<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Keeper's interiority is concrete and particular—retrocognition is embodied through physical action (barefoot on thresholds, forehead pressed to glass) rather than merely labeled. His motivation to recover his childhood plea carries visible contradiction: the universe that swallowed his voice owes him nothing, yet he persists. The final moment earns its cost: recognizing his own child-voice proves the plea survived but confirms no rescue ever came, a bittersweet validation that rekindles him withoutResolver the original loss. Minor deduction: the voice remains consistently poetic-elevated throughout, with no stress-driven compression or syntactic breakdown at peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the prism catches starlight, the hush cracks, and the child's coordinates spill out—Keeper's eleven-year search succeeds in proving pattern survived, though the universe never answered. The cost is visible and poignant: he hears his own abandoned plea, confirming both that meaning persisted and that no help came. Drive lens is Situational with Accumulative texture (star-charting pressure, comet coincidence, retrocognitive tangling); escalation coheres as stubborn hope meets uncharted light, the geometry snaps, and the shard releases its message. Orientation anchors early (custodian, pavilion, post-collapse dusk, prism on pedestal) with no debt. One meaningful deepening: the comet's arrival and lattice-alignment choice tighten all prior charting into a single obedient beam.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion is vividly particular—panes vibrating with radio ghosts, grown like a salt flower around the lighthouse—and it constrains action: Keeper climbs corroded steps nightly, presses his forehead to glass to cast retrocognition outward. The prism and shard anchor tactile interaction (carried like a sleeping animal, trembling/cracking like thawing ice). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "dusk bleed through cracks," "thistle-blown hope snagging on rusted railings," ashen sky. The comet's "pale roar" and the beam's final obedience charge the closure image. Minor gap: the dead sea and horizon remain atmospheric backdrops without pressuring a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and sustained: prove coincidence has meaning by rekindling the beacon through star-path alignment to release the trapped plea. Pressure coheres under the Situational lens: eleven years of charting, dwindling oil, mutinying knees, then the uncharted comet strikes "like a bell" and Keeper makes the peak choice—haul the prism to the highest deck, redraw charts mentally, latch retrocognition onto the comet's ellipse until points snap together. The prism catches light, the hush cracks, the plea emerges—cost is visible (decades of exhausted effort, childhood plea confirmed but unanswered) and the tightening is meaningful. Agency is clear: Keeper's decision to fit the comet into old destinies drives the turn. No antagonist required; coincidence complicates (comet appears) but does not resolve—Keeper's choice and retrocognitive work do.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—whether scattered pattern holds meaning or the universe is merely "twitching"—emerges organically from Keeper's nightly star-charting and the prism's history. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the child's coordinates survived "their impossible journey," proving fragile meaning persists even when unanswered, enough to "rekindle him" without divine thunder. Subtext operates through the shard of hush (silence preserving signal), the comet's uncharted arrival (coincidence as conspiracy), and "thistle-blown hope" recurring to frame stubborn endurance. No thematic echo or moral summary; the story trusts the prism-crack and voice-spill to carry weight. One minor note: "prove that coincidences have meaning" is articulated by the narrator early, skating close to thesis-statement, but it functions as the character's obsessive frame rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: elevated-poetic register with concrete anchors ("fused bone and slag," "flensed plastic," "salt flower"), syntactic rhythm modulating between lyric compression and grounded action. POV remains stable single-focalization with no head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled (close enough for embodied perception, far enough for retrospective framing). Diction stays within a contemplative-archaic idiom that suits post-collapse mythic tone. No dialogue to judge. Minor penalty: the prose maintains its elevated register uniformly—no stress-driven syntactic breakdown or diction shift at peak beats (comet arrival, prism-crack); a brief compression or fragment-burst would have sharpened urgency. Perceptual signature is clear: Keeper notices thresholds, star pricks, retrocognitive lightless flashes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse; figurative language ("thistle-blown hope," "salt flower," "tethered beast") is vivid and thematically coherent. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or causal setup. Clarity and grammar are clean; no pronoun drift or tense slips. Deductions: mild overwriting in the opening third—"lightless flashes," "radio ghosts that howled," "glutted with signals," "mosaicked with satellites"—stacks metaphor without always serving immediate pressure (−0.3). One paraphrase loop: paragraphs beginning "He told himself" and "It was a thistle-blown hope" restate his motivation across adjacent beats without new information (−0.2). A few elevated-diction choices ("flensed," "retrocognitively") are apt but risk slight register drift for a solitary custodian's interior voice. No scaffold or template cadence; propulsion is steady. Final image is strong and concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—retrocognition used to chart vanished satellite constellations and align a comet with a broken prism to release a decade-old radio plea—is specific, non-obvious, and emotionally grounded. The story transforms familiar post-apocalypse and lighthouse-keeper tropes through the "shard of hush" conceit and the causal mechanics of star-path alignment. Keeper's motivation (prove coincidences have meaning by recovering his own childhood message) is particular and poignant, avoiding generic survivalism. The comet's arrival is a coincidence that complicates rather than conveniently resolves—Keeper must still do the retrocognitive work to snap the geometry. Risk: the elevated-poetic voice and intricate premise commit fully without hedging. Minor deduction: the post-collapse lighthouse custodian tracking lost signals echoes genre templates (Canticle for Leibowitz, The Road's relic-keepers); the retrocognition and hush-shard twist it, but the frame remains recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Keeper's choices drive all key turns: nightly climbs (setup), mental chart-redrawing when the comet appears (peak decision), hauling the prism to highest deck and latching retrocognition onto the comet's ellipse (climactic action). His agency is embodied and causal—without his decision to fit the comet into the old lattice, the prism stays cold. He appears in every beat, and the final turn (prism catches light, hush cracks) is the direct result of his work. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The broken crystal prism is handled across setup (pedestal, fractured heart), development (carried nightly, stays cold under his hands), and climax (hauled to highest deck, catches comet-light in "a single obedient beam," the crack enables the hush-release). Its wounded geometry is the causal engine: star-alignment must match the prism's faces to rekindle the beam. Removing it breaks story logic and closure image. The final beam and crack are the physical proof of meaning. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The shard of hush shapes stakes (it swallowed a decade's pleas, including Keeper's) and tactics (alignment must coax it to release). It is physically present (trembles, cracks "like thawing ice") and its release is the story's climactic payoff. Setup: introduced early as "sliver of silence so dense it kept the old world from rotting entirely into noise." Development: Keeper knows his plea is trapped inside. Payoff: the hush cracks and the child's voice spills out. Conceptual cost: the hush preserved the message but guaranteed no answer. Essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Retrocognition is not label-only; it enables on-page action with visible mechanics and cost. Setup: "stand barefoot on any forgotten threshold and feel backwards along footprints of time." Development: He uses it nightly (casting it like a net along star paths, looping through exhausted memories "like a tethered beast"). Climax: latching onto the comet's path and sliding backwards through centuries until it tangles with the satellite lattice is the pivotal move that makes the geometry snap. Cost: years of looping, exhaustion, and the final tangling requires effort ("closing box"). The trait's specific rules (touch triggers it, histories whisper through him) constrain and enable every major choice. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>"Rekindle" is the story's organizing action: Keeper's goal from paragraph seven onward is "to rekindle the beacon not with oil or flame but by tracking star paths." Every middle beat (nightly climbs, charting on sailcloth and flensed plastic, waiting for alignment) serves this action. The climax realizes it: the prism catches starlight "in a single obedient beam" and the hush releases the plea, "enough to rekindle him." The action is metaphorically and literally fulfilled—beacon rekindled, hope rekindled—and the final line confirms it. Removing "rekindle" would require rewriting the entire causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Star-path tracking is signaled early (paragraph seven: "tracking star paths across the ashen sky"), detailed in development (charting "faint pricks" on sailcloth, diagrams spidering across walls, retrocognition drifting along vanished paths), and executed at climax (fitting the comet into old destinies, sliding backwards along its ellipse until it tangles with the satellite lattice). The method's mechanics matter: alignment with the prism's wounded faces is the causal key. Without this means, Keeper has no way to rekindle the beacon or prove pattern. The method shapes every attempt across eleven years.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion is vividly rendered (panes vibrating with radio ghosts, grown like a salt flower) and pressures choices: corroded steps force nightly climbs, the highest deck is where Keeper sets the prism for final alignment, pressing forehead to glass lets retrocognition drift outward. Setup and development are strong; payoff: "glass and iron singing under the comet's pale roar" charges the climax. It supplies the vertical structure (spiral of steps, highest deck) that the plot requires. Micro-setting (body, tool) also functions (barefoot on thresholds, prism carried). The pavilion could be swapped for another tower-like structure with minor edits, but its humming-glass specificity and radio-ghost detail add irreplaceable texture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the collapse of civilization" is signaled immediately and establishes scarcity (dwindling oil, dead sea, no living memory of Keeper's name, evacuation ships never returned). Development: eleven years of solitary charting, mutinying knees, exhausted memories. Payoff: the timeframe's weight is felt in "the only hope he had not already outlived" and the final recognition that the plea survived but was never answered. The post-collapse frame tightens decisions (no external help, no surviving almanac) but does not function as a live ticking clock. It is essential backdrop rather than a countdown that alters moves beat-by-beat. Solid integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"prove that coincidences have meaning, that the scattered remnants of pattern were not just the twitching of a dead universe"—is articulated early and dramatized through action: eleven years of star-charting, refusing to accept randomness, seizing the comet's arrival as proof. Internal friction: he "told himself" this, marking it as a self-imposed frame rather than universal truth. Payoff: the prism's obedient beam and the plea's survival prove pattern persisted, "enough to rekindle him," even though no answer came—partial validation with visible cost. The motivation drives every choice and charges the closure image. Strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Thistle-blown hope" is introduced early as metaphor ("thistle-blown hope, drifting, snagging on rusted railings") and modulates with pressure: fragile but persistent through eleven years of failure, struck "like a bell" by the comet's coincidence, ultimately validated by the plea's survival without requiring rescue. The tone is coherent through turns—never naive optimism, always tempered by loss and the universe's indifference—and charges the final image: "fragile, thistle-blown meaning" survives conspiracy of broken prism and stray comet. The recurring image reweights the dominant stake and encapsulates the story's emotional and conceptual register. Indispensable to thematic and atmospheric unity.</comment>
