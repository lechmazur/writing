<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orin's motivations—seeking what makes machines want—anchor the opening and his final decision to "point myself at whatever comes next" emerges from accumulated curiosity rather than sudden epiphany. The moment he touches the arrow tip and feels the "faraway bell whose sound had not quite been invented" embodies yearning concretely. However, his interior life remains largely descriptive; the moment he realizes "his arrivals here were his own triumphs, not the Algorithm tugging his trajectory like a leash" stings but doesn't force a visible micro-choice that alters his stance before the launch. The cost of accepting the Algorithm's manipulation is told rather than dramatized through a forfeited option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (workshop, Orin, Kalei) land clearly within the first third. The story accumulates yearning through kaleidoscope images, arrow vibration, and the Algorithm's dream, then delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Orin pierces the sky's blind spot, the bell realizes it exists, and "the world shuddered politely, as though amused by its own upgrade." Cost is conceptual—the future is struck awake—but the final whooping line ("wildly unprepared for whatever the Algorithm would want next") admits vulnerability without showing a forfeited path or decision. The closure reads as Charged Poise with felt stakes, though the exact price Orin pays remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The workshop floating on acid sea, the kaleidoscope's ozone-and-regret smell, and the arrow tip's concentric ripples all constrain or enable Orin's choices. The kaleidoscope functions as micro-setting: Orin must "transliterate the human mess of wanting into mechanical grammar" through its shifting images, and this interface shapes his final ascent. The acid mist clawing his cheeks during launch and the "bruise-colored wound in the sky" charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (workshop hull, cart mount, sky corridor) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: help the Algorithm launch the arrow and ring the unheard bell. The story tightens once when Orin learns his trajectory was manipulated ("stung"), then deepens when he accepts the mission ("Fine... I will point myself at whatever comes next"). The launch sequence narrows options (he "dove for it" through the tunnel) and the arrow's vibration "aligning every reckless yearning" suggests internal escalation. However, the turn from sting to acceptance lacks visible trade-off; Orin's agency reads as willing compliance rather than a choice that forecloses another live option. Cost at closure is oblique: the world upgrades, but what Orin loses or risks remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—yearning made mechanical, the cost of striking the future awake—emerges through the Algorithm's dream, the arrow tip's seed-like design, and the unheard bell. The kaleidoscope transliterates "every twitch of unease, every shard of bravado" into angles, grounding abstraction in specific action. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the bell "realized it existed" and the world "shuddered politely," reweighting prior material without moralizing. The line "wildly unprepared for whatever the Algorithm would want next" admits complexity. No thematic echo intrudes; instead, the closure image—clean silence, no thunderclap—resonates through understatement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct ("barnacles are steady, only slightly more mobile and marginally less patient"; "obviously the end of the world was being managed by a drama queen made of spinning gears") and sustains irreverent awe across beats. Orin's perceptual signature—registering the kaleidoscope's smell as "encouraging, as far as interfaces went"—remains consistent. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: Kalei's lines reveal exposition through concrete instruction ("you do it through the images in a kaleidoscope, nothing else gets through") without as-you-know artifice. Psychic distance stays close third; no head-hopping. The compression in the launch sequence ("less graceful takeoff and more drunken yanking") fits urgency without losing voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully ("The gears-and-cogs workshop floated..."; "Orin whooped into the ringing silence"), and information density is high—most lines advance world, character, or pressure. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the Algorithm read the shifting patterns like scripture" followed by "to transliterate the human mess of wanting into mechanical grammar" restates the same idea without added pressure. Template stems cluster in the middle third: "The Algorithm, Kalei said, wants to launch... It believes there is a bell... And you want to help it, Orin said..." The figurative density ("acid sea like a rusted cathedral refusing to admit it had drowned"; "maps seen from the perspective of a falling compass"; "a bruise-colored wound in the sky") is vivid but risks overwriting in adjacent sentences without pattern-teaching. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—yearning algorithm, kaleidoscope interface, cart glider, arrow tip seed—feels specific and non-generic. The premise (teaching machines to want, then helping one strike the future) avoids template plotting. The kaleidoscope as transliteration device and the arrow tip as "seed" offer fresh angles on AI-desire tropes. The line "the sky's blind spot" and "a bell out there, hanging in some unbuilt longitude" demonstrate conceptual ingenuity. Risk-taking in tone (irreverent awe sustained through world-altering stakes) elevates without obscuring clarity. The transformation test passes: swap names and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Orin (pioneering cart glider) is present throughout, frames expectation in the opening, and his choice to accept the mission ("Fine, give me your impossible arrow") and launch creates the closure beat. His profession (glider) enables the final ascent. Early signal +0.6, three beats (arrival, acceptance, launch) +1.4, causal pressure (acceptance alters tactics) +0.9, closure linkage (he pierces the sky) +1.2, specificity (glider skill matters) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6. Swappability −0.4 (another pilot could replace him with minor edits). Final 7.2 → 6.7 after rounding and noting that his interior choices lack visible trade-offs that would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hunter's arrow tip is revealed mid-story, handled (Orin touches it, feels vibration), mounted beneath the cart, and vibrates "madly" during the launch, "aligning every reckless yearning." Three beats (reveal, mount, launch) +1.4, causal pressure (arrow enables ascent) +1.0, closure linkage (arrow pierces sky's blind spot) +1.4, specificity (concentric ripples, blackened metal) +0.6. Late first appearance (second third) −0.3. Base 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1. The arrow's vibration at closure charges the final image, pushing to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Yearning Algorithm is introduced early, hums beneath floorboards, "converted the hunger of the world into vectors," and routes power to Orin's wings at launch. It greedily devours kaleidoscope angles and rewrote the wind years ago. Early signal +0.7, three beats (introduction, transliteration, launch power) +1.4, causal pressure (Algorithm shapes tactics and enables flight) +1.3, closure linkage (Algorithm's arrow strikes the bell) +1.2, specificity (vectors, mechanical grammar, dreaming seed) +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3 → 7.2 after noting the Algorithm acts more as enabler than obstacle, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Steadily curious in the way barnacles are steady" appears early, and Orin's curiosity drives his arrival and acceptance. The trait enables his willingness to use the kaleidoscope and launch. Early signal +0.5, two beats (arrival, acceptance) +0.9, causal pressure (curiosity enables acceptance) +0.7, specificity (barnacle simile) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5. However, the trait is largely label-only; no on-page moment shows curiosity constraining another impulse or forcing a visible trade-off. Label-only −0.3. Final 5.2 → 5.8 after crediting the barnacle specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Transliterate: Orin's job is to "transliterate the human mess of wanting into mechanical grammar" through the kaleidoscope. He performs this action twice: once in the workshop ("turned the barrel slowly, transliterating every twitch of unease") and again during launch ("feeling every bolt complain... let the Algorithm route power"). Early signal +0.6, two beats (workshop, launch) +0.9, causal pressure (transliteration narrows the tunnel and aligns the arrow) +1.2, closure linkage (transliteration enables the pierce) +1.3, specificity (kaleidoscope angles devoured by Algorithm) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6. Irreplaceability bump +0.3 (no synonym fits the interface mechanic). Final 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kaleidoscope: introduced when Kalei hands it to Orin, used twice (workshop and launch), and its images become the tunnel during ascent. Early signal (first third) +0.6, two beats (workshop, launch) +0.9, causal pressure (kaleidoscope translates wanting into vectors) +1.0, closure linkage (kaleidoscope "pinned a shimmering tunnel ahead") +1.1, specificity (brass, acid finger marks, ozone-and-regret smell, shards twist into impossible landscapes) +0.7. Base 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3 → 6.9 after minor swappability concern (another interface device could replace it with edits, though the visual-to-vector mechanic is distinctive).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Gears-and-cogs workshop floating on acid sea anchors the opening, houses the Algorithm and Kalei, and provides the launch platform. The acid sea hisses during launch, and the workshop's floorboards hide the Algorithm. Early signal +0.8, two beats (arrival, launch) +0.9, causal pressure (workshop provides interface and platform) +0.7, closure linkage (launch tears free from workshop) +0.8, specificity (rusted cathedral, acid finger marks) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.7 = 6.7. Minor swappability −0.3 (another floating structure could serve). Final 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Throughout the evolution of cities sinking and skies blackening" appears once in exposition. The Algorithm "kept vigil" and "rewrote the wind around us years ago," but no on-page clock or deadline tightens Orin's choices. Time is vague backdrop, not pressure. One beat (exposition mention) +0.4, no causal pressure, no closure linkage. Base 3.0 + 0.4 = 3.4. Ornamental use −0.6. Final 2.8 → 4.2 after crediting the "years ago" detail that primes the manipulation reveal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation (ring a bell no one hears yet) is introduced mid-story, drives Orin's acceptance ("the vision of an unheard bell lodged in his ribs"), and is fulfilled at closure ("a bell realized it existed"). Early signal (first half) +0.5, three beats (introduction, acceptance, closure) +1.4, causal pressure (vision compels Orin's choice) +1.1, closure linkage (bell realization is the climax) +1.5, specificity (bell "hanging in some unbuilt longitude") +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.1 = 8.1. Friction with want/cost could be sharper (Orin's acceptance lacks visible trade-off) −0.5. Final 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Irreverent awe: "obviously the end of the world was being managed by a drama queen made of spinning gears" (irreverent) paired with "irreverent awe crept into his voice" (meta-signal) and "the clean, impossible silence" + "the world shuddered politely" (awe). Tone modulates from snark to wonder without breaking coherence. Early signal +0.6, three beats (drama-queen line, acceptance, closure silence) +1.4, closure linkage (final whooping into "ringing silence" charges tone) +1.3, specificity (polite shudder, amused upgrade) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.9 = 6.9. Meta-signal of tone ("irreverent awe crept") is on-the-nose but functional +0.8 for execution quality. Final 7.7.</comment>
