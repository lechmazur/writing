<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kerran's altruistic ghost persona is consistent and embodied through chalk-writing that "stung spectral fingers," anchoring motivation in both life (river cleanup) and death (organizing evacuation). The protagonist's agency drives key choices—meeting召 召唤, route planning, timed instructions—with visible cost when the bell cracks and the final image shows gratitude "tangle with grief." Internal contradiction appears when Kerran recalls drowning in hospital light believing the campaign failed, yet now sees people "ready to move whole groves if a ghost asked kindly enough." Minor slip: Mara's trust declaration feels slightly on-the-nose ("feels strangely trustworthy") rather than dramatized through action, though it does unlock Kerran's memory and forward motion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its mosaic pattern early (strangers→family, dead learning to walk, Kerran organizing routes), transitions via the bell's ringing and quake intensification, and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when the survivors stand together on the surviving span, orchard intact, bell shattered—gratitude and grief braided with visible cost (lost heirlooms, collapsed arch, shattered bell). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the fourth paragraph ("Our settlement clung to one particularly low arch"). The cost is legible: "No one screamed; they were too busy counting who had made it across, calling each name like a prayer." One meaningful deepening occurs when the northern orchards begin to fall and Kerran's chalk messages shift from planning to urgent command ("Move now"), narrowing options and raising stakes under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard planet's floating rock arches constrain movement throughout—safe routes painted with solar paint, spans that collapse, harnesses lashed to trunks—and the watering bell functions as both anchor and signal device, cracking under final pressure to pierce "stone and skin and whatever gauze separates the living from the organizing dead." Spatial choreography remains clear: low arch cradles butterfly garden, promenade hosts meetings, northern orchards drift toward nebula, survivors cross to the surviving span. Sensory detail is purposeful and varied: mineral ghosts clouding glass, violet gas river, sap and dust streaking faces, auroras caught in spiral etchings. The bell's crack charges the final image by marking the boundary between planning and survival, and the shattered state persists ("bell in shards") as a cost marker at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: prevent the orchard community from shattering when the planet sheds a ring. Escalation tightens through quake intensification, fissures opening where children played, the sky tearing, and gas flaring as chunks rise. Agency belongs to Kerran (chalk instructions) and the living (following them, trimming packs, swinging groves via grav-cranes), with visible cost: abandoned heirlooms, collapsed arches, the bell cracking, and the final count of survivors. The turn at "Move now" forces immediate choice—ride the first lifts or lose the window—and the resolution is earned by collective action under ghost guidance. One minor friction: the nebula's "soft harbor to cradle the pieces" introduces a cosmic safety net that slightly softens the stakes, though the on-page cost (lost homes, spilled ladders, shattered bell) remains legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of community forged under existential pressure emerges from concrete particulars: strangers becoming family, chalk messages trusted without seeing the hand, protest songs humming over planetary groans, names called like prayers. The watering bell recurs with shifting weight—weather marker, meeting召 召 signal, then shattered relic—charging the closure without overt statement. The final image answers the implicit question (can altruism survive death and disaster?) through the brambled hope of "gratitude tangle with grief," a non-literal answer rooted in prior action. Kerran's discovery that people will "move whole groves if a ghost asked kindly enough" reweights the life-death boundary and past failure without moralizing. The nebula legend ("when a world exhausted itself, the cosmos grew a soft harbor") risks abstraction but is anchored by Ryo's tears and the violet updraft's physical menace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV ghost narration maintains consistent perceptual signature: Kerran notices organizing details (routes, satellites, cisterns, ladders) and filters emotion through civic memory ("drowning in hospital light," "last campaign to clean the rivers"). Diction stays character-particular ("altruistic ghost who had never stopped organizing," "chalk that stung my spectral fingers") with rhythmic control under pressure—short declaratives during the sky-tearing ("The sky tore quietly open") and lyric expansion at closure ("gratitude tangle with grief, a brambled hope sturdy enough to share the weight of a changing sky"). Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "the cosmos grew a soft harbor to cradle the pieces" momentarily elevates register beyond Kerran's civic idiom, though Ryo's "nebula of respite" frames it as in-world legend rather than narratorial philosophizing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance world logic, character choice, or thematic resonance. Rhythm varies purposefully, alternating compact declaratives ("Our settlement clung to one particularly low arch") with lyric expansions ("violet river curling into itself, becoming a luminous bruise"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Clarity is strong throughout; spatial choreography and causal sequence track cleanly. One friction: "the bell followed the arches" in "the chalk followed the bell, and the bell followed the arches" momentarily obscures agency—does the bell follow architectural movement or atmospheric wind?—but recovers quickly. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("floating rock arches that drifted like reefs," "discarded vertebrae"), with no mixed metaphors or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ghost-as-civic-organizer premise offers a fresh angle on post-mortem agency, transforming the haunting trope through Kerran's altruistic continuity and the physical constraint of chalk. The orchard planet's ringing arches and the nebula-as-respite legend create a specific cosmology that shapes stakes rather than serving as backdrop. Emotional specificity avoids template grief: Mara's sons died in methane blight, Ryo weeps behind his visor, elders hum protest songs. The synthesis of disaster narrative, ghost organizing, and community trust feels inevitable in hindsight. Minor limitation: the nebula legend arrives late (seventh day) and functions partly as a cosmic safety net, reducing the radical freshness of the opening premise. The "brambled hope" closure image is earned but borders on poetic conventionality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kerran (altruistic ghost) appears in the opening line, drives every major turn via chalk messages (meeting召, route planning, "Move now"), and the final image centers on their unseen smile and felt gratitude. Choices create beats: writing the first message, planning under the bell, issuing urgent instructions during the collapse. Cost is visible: spectral fingers sting, Kerran drags letters against gravity, memory of hospital drowning resurfaces. Irreplaceable: the ghost's organizing nature and invisibility enable the trust dynamic ("whoever could move chalk without hands") and the thematic question of altruism beyond death. Removing Kerran would require a living organizer and collapse the story's moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The butterfly garden watering bell is introduced early (paragraph 8–9), used in multiple beats (meeting召 anchor, weather marker, chiming during planning, cracking under final pressure), and returns shattered at closure ("bell in shards"). Its mechanics matter: the bell rings when moons and wind align, signaling both weather and ghost authority. The crack is a decisive cost marker ("pierced stone and skin and whatever gauze separates the living from the organizing dead") that charges the final image. Specificity: glass clouded with mineral ghosts, spiral etchings catching auroras. The bell's transformation from delicate relic to shattered symbol of survival is irreplaceable to the story's emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nebula of respite is signaled mid-story via legend ("when a world exhausted itself, the cosmos grew a soft harbor"), dramatized when the gas river forms and slows the fall of broken land, and shapes tactics (survivors watch chunks rise instead of falling, adjust evacuation timing). Present at closure when Ryo promises "if the nebula truly meant respite, it would wait." Cost connection: it reframes loss (half their food and homes drifting toward the nebula) as potential rather than pure disaster. Limitation: arrives after the 40% mark and functions partly as external rescue rather than protagonist-driven solution, reducing causal irreplaceability. Still, the concept reweights the orchard's survival and the collective effort's meaning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is signaled early (paragraph 14: Mara says "this hand...feels strangely trustworthy"), enables the key turn (community commits to the ghost's plan despite invisibility), and constrains tactics (Kerran must earn trust through consistent, kind chalk messages rather than visible authority). Cost: Kerran's past failure resurfaces when trust is granted ("loosened something I had tightened around my own memory of drowning in hospital light"). Present at closure in the "gratitude tangle with grief" that acknowledges unseen guidance. The attribute is irreplaceable: without it, the ghost-organizer dynamic collapses into fear or disbelief rather than collective action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears explicitly ("They reexamined every plan in minutes") and drives the climactic turn when the sky tears and Kerran writes "Move now"—the community abandons heirlooms, trims packs, chooses lift order, all compressed reexaminations under pressure. The action is prepared by earlier planning (days of chalk instructions, mapped routes, packed seedlings) and pays off in survival (intact orchard, counted survivors). Cost: abandoned belongings, the speed required ("minutes"), the emotional toll of trimming choices. Irreplaceable: the story's emphasis on collective organizing depends on the ability to adapt plans; swapping for "adjust" or "revise" would dilute the root sense of re-seeing under crisis.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Chalk messages on deserted sidewalks at dawn are introduced early (paragraph 12), used across multiple beats (first召 message, daily instructions for apiaries/cisterns/ladders, urgent "Move now"), and constrain method—Kerran cannot speak, must write before sweeping, endures physical cost ("stung my spectral fingers," "each letter a drag against the gravity that ignored me"). The dawn timing matters: messages appear before the living wake, creating mystery and authority. Present at closure when past chalk work enables the survivors' coordinated escape. Irreplaceable: the method defines the ghost-community interface and the story's tactical texture. Removing it would require voice or visibility, collapsing the trust dynamic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches is introduced in the opening lines and shapes every major choice: settlement location (low arch cradling butterfly garden), safe routes (painted with solar paint), evacuation constraints (swinging groves via harnesses, crossing spans before collapse), and the climactic threat (arches collapsing, northern orchards falling). Present at closure when survivors stand on "the surviving span" with the first arch collapsed behind them. Specificity: iron-black loop, twin moons pulling crust, arches groaning like tired ships, fissures opening where children played. Cost: spatial limits force abandonment of homes and heirlooms. Irreplaceable: the floating-arch geology is the story's structural spine; a static planet would eliminate the evacuation stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After strangers become family" frames the opening line and implies elapsed time before the main action, but the timeframe does not actively tighten on-page decisions. The seven-day countdown (quakes begin, planning days, seventh day sky tears) provides loose structure, yet no live clock pressures individual choices within scenes—Kerran's messages appear "three days after quakes began" without urgency shown until the final collapse. Present at closure in the survivors' bond ("strangers who had once bartered in silence now held one another"), reweighting the opening frame. Limitation: the timeframe is more thematic bracket than tactical constraint; removing the "after" frame and shortening the seven-day span would not fundamentally alter the evacuation mechanics or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation to orchestrate collective effort is dramatized from Kerran's first chalk message召 ("We must orchestrate a collective effort or watch the roots crack apart alone") through every planning beat (families sleeping in shifts, youngest marking routes, Mara leading elders) and paid off at closure when the community stands together, orchard intact. Friction appears when Kerran's organizing impulse conflicts with the limits of ghost agency (can only write, not speak or physically act). Cost: spectral fingers sting, gravity drags each letter, and the bell Kerran relies on cracks. Irreplaceable: the story's thematic core (altruism beyond death, strangers becoming family) depends on this organizing drive; swapping for individual survival would eliminate the collective stakes and moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" appears explicitly in the final sentence and names the tonal synthesis: hope (intact orchard, survivors counted) entangled with grief (shattered bell, lost homes, collapsed arch). The tone is coherent throughout—Kerran's civic optimism threads through disaster imagery (violet bruise nebula, groaning arches, spilled ladders), and language choices layer loss with resilience ("promising that if the nebula truly meant respite, it would wait," "dusty faces streaking with sap and dust"). The final image charges the phrase by embodying it: "gratitude tangle with grief, a brambled hope sturdy enough to share the weight of a changing sky." Minor limitation: the phrase itself is poetic but borders on abstract; the story earns it through prior particulars rather than the reverse.</comment>
