<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation to map emotional pathways is established, and his interior voice carries weight through embodied sensations ("buzzing," "feather-touch awareness"). However, the final choice to "nudge their paths" arrives without clear prior setup of what that action entails or costs him personally—it reads more as discovery than decision under pressure. Naya functions as affectionate skeptic but her choices remain observational rather than driving pressure; the relationship supports but doesn't crucible-test the protagonist.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory threads (static, light lines, geode warmth) toward a final reconfiguration where Eli "redirects" memory-pain into a tool. Orientation anchors cleanly (studio, post-shock, Eli+Naya present). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the "cursed souvenir" reweighted as compass), but the cost—what Eli loses or forecloses by choosing to guide rather than carry echoes—remains oblique; the final image asserts relief without showing the trade-off that makes the shift undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio supplies fiber brushes, projector glow, and cool wall as tactile anchors; the geode sliver's mica facets and warmth recur across beats and flare sympathetically at the turn, charging the final image. Spatial choreography (Eli on floor, Naya cradling sliver, air "knitted and trembling" between fingers) remains clear and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: manage the post-pill haunting that chews through sleep. One meaningful deepening occurs when Eli enters the memory-web and loosens a knot, narrowing his stance from passive carrier to active guide. However, the escalation mechanism—how "intention" and "breath" enable the redirection—appears late without prior constraint or failed attempt, so the turn feels discovered rather than fought-for. The conceptual cost (accepting the tool role) is felt but not dramatically tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of consent, pattern-reading, and ethical use of involuntary insight emerges through concrete beats: the pill "opening doors his ethics had never consented to unlock," then the realization "you do not have to carry every echo; you can devise patterns that return the light." The final image ("cursed souvenir is actually a tool, and this studio becomes our compass") reweights prior material without overt thesis. Quiet ending earns resonance through the shift from haunting to purpose, though the ethical friction could press harder at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and voice-distinct: diction like "willowglass hope," "somersaults of curiosity," and "stabs of fear" anchors the narrator's perceptual signature. Psychic distance tightens smoothly during the vision sequence ("Here, she whispered, though her lips barely moved"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("You sure the pill wore off?"; "show me your haunted corridors, professor"). Minor filter-verb density in reflective passages ("felt," "noticed") does not obscure immediacy under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, a paraphrase loop appears mid-story: "Lines of light unfurled…threads looping" restates the web-of-connections image across adjacent sentences without adding pressure. Template cadence in the vision sequence ("He felt…He turned…He reached") creates a brief drumbeat that flattens momentum. One stock metaphor ("cobwebs of possible choices") slightly dilutes the otherwise fresh sensory palette. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The telepathy-pill-recall premise and somatic-marker mechanism are familiar from contemporary SF, but the synthesis—static shock jumpstarting latent pattern-reading into a light-painting toolkit—feels specific and earned in hindsight. The "willowglass hope" coinage and the choice to treat haunting as design problem add fresh inflection. Risk-taking in the vision sequence (externalized memory-web, sympathetic geode flare) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a small bonus within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Naya (affectionate skeptic) is seeded early, doubts the method while trusting Eli, and makes two key moves: asking "Tell me what you feel" to invite the shared vision, then reframing the souvenir as tool at closure. She enables rather than decides, but her reframing at the end shifts Eli's stance and charges the final image, satisfying two gates (setup, payoff) with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Muscovite geode sliver appears in beat one (Naya cradles it), recurs when it warms and catches light during the vision, flares "in sympathetic relief" at the turn, then becomes the "cursed souvenir" reweighted as compass in the ending. Three distinct beats, early signal, and closure participation, but its unique properties (mica, fractal reflection) narrate more than constrain—removing it would weaken but not break the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Telepathy pill recall seeds the premise (first paragraph), shapes the central problem (doors opened without consent, pathways clinging like cobwebs), and drives Eli's choice to devise control rather than let it chew through sleep. The recall's mechanics (somatic markers, heightened signal-reading) enable the vision-web tactic. Removing it would collapse the story's stakes and closure logic entirely.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears once as descriptor for the geode's mica reflections but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. It enriches texture without altering choice—swappable with "intricate" or "detailed" with minimal edit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Devise" anchors the mid-story turn ("let us treat this like a design problem. We devise a way to aim whatever this is") and recurs at closure ("you can devise patterns that return the light"). The action redefines Eli's stance from passive haunted to active designer, driving the vision sequence and the final reweighting. Removing it would obscure the protagonist's agency and the conceptual shift at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Somatic markers (muscle tension, microexpressions, heat/breath shifts) are explained mid-story and underpin the vision mechanics: Eli reads "feelings, somersaults of curiosity, stabs of fear" and redirects them via breath and intention. The method enables the climactic turn and is signaled before use, but its mechanics remain partially told rather than dramatized through failed attempts or visible constraints.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Light painting studio is named early and supplies fiber brushes, projector glow, cool wall, and the performance context (illuminating hidden pathways in audience minds). The setting frames the stakes and provides the geode as prop, but does not constrain a choice under pressure—the vision could occur elsewhere. It charges atmosphere more than altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the static shock" frames the timeframe in the opening line and establishes causality (shock jumpstarts the haunting). However, no ticking clock or urgency tightens decisions on the page; the piece unfolds in studio present without time pressure. Early signal and causal framing earn mid-band, but lack of tactical constraint caps higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden pathways" is voiced in the performance backstory and recurs when Naya says "you can devise patterns that return the light." The motivation drives Eli's choice to map and redirect rather than passively carry, shaping the vision sequence and closure. Friction between wanting to help and the ethics breach ("doors his ethics had never consented to unlock") adds cost, satisfying setup, development, and payoff with visible tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope, fragile but flexible, reflecting every doubt while bending toward some yet unseen clearing" is coined mid-story and charges the reflective texture; the final line's "steady hum, like distant traffic on a clear night" resolves the buzzing chaos into controlled tool-mode. Tone modulates from haunted urgency to cautious hope under pressure, and the coinage itself is memorable. Closure linkage and specificity lift the score, though the metaphor appears once rather than threading multiple beats.</comment>
