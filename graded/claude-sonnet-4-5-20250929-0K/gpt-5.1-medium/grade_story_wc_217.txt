<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's character is rooted in a consistent perceptual signature—seeing "openings" where others see imperfections—and his micro-choices (lifting the feather to his ear, humming in response to discord) embody that stance under pressure. The embodied emotion is strong ("teeth ache," "flushed") and the final gesture of writing "line after unfinished line" carries visible cost: he accepts incompleteness as companionship rather than solving it. Minor deduction: the bird-being's dialogue edges toward articulating the theme rather than letting Elian's actions alone reveal his arc, and the interiority occasionally leans abstract ("strange country of trust").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (cobalt lagoon, shoreline poet, post-rain). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elian opens his notebook and writes "line after unfinished line," crystallizing his acceptance of discord as companionship—a stance earned by the feather encounter and the being's validation. Cost is felt: he trades the desire for harmony for co-existence with discord. One meaningful deepening (the feather's pulse → hearing dissonances → harmonizing them) tightens the stake. Minor issue: the being's explicit validation ("you have left it ajar") slightly externalizes what the prior images had already charged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lagoon setting is vivid and purposeful: "cupped in black rock," "deep metallic blue," post-rain mist, and the kite over water all pressure Elian's perceptual stance. The feather's arrival at the tideline and the woven-dawn strands appearing on the lagoon's surface directly constrain and enable his tending action. The body (lifting feather to ear, humming) functions as micro-setting. Minor gap: the being's emergence from "crossing strands" introduces a world-rule late without prior cue, and the spatial choreography of "whirlpools" and "strands" is slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering beauty in the incomplete, tested when Elian encounters the wounded feather. Pressure tightens when he hears "restless patterns that made his teeth ache" and must choose whether to force harmony or "let each roughened note lean against another." The kite-string snap and child's raised empty hand serve as thematic prelude, not reversal, so the single meaningful turn is Elian's humming response, which narrows his options (he cannot mute discord; he must meet it). Cost is legible: he trades certainty for "companionship" with discord. Agency is clear. No antagonist required under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in incompleteness—emerges through the kite's release, the feather's wound, and Elian's humming rather than statement until the being's speech, which slightly over-articulates ("Perfection is a closed door; you have left it ajar"). The final image of writing "line after unfinished line" reweights the premise non-literally and avoids moralizing. The "woven dawns" motif recurs with shifted meaning (first as belief, then as visible strands, finally as faded memory). Deduction: the being's dialogue in the climax edges toward thematic echo, reducing subtextual charge by ~0.3.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Elian; perceptual signature is distinct (noticing "openings," "unfinished songs," "threads bright and frayed"). Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity: "barbs that shimmered with bruised violet and dusk-green light." The being's telepathic speech is handled cleanly with "though its beak did not move." Minor issue: the being's dialogue register is slightly elevated and generic compared to Elian's embodied narration, creating brief convergence. Free indirect style is clean throughout; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly legible ("threads bright and frayed," "door swinging inward on its own quiet hinge"). Information density is high. However, several phrases loop or paraphrase: "burnished hush" echoes "constant hush of waves"; "warmly attentive" appears twice in close proximity; "woven dawns" is described three times in similar terms. Template stems recur: "He [verb]" opens multiple consecutive sentences in the humming sequence. These artifacts appear in mid-story beats, not closure, so baseline −0.6 applied in Q7 only. No closure harm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of poet-as-healer, magical realism grounded in sensory perception, and the motif of incompleteness-as-strength is specific and non-obvious. The kite-string metaphor and the feather's tactile detail elevate the premise beyond template. However, the "wounded magical creature teaches mortal a lesson" frame is familiar, and the being's explicit validation reduces narrative risk. The piece commits fully to its lyric register and follows implications without retreat, but the transformation of the trope is partial rather than definitive.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian (quiet shoreline poet) is present from the opening, shapes two key beats (choosing to listen to the feather, choosing to harmonize rather than mute discord), and his final choice to write "line after unfinished line" closes the arc. His occupation and stance are causally central. Cost: he foregoes certainty and accepts discord as companionship.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drake's tail feather appears early (~15% mark), is handled in three distinct beats (landing, lifted to ear, pulsing coolly at closure), and its specific properties (opalescent, warm, pulsing, wounded) drive Elian's tending action and the auditory reveal. Removing it collapses the mechanism of the story. Its state evolves: warm and pulsing → cool and settled.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" is introduced early as Elian's belief, reappears as visible "ribbons of coral, violet, and pewter threading water and air" that form whirlpools, and is noted as faded at closure. It enables the being's emergence and visually charges the middle beat. However, its mechanics remain abstract (the strands do not constrain a specific choice), and it could be replaced with another visual metaphor without breaking causality. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but does not drive tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Warmly attentive" is used twice: first when Elian senses the feather is wounded ("becoming warmly attentive in return"), then at closure ("opened his notebook with warmly attentive hands"). It characterizes his stance but does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it is more perceptual signature than active attribute. Present in closure but not mechanically essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Tend" is signaled early ("To tend it would mean stepping beyond knowing"), enacted in the humming beat ("answered by harmonizing discord"), and validated by the being ("Those who tend the incomplete keep the world from shattering"). The action drives the story's major turn and defines Elian's method. Cost: he must stay with what hurts without turning away. Removing "tend" removes the story's verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Harmonizing discord" is cued when Elian hears "dissonances slurring" and enacted on the page: "humming low where the pitches scraped and jarred... let each roughened note lean against another." The method is specific, shapes the climactic beat, and is reflected in the being's speech. It could not be swapped for "soothing" or "silencing" without breaking the thematic logic. Visible cost: he must endure the ache rather than mute it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "cobalt lagoon after rain" is established in the opening, provides the tideline where the feather lands, and supplies the surface where the woven-dawn strands appear. It anchors the piece spatially and tonally. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost; the encounter could occur on another shoreline with minor adjustments. The post-rain quality is atmospheric but not mechanically essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"As a kite string snaps" is present as a simile ("The moment split the afternoon, as a kite string snaps, clean and irreversible") and frames the story's suddenness. However, it does not track time or tighten decisions; the story's pacing is contemplative rather than clock-driven. The kite's snap is thematic prelude, not timeframe mechanism. Lyric use without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To discover beauty in the incomplete" is dramatized early ("He wrote to discover beauty in the incomplete"), tested when Elian hears "a world always on the verge of harmony, never quite arriving," and confirmed at closure when he writes "line after unfinished line." The motivation drives his choice to harmonize rather than fix. Cost: he must abandon the desire for completion. Friction is present: "uncertain whether he had succeeded or failed."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Burnished hush" opens the story and recurs subtly in "constant hush of waves" and the quiet after the being's departure. The tone modulates under pressure (teeth ache, flushed uncertainty) but returns to stillness at closure ("stood alone again, yet not alone"). It charges the final image by framing discord as companionship rather than noise. Coherent and purposeful, though the modulation is gentle rather than dramatic.</comment>
