<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilias's interiority is specific and embodied: "tired precision," "fingers working by memory," judging signal "by the sound of a leaf falling." His choice to override protocol and force the array to track the dying star is motivated by Alma's legacy and his professional ethos, with visible cost (risk of breaking equipment, defying staff protests). The secondary character Alma operates effectively as a voice in memory, shaping present decisions. Minor weakness: the phrase "changelessly constant" in describing Alma's voice reads slightly formulaic, but does not undercut the earned final choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece accumulates sensory density (tremor, clock hand, stellar flare) toward a decisive act—Ilias bypasses safety locks, restructures Camera Three, and captures the data—that forecloses the safer path with felt cost ("risk breaking the tool"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: "held the configuration steady… sealing their brief, stolen clarity inside the archive" crystallizes the observatory's survival and Ilias's fidelity to Alma's mission. Orientation anchors (lunar observatory, tremor, Ilias) land by ~10% of the text. One meaningful tightening occurs when the quake peaks and Ilias decides to push past protocol. Cost is legible: if he fails, "they were only another crater."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lunar observatory, regolith tremor, and shielded dome provide concrete environmental constraints that shape Ilias's choices: the quake threatens alignment, forcing him to override damping filters and work by sound and touch. Micro-setting (Camera Three housing, console handrails, clock hand in glass cage) functions effectively. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional bias: micrometeorites ticking, attenuators sighing, static crackle. The setting charges the final image: "held the configuration steady through the last aftershock" directly ties environment to closure. Spatial choreography is clean (console to console, staff on handrails, array above).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: capture the stellar death before it evaporates, or the observatory becomes "only another crater." Escalation occurs when the quake peaks and Ilias must choose between protocol (lock down, lose data) and risk (bypass filters, possibly break equipment). His agency—overriding locks, restructuring circuitry—drives the tightening under Situational/Accumulative pressure. The cost is visible: "risk breaking the tool that reached for it," staff protests ignored, tremor in his knees echoing the foundation's tremor. One meaningful choice narrows options and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: "to harness the ephemeral you had to risk breaking the tool," the tension between preservation and capture, Alma's insistence that "broken time noticed broken worlds." Escape velocity as concept (the speed to leave behind what binds you) reappears in the climax without didacticism: "the speed required to leave behind whatever bound you" inflects Ilias's decision to risk everything for data that will outlast funding or politics. The final image—"sealing their brief, stolen clarity inside the archive"—offers a resonant answer to the central question (can understanding reach escape velocity before the moment evaporates?) without stating a moral. No thematic echo or final-paragraph sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Ilias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: professional idiom ("sage camera repairer," "attenuators sighing," "judge signal strength by the sound of a leaf falling"), attention filtered through technical expertise and Alma's remembered voice. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "silicate desert," "invisible hot rain," "luminous ache of numbers." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, closing in during the peak choice ("eyes half closed… deciding how far he could push"). No filter-verb stacks or register drift. The single line of dialogue ("We are here to harness the ephemeral…") reads as Alma's remembered edict, not conversation, and is integrated without breaking frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, setting, and pressure simultaneously ("He had learned to judge signal strength by the sound of a leaf falling… Instead there were micrometeorites ticking against the hull"). Figurative language is controlled and coherent: "lantern nailed to the raw dark," "sky was flinging away pieces of itself," "lines of code racing… like illuminated script." Minor scaffolding appears in adjacent phrasing ("the quake deepened… the foundations shook") but does not obscure causality or dull the closure beat. No loops, no template cadence, clean grammar and tense throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lunar observatory, stellar-death data capture, and legacy-driven risk feels specific and non-obvious. "Escape velocity" as both literal astrophysics and metaphor for knowledge survival is integrated without gimmickry. The choice to structure around a single high-pressure beat (bypassing safety during a quake to capture ephemeral data) transforms familiar tropes (lone technician, dying mentor's voice) through particular sensory and technical detail. The piece commits fully to its premise—harness the ephemeral or justify nothing—and follows through at closure. Risk-taking (rejecting safe protocol, threading technical action through tremor) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilias as "sage camera repairer" is seeded early, developed through his decision to override locks and restructure Camera Three mid-quake, and shapes the closure: his expertise and memory-driven work capture the flare. His choices create the key turn (bypass safety systems) and the final act (hold configuration steady, seal data). Causal pressure is strong; the role is indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The clock hand appears in three beats: wired into tremor sensors, shrieking during the quake, and blurring into "an unbroken circle of silver" at the climax. It reweights meaning (broken time notices broken worlds) and is visually present at the peak moment. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; its role is atmospheric and thematic rather than causal. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Escape velocity" is seeded early (drilling steel into silicate desert), returns in Ilias's climactic thought ("the speed required to leave behind whatever bound you"), and stakes are framed around it: will their understanding reach escape velocity before the moment evaporates? It shapes the protagonist's motivation and the story's thematic calculus. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure; drives at least two beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Changelessly constant" describes Alma's remembered voice and, by extension, Ilias's work ethic ("his work was changelessly constant"). It enables the staff's grudging trust, which allows Ilias to act without interference, but the trait itself does not constrain a specific choice with visible cost. Functional across beats but lacks the irreplaceability required for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Restructure" is the pivotal action: Ilias opens Camera Three's housing, bypasses damping filters, and coaxes raw data into the core while the observatory sways. This act is the climax; removing it would collapse the plot. It redefines options (protocol vs. capture) and is causally indispensable. Present in setup (mentions of alignment issues), executed on-page in the climax, and directly enables the closure (data sealed in archive).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The method "by the sound of a leaf falling" is signaled in the setup ("He had learned to judge signal strength by the sound of a leaf falling") and returns during the climax when Ilias listens with "eyes half closed" to decide how far to push. It shapes one key choice but is not mechanically detailed or irreplaceable; another sensory judgment could serve similarly. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lunar observatory is established immediately and supplies all key constraints: tremor threatens alignment, the dome shields instruments, regolith shifts beneath pylons, micrometeorites tick the hull. The setting forces Ilias's choice (quake vs. data capture) and is inseparable from the closure action (holding configuration steady through aftershock). Environmental pressure is causal and present in setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"When foundations shake" frames the entire piece: the hour is named at the outset, the tremor escalates through the middle, and the climax occurs "through the last aftershock." Time pressure tightens decisions (protocol says lock down, but the flare is only "a second wide" and will pass unrecorded if he waits). The clock hand visually marks the temporal urgency. The timeframe is causal, shapes tactics, and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is voiced by Alma in memory, internalized by Ilias, and dramatized in his choice to risk the equipment for fleeting data. The motivation creates friction (safety vs. capture, preservation vs. use) and drives the climax. It is seeded early, shapes the middle choice, and is implicit in the closure image ("sealing their brief, stolen clarity"). Cost is visible: potential equipment failure, staff alarm, physical strain.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" coheres across the piece: "luminous ache of numbers," "invisible hot rain," "slow, disinterested fire," "lines of code racing… like illuminated script." Tone modulates under pressure (calm technical detail → tremor urgency → charged final image) and supports the thematic register. The final beat—"sealing their brief, stolen clarity"—charges the ending with the promised ache. Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
