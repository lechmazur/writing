<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior voice is specific and embodied—"careful bruise," "ears that heard unspoken words"—and the final choice to "let those trapped ideas spill out" is earned by prior pressure. Motivation flows consistently from inherited ability through terror/longing to surrender. The perceptual signature (hearing unspoken words) remains character-particular throughout. Minor slip: the grandmother's backstory is told rather than dramatically woven, but it primes the closure without flattening present pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered metaphor and the final image—ideas pouring into the valley—reconfigures the protagonist's burden into shared potential with visible cost (the "ringing emptiness" that replaces pressure). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis: rest arrives not as resolution but as "space, wide and echoing," a renunciation of hoarding creativity. Cost is legible in the emptying and the shift from "trapped" to "free." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway and astrolabe constrain key choices: the instrument "clicked, a soft metallic consent" before the tunnel opens, and the archway stones provide spatial grounding for the final rest. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"air that tasted of metal and cold flame"—and the body (shaking hands, skull pressure, back learning stones) functions as micro-setting. The astrolabe's transparency and dust scenes charge the closure image. Environment shapes the protagonist's trajectory and the ending posture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and tightens when "the sentence was mine" turns external threat into internal confrontation. One meaningful reversal: realizing the trapped ideas are her own abandoned work, which narrows options to surrender or continued imprisonment. Agency is embodied in lifting the astrolabe "toward the thickening light," and cost is visible: "ringing emptiness" and the renunciation of control. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens without requiring multiple causal turns. The stakes are felt throughout and the final release forecloses hoarding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—creativity trapped by fear versus release despite cost—emerges through the astrolabe's spiral, the falling stars, and the dust scenes (child building wings, woman singing equations). The final image answers the central question non-literally: rest as "space" rather than completion. No thesis statement mars the ending; the thematic charge lands in "its direction had stopped hiding from me." The protagonist's arc is inseparable from the theme, and the dust pouring into sleeping minds resonates without explaining. Subtext operates in "terror and longing braided together" and the paradox that rest requires surrender, not safety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV held throughout with stable psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: the narrator hears unspoken words and notices spirals, pauses, metaphysical textures. Diction remains character-particular—"careful bruise," "shadowed rapture," "wrung itself dry"—without register drift. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("I realized," "I understood") appear but feel voice-motivated rather than distancing. Syntax modulates with pressure: compressed fragments during the climax ("Terror and longing braided together") contrast with longer, reflective sentences at rest. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent. Minor overwriting in stacked metaphors: "muffled sighs," "wavering light," "bruised green," "narrow map," "slow needles of fire," "shadowed rapture" cluster without always advancing pressure. "Careful bruise" and "shadowed rapture" verge on mixed vehicles but remain evocative. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; information density is strong. Sentence openings vary. The closure image is clear despite the lyric register. One small deduction for metaphor density in middle beats that could tighten without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—releasing trapped creativity via an astrolabe under an aurora—synthesizes familiar tropes (inherited magic, artistic block) into a specific configuration. The grandmother's spiral motif and the dust scenes (wings from umbrellas, singing equations to storms) provide fresh particulars. The transformation test passes: swapping names or places would weaken the archway/astrolabe linkage. Risk-taking in lyric register and metaphysical mechanics is coherent. However, the "artist freeing their own blocked work" frame is a known template; the piece elevates it through embodied cost and perceptual specificity but does not fully escape derivation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "moonstruck dreamer" label is mentioned early and the protagonist's choices—climbing when she should sleep, lifting the astrolabe, surrendering to the ideas—drive the turns. However, "moonstruck dreamer" itself is not irreplaceable; the protagonist could be called anything. The role is more thematic echo than causal lever. Present in setup and payoff, functional in middle choice, but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The astrolabe appears early, is handled in multiple beats (unfolding, tracing stars, clicking consent, flaring transparent), and its spiral matches the archway's carving, creating charged reprise. Its mechanics—tracing falling stars—shape the method of release. Without the astrolabe, the closure collapses. Specificity (brass, grandmother's rebuild, plates with spirals) and causal pressure (it "obliged" the sky, became transparent to reveal dust) earn high integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Remembered stardust" is etched on the astrolabe and reappears as swirling dust in the transparency, each grain "a tiny scene." The concept shapes the final release: the dust pours into the valley, embodying the trapped ideas. It constrains the grandmother's work ("nights that had never officially existed") and charges the closure image. Present across all three gates and causally active in the ending, though not entirely irreplaceable (could be "forgotten visions" or similar).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ability to hear unspoken words drives the inciting action (murmurs lead her to the archway), sharpens mid-story ("the unspoken words in the air sharpened"), and culminates in the realization that "the sentence was mine." The trait constrains her perception and enables the recognition that trapped ideas are hers. Visible cost: the pressure in her head. Essential across setup, development, and payoff. Minor swappability (could be "sees forgotten thoughts") prevents top band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Rest" is the stated goal ("I had come there to rest") and the ending delivers it: "finally able to rest" after the ideas are released. The action redefines from passive cessation to active surrender. However, the story could function with "release" or "understand" as the framing verb; "rest" is thematically apt but not mechanically indispensable. Present in setup and payoff, shapes closure tone, but partially swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tracing falling stars is the method: "symbols rearranged themselves into a narrow map that could only be read by tracing the path of falling stars." The sky drops "slow needles of fire" and "every traced descent" sharpens the words. The astrolabe's mechanics depend on this action, and the final stars "plunged straight into the astrolabe." Setup, middle constraint, and payoff all hinge on this exact method. Irreplaceable and causally active throughout.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway is the story's location and pressure point: the aurora "sagged low," the keystone bears the grandmother's spiral, and the protagonist lies "beneath the cooling archway stones" at the end. The setting supplies the tunnel of light and frames the final rest. It constrains movement (broken steps, ruined stones) and charges the closure image. Present across all beats and essential to closure. Minor deduction: it could theoretically be another threshold, but spiral linkage makes it highly specific.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Across an unwritten calendar" describes the grandmother's astrolabe ("a sky measured across an unwritten calendar only she could read"). It recurs as "nights that had never officially existed." The timeframe is conceptual rather than ticking; it flavors the theme but does not tighten decisions on the page. Lyric reprise (setup → final image where time stops hiding) earns mid-range, but no middle constraint or live clock shaping tactics. Present in setup and obliquely in payoff, but not causally active in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"To free trapped creativity" is stated early ("I had come to free trapped creativity, even if it tore me on the way out") and drives every choice: climbing, unfolding the astrolabe, lifting it toward the light. The mid-story reversal—realizing the trapped ideas are her own—deepens the friction between desire and cost. The ending dramatizes success with visible price (emptiness). Setup, development friction (terror vs. longing), and payoff all hinge on this exact motivation. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" is named explicitly and embodied throughout: "Terror and longing braided together in me, a shadowed rapture that made my hands steady." The tone modulates from dread ("slow dread of someone waking into a nightmare") to ecstatic surrender ("wide and echoing, like the sky after a storm"). Coherent through turns and charges the final image of ringing emptiness. Present in all beats and integral to emotional arc. Minor swappability (could be "dark exultation") prevents highest band.</comment>
