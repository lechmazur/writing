<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eren's curiosity is embodied through concrete choices—adjusting dials, cross-referencing the grid, choosing to deliver the message rather than file it. His interior life shows contradiction: protocol versus the "persistently curious ache." The final renunciation of bureaucratic safety to deliver Lale's unsent message carries visible cost. Minor issue: some interiority leans slightly expository ("he reminded himself") rather than staying embedded in perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through a pattern of echoes (the hearing aid's ticks, Lale's unsent attempts, the "reeling hush") that converges at closure when Eren delivers the message. Orientation anchors are clear by ~100 words (Eren, atrium, twilight, contact tracer). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Eren's choice to call forecloses the bureaucratic path and crystallizes his stance as someone who "could not fix anything, only tilt it." Cost is felt in his violation of protocol and the weight of the woman's cry. One meaningful deepening—from buzzing signal to delivered plea—reweights the dominant stake (protecting vulnerable voices) with undeniable pressure at the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The hearing aid constrains multiple choices: its temperamental wheel must be learned nightly, it heats in Eren's palm as he climbs, it vibrates at the photograph. The mist-clad atrium and the riverside apartment's smells anchor space concretely. The photograph is handled twice and charges the final beat. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Does not quite reach 9-band because environment pressures tactics but does not decisively alter the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting vulnerable voices) is signaled early and tightens when Eren chooses to call rather than file. The hearing aid's escalating signal ("buzzing hotter," "vibrated sharply") accumulates pressure under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: Eren's decision to deliver the message forecloses the protocol path. The cost is legible—he introduces himself "not as city employee" and violates procedure. One meaningful tightening (the unsent plea resolved into "Tell her I forgave her first") narrows options and forces the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (incidental heroism, the ethics of witnessing) emerges from particulars: the hearing aid as "cracked plastic oracle," Lale's frozen laughter, the pulse-shaped unsent words. The final act—Eren naming his work "incidental heroism"—lands as a non-literal answer to the central question (what does it mean to protect voices after death?) without moralizing. The closing image ("sound thin as tracing paper, yet louder than the whole mist-wrapped city") reweights prior material through specific contradiction. Subtext operates in silences: Lale's attempts that end before the beep, the woman's cry as the story's only loud sound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Eren; perceptual signature is consistent (he notices the hearing aid's "shy tick," the "reeling hush," the photograph's "blurred smile"). Diction fits the contemplative, technical register ("contact tracer for hearts," "pulse-shaped into silence"). Minimal dialogue; the single exchange is goal-driven and advances plot. Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "he reminded himself" slightly externalizes thought. Rhythm modulates effectively from the opening's slow hush to the apartment's vivid sensory detail to the closing's charged brevity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "The aid had once belonged to a retired switchboard operator, and it still remembered how to lean toward voices" establishes history, animates the object, and primes its use). Syntax varies purposefully; no template runs. Minor issue: a few lines lean slightly overwritten ("mist smeared the glass roof, turning streetlights into slow, underwater lanterns" is vivid but slows momentum in a setup beat). No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and serves atmosphere without cluttering peak beats. The final line ("He named this quiet work incidental heroism") resolves by image and recharges the premise cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise (contact tracer for the dead using a hearing aid as compass) offers a fresh synthesis of ghost story and procedural. Specific details (the hearing aid's "temperamental wheel," Lale's mismatched coat buttons, the "reeling hush") anchor freshness. The emotional arc—curiosity to moral risk—transforms the trope of the reluctant medium. However, the core shape (lone investigator finds final message, delivers it to grieving recipient) follows a familiar template. Transformation is present but not quite bold enough to reach high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eren's role as contact tracer drives setup (workstation, hearing aid), middle choice (to investigate rather than file), and closure (delivery of the message). His decision to call Deniz rather than archive the death is the story's hinge. Present across all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The photograph appears in two beats: Lale clutches it (discovery), Eren's fingers brush it and the hearing aid vibrates (middle turn). It charges the closure by framing the unsent plea's recipient (the laughing woman on the pier). Specific detail (mismatched buttons, whipping hair) makes it irreplaceable. Strong closure linkage; the photograph is the lens through which Eren understands the message's stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is named in the final line and articulated through Eren's choice to deliver the message knowing "he could not fix anything, only tilt it." The concept shapes the dominant stake (protecting voices) and the ending's moral calculus. However, it is more thematic resonance than on-page constraint; the phrase itself is declared rather than enacted across beats. Present at closure with thematic weight but not full causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Eren's persistent curiosity is dramatized early ("the sort of man who asked not just where someone died but what they had almost said"), enables the middle choice (scrolling contacts, playing unsent messages), and drives closure (calling Deniz instead of filing). The trait carries visible cost: supervisors warn it will slow his caseload, and his final act violates protocol. Constrains action with price across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Assure" appears once when Eren tells the guard "I will be back before shift change...to assure the man, though the guard had not voiced any concern." The action is present but peripheral; it does not create a turn or redefine options. Setup only; no middle or closure participation. Swappable with minor narrative adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hearing aid is signaled early (second paragraph), used across multiple beats (adjusting dials, buzzing hotter as Eren climbs, vibrating at the photograph, catching residue of unsent words), and its mechanics matter throughout (it "remembered how to lean toward voices," served as compass, resolved pulses into the final message). Its specific properties are irreplaceable; Eren could not trace the call without it. Essential across all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is established in the opening and anchors Eren's workstation. It sets tone (the "reeling hush") and provides spatial grounding but does not constrain middle choices or appear at closure; the key action shifts to the riverside apartment. Setup strong, but limited development and no closure participation. The apartment's sensory detail (boiled cabbage, flickering light) does more tactical work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"When the dead call" frames the opening and establishes the temporal logic (twilight as the moment when unsent messages search for receivers). The timeframe pressures Eren's decision to act immediately rather than defer. Present at setup and implicit throughout, though not explicitly tracked as a ticking clock. Shapes urgency but does not create a live countdown that alters tactics beat by beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Eren's motivation ("to protect vulnerable voices, even when those voices rasped from throats that no longer moved") is dramatized early and drives the central conflict: protocol versus moral duty. It is tested in the middle (the choice to investigate rather than file) and enacted at closure (delivering the message). Friction is clear: his job officially requires logging deaths, but his motivation compels him to honor the unsent plea. Cost is visible in his protocol violation and the weight of the woman's response.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" is established in the opening ("the atrium hummed with a reeling hush"), recurs in the apartment ("that same reeling hush"), and modulates at closure when the woman's cry becomes "louder than the whole mist-wrapped city." Tone is coherent and charges the final image by inverting the dominant silence. The shift from hush to cry reweights the emotional stakes and completes the tonal arc.</comment>
