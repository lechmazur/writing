<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is concrete and character-specific, with the backwards-aging conceit embodied through layered contradiction ("bones young, eyes impossibly ancient," memory thickening as body erodes). Mora's anticipation and confusion are physicalised through trembling, flexing hands, breath caught. The final choice—to withhold full vanishing until she decides what to remain—emerges from prior causality with visible cost: she has experienced a self-erasure tremor and must now navigate the hollow discovered inside.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure: Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image crystallises Mora's choice between vanishing-as-fleeing and appearing-as-return, reweighting Elian's withholding with undeniable pressure ("the night held its breath, waiting for who she would choose to be"). Cost is felt in the "new hollow she had discovered inside" and legible in the grotto's "hidden pull" that will shape her future. Orientation is clean by ~100 words. Single POV, one scene, one dominant stake (learning to vanish without fleeing), one meaningful deepening through the stone-drop trance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The floating platform tethered to magnetic field-lines constrains the demonstration and charges the final image; the grotto's resonance aligns the ripples with an unseen grid, making setting essential to method. The basin of water drawn upward, the sycamores leaning inward, and the abyss below create spatial pressure. Micro-setting (the stone, the basin, the platform's drift) all constrain Mora's trance and the lesson's unfolding. The grotto's "hidden pull" appears at closure, tugging at the hollow inside her—environment shapes the final stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Mora came for "a demonstration of disappearance," Elian intends "to teach vanishing to appear in her bones." The stone-drop trance tightens pressure through sensory dilution and self-erasure: "the certainty of it thinned, like ink washed again and again," culminating in the moment "the world seemed to forget she had ever been sitting there." Cost is legible in the painful bright return and Elian's refusal, which folds into the lesson and forecloses haste. The final withholding forces her to "decide what deserves to remain," a meaningful deepening with felt opportunity cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—identity as volitional act, vanishing versus fleeing—emerges from the stone-drop particulars and Elian's refusal without statement. The rings-between-spaces method and the hollow discovered inside function as non-literal embodiment. The final lines ("only when you can vanish without fleeing...will your appearing stop being a desperate return") reweight prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to the central question. Subtext operates in Elian's gesture, silence, and the grotto's pull; no thematic echo or prompt language appears.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited, Elian-focalized, stable and coherent throughout. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "his voice steadied her more," "the air thinned, listening," "she felt herself widened across the rings." Elian's interior texture ("feared what might happen when his body finally matched the age of his students") is distinct from Mora's embodied confusion. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("if the stone cannot help me disappear, why bring me here at all" / "Because the first thing you must learn is how I withhold"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the trance. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with the trance ("Minutes or hours later, she could not say"). Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor overwriting appears in the opening third: "the magnetic grotto under starlight hummed softly beneath," "trading a continuous sycamore hush," and "tone itself were study" lean elevated without clear voice motivation. The stone-drop sequence is clean and propulsive. No loops or template cadence. Figurative language is mostly controlled, though "like ink washed again and again" and "folded itself into the lesson like another ring" cluster without pattern-teaching, triggering a −0.3 deduction for density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Backwards-aging researcher teaching disappearance is a specific synthesis; the withheld lesson and ring-pattern method feel earned rather than gimmicky. The premise avoids template plotting. The final reconfiguration (appearing versus fleeing) grows from prior particulars. Minor proximity concern: "vanishing" as enlightenment vehicle echoes familiar meditation/magic fiction tropes, but the trance mechanics and Elian's fear of erasure add specificity. The story commits to its premise fully; the grotto, platform, and ripple mechanics cohere as a singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian appears early, frames the lesson, drives the withholding decision at closure, and his backwards-aging fear constrains his teaching method ("I will not show you the full vanishing tonight"). His choice to withhold creates the final turn and forecloses Mora's haste with visible cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending; causal and specific.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The grotto appears in setup (hums beneath, tethers the platform), resurfaces mid-scene (resonates with the ripples, aligns them to an unseen grid), and returns at closure (tugs at the hollow inside Mora). It constrains the setting and charges the final image, but its magnetic properties are descriptive rather than tactile—Elian and Mora never handle or navigate it directly. Swappable with "chasm" or "abyss" in some beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Delayed revelation is the narrative engine: Elian refuses to show full vanishing, teaches withholding as method, and the withheld cost shapes Mora's tactics and the ending stakes. The concept structures every beat: "what you needed was to see exactly what can be lost" before the full demonstration. It changes options on the page, forecloses haste, and the final image depends on it. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully, never in straight lines, never all at once" appears early and constrains his teaching: he drops the stone to demonstrate indirection, guides Mora through rings rather than spectacle, and withholds the full vanishing. The trait enables the middle trance and the closure refusal with visible cost. Present in setup and payoff; causal in two beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Withholding appears early (Elian intends "delayed revelation"), drives the stone-drop choice (lesson in absence rather than presence), and defines the closure turn: "I will not show you the full vanishing tonight" forecloses Mora's want and reconfigures stakes. The major turn traces directly to this action; removing it breaks the narrative arc. Indispensable across setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ripple method is signaled early ("It begins here, through the patterns in the rings of a pond after a stone is thrown"), executed mid-scene (stone drops, rings spread, Mora watches the spaces between), and its effect shapes the ending (the hollow discovered, the pull that persists). The mechanics matter: Elian drops the stone, the grotto aligns the rings, Mora's self dilutes across them. Present and causal in all three gates; the method could not be swapped without rewriting the trance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The platform appears in setup, grounds the entire scene, sways under Elian's gesture and drifts along invisible field-lines during the trance, providing tactile feedback that anchors Mora's experience. The basin at its center holds the water; the abyss below it creates vertigo. It constrains the demonstration spatially and charges the atmosphere. Present in setup, middle, and implicit at closure; not quite indispensable but essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through the trance" appears as timeframe: "Minutes or hours later, she could not say." The trance window structures the middle sequence (Mora's breath falls into the spaces, her sense loosens, the final ring vanishes) and the ending acknowledges its after-effect. The timeframe shapes pacing and Mora's disorientation but does not tighten decisions with a live clock. Present in two beats; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elian's purpose—"to teach vanishing to appear in her bones"—is stated early, guides his withholding tactic, and the final refusal reweights the lesson: she must decide what deserves to remain before learning full vanishing. Mora's anticipation and confusion dramatize the friction between want (spectacle) and need (seeing what can be lost). The motivation drives setup, middle demonstration, and closure; cost is visible in Elian's refusal and Mora's hollow.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Sycamore hush" anchors the opening atmosphere, returns mid-scene ("rose and fell like a distant sea, until even that sound felt optional"), and the night's held breath at closure modulates it to charged silence. Tone is coherent through the trance and shifts purposefully to support the ending's poise. It reweights rather than remaining static; present in setup and payoff, though not causal in middle beats.</comment>
