<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is highly specific—elevator mechanic's observational idiom filtering the ghost-world—and micro-choices (kneeling, analyzing dust, touching the barrel) are embodied and purposeful. Internal contradiction is present ("against every training manual and most of my better instincts") and the final act of engagement is earned by curiosity-as-flaw. The ghost-boy functions as secondary pressure but remains thin; the final choice feels slightly under-motivated because we don't see what the protagonist sacrifices or risks by engaging the barrel beyond abstract instinct.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered observation (dust patterns, ceiling bulge, ghost testimony) until the mainspring touch triggers the upside-down room reveal—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that crystallizes the "ceilings as agreements" thesis with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist moves from passive observation to active engagement, narrowing options. The closure image lands cleanly under the chosen lens, reweighting prior "cracks in the facade" material, though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ticket office, concrete shaft, brass mainspring, and inverted room are vivid and constraint-rich: the polished circle on the barrel signals repeated ghost use, dust accumulation guides forensic choice, and the ceiling breach supplies the final spatial impossibility that charges closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (elevator grease simile, fibrous sigh of tape). The micro-setting (mainspring on crate) directly enables the protagonist's final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"to discover what ceilings hide"—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when the boy's ghost directs attention upward and the ceiling bulges, forcing a choice. The protagonist's agency (touching the barrel) is clear, but the cost is oblique: we see the breach open but not what the protagonist forfeits or risks by causing it. One meaningful deepening occurs; the escalation is driven by protagonist curiosity under the Accumulative lens, but the trade-off lacks visceral price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—"ceilings as agreements, treaties between floors"—emerges through concrete particulars (dust forensics, ghost testimony, inverted room) without thesis statement. The final image (upside-down room, pacing machinery) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "what do ceilings hide" that reweights prior material with conceptual cost. Subtext operates in the ghost-boy's relief and the protagonist's "against better instincts" hesitation. No moralizing; the ending charges ambiguity without resolving it tidily.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person; psychic distance is stable and controlled. Voice is distinctly blue-collar-technical-mystical: "elevator grease," "stress fractures," "thin treaties between floors." Diction stays within the mechanic-mystic register even under pressure; no head-hopping or filter clutter. The perceptual signature—observing dust, cracks, bulges with forensic care—is character-specific and consistent. Purposeful compression ("the familiar weightless burden") is taught early and pays off in tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances observation, ghost-world lore, or sensory detail without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at tension peaks, longer accumulative sentences during forensic analysis). Zero paraphrase loops; no template cadence. Figurative language ("membrane instead of a switch," "entrails") is vivid and coherent. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Minor quibble: "the way buildings learned to lie" risks slight abstraction, but it's anchored by prior concrete cracks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—blue-collar ghost-seer + horologist's heart + inverted architecture—is specific and non-obvious. The "ceilings as treaties" metaphor is fresh and follows its implications without retreat. Dust-pattern forensics and the upside-down room are particular to this premise. The ending avoids tidy resolution and commits fully to conceptual ambiguity. Risk is present in the unconventional closure (no causal confrontation, only revelation), which heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight derivative echo: the "buildings lie" trope is familiar in urban-fantasy adjacent work, but the horologist element transforms it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; choices (kneeling to analyze, touching the barrel) create the final turn. Early signal, two distinct beats (dust analysis, engagement), closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced ~30% in; handled twice (visual inspection, touch that triggers breach). Polished circle detail shows prior ghost use, adding specificity. Touch directly shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("cracks in the facade"), developed mid-story ("facades crack from the inside"), and returns in closure ("treaties between floors," breach visible). Shapes protagonist's interpretive frame and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Trait demonstrated on-page through dust forensics, ceiling-bulge detection, and ghost-boy reading. Enables the protagonist's choices with visible mechanics; not label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Action occurs in final third, triggers the breach, and is the pivot for closure. Prior beats (hesitation, ghost testimony) build toward it. Irreplaceable; the story's logic requires this exact engagement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Signaled early, used in one extended beat (dust crescent, smudge interpretation). Guides protagonist's understanding but does not constrain a later choice. Present in closure interpretation ("prior particulars") but mechanics are one-note.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Present from line one; glass-fronted cube, cracked plaster, concrete shaft all pressure choices. Mainspring's placement and the ceiling breach are setting-enabled tactics. Micro-setting (crate, barrel) alters final action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Fluorescent death signals the ghost-world threshold early and is referenced once more when fixture dies again. Marks transition but does not tighten live decisions after the opening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stated early, dramatized through repeated upward glances and the protagonist's internal justification for "chasing rumors." Friction between curiosity and "better instincts" creates visible hesitation. Drives final choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Phrase "weightless burden" appears early; tone of forensic calm layered with ghost-world unease modulates through the piece. Final pacing-machinery image charges ambiguity. Coherent through turns; quiet intensification rather than static mood.</comment>
