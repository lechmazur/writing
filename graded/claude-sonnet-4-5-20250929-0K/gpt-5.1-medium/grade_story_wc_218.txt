<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The caretaker's interior is distinctly rendered through technical perception filtered by mortality: "clock chiming underwater," choices made through craft idiom ("measuring tension by feel"). Motivation deepens organically from polished architect to dying translator between species, with embodied cost visible in "chest hurt, but his grin came easily." Minor slip: the progression from museum designer to island caretaker feels summarized rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene, and the final death "between them, listening" arrives without a micro-choice that forecloses a path—it reads as graceful fade rather than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred and held: pressure builds through copper-wire experiments that unlock architectural secrets, culminating in monks walking "more slowly...vowels rounded by leaves." Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the caretaker completes his translation project and dies mid-negotiation, forecloses the path of waiting passively, cost visible in "between them, listening." Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (island, verdict, six months, orchard). One tightening: storm unlocks hidden chambers, validating his intuition and shifting the project from engineering to translation. The death arrives on-page but feels slightly soft—Cost Proof Test satisfied by "everything negotiated peace" reweighting prior "architectural secrets," though the final image could land harder.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pillars "hollow with architectural secrets," copper coils in storage loft, and storm-opened chambers constrain choices and charge closure: the wires enable circuits, the chambers validate translation, and monks' final paths ("not the architects") prove the orchard's voice. Micro-setting (toolshed, copper, oak branches) functions as setting at this length. Sensory hierarchy reflects craft priority: "hum under birdsong," "grinding sigh," tactile wire-winding. Spatial choreography clear across cliff path, orchard, loft, and pillar interiors. Environment applies immediate pressure (storm, hidden seams) and the final paths are chosen by trees, not architect—setting decisively shapes closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: remodel orchard into "a message that could not be ignored" to foster interspecies respect before death. One meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens: storm catalyzes discovery of hidden chambers, shifting his role from engineer to translator and narrowing options (he adjusts plan, "less engineer than translator"). Agency clear in wire experiments, diary annotations, guiding monks along tree-chosen paths. Cost legible: "died between them, listening" forecloses the architect's control, accepting the mountain's voice. No antagonist required; pressure coheres through mortality clock and the orchard's gradual response. Minor gap: the monks' arrival feels coincidental rather than summoned by his work, slightly softening the earned resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—translation across species, humility in design, apology through presence—emerges from wire experiments, diary particulars, and the shift from "polished indifference" to listening. The final image "died between them, listening, as everything negotiated peace" offers a resonant, non-literal answer: architecture as conversation, not imposition. Subtext operates in "brazen calm," copper as subtitle, and "vowels rounded by leaves." No thematic echo; the ending avoids stating the moral. Backstory (museum designer background) tilts present stance by establishing the contrast between efficiency and the orchard's patience. The phrase "interspecies respect" in paragraph 16 briefly borders on prompt-speak but is redeemed by immediate grounding in "root and stone, feather and fruit."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: craft idiom ("tension by feel," "resonances like constellations"), technical precision filtered through mortality. Diction remains architect-monk throughout ("networked circuitry," "subtitles," "slow graffiti"). Free indirect style clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates: compressed urgency in wire-winding, expansive reflection in night passages. Minor density issue: "gossip about birds" and "blinking lizards guarded mosaics of extinct flowers" veer toward lyric ornament without advancing pressure in those beats. Prose as character holds: the narrator's way of noticing (joints, hinges, resonance) is consistent and voice-motivated. Elision of monks' thoughts appropriate; final passage compresses his death without overexplaining.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "veined with moss, hollow with architectural secrets" conveys history, mystery, and structure). Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings diverse. Minor loop: "He understood then" (paragraph 31) and "So he adjusted his plan" (paragraph 32) restate insight without added pressure—light paraphrase slip. Figurative language controlled but occasionally dense: "clock chiming underwater," "frozen moonlight," "graffiti," "subtitles" cluster in the first third without pattern-teaching, though they clarify at closure. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Grammar clean, tense stable, no pronoun drift. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve via image. Textural specificity strong ("cramped hand," "blinking lizards"). Propulsion consistent; no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise—dying architect translates mountain's voice through copper circuitry—synthesizes memoir, eco-fable, and craft meditation in a non-obvious frame. Transformation test passed: plot and arc depend on this voice, setting, and the wire-as-translation conceit. Turns feel earned: storm unlocking chambers grows from wire network, monks' slower walk from tree-chosen paths. Trope of terminal-diagnosis urgency is elevated by the specificity of copper loops and "gently systematic" method. Minor echo risk: "buildings could apologize, walls could bow" approaches architectural-memoir idiom without full transformation. Bold risk in accumulative structure and lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth (apologizing through presence rather than declaration) avoids generic template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 1–2. Development: wraps copper (paragraph 23), adjusts plan from engineer to translator (paragraph 32), guides monks (paragraph 34). Closure: "died between them, listening"—his final choice to complete the translation and accept the mountain's voice. Three distinct beats; causal pressure (his wire work enables the storm unlock and monk guidance); closure linkage strong. Cost: forecloses control, embraces listening. High irreplaceability: the architect-turned-caretaker identity shapes every tactic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 8, removed from toolshed. Development: titles "Last Renovation" (paragraph 10), sketches layout (paragraph 19), "recording each new resonance...with stubborn, brazen calm" (paragraph 33). Closure: not explicitly present in final image but implicitly the record of his work. Two beats (title, sketch+record); shapes one turn (formalizes project scope). Swappable with "notebook" or "journal" without major structural loss. Cost indirect: the diary organizes but does not itself constrain a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 5, pillars "hollow with architectural secrets." Development: storm unlocks "hidden seams...panels slid aside to reveal cramped chambers" (paragraph 29–30), validating wire experiments. Closure: monks walk paths "the trees had chosen, not the architects" (paragraph 34)—secrets now accessible, architecture becomes dialogue. Three beats (introduction, storm reveal, monks' access); causal pressure (unlocking changes his understanding and tactics); closure linkage strong. Irreplaceable: the hidden-chamber mechanic drives the shift from engineer to translator.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 13, "gently systematic" applied to his prior work. Development: "wound the metal gently, never biting bark, measuring tension by feel" (paragraph 24)—systematic care enables success; "less engineer than translator, recording each new resonance...with stubborn, brazen calm" (paragraph 32–33)—trait evolves into translation method. Closure: guides monks "more slowly" (paragraph 34), systematic patience charges final image. Two beats (wire-winding, recording); constrains method with visible benefit (pillar shivers without cracking). Trait shown through action, not label-only. Cost implicit: systematic care trades speed for success.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 11, decision to "remodel the orchard itself into a message." Development: every experiment from paragraph 22 onward executes this action; storm unlocks chambers (paragraph 29), adjusts plan (paragraph 32), guides monks along new paths (paragraph 34). Closure: "died between them, listening, as everything negotiated peace"—remodel complete, message received. Four beats; causal pressure drives all turns; closure depends on completed remodel. Highly irreplaceable: swapping "remodel" would require rewriting core structure. Cost: his life spent in execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 21, copper coils "from an old lightning rod project." Development: paragraph 23–24, wraps copper around oak branches, "wound the metal gently...listening for a faint hum"; paragraph 25, "extended the living circuitry from oak to fig to pear"; paragraph 27, birds close circuits; paragraph 28, lightning uses copper network. Closure: paragraph 31, "his wires were merely subtitles"—method reweighted. Four beats; mechanics matter (tension, circuits, lightning conduction); causal pressure (enables pillar response and chamber unlocking). Irreplaceable: copper's conductivity is essential. Cost: labor and risk (storm, sap boiling).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 4–5, temple orchard within living stone pillars. Development: pillars constrain all experiments (paragraph 24, pillar shivers; paragraph 29, seams unlock; paragraph 30, chambers reveal mosaics); orchard provides trees for wiring. Closure: monks walk "between branches and stone lips" (paragraph 34–35), setting shapes final paths and rounds prayers. Four beats; environment pressures every choice (cliff path, toolshed access, storm exposure); micro-setting (branches, copper, chambers) alters tactics throughout. Irreplaceable: the pillar-orchard integration is the story's spatial logic. Cost: orchard's voice supersedes architect's design.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 2, "six months to live, perhaps fewer if storms came early." Development: paragraph 7, "countdown in his blood gave the place...precise urgency"; paragraph 11, "narrowing days"; paragraph 26, "chest hurt"; paragraph 33, mortality implicit in "stubborn, brazen calm." Closure: paragraph 35, "died between them." Three beats (diagnosis, urgency acknowledgment, death); tightens decisions (remodel now, not wait). Clock tracked intermittently rather than beat-by-beat but presence felt. Cost: life spent completing message. Minor gap: storms arrive but six-month frame not revisited to sharpen final urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 16, "motivation was to foster interspecies respect...root and stone, feather and fruit, architect and weather." Development: paragraph 17–18, pillars "still learning to speak"; paragraph 23–24, experiments link tree and pillar; paragraph 31, "orchard and mountain were already conversing." Closure: paragraph 35, "everything negotiated peace"—desire fulfilled. Three beats (declaration, experiments, final negotiation); motivation shapes all wire choices. Friction: "interspecies respect" borders on prompt-speak in paragraph 16 but is immediately grounded in concrete pairs. Cost: his life becomes the medium for respect. High specificity: this exact motivation drives the translation frame.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 3, "listened in brazen calm." Development: paragraph 7, "strange, precise urgency"; paragraph 26, "chest hurt, but his grin came easily"; paragraph 33, "stubborn, brazen calm." Closure: paragraph 35, "died between them, listening"—calm held to final breath. Three beats (diagnosis response, pain+grin, death); tone modulates with pressure (urgency rises, calm persists). Coherent through turns; charges final image (listening = active calm). Irreplaceable: "brazen" carries defiance without panic, distinct from mere serenity. Cost visible: calm is maintained against bodily betrayal.</comment>
