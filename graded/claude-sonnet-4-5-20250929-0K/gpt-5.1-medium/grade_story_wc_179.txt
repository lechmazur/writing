<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout ("my resentment had grown heavier than my bones"). The protagonist's contradictory impulses—clinging to fury while seeking relief—operate simultaneously in scene, particularly when the car memory surfaces and she feels herself reaching for her brother while blaming him. The final shift is earned through embodied realization ("the hurt moved differently, no longer a blade, more like a splinter working itself outward"), and Ilen's characterization as a "scheming pacifist" whose "campaigns of compassion" are visible in his tactical patience shows embodied contradiction. Minor deduction: Ilen's interiority remains somewhat opaque, though his role as guide justifies limited access.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist releases the rehearsed narrative and feels a note "bloom inside my chest" while the box remains silent—Charged Poise with conceptual cost). The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early through the sanctuary's shifting walls and layered sensory recursions, holding it through the cellular-memory sequence to a final cadence shift that reweights resentment as "repeating the wound as identity." Causality remains legible: the broken music box triggers the sanctuary's reality-shift, which forces the body to remember the true sequence. One meaningful deepening (the car scene reappearing with corrected blame) suffices at this length. Minor slip: the sanctuary's mechanics ("cellular memory," reality shifts) are asserted more than demonstrated, but the closure effect remains undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: silence "tightened around thought itself," walls "flickered between stone, glass, and something like misted skin," and the shifting architecture forces the protagonist to confront bodily memory when escape routes disappear. The broken music box—handled twice, first as light object then as vibration source—charges the final image when its silent key-turn produces an internal note. Spatial choreography is clean (cross-legged opposition, the box between them, walls rippling outward). Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis (the protagonist notices Glass "resting like snow" during trauma replay, broader detail in calmer beats). Entry to 9-band requires the object or environment to constrain a choice; here the sanctuary's shifts force confrontation but the protagonist's agency in the final turn is more internal than spatial, capping the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stopping hatred of her brother—is signaled in paragraph 7 and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sanctuary's reality-shift forces the protagonist into the car memory and her body reveals the true sequence ("I felt my hand reaching for my brother's... felt him squeeze back before opening the door"), narrowing options from sustained blame to acknowledgment. Agency operates through attention and renunciation: she chooses to turn the key again at the end, knowing it's broken, and allows the internal note to emerge—endurance that forecloses the old narrative with felt cost ("the realization hurt"). Ilen's method (cellular memory accessed through the shifting room) applies pressure without solving via coincidence. The cost is legible on the page: her fury's foundation collapses, and she must live without the defensive story.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—resentment as rehearsed identity and the cost of releasing it—emerges through concrete particulars: the broken music box that "remembers songs even when silence shreds its machinery," the sanctuary's refusal to allow excuses ("always perfectly wrong for the excuses we bring"), and the final image of an internal note blooming while the external mechanism stays broken. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: the body can hold truth even when the mechanism of blame is dismantled. Ilen's line "we ask resentment to release its grip one muscle at a time" operates as method rather than thesis because it's enacted via the cellular-memory sequence. Subtext operates in his closed eyes and the empty-handed patience, his "entire campaigns of compassion hiding behind" his gaze. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the ribs vibrating "as if tuned to a song I had nearly erased" reweights the opening's "soundless sanctuary" without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with controlled distance and a distinct perceptual signature: metaphors favor weight and texture ("resentment had grown heavier than my bones," "hurt moved differently, no longer a blade, more like a splinter"). Ilen's dialogue carries subtext and pursuit ("Every truce has a weapon buried inside it... mine is understanding"). Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the car-memory beat, where perception compresses to vibration and glass. Diction remains within the narrator's register throughout; elevated moments ("horizons," "cellular memory") read as Ilen's idiom filtering into her frame rather than authorial drift. Minor deduction: brief filter-verb clusters in reflective passages ("I felt the building tilt," "I felt each cell") slightly dull immediacy, though they remain voice-consistent and do not obscure peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift across beats. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "His name was Ilen, a scheming pacifist whose plots never harmed but always unsettled" introduces character, occupation, and thematic tension). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("walls shimmered as if they were trapped horizons," "reality curls and uncurls to expose the knots we hide"). Two minor issues prevent higher score: slight paraphrase loop in the car-memory passage ("I felt... I felt... I clung") adds −0.2; one mixed-register moment ("cognitive smoothness" implied by "cellular memory" jargon, though it's Ilen's term) adds −0.1. The closure beat is clean and propulsive. No template cadence or scaffold. Overall strong momentum with hairline drag in the trauma-replay sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—pacifist as tactician of emotional release via a reality-shifting sanctuary that reads bodily memory—is specific and non-obvious. The broken music box as metaphor for holding truth when machinery fails is fresh. Ilen's characterization ("scheming pacifist whose plots never harmed but always unsettled") transforms the mentor archetype. The sanctuary's physics (walls trading places with air, the body replaying impact as vibration) commits fully to its premise. Minor constraint: the "teach resentment to release" frame and cellular-memory method edge toward therapeutic-workshop idiom without quite falling into template. The emotional arc—protagonist blaming brother for her own drunk-driving guilt—offers genuine complexity and avoids false equivalence. The transformation test holds: swap names/places and the arc loses its anchoring particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilen (scheming pacifist) is present from paragraph 4, constrains the middle action by orchestrating the music-box trigger and sanctuary mechanics, and delivers the core teaching ("resentment to release its grip one muscle at a time") that the protagonist enacts at closure. His tactical patience—eyes closed, hands empty, watching distortions "as if measuring each"—demonstrates the "scheming" attribute through choice rather than label. His decisions (handing her the box, timing the explanation of cellular memory) create two key turns: the reality-shift and the protagonist's final acceptance. Cost: his method risks the protagonist's resistance ("nothing he could say would change what my brother had done"), and he absorbs that friction to guide her through. Strong integration across setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The broken music box appears in paragraph 14 (early), is handled and turned twice (paragraphs 23 and final), and its broken state ("no teeth remained for it to catch") is causally active: the first turn triggers the sanctuary shift, the second produces the internal note despite external silence. The broken pin is specified and its failure to catch is dramatized ("Metal scraped once, then the cylinder stuttered"). The object's evolution—from wrong/incomplete presence to metaphor ("remembers songs even when silence shreds its machinery") to final proof that the body holds truth when mechanism fails—charges the closure image. Irreplaceable: a working music box or generic object could not carry the same weight. Cost: turning the broken key forces acknowledgment that repair is internal, not mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Shifting grace" appears obliquely as the sanctuary's reality-shifts ("the floor rippled like pond water; the walls bent outward and inward") and Ilen's description ("it curls and uncurls to expose the knots we hide"). The concept shapes tactics: the protagonist cannot escape or argue away the body's memory when the room forces confrontation. However, "grace" itself is not named or made legible as a stake—"shifting" does the mechanical work, while "grace" remains thematic. The sanctuary's method is present across setup (paragraph 3 "walls shimmered as if they were trapped horizons"), development (the car-memory forced replay), and payoff (the room steadies after the realization). Cost: the shifting traps her in the memory until she stops resisting. Ceiling: the "grace" half of the concept is under-integrated; "shifting reality" carries the pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Reappears when needed" is stated in paragraph 26 ("The sanctuary reappears when needed, always different, always perfectly wrong for the excuses we bring") but not dramatized as a constraint. The text does not show the sanctuary having vanished and returned; we see one continuous visit. The attribute is told rather than enacted, and its mechanics do not alter the protagonist's tactics on the page. It serves thematic resonance (the idea that help arrives when readiness meets need) but does not drive a turn. Present in middle development as exposition; absent from closure. Swappable with "always available" or "appears to those who seek" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Convince" is the core action from paragraph 7 ("I had come because he promised to help me stop hating my brother") and paragraph 18 ("Today I will convince you to lay down what you carry"). Ilen's entire method—handing the box, orchestrating the reality-shift, explaining cellular memory, waiting through her resistance—is tactical persuasion. The protagonist's final choice to turn the key again and allow the internal note is the moment she is convinced, not by argument but by embodied proof. Two major turns trace to this action: the sanctuary shift (Ilen's setup) and the protagonist's acceptance (the payoff of his campaign). Cost: Ilen's method risks failure ("I did not believe him"), and the protagonist pays by relinquishing her defensive narrative. Indispensable: remove "convince" and the piece becomes passive observation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Through cellular memory" is named in paragraph 29 ("The method is through cellular memory") and enacted in the car-replay sequence where "my tissues already carry every verdict they can bear" and "the body knows the direction of impact, the angle of absence." The mechanics are signaled (the sanctuary accesses bodily memory rather than conscious narrative) and matter: the protagonist's cells "remember the lies I had taught" them, and the correction happens at tissue level ("one muscle at a time"). However, the method is introduced at the 40% mark and its mechanics are asserted more than demonstrated—we see the effect (corrected memory) but not the means (how the sanctuary reads cells). Present in development and payoff, absent from setup. Cost: the method bypasses her conscious defenses, forcing confrontation she cannot argue away.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary is introduced in paragraph 1, shapes every beat (silence that "tightened around thought itself," walls that shift to "expose the knots we hide"), and supplies the resource (reality-shifts triggered by the music box) that forces the protagonist's memory correction. The setting is causally active: its physics prevent escape or evasion, and its mechanics (no echo, air trembling without sound, walls as "trapped horizons") constrain her choices to endure the cellular-memory sequence. Spatial properties (cross-legged seating, the box between them, the floor rippling, walls trading places with air) are tracked and integral. The sanctuary participates in closure: when "the sanctuary steadied," the protagonist's acceptance is complete. Irreplaceable: a generic therapy room could not trigger or contain the reality-shift.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"While reality shifts" is the timeframe anchor from paragraph 9 ("While reality shifts, they said, the sanctuary reveals its truest work") and governs the entire car-memory sequence. The shifts occur on-page across paragraphs 24–35, and their duration brackets the protagonist's confrontation: she cannot leave until the sanctuary "steadied" (paragraph 36). The timeframe tightens decisions—she must endure the replay rather than flee—and alters tactics by removing the option of verbal argument. However, the clock is qualitative (the shifts' duration) rather than quantitative, and no precise limit is tested. Present in setup (paragraph 9 foreshadows), development (the shifts occur), and payoff (they resolve). Cost: while reality shifts, she is trapped in the memory and cannot escape the body's truth.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To teach resentment to release" is Ilen's stated motivation (paragraph 19: "my work is to teach resentment to release") and is dramatized through his tactical patience, the orchestrated music-box trigger, and his refusal to argue ("We will not argue about justice"). His desire is in friction with the protagonist's resistance ("nothing he could say would change what my brother had done"), creating pressure. The motivation shapes two beats: his decision to hand her the broken box and his explanation of cellular memory after the shift begins. Cost: his method depends on her willingness to turn the key, a risk he accepts. The motivation is present in development and payoff but not strongly signaled in setup (he is introduced as "scheming pacifist" but his specific goal arrives later). Swappability test: "to heal trauma" or "to facilitate forgiveness" would require only minor edits, though "teach resentment to release" is more tactical and specific.</comment>
