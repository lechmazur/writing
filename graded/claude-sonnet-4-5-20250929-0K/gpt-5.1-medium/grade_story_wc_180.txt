<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mender's motivation is clear and rooted in a specific parental failure: signing a contract that betrayed his daughter's dreams. Internal conflict manifests through the tension between his trade (glass-mending) and his daughter's vision (grafting life from ruin), and the ribbon becomes an embodied tether to regret. The final bargain with the trees—offering caretaking until her return—is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of enforced ownership with felt cost. Minor slip: the daughter's voice in the final rustle reads slightly convenient, though it lands as possibility rather than certainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered reflections on contract versus vow, culminating in the protagonist's spoken bargain with the orchard and the petal-rain response. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise meets Earned Stasis): he commits to tending without ownership, the trees respond, and the final image of his daughter's voice in the rustling reweights prior material with conceptual cost—he cannot reclaim her, only steward the space she might return to. Orientation is clear by the opening beat (cathedral, orchard, breach of contract). One meaningful deepening occurs when he shifts from passive regret to active caretaking.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The orchard-in-cathedral setting is vivid and purposeful: branches through stained glass and buckled flagstones embody the feral consequence of the broken contract. The mender's repair bag (cracked lens, copper wire, lead strip) functions as micro-setting, constraining his attempts to bridge his trade with his daughter's grammar. The ribbon tied to the watchful trunk charges the final image when the orchard "hushed" in response. Minor gap: the apple's mirrored vision feels slightly detached from the immediate spatial choreography, though it serves thematic closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom and undoing the contract's harm—is signaled early and tightens when the mender refuses the bankers, tearing the contract and making the orchard feral. His shift from passive regret to active caretaking (pruning, apologizing, tying the ribbon, offering a new bargain) constitutes meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible: he cannot retrieve his daughter, only steward a space she may never return to, and the petal-rain acceptance reweights prior failure. The breach of contract and its consequences drive all subsequent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between "contracts chiseled forever" and "deciduous vows...shed like leaves, renewed each season." The mender's arc—from enforcing permanence through glass repair to accepting seasonal, renewable promises—is inextricable from the thematic question. The apple's vision offers a resonant, non-literal answer: possibility rather than fate, wisdom composted from mistakes. The final image (petal-rain, daughter's impatient voice in rustling) reweights the opening without stating a moral. No overt thesis statements; the phrase "deciduous vows" is integrated through action and image rather than declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, and the mender's perceptual signature—filtering the world through repair metaphors ("coax fractures into alignment," "grammar" of trees)—is consistent and character-specific. Diction matches his trade background ("quartz-eye," "lead counterweight") and emotional state; under peak stress (offering the bargain aloud, feeling foolish) the voice compresses without losing texture. The daughter is rendered through reported speech and vision, maintaining clean focalization. Minor slip: "endearingly feisty" appears twice in identical phrasing, a small voice tic that feels slightly templated but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer contemplative lines giving way to clipped action during the pruning sequence. Two patterns warrant attention: "endearingly feisty" appears twice identically, and the phrase "deciduous vows" recurs three times, the third instance ("We could abandon ironclad contracts and learn instead from deciduous vows") bordering on expository summary. The closure image is clean and propulsive, and there are no paraphrase loops. No filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The core synthesis—cathedral orchard, glass-mender father, root-grafting daughter, contracts versus seasonal vows—is specific and non-obvious. The mender's trade (repair of the broken) contrasts sharply with his daughter's ethos (coaxing life from ruin), and the premise explores this friction through the failed contract and feral orchard without resorting to neat reconciliation. The apple-as-mirror and petal-rain response feel inevitable in hindsight, rooted in the orchard's established agency. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative structure and the ending's refusal to deliver reunion, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation of "deciduous vows" from metaphor to enacted choice elevates originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The quartz-eye mender is present throughout and drives key turns: signing the contract (backstory inciting event), tearing it (making the orchard feral), and offering the new bargain to the trees (closure choice). His decisions alter tactics on the page—using repair tools to tend rather than fix, tying the ribbon, speaking aloud—and the final petal-rain directly responds to his caretaking offer. Early setup, middle pruning beat, and closure participation all present. Causal pressure and irreplaceability are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The daughter's hair ribbon appears in three beats: introduced in the mender's pocket (signal of courage and loss), tied around the watchful trunk (purposeful action that triggers the orchard's hush), and implicitly reweighted in the final petal-rain and vision. Its function evolves from talisman to offering, and the orchard's response charges the closure. Early setup, middle use, closure linkage all present. Visible cost: he surrenders the relic to the trees, bridging his trade with her vision.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Deciduous vows" is introduced early ("a kind of deciduous vows whispered between stone and sap") and frames the protagonist's shift from contracts to seasonal promises. It shapes the final bargain: "We could abandon ironclad contracts and learn instead from deciduous vows, accepting that promises must fall and regrow to stay alive." The concept reweights the stakes—he offers caretaking without ownership, accepting renewal over permanence. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure thought. Cost is conceptual: he renounces control. Minor deduction for one line that borders on thematic summary rather than dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" describes the daughter in two identical phrasings: once in backstory (her declaration she would never mend glass) and once in the apple's vision (scolding and laughing). The trait is label-dominant; its effect on her choices (leaving, teaching children) is told rather than dramatized on the page. The repetition charges the final image but does not constrain a present beat. Present in setup and closure vision, but middle beat is absent. Swappable with "spirited" or "stubborn" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Persist" is enacted through the mender's sequence of small, clumsy kindnesses: pruning, apologizing, tying the ribbon, offering the bargain. The action is signaled ("I began to persist with small, clumsy kindnesses") and shapes multiple beats—his refusal to accept the bankers' terms, his tending of the feral orchard, and his final spoken offer. The orchard's petal-rain response directly follows his persistence. Early signal, middle beats, closure linkage. Cost: he accepts labor without guaranteed reunion. Minor deduction for the verb "persist" appearing in summary form rather than fully embodied throughout.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The forgotten bag contents (cracked lens, copper wire, lead strip) appear in one extended beat: "To reach the higher branches, I rummaged through my old repair bag, using forgotten bag contents as though they were relics from another lifetime." The items become makeshift tools (magnifier, ladder of hooks, counterweight) that enable pruning, a causal step toward tending. Mechanics are clear and specific. Setup is late (second half), middle use is present, closure linkage is indirect (tending leads to bargain). Cost: he repurposes repair tools for grafting logic, a small but visible shift. Cap at 6.9 for late introduction and single-beat use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lush orchard in the cathedral rafters is introduced in the opening beat and drives multiple turns: the bankers' demand triggers the contract breach, the feral growth (branches through windows, buckled flagstones) embodies consequence, and the orchard's final petal-rain response occurs within this setting. The space pressures choices—he must work within the cathedral's vertical limits, use the rafters' geography—and the contrast between stone (his past) and sap (her future) charges the closure. Early setup, middle pressure, closure participation. Irreplaceable: no other setting could anchor the contract/vow metaphor as concretely.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the breach of contract" frames the entire narrative window: the orchard is already feral, the bankers and bishop are absent, and the mender's return is motivated by regret and the urge to bridge generational wisdom. The timeframe tightens his options—he cannot undo the breach, only tend the aftermath—and the finality of "after" shapes the elegiac tone. Present in setup and implicit throughout. Cost is legible: he cannot reclaim the pre-breach state. Minor deduction: the timeframe does not create a live ticking clock that alters mid-scene tactics; it functions as a static frame rather than escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To bridge generational wisdom" is stated early ("I had come back for one reason only...the stubborn urge to bridge generational wisdom") and dramatized through the mender's shift from glass repair to orchard tending. The motivation drives his choices: using the ribbon, pruning in her style, offering a new bargain. Friction is present—he cannot speak her "grammar" instinctively—and cost is visible: he must labor without guarantee of reunion. Early signal, middle beats (tending sequence), closure participation (bargain and petal-rain). The apple's vision of her teaching children embodies the bridging as possibility, not certainty.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Accidental wisdom" is woven throughout: the mender's realization that "promises must fall and regrow" arises from tending the feral orchard rather than deliberate insight, and the final rustle carries "my daughter's impatient voice, mocking my accidental wisdom for arriving years later than it should have." Tone is elegiac yet wry, matching the protagonist's self-awareness. It modulates with pressure—contemplative during backstory, urgent during tending, resigned yet hopeful at closure. The closing line charges the effect: wisdom arrives late and incomplete, a cost acknowledged on the page. Coherent through turns, present in final image.</comment>
