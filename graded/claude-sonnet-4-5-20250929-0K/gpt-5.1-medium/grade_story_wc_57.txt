<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eli's interiority remains specific—he kneels in snow, traces rope with calluses, seeks preservation methods—and his final stance feels earned through prior contemplation. The piece avoids diagnostic labels, embodying perception through concrete actions (holding fulgurite to lantern, testing knots). However, the protagonist's emotional progression lacks genuine contradiction; he moves smoothly from curiosity to understanding without friction or self-deception. The final bow is credible but too frictionless; the story would benefit from a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost rather than peaceful acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly in opening lines (Eli, harbor dock, snow). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: "felt the seeds and knots of the world turn slowly toward another spring" crystallizes the stakes with undeniable pressure, reweighting preservation as an act of listening rather than collecting. The woman's appearance and instruction provide the final tightening, narrowing Eli's understanding to "what holds fast." Cost is felt (he must now listen differently, commit to rope as well as seed) but the price remains oblique rather than sharp—no path is visibly foreclosed on the page, only redirected.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The golden dock, snow, fog, and lantern create consistent atmospheric pressure. The fulgurite glass constrains Eli's perception, acting as a lens that illuminates rope patterns, thus affecting his interpretive choices. The harbor's "oceanic hush" and fog rolling thick modulate sensory hierarchy, narrowing focus as Eli slips deeper into the rope's language. Spatial choreography (dock end, mooring post, lantern, rope coil) tracks cleanly. The final image charges the dock-under-snow with thematic weight, and the setting's recursive description ("golden dock under snow" appears three times) anchors the closure without becoming ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (to preserve ancient methods by learning secret weavers' art) is signaled early and tightens when Eli realizes stories have fled into hemp. The rope-decoding beat narrows his understanding and forces a shift from passive collection to active listening. The woman's arrival provides a turn—her instruction reweights his approach, demanding gentleness and purpose. Cost is present (he must alter his methods, tend cord as well as seed) but felt rather than decisive; no live option is visibly foreclosed, only deepened. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful pressure-point (the knot revelation) suffices, but the escalation remains contemplative rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (preservation as listening, memory in humble materials) emerges through particulars: seeds as "tiny hardened questions," knots as refuge for stories, fulgurite as lightning-memory. The rope's "slow speech" and the woman's "touching the rope, then the satchel" offer concrete thematic linkage without moralizing. The final line provides a resonant answer—preservation means tending what holds fast—without stating a thesis. Subtext operates cleanly in the woman's sparse dialogue and Eli's shift from collection to coaxing. The piece avoids thematic echo; no character articulates the premise in prompt language, and the ending reweights prior material through image rather than summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Eli's perceptual signature (calluses listening, awareness of seed definitions, philosophical framing) is consistent and character-specific. Diction stays controlled: "memory had taken refuge," "half-mocking tales," "chill mornings and generations of bent backs." The woman's dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("Keep listening to what holds fast"). Brief figurative density ("fog rolled across the harbor like a slow thought," "stories...fled into hemp and twist") fits the contemplative register without overwhelming. Distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the knot-reading beat. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches Eli's knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in key beats (fulgurite-lit rope, knot-images). However, paraphrase loops appear: "fog rolling across the harbor" recurs three times with minimal variation, and "golden dock under snow" appears identically twice in close proximity without pattern-taught justification. Template cadence is present in middle paragraphs ("He had been told...," "If that were true...," "With his free hand...") that flatten propulsion. Figurative language is generally coherent, but "fog...like a slow thought" borders on abstraction. No severe artifacts touch closure, so caps do not apply, but the loops and stems lower the score within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed collection, fulgurite as interpretive lens, and knot-reading as textual preservation feels specific and non-obvious. The premise avoids template plots; combining ancient methods, secret weavers, and rope-as-story is fresh in combination. Emotional truth (the patient labor of preservation, the humility of tending cord) grounds the concept. The final image—seeds and knots turning toward spring—resonates as earned closure. However, the woman's dissolution back into fog verges on familiar mystical-guide tropes, and the fulgurite's convenience (it reveals patterns exactly when needed) slightly undercuts inevitability. Risk-taking in structure and voice is present but measured.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eli (philosophical seed collector) is present throughout and makes the choice to kneel, study the rope, and shift his approach after the woman's instruction. He appears in opening, middle beats (rope decoding), and closure. His role as collector frames his motive and final stance. However, his choices are contemplative observations rather than high-stakes turns; the story would function similarly if he were a "wandering archivist" or "memory keeper." Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (his choice to listen alters closure stance) +0.8, closure linkage (final realization) +0.9, swappability −0.6. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. Band 5.0–6.9.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fulgurite glass appears early (carried from cliff hut), is used actively in the rope-decoding beat (held to lantern, illuminates patterns), and is present at closure (woman's eyes reflect its "restless glimmer"). Three distinct beats: introduction, instrumental use, and closure reprise. Its unique property (frozen lightning as lens) enables the interpretive turn. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (without it, rope patterns remain invisible) +1.2, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.6, ornamental final mention (glimmer reflected, not used) −0.3. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. Band 5.0–6.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Secret weavers are mentioned early (cliff hut woman's tale), shape Eli's search on the dock, and inform his realization that stories live in knots. The concept drives his interpretive attempt and the woman's identity/instruction. Early signal +0.5, two beats (dock search, woman's arrival) +0.9, causal pressure (belief in weavers motivates decoding) +0.9, closure linkage (woman embodies the concept) +1.0, swappability (could be "hidden storytellers" or "memory keepers") −0.5. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. Band 5.0–6.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" appears twice as direct label: "infinitely patient, braiding time" (describing weavers) and "infinitely patient as the dock grew whiter" (describing Eli). The trait enables Eli's long knot-study without rushing, a meaningful on-page action. However, no visible cost or trade-off is shown—patience is pure advantage here. Early signal +0.4, one beat (knot study) +0.4, causal pressure (patience enables decoding) +0.7, closure linkage (stance at end) +0.5, label-only trait (no embodied friction or price) −0.6, ornamental use (second mention decorative) −0.4. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff (oblique). Band 5.0–6.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Coax" appears three times: coaxing epics from silence (told method), coaxing images from rope (Eli's action), and the woman's instruction to "let nothing be pulled taut without purpose." The action drives the middle beat and closure. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (method of interpretation) +1.0, closure linkage (woman echoes the verb conceptually) +0.8, swappability (could be "decode" or "read" with minor edits) −0.6. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. Band 5.0–6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Decoding knot patterns in fisherman's rope is signaled early (tavern tales), enacted in the central beat (Eli traces loops/crossings, sees images), and validated at closure (woman touches the rope, confirms the method). The mechanics matter: fulgurite illuminates, knots flare, memories rise. Early signal +0.6, two beats (rope study, woman's touch) +0.9, causal pressure (method enables the turn) +1.3, closure linkage +1.1, specificity (rope properties and knot types are detailed) +0.7, swappability −0.4. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. Band 5.0–6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Golden dock under snow is present throughout: opening anchor, repeated twice in body, and final closure image. The dock's physicality (boards tar-black beneath frost, mooring post, lantern) provides spatial grounding. The setting constrains Eli's focus (rope at dock's end) and charges the final moment ("stood alone on the golden dock"). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (spatial constraint focuses study) +0.8, closure linkage (final stance location) +1.2, specificity (golden glow, frost, mooring details) +0.6, repetition without evolution −0.4. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. Band 7.0–8.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Fog rolling across the harbor appears four times as atmospheric frame and twice as metaphor for time loosening. The timeframe is present but does not tighten decisions—Eli's study proceeds without urgency, and the woman's arrival is untimed. The phrase recurs but does not create a live clock or escalate pressure. Early signal +0.5, multiple mentions (atmospheric, not causal) +0.4, no causal pressure (fog complicates visibility, not options) +0.2, closure linkage (final image includes fog/breathing harbor) +0.5, ornamental repetition −0.5, vague tracking (no sense of elapsed minutes or urgency) −0.6. Setup ✓, Development (weak), Payoff ✓. Band 3.0–4.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To preserve ancient methods is stated early, drives Eli's dock search, and is reweighted at closure (preservation now means tending cord, not only seed). The motivation is dramatized through his choices (kneeling, tracing knots, listening) and conflicted by the realization that methods live in unexpected places. Early signal +0.7, two beats (dock arrival, rope study) +0.9, causal pressure (desire shapes his interpretive attempt) +1.1, closure linkage (final stance embodies expanded preservation) +1.0, friction (must alter approach, accept new forms) +0.4, told-only in opening paragraph −0.3. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. Band 5.0–6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Oceanic hush" appears twice as direct phrase and is sustained through fog, breath imagery, and quiet dialogue throughout. Tone is coherent, modulates subtly (contemplative opening, focused middle, resonant close), and charges the final image (harbor breathing, seeds and knots turning). The hush supports the closure's quiet power without stasis. Early signal +0.6, three beats (opening, middle fog, closure breath) +1.4, causal pressure (tone enables patience and listening as tactics) +0.9, closure linkage (final line rhythm echoes oceanic cadence) +1.3, specificity (hush as absence, not mere silence) +0.5, static mid-section (tone does not escalate, only sustains) −0.3. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. Band 7.0–8.4.</comment>
