<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Aurek's motivation is consistently rendered through embodied action—his counter-clockwise clocks, his careful dissection of the yoyo, his kneeling at the hunger stone—and his interiority carries a specific texture of weariness and resolve ("despair was only a clock that never changed its hands"). The renunciation of despair and the final casting of the yoyo represent a credible shift earned by prior causality. Minor weakness: the buyers and "people whose lives had already shattered" remain abstractions; grounding one concrete prior client encounter would have sharpened the stakes, but the cost at closure is visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Causal spine. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the boatman's refusal. The yoyo dissection provides a meaningful causal turn that narrows options, and the final casting delivers Charged Poise—the lighthouse trembles, "answering with a future still unwritten," reweighting all prior material with undeniable pressure and cost (he has irreversibly engaged the mechanism). One cap consideration: the "hunger stone" premise is seeded late in exposition rather than dramatized early, creating mild setup debt, but closure remains legible and the cost unmistakable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse interior (brass, numbered stairs, round chamber with jagged crack) and the hunger stone itself constrain Aurek's choices at every beat: the backward knob, the yoyo niche, the crack over which he casts the device. The tide's exhale is tracked and pressures the descent. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"basalt shining with a faint, latent radiance," the smell of "rust, brine, and old prayers"—and filtered through Aurek's watchmaker's eye. The final spatial move (casting the yoyo into the void) charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate test cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: "step beyond fate's design" by accessing the hunger stone's foresight. The dissection of the yoyo provides one meaningful tightening (rotating the shard to release rather than pool force), and the final casting escalates pressure with a visible cost—Aurek has engaged an irreversible mechanism with unknown consequence. Agency is clear throughout (descent, dissection, final action). Minor limitation: the middle beats (stair descent, yoyo discovery) feel more atmospheric than pressured; a second micro-reversal or visible loss (tool failure, physical injury) would have sharpened escalation into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—stepping beyond or through despair and fate's fixed design—emerges from concrete particulars: the counter-clockwise clocks, the hunger stone's warning ("If you see me, despair"), the yoyo's hoarded momentum. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: exhilaration and bleakness coexist as the lighthouse trembles with "a future still unwritten." The yoyo functions as a purposeful motif that reweights meaning at closure rather than token recurrence. Subtext operates cleanly in the geometry of reversal (backward clocks, descent as ascent, falling that returns). One slip: "despair was only a clock that never changed its hands" edges toward thematic echo but is specific enough to the protagonist's idiom to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Aurek notices "hairline seams," "nested weights and springs," and interprets the tower through a watchmaker's reverse-engineering lens. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon ("portable well," "hoarded momentum"), and psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during dissection, wider during atmospheric descent). Minor register wobble: "bleak exhilaration" in the final line, while evocative, reads slightly elevated compared to prior interiority. No dialogue present, so dialogue bullets are not applied. Elision of the builder's full backstory is purposeful and efficient, keeping focus on present action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively across beats; information density is high (the yoyo description does triple duty: world-building, puzzle, and thematic charge). Clarity is strong in the dissection sequence and spatial choreography. Weakness: template cadence appears in the stair-descent section—multiple "he [verb]" stems across adjacent sentences—and a minor paraphrase loop occurs around "hunger stone" exposition (paragraphs 6–8 restate its nature without added pressure). The loop and stem-run combine for −0.6 in this category. Figurative language ("rotting jaw," "held breath") is coherent and serves voice, avoiding overwriting. No filter-verb stacks or closure-beat artifacts, keeping the penalty localized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of counter-clockwise clock-making, hunger-stone folklore, and reverse-engineering a puzzle yoyo feels specific and non-obvious; the story commits fully to its premise without retreat. The "falling that returns" concept and the numbered-descending staircase offer fresh inflections on recursion and reversal. Minor derivative pressure: the "mysterious lighthouse / ancient mechanism / lone seeker" template is widely used, but transformation through the watchmaker's idiom and the yoyo's concrete mechanics restores originality. Risk-taking in the elliptical backstory and accumulative pacing heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a small within-band lift (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening line; drives three key beats (arrival, yoyo dissection, final casting); all major turns trace to his choices under pressure. The watchmaker trait enables the reverse-engineering and charges the final image with his specific idiom.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Seeded early (paragraph 6), handled in two distinct beats (discovery at the chamber, fitting the yoyo), and causally active at closure where it anchors the mechanism and the final casting reweights its "worse futures" warning. The carved words and the shallow cup demonstrate irreplaceability; removing it breaks story logic. Cost is legible (engaging an irreversible transformation).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept appears in multiple images (basalt's "latent radiance," the shard's hum, the final trembling), shaping atmosphere and thematic resonance. It constrains one tactical choice (recognizing the shard as the yoyo's core) but does not narrow options elsewhere. Present early and charged at closure, meeting two gates, but causal pressure remains moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phrase "neatly inventive hands" appears once as atmospheric description (unseen polishing) but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. It colors tone without altering tactics. Label-only mention trends low; no middle development or closure participation visible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The initiation (casting the yoyo over the crack) is the story's climactic action, seeded by the builder's notes and prepared by the dissection. It redefines all prior moves, delivering the closure beat with unmistakable cost and irreversibility. Removing or swapping it dismantles the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Signaled early (builder's sketches, "reverse-engineering" vocabulary), executed on-page through the yoyo dissection (one full beat of causal work), and its mechanics—rotating the shard to release force—directly enable the final initiation. The method shapes two distinct beats and the closure, demonstrating high integration and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse pressures every choice: the backward knob (entry constraint), the numbered-descending stairs (descent logic), the yoyo niche (fitting requirement), and the crack over the sea (final casting site). The round chamber and hunger stone anchor the closure image. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) also constrains throughout. Essential across all three gates with strong causal participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The low tide signals urgency ("receding tide unveiled the hunger stone"), shapes the descent window, and provides atmospheric pressure ("the sea withdraw like a held breath"). It appears in two distinct beats (arrival, chamber) and tightens the stakes by making the stone accessible. Not a ticking clock that alters moment-to-moment tactics, but it does constrain the larger decision frame and charges the final image ("the sea did not pause").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stated early, dramatized through the counter-clockwise clocks and the choice to seek the hunger stone, and tested at closure when he renounces despair ("despair was only a clock that never changed its hands") and casts the yoyo with visible cost. Friction between his weariness and resolve appears in micro-choices (kneeling, "some thin seam between fear and resolve"). Present across all three gates with strong causal and thematic linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The tone braids bleakness (hunger stone's warning, "worse futures," "rotting jaw") with exhilaration (the "bleak exhilaration" final line, the trembling lighthouse, "future still unwritten") coherently across all beats. It modulates with pressure—weariness during descent, focus during dissection, charged release at closure—and charges the final image without flattening into a single static mood. Present and purposeful throughout.</comment>
