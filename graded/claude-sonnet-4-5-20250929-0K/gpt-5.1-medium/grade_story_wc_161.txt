<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Noel's interiority is concrete and character-specific—using dust motes to plan routes shows contradiction between mysticism and guilt-driven avoidance. The woman's arrival forces a choice, and his final act of writing the song embodies change with visible cost (releasing what he's hoarded). Minor slip: the sister's belief in "falling stones" feels slightly over-articulated for the moment, brushing against thematic echo. Internal conflict is embodied throughout, particularly in the balance metaphor that recurs with shifting weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis transitioning to Decisive Change: Noel writes and sends the unfinished song, foreclosing his hermetic refuge with felt cost. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—dust, meteorite, pigeons, and song fragments build density until the woman's arrival forces the pattern to break and crystallize. Causality is clean: the woman's return visits and the sister's death anchor the final act. One weak seam: "Across learning to trust again" is vague timeframe compression that could anchor more concretely, but the payoff recovers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The attic functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: warped floorboard, single skylight column, and caged pigeons all pressure Noel's balance ritual and route-planning method. The Mars meteorite chip on the trunk recurs with reweighted meaning—first as refuge from mistakes, then recognized by the woman as part of his former philosophy, charging the closure. Sensory hierarchy matches POV: dust, light, and feathers filter through his focus on erasure and reinvention. No occupation-depth issues at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving lost songs while avoiding past guilt—is signaled early and tightens when the woman refuses to leave, forcing Noel to confront the Rialto fire and his role. The tightening is earned: her repeated visits narrow his avoidance tactics until writing the song becomes the only honest act. Cost is visible: he releases the melody he's hoarded, ending his hermetic reinvention. One micro-turn (her recognizing the meteorite) sets up the final choice without diluting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—trust as unfinished song expecting the next note despite ruin—emerges from concrete particulars: dust-mote navigation, Mars chip as relic older than mistakes, pigeons named after lost melodies. The woman's return and the final act of tying the song to a bird offer a resonant answer without stating a moral. "Trust… another word for unfinished song" brushes close to thematic statement but recovers through the sister's faith and Noel's embodied choice. The final image reweights prior material with quiet, earned pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Noel notices balance, dust currents, "delayed flame of memory," filtering the world through musical and evasive metaphor. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Two weak spots: "Trust, he realized, was another word for unfinished song" slips into over-articulated insight, and the woman's dialogue sometimes carries expo-weight ("They say you wrote it") rather than full subtext. Rhythm modulates well under pressure, particularly in the shorter beats after her arrival.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two penalties: "a forgotten lung above the city" and "slow trumpet" push elevated diction without full grounding in Noel's craftsman POV, risking mild register drift. Line "mapping the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight" repeats the method twice in close proximity, a minor loop. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Information density is high and propulsion is sustained. Clarity at closure is untouched.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—guilt-haunted musician using pigeons to smuggle melody fragments through a city score, guided by dust—is specific and non-obvious. The Mars meteorite as anchor older than mistakes adds fresh dimension. Risk is present in the dust-mote navigation method and the woman's refusal to leave, both heightening stakes without gimmickry. The premise transforms the "redemption through art" template via the charged particularity of pigeons, meteorite, and unfinished song, making removal of any element structurally harmful.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Noel's role as courier pigeon trainer shapes his avoidance tactics (teaching routes to preserve lost songs) and the final decision to send the written melody. Present in setup, middle navigation ritual, and closure. The specificity of the role enables the ending's logic. Solid causal work across beats but the trainer mechanics could press harder in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mars meteorite chip appears early on the trunk, reappears when the woman recognizes it and links it to Noel's past philosophy ("falling stones"), and its weight/age theme threads through his need for something older than mistakes. Two-beat involvement with thematic charge, but it does not directly enable a tactic or constrain a choice—lyric reprise that reweights without full causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paper trails live downstairs as backstory anchoring his mistakes (invoices, settlement letters) and contrast the attic reinvention. The concept is present and thematically consistent but does not alter on-page tactics or choices; it remains atmospheric context. Mentioned in setup, not developed in action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reinvents personal history" is embodied throughout: naming birds after lost songs, using dust to plan routes, trying to forget "Noel Harrow." It constrains his response to the woman's arrival (resistance, then collapse) and the final act of writing the song ends the reinvention with visible cost. Present across setup, middle avoidance, and closure. Strong integration with the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Balance appears early as physical metaphor (warped floorboard, meteorite tilting his stance) and recurs when the woman's presence destabilizes his equilibrium. It charges the tonal texture but does not drive a major turn—Noel's final choice stems more from the woman's persistence and his guilt than from the balance motif. Lyric accent rather than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dust-mote navigation is signaled early, shown in action ("mapping the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight"), and its ridiculousness is acknowledged as "the only honest compass." It shapes his route-planning method and symbolizes his mystical avoidance. Present in setup and middle ritual; the final act implicitly abandons it, creating closure tension. Mechanics matter on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vintage bookshop attic constrains all action: cages, warped floorboard, single skylight, trunk with meteorite. The setting pressures Noel's balance ritual and isolates him until the woman climbs the wrong staircase. The confined space makes the woman's refusal to leave more invasive, raising stakes. Micro-setting that alters tactics and charges the final image of sending the bird from that attic window.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Across learning to trust again" is vague and lacks a live clock. The timeframe compresses multiple visits into summary ("she kept returning") rather than tracking discrete scenes with escalating pressure. The progression is legible—resistance to collaboration to final release—but the elasticity weakens urgency. Time reweights meaning at closure but does not tighten tactics beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The desire to preserve lost songs drives every choice: naming birds, smuggling melody bars, avoiding the woman, and finally writing the unfinished song. The motivation is dramatized in action and friction (hoarding vs. releasing). It conflicts with his guilt and need to forget, creating genuine tension. Visible cost when he ties the song to a bird and releases it, ending his preservation-as-erasure cycle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone oscillates between withering (forgotten lung, brittle glue, delayed flame) and blooming (cooing overlap as withering promise that still bloomed, dusk as drifting ink). The duality charges the final image and modulates with pressure—heaviest after the woman's arrival, lifting slightly at closure. Coherent and purposeful, though "withering promise that still bloomed" states the effect rather than fully embodying it in image alone.</comment>
