<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Jonas's prosopagnosia is embodied through his methodical grid-work and his distinct way of "reading" people by motion rather than features (Rhea by heel-dig, shoulder-square). The interiority avoids label-speak and shows contradictory impulses: he paints to "awaken dormant empathy" yet admits "faces failed him" while "gestures never lied." His methodical trait drives on-page choices (mixing paint slowly, organizing blindness into sight) and the final stance—continuing to paint as the stone slips—feels earned. Minor: the secondary goal of mapping compassion through visitor behavior is told more than shown, and Rhea's pressure on him is minimal, limiting relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—details and gestures accumulate toward a resonant final image. Orientation anchors (Jonas, quarry, mist, detective case) arrive by the second paragraph. The closure unit is Charged Poise: the stone slipping beyond the mist as Jonas completes the portrait's dignity, crystallizing his method and the case's open stakes with undeniable pressure. Cost is felt (thirteen years, hollow file, the waiting itself) but not decisively paid on the page; the turn is more deepening than tightening. One meaningful intensification occurs when the ribbon's memory triggers the portrait and Jonas explains his exhibition theory to Rhea, narrowing his tactic from passive observation to active image-making.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The quarry mist, gravel, and floodlight halos create a coherent sensory envelope filtered through Jonas's disordered face-sense (mist "turning...pale moons, their halos bleeding"). The ribbon fragment in the evidence bag is handled twice (initial viewing, then painted onto canvas) and its satin angle charges the final image by conferring "weary, stubborn dignity" on the victim. The folding table, easel, and Rhea's flashlight beam supply micro-setting that constrains Jonas's work in real time. Spatial choreography (quarry rim, stone slip) remains clear. Minor: the thirteen-year timeframe and the phrase "furrowed hush" recur but do not evolve with events.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: solving the cold case by awakening empathy through portraiture. Pressure accumulates through Jonas's methodical painting, his explanation of past confessions triggered by his work, and the stone slip that signals possible witness presence. The tightening is more textural than causal—no on-page reversal or forced choice—but the ribbon's reweighting (from "party trash" to dignified memorial) narrows the emotional frame and raises implicit cost. Agency is attentional endurance (Jonas paints "until the ribbon...seemed to flutter") rather than decision. The escalation is density-driven, consistent with the Accumulative lens, but lacks a second beat that alters tactics or forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—art as witness and the limits of empathy in the face of absence—emerges through Jonas's grid-work, the hollow file, and his belief that "images could travel where arguments failed." The final image (ribbon conferring dignity, stone slip as potential answer) offers a non-literal resolution: justice may be atmospheric invitation rather than juridical certainty. The ribbon's transformation from dismissed evidence to person-proxy enacts "unifying opposites" (victim/viewer, absence/presence). Subtext operates in gesture (Rhea's heel-dig skepticism, Jonas's slow stirring as "layers of time") and the piece resists moralizing. Minor: the phrase "lance the armored hide of a conscience" borders on overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Jonas's perceptual signature (motion over features, arrangements of shadow/light) is distinct and consistent. Voice modulates with the scene's contemplative pressure without artifice. Rhea's dialogue ("Do you always paint on site?") carries natural skepticism and her physicality (boots crunching, flashlight beam) distinguishes her without head-hopping. Filter verbs ("he remembered," "he believed") fit the reflective mode. Minor: some elevated diction ("prosopagnosia," "lance," "dormant empathy") edges outside a purely embodied register in peak beats, and one line—"very methodical even in that"—reads as meta-commentary on the prompt attribute rather than organic voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high (grid-work, ribbon fragment, visitor hand-hovering) and most lines advance character or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully; the opening ("mist rose...curling like breath") and closing ("stone slipped") frame the piece cleanly. Two areas lower the score: (1) mild paraphrase loops—"methodical" appears three times in similar constructions ("He was very methodical," "very methodical even in that"), and "furrowed hush" recurs identically without reweighting; (2) one mixed metaphor—"lance the armored hide of a conscience that had grown comfortable in the dark" conflates surgical precision with animal hide and spatial comfort. These touch non-closure beats; the final image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—face-blind portrait artist painting cold-case crime scenes to trigger confessions—is fresh and tightly synthesized with Jonas's methodical grid system and the ribbon as mnemonic anchor. The quarry setting and the hollow-file constraint avoid stock detective templates. The turn (ribbon reweighted from trash to dignity) feels earned. Risk: the reflective mode and atmospheric closure require reader trust without a decisive on-page event. Minor: the "unifying opposites" method and empathy-awakening goal are stated more than demonstrated in micro-choices, and the phrase "very methodical" signals prompt compliance rather than organic discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Face-blind portrait artist: setup in para 5 (prosopagnosia explanation); development via grid-work and motion-reading (Rhea's heel-dig); closure linkage through the act of painting the ribbon's dignity. Jonas's disability enables the methodical grid system and his unique witness-reading, driving two beats (initial explanation, visitor hand-hovering theory). Cost: his inability to see faces constrains how he seeks justice (images not interrogation). Specificity is high (arrangements of shadow/light, chords waiting). Swappability: low; remove face-blindness and the grid logic collapses. Positive signals: early +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure link +1.2, specificity +0.6. No major frictions. Total guidance ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Masquerade mask ribbon fragment: setup in para 11 (evidence bag); development in para 12 (Jonas remembers it as "more person than the person"); payoff when he paints it onto the canvas conferring dignity and it "seemed to flutter" in the final third. Appears in three distinct beats (bag viewing, memory trigger, painting act). Causal pressure: the ribbon's reweighting from dismissed "party trash" to memorial anchor drives Jonas's entire portrait and charges the ending. Closure link: the dignity Jonas paints via the ribbon is the story's emotional resolution. Irreplaceable: no other object carries both evidence status and personal-memory weight. Cost: implicit (thirteen-year silence, victim reduced to ribbon). Positive signals: early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.3, closure +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost +0.4. Total guidance ~7.4 (round down).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cold cases: setup in para 3 ("cold cases liked quiet"); timeframe anchor ("Thirteen years...everything important lost"). Development: the hollow file and Rhea's apology shape the constraint (no evidence → Jonas paints memory). Closure: the unresolved stone slip sustains the cold-case openness as thematic payoff. Causal work: the absence of evidence forces Jonas's method and Rhea's reliance on him. Two beats (file intro, exhibition confession theory). Cost: thirteen years and hollowness are felt. Specificity: moderate—"cold" functions more as atmosphere than tactical constraint (no live suspect, no ticking clock that alters moves). Positive signals: early +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal +0.8, closure link +0.9. Friction: more thematic than tactical pressure −0.4. Total guidance ~5.8, round to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Very methodical: setup in para 8 ("He was very methodical about it"); development via grid-making (para 9) and slow paint-mixing (para 13); reprise ("very methodical even in that," para 21). Appears in three beats (trait declaration, grid action, visitor notation). Causal work: the grids and note-taking enable Jonas's blindness-as-sight and organize his witness detection. Cost: the methodical pace contrasts the urgency Rhea might prefer. Specificity: the grid system is irreplaceable. Friction: repetition of "very methodical" reads as label reinforcement rather than embodied constraint at each mention −0.5; the attribute is told more than tested under pressure −0.3. Positive signals: early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +0.9, specificity +0.5. Total guidance ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Lance: setup absent until para 16 ("lance the armored hide of a conscience"). Single mention, no prior seed, no reprise. Development: the verb describes Jonas's theory but does not drive an on-page action—Jonas paints, he does not literally lance. Closure: the stone slip and dignity image do not reference lancing. Causal work: minimal; "lance" is metaphorical gloss on "awaken empathy," which is the true motivation. Swappability: high—replace with "pierce," "penetrate," "reach" without structural loss. Positive signal: causal link to theory +0.3. Frictions: late intro (beyond midpoint) −0.6, ornamental/metaphorical only −0.7, swappable −0.6, summary-only −0.5. Caps: late intro cap 4.6, swappable cap 3.8; use higher of the two per limiter rule → 4.6. Guidance −2.4 from 4.6 base = ~2.2; round to 4.1 acknowledging metaphorical fit to theme lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>By unifying opposites: setup in para 16 ("making the viewer feel both victim and murderer"); no prior seed. Development: the theory explains Jonas's goal but does not shape a middle choice or painting tactic on the page. Closure: the ribbon's dignity and the stone slip imply connection (observer and observed) but "unifying opposites" is not re-invoked or demonstrated through a visible synthesis. Causal work: the phrase frames intent but does not constrain execution. Single mention. Swappability: moderate—"evoking empathy" or "bridging perspectives" could replace with minor edits. Positive signals: theory link +0.4. Frictions: late intro −0.6, single mention, told-only theory −0.6, swappable −0.5. Caps: late intro 4.6, swappable 3.8 → 4.6 limiter. Guidance −1.3 from 4.6 = ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Shadowed quarry in mist: setup in para 1 (opening line); present throughout as spatial anchor. Development: mist thickens (para 22), gravel crunches under Rhea's boots, floodlights create halos, ribbon fragment hides in gravel. Closure: stone slips beyond the mist, signaling possible witness presence and charging the final image. Causal work: the quarry's isolation enables the reflective painting session; the mist's thickening and stone slip add atmospheric pressure. The quarry is irreplaceable as crime-scene return site. Three or more beats (opening, mist evolution, stone slip). Cost: implicit (isolation, cold, years of silence embedded in place). Positive signals: early +0.8, three+ beats +1.4, causal +1.0, closure link +1.3, specificity +0.6. Total guidance ~6.7 (round down from ~6.74).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After the evidence disappears: setup in para 10 ("Thirteen years...everything important lost before I even made detective"). Development: the timeframe explains why Jonas is called (hollow file forces his method). Closure: the thirteen-year gap persists; the stone slip does not resolve it. Causal work: the evidence absence drives the constraint but the "after" moment does not tighten decisions on the page—no live clock, no deadline pressure. Two beats (Rhea's apology, hollow-file reveal). Specificity: moderate; the duration matters, but "after" functions as backstory anchor rather than tactical countdown. Positive signals: early +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal link +0.7. Frictions: more setup than active pressure −0.5, no escalation via time −0.4. Caps: missing middle development cap 3.4 does not apply (evidence-loss is middle constraint); total guidance ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To awaken dormant empathy: setup in para 16 (stated goal); development via exhibition theory (para 19-21: visitors' hands hover, later mail confessions); closure linkage when Jonas paints the ribbon to confer dignity, implicitly inviting the killer's empathy as the stone slips. Two beats (goal statement, visitor behavior). Causal work: the motive drives Jonas's entire painting session and his choice to work on-site. Cost: implicit (years waiting, the risk of failure, isolation). Specificity: high—replace with "solve the case" and the portrait's emotional function collapses. Friction: told more than tested under friction −0.6 (no on-page moment where Jonas's empathy-goal conflicts with another want). Positive signals: early +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal +1.2, closure link +1.0, specificity +0.6, cost +0.3. Guidance −0.6 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Furrowed hush: setup in para 2 ("furrowed hush that settled over the stone"); reprise in para 18 ("that furrowed hush of the quarry settling around them both"). Development: the hush frames the contemplative painting session and Rhea's skeptical presence. Closure: the stone slip breaks the hush, modulating tone to suspense and charging the final image. Two beats (opening anchor, midpoint reprise, closure break). Causal work: the quiet enables Jonas's reflective method; its break signals potential witness. Tone coherence: high—mist, gravel crunch, whispered dialogue all sustain the hush until the slip. Specificity: "furrowed" is unusual and consistent. Positive signals: early +0.8, two beats +0.9, causal +0.9, closure modulation +1.2, specificity +0.6. Total guidance ~7.1 (round down from ~7.14).</comment>
