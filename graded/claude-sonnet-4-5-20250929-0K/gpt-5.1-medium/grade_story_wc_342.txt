<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's prosopagnosia is embodied through concrete navigation strategies (books by spine and smell, constellation analogy) and drives her relationship to the library as "her only true home." The final realization—that frames and limits force attention rather than obstruct it—emerges from her painting constraint and ties to her disability with visible cost. Internal contradiction appears in her attempt to compress "decades of light into pages" while confronting the impossibility of endless sky. Minor deduction: the patron's coin-teaching backstory is told rather than dramatized, though it primes the safe discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Mara, tree library, demolition morning) land cleanly in the opening lines. Pressure accumulates through layered backstory (guild commission, ceilings, masters gone, condemnation) and tightens in the final painting act where spatial constraint forces the realization that "some limits were not failures but frames." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the boards "seemed ready to warp" and she stops "not because the painting was finished, but because there was no more space," reweighting her disability and art practice with conceptual cost. The demolition countdown horns bracket the painting beats and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hollowed oak library is signaled early with fractal shelf structure and holds Mara's painted skies. The coin's faint indentations function as micro-setting that led to the book safe, and the narrow book of primed boards becomes the tool that constrains her final act. The boards' warping under layered paint is the physical limit that crystallizes her insight. The demolition crew idles outside, creating spatial pressure. Setting details (dust motes, ancient grain, lowest ring safe) filter through Mara's tactile navigation and professional lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: craft a surviving sky before demolition. Pressure tightens via countdown horns and spatial constraint (no more space on boards). Agency is clear: Mara proposes the compressed sky book instead of a catalog, layers color until the boards warp, and stops when the frame is full. The cost is visible: "some limits were not failures but frames" forecloses the pretense of endless sky and reframes her prosopagnosia as another productive boundary. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, with felt conceptual price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (limits as frames, not failures) emerges organically from Mara's painting constraint, her face blindness, and the physical capacity of the boards. The coin's indentations, the tree's fractal precision, and the final realization form a tightly braided thematic argument delivered through image and action. The ending offers a non-literal answer: "it was their edges that made anyone stop and look" and "forcing her to meet each person as new light on old ground." No moralizing; the insight is embedded in the warping boards and earned by the painting act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single stable POV with distinct perceptual signature: Mara navigates by touch, grain, and light rather than faces. Diction is controlled and lyric ("dust motes hanging motionless," "light as if it were a language older than ink") without register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close sensory detail to brief reflective passages anchored in present stimuli (coin, boards, horns). Minor deduction: the reflection on "pretending that faces were constellations" edges toward articulation slightly beyond mid-crisis internal voice, though it remains character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense; most sentences advance character, world, or theme. Opening and closing images are strong. Minor issues: "She was a portrait artist who could not recognize faces, not even her own" reads slightly expository for the opening third; "The guild masters said she captured light as if it were a language older than ink" is elegant but risks slight over-writing in a high-density passage. The reflection paragraphs ("She had built a life by pretending...") contain light paraphrase loops ("every meeting started from zero, every goodbye dissolved into anonymity" restates the disability without added pressure). Overall density and momentum remain high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of prosopagnosia, fractal library architecture, and sky-painting as vocations is specific and non-obvious. The conceptual move—limits as enabling frames—feels inevitable in hindsight and transforms familiar disability-as-metaphor material through concrete craft stakes (boards warping, color compression, spatial constraint). The demolition countdown and the coin-map method add fresh procedural specificity. Risk-taking in pacing (heavy backstory load) and thematic density succeeds without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous work detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's face blindness is signaled early, shapes her bond to the library ("never been lost" among books), and drives the final realization that frames force attention. It appears in Setup (opening third), Development (constellation navigation analogy mid-story), and Payoff (final insight about meeting "each person as new light"). Two beats plus closure linkage. Moderate causal pressure: the trait primes her acceptance of limits but does not directly narrow tactical options in the painting act itself. Closure participation is thematic rather than plot-mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The secret book safe appears after the 40% mark ("Today, the safe gaped open where she had left it"), violating early setup. It stores dangerous manuscripts and supplies the narrow primed book for Mara's final commission. Functional in one beat (the book retrieval) and present at closure (she paints the boards). However, the safe itself is ornamental; the book could have been introduced without the safe mechanism. Swappability and late arrival limit the score despite closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" is the story's thematic and tactical spine. Setup: fractal shelves, hollowed tree, prosopagnosia as constraint. Development: Mara wonders "if sky had limits too" and tests compression on boards. Payoff: she stops "not because the painting was finished, but because there was no more space" and realizes "some limits were not failures but frames." The concept drives her final stance, reweights her disability, and charges the closure image. High causal pressure, irreplaceable, visible conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" describes the guild's carving ("every shelf echoed a branch, every alcove mirrored a knot, spiraling smaller into quiet") but remains architectural description. It does not constrain an on-page action or enable a tactical choice with cost. Present in Setup, contributes to atmosphere and thematic resonance (fractal as another frame), but lacks direct causal work. Ornamental rather than pressure-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Craft (painting) is Mara's vocation, her commission history, and the central action of the final act. Setup: she painted guild ceilings. Development: she proposes the compressed sky book. Payoff: she layers color until the boards warp and discovers the limit. The action is irreplaceable; swapping "paint" for another art form would break the sky-mirroring premise and the visual/spatial constraint. Three beats, high causal pressure, closure-defining, visible cost (warping, stopping).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The coin with faint indentations is introduced early as a keepsake from the first master. Its method (reading by touch, "a map where no eye could see") led Mara to the book safe "years later." Present in Setup (coin placed as paperweight in final scene), linked to Development (safe discovery backstory), and weak Payoff (paperweight role is functional but minor). The method shapes one past choice (finding the safe) but does not constrain present tactics. Lyric reprise without strong causal pressure in the present scene.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is anchored immediately ("last morning in the tree trunk library") and pressures all choices: demolition forces the final commission, the hollowed structure supplies the fractal architecture that mirrors Mara's theme, and the carved rings hold the safe. Setup, Development (navigating by grain and smell), and Payoff (the tree "leaning in" as she paints, the building as character). The setting is irreplaceable; removing it breaks premise, stakes, and closure. Spatial constraint (lowest ring, gaping safe, boards) alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe ("hush just before a condemned building is demolished") is signaled in the opening and bracketed by countdown horns (first and second). Setup clear, Development present (Mara asked for "this last hour alone"), and Payoff strong (she stops at the second horn). The clock tightens decisions: she must finish before demolition. However, the exact duration and elapsed time during painting are vague, and no on-page consequence shows what happens if she overruns. The pressure is atmospheric more than mechanical. Two beats plus closure framing; moderate causal tightening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To mirror the sky inside walls" is stated as Mara's motivation and demonstrated through her ceiling commissions and the final compressed-sky book. Setup: "Her motivation had always been simple and impossible: to mirror the sky inside walls." Development: layering decades of sky fragments. Payoff: she compresses sky "beyond reason" and discovers that pretense of endlessness was never the point. The motivation drives the final act and the thematic realization, with visible cost (boards warping, stopping). Friction between the impossible goal and the discovered frame is clear. Slightly tell-heavy in the Setup line but dramatized thereafter.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" is established in the opening ("dust motes hanging motionless," "stillness pressed against the shelves") and modulates through the story: "strange, hovering quiet" before charges, "Stillness gathered around her as if the whole tree were leaning in." Tone coherent through turns, charges the painting act, and supports the realization about frames. The demolition countdown provides counterpoint tension without breaking the dominant stillness. Distinct, purposeful, and integrated across all three gates.</comment>
