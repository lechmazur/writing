<comment>Aurelio's interior world is concrete and specific—pressing leaves against pages, treating imaginary archives like scrolls—and his craft history anchors motivation. The invented histories emerge from his studious trait and gilding background with embodied continuity. Internal conflict between escape and collection is present but could press harder; the final choice to wait "is enough" reads as acceptance with visible cost (carrying the archive home, the lamp extinguished) but lacks sharp contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the closure beat. Minor: "incandescent restraint" appears as narratorial label rather than lived tension.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates ritual detail (time, hum-line, story) and deepens through the shift from named histories (Mrs. Ibarra, the boy) to dates-and-names-that-do-not-exist, then to the lamp's extinction and Aurelio's wait—a Charged Poise that crystallizes his stance (offering fragile stories, imagining the town's rearrangement) with felt cost (the unfinished ripple, no answering sound). Orientation anchors early (mountaintop, empty town, dawn). One meaningful deepening is clear: the progression from specific invented pasts to pure index to silent vigil reweights the dominant stake. The cost is conceptual and relational (the town remains silent; he carries his quiet archive homeward), legible in the final image.</comment>

<comment>The bonsai labyrinth, observatory, fluorescent lamp, and mountaintop anchor spatially and recur with purpose. The lamp's hum is handled as a live constraint (charted, felt in teeth, guides story-writing) and the bonsai's "invisible mouths of fragrance" and mist like "quiet handwriting" charge the final walk. Sensory detail is filtered through Aurelio's craft idiom (gold leaf, edges burnished, grain of timelines). Minor: the empty streets "lie empty as paper" is vivid but the metaphor does not return; occupational depth (gilding tools, ruled columns) enriches without overwhelming.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: to collect textures of different times so the town might remember how to speak (signaled early). One meaningful tightening occurs when the lamp flickers out, forcing Aurelio to stop mid-line and shift from charting to waiting—a renunciation with visible cost (unfinished ripple, no sound from below). The hum's constancy as "incandescent restraint" shapes his tactics (respecting it, copying the line again without story). Agency is endurance and offering; coincidence does not resolve. The trade-off is legible but the pressure could escalate more sharply before the lamp dies.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme—memory, archive, silence's textures, offering fragile futures—emerges from particulars (notepad columns, gold-edged blank card, dates that do not exist) without statement. The final image (imagining the town turning in sleep around his offered stories, carrying the quiet archive homeward) resonates as Conceptual Repricing: his invented histories function not as escape but as indexed silence the town might consult. The core concept (invented histories) integrates cleanly with the thematic question of how to hold collective loss. No moralizing; the piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications (even the boy's timeline, the unspoken forgiveness/warning).</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Single POV, stable third-close. Diction is controlled and character-particular: "fragile celebrations of futures people believed would surely arrive," "grain a possible sorrow rubbed almost to tenderness," "incandescent restraint imposed on the waking world." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during charting, pulling back for lyric observation of bonsai). Filter verbs ("he senses," "he decides") are voice-motivated and fit the studious, archival tone. Minor: "incandescent restraint" and a few elevated phrases ("ostentatious," "anemic persistence") push register slightly above immediate embodied perception but remain legible within the craft-focused idiom.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Line-level clarity is high; rhythm varies naturally and sentences layer jobs (e.g., "leaves catching the first gray hints of dawn" anchors time, setting, and mood). Strong specificity: "battered notepad, its corners rounded by years," "fragile futures...never demanded at the counter." Minor scaffold detected: "He writes..." opens multiple consecutive paragraphs in the middle third, creating template cadence (-0.3). "Fragile" recurs (fragile celebrations, fragile futures, fragile stories) without evolution (-0.2 paraphrase loop). No filter-verb stacks or synonym churn in peak beats; propulsion is steady but could tighten in the reflective middle section.</comment>

<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—gilded-leaf stationer inventing histories by charting a fluorescent hum's warble in an empty town—is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms "archive fiction" by grounding it in craft idiom (ruling columns, pressing leaves) and the physical lamp as both constraint and doorway. Emotional specificity (treating imaginary records as scholars once treated scrolls, the notepad pressed to chest) avoids generic loss-and-memory templates. The final walk through bonsai as "quiet archive homeward" feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is present (the invented-histories-as-index move, the lamp's death as closure) without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Gilded-leaf stationer: present in setup (craft history, gilding tools), shapes middle beats (his hand remembers gold, he treats archives as scholars treated scrolls, he prefers edges burnished), and charges closure (pressing notepad to chest, walking through bonsai carrying his quiet archive). His craft idiom filters perception and constrains method (ruled columns, pressing words like leaves). Two beats: the gold-edged blank card for the boy and the final archive-carrying walk. The trait is specific and irreplaceable; removing "gilded-leaf" would lose the texture metaphors and the motif of adorning futures. Cost: his craft now serves no customers, and he walks home with an archive no one demanded.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Battered notepad: present in setup (carrying it to observatory), used across multiple beats (opening it, ruling columns, writing stories, turning to fresh page, copying the wavering line, the final line trailing unfinished), and reprise at closure (pressed to chest as he stands among bonsai, then carried homeward). The "corners rounded by years" detail signals history. Specificity: the notepad is his archive medium, its battered state parallels the town's silence, and the unfinished ripple when the lamp dies is the story's final written artifact. Minor: it is primarily a vessel; its specific properties (battered, rounded corners) do not constrain a choice as strongly as its use does.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Invented histories: setup (writing records of lives that might have been), drives middle beats (Mrs. Ibarra's keys, the boy's blank card, dates that do not exist), and charges closure (imagining the town rearranging unspoken memories around his offered stories, carrying the quiet archive). The concept shapes stakes (collect textures so the town might remember how to speak) and tactics (charting hum, fitting stories to pattern, giving silence an index). Cost: his inventions may never be consulted, and the town remains silent. Irreplaceable: removing this exact concept would collapse the narrative. The progression from specific invented pasts to pure index to silent offering is the story's spine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Earnestly studious: present in setup ("earnestly studious about his imaginary archives"), enables beats (treating them as scholars once treated scrolls, ruling columns, measured strokes, giving silence an orderly spine), and implicit at closure (standing and waiting among bonsai, the quiet archive pressed to chest). Visible tradeoff: his seriousness means he works slowly ("each word a leaf he presses"), and his respect for the hum's constancy keeps him from extravagance. Cost: his earnestness may be futile (no sound comes), yet he persists. The trait is plausible and consistent but functions more as coloring than as a sharp constraint that forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Refract: setup by end of first third ("learned to refract the quiet through that sound, to split it into colors of possible time"), enables middle tactic (charting the hum's warble as doorways into might-have-been mornings), but not directly active at closure (the lamp dies, he waits). The action is specific to Aurelio's method and fits his craft idiom (light/color/fragmentation). Two beats: the 5:01 stutter → Mrs. Ibarra story, the 5:07 whine → boy story. Swappability test: "interpret" or "translate" could replace "refract" with minor edits, though "refract" carries optical precision. The metaphor charges middle pressure but does not reappear in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn: setup (learning to refract via the hum), mechanics matter across beats (ruling columns, sketching wavering line, the hum's stutter at 5:01, rising whine at 5:07, feeling it in teeth, the lamp's constancy as incandescent restraint, the final flicker-out), and shapes closure (when the lamp dies, the line trails unfinished, forcing Aurelio to stop and wait). Specificity: the lamp is the only working light, its pitch variations are the doorways, and its extinction is the story's hinge. Cost: without the lamp, his method halts. Irreplaceable: removing the lamp would require rewriting the entire mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests on a mountaintop: present in setup (climbs to observatory, bonsai breathe above), recurs in middle (bonsai shadows sway like field trying to remember the sea, invisible mouths of fragrance, mist like quiet handwriting), and charges closure (stands among bonsai, walks back through blooming labyrinth carrying archive). The setting is vivid and atmospheric; the bonsai's "trying to remember" and fragrance mirror Aurelio's memory-work. Minor: the bonsai do not directly constrain a choice (he could chart anywhere with the lamp) but they provide the lyric frame and charge the final walk. The mountaintop isolation is structural (no town noise reaches him).</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>After the town goes silent: setup (streets empty, radios dead, phones mute), frames stakes (he writes for the silence), tracked loosely via dawn progression (5:01, 5:07, "the sky lightens," lamp flickers out), and implicit at closure (no sound from below, town turning in sleep). The timeframe creates pressure (dawn is ending, the lamp will die) and shapes his urgency. Minor: the "after" is more premise than live clock; we do not see the silence deepen or a ticking deadline tighten choices beat-by-beat. The progression is atmospheric rather than tactical. Cost: the silence persists; his vigil may be endless.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>To collect the textures of different times: setup ("his true motive...to collect the textures"), drives beats (writing slowly to feel rough/smooth grain, charting hum, stories fitted to pattern, sensing if he gathers enough textures the town might remember), and charges closure (imagining the town rearranging memories around his offered stories, the quiet archive carried homeward). The motivation is contradictory and embodied: he writes "not to preserve but to suggest," his hand remembers gilding futures that never arrived, and he hopes (without admitting) his collection will restore speech. Cost: the town remains silent; his archive is undemanded. The desire is specific and irreplaceable; removing it would hollow the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Incandescent restraint: coherent through turns (fluorescent lamp's anemic persistence, the hum's constancy as restraint on waking world, Aurelio's distrust of extravagance, preferring edges burnished not ostentatious, measured strokes, treating silence with respect), modulates with pressure (the lamp's whine felt in teeth, the unfinished ripple when it dies), and charges the final image (standing among bonsai, waiting, imagining the town's quiet rearrangement—restraint held to the last line). The tone is not static; it tightens as the lamp nears death and softens into the final walk. Minor: "incandescent restraint" appears once as direct label; the effect is otherwise shown through diction and rhythm.</comment>
