<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The janitor's interior life is embodied through concrete action—lifting the glass, watching projections, dropping his broom—and his spiritual curiosity manifests in listening posture rather than declaration. The move from invisibility to witness is earned through accumulated micro-choices. Internal contradiction appears in his belief that survival requires being invisible, countered by his impulse to reach out and be seen. Minor slip: the final epiphany about vulnerability arrives slightly pre-articulated rather than fully discovered through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the janitor's promise to keep watching crystallizes his stance shift from shadow to witness, with the cost legible in "chest hurt" and the spaciousness of opening. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered projections, the pattern breaks when stars slow to stillness, and the final cadence reweights his labor from cleaning to witnessing. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lantern glass reveals falling stars as human moments, narrowing his understanding and raising the stakes of attention.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tracking station's "quiet older than memory," dust "like crushed nebulae," and the yellow lantern glass all constrain and charge the janitor's discovery. The dome itself becomes a receptor for projections, altering what he can witness. Sensory detail is purposeful—ozone, metallic tang, humming glass—and filtered through his custodial attention. The lantern glass as micro-setting object charges the final image when he lifts his broom "as if it were a staff." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the janitor remains invisible or allows himself to witness and be seen—is signaled early and tightens when the projections shift to human moments, forcing his choice between habitual shadow-work and vulnerable presence. Agency manifests in his decision to step closer, listen, and whisper a promise, foreclosing the path of efficient invisibility with the visible cost of chest pain and exposure. The escalation under the Accumulative lens deepens when stillness itself becomes vulnerable, mirroring his hidden tenderness and compelling his stance shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—strength through vulnerability—emerges organically from the janitor's work, the universe's pause, and the geometry of feeling that charts falling stars through human hearts. The final image of broom-as-staff and whispered promise offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in "the hurt felt spacious" and "a lung poised between breath and release." The knowledge "did not crash over him; it seeped in, like cleaning water" grounds insight in his custodial idiom. Minor excess: "flourishing stillness" edges toward stated theme rather than pure implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled—"spiritually curious in a shy, crooked way," "mops than mantras"—with diction rooted in the janitor's custodial lexicon. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure. The perceptual signature is selective: he notices dust, instruments, and the building's weary vents. Slight register drift occurs in passages like "dense, patient fullness, like a lung poised between breath and release," where elevated abstraction momentarily exceeds his established idiom, though it remains within the story's lyric mode and does not break focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language—"meteors stitched white scars," "rivers of motion"—supports rather than obscures. Minor template cadence appears in several mid-story sentences beginning with "He [verb]" structures. A paraphrase loop occurs around "the station had once tracked...now the projections moved" and the subsequent reiteration of transformation. The final image is clean and propulsive. Overwriting check: figurative density in the middle third (nebulae dust, throat about to sing, molten silver threads) accumulates without muddling, but approaches saturation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic janitor, abandoned tracking station, and vulnerability-as-strength is specific and non-obvious, avoiding the "chosen one discovers hidden power" template by centering witness over mastery. The falling-stars-as-human-moments inflection and the geometry charted by feeling offer fresh angles. Transformation test passes: the arc would collapse if transplanted to a different protagonist or setting. Risk is present in the lyric pacing and the refusal of conventional confrontation. Minor familiarity: the lone caretaker in a forgotten place echoes existing tropes, though the spiritual-curiosity lens and the vulnerability thesis individualize it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced immediately, the cosmic janitor drives every beat: he lifts the glass (activating the station), steps closer under compulsion, listens with custodial attention, and whispers the closing promise. His decision to witness rather than remain invisible is the story's hinge. Removal would erase all agency and closure. Causal pressure is strong, closure linkage definitive, cost visible in his exposed chest pain.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass appears early under dust, is lifted to activate projections, returns when he sets it on the control panel, brightens as he listens, and implicitly underwrites the final promise. It enables the core revelation, constrains his perception (he must engage it to see the new star maps), and charges the ending. Removing it would collapse the mechanism of witness. Three distinct beats, closure-linked, irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Flourishing stillness" is named late (two-thirds in) but prepared by earlier "quiet older than memory" and the station's waiting. It becomes active when the falling stars slow to "near-motionless blaze" and the janitor senses "a dense, patient fullness." That pause forces his recognition and mirrors his hidden tenderness, altering his stance from shadow to witness. Closure linkage is strong, but the label arrives somewhat late and edges toward theme assertion rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious in a shy, crooked way" is introduced early and constrains his mode of engagement—he listens rather than declares, reaches out tentatively. It enables his ability to "empathize with the building" and compels his attention to the lantern glass. The trait shapes two beats (initial approach, final listening) and informs the ending's stance. Cost is present in his shyness limiting earlier action. Swappability is moderate; "introspective" would require only small edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Empathize" is seeded early ("learned to empathize with the building") and drives the middle turn when he wonders if "the universe, too, needed someone to mop around its forgotten corners." His empathic listening enables the final stance shift. The action recurs across three beats and is causally tied to closure. Removing it would flatten his mode of engagement, though "witness" or "attend" might serve similar functions with modest revision.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" is signaled early (station's mission), becomes active when projections show "how they [stars] fell," and transforms in the climactic beat where trajectories align "along a subtle geometry of feeling, as though charted by tracing the path of falling stars through human hearts." The method shapes his realization and the ending's conceptual repricing. Three beats, closure-definitive, irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station is introduced in the opening line, supplies the dome for projections, houses the console and lantern glass, and embodies the "forgotten place" that the janitor tends. It constrains action (single location, instruments that "almost remembered"), pressures stakes (abandoned by astronomers, overlooked era), and charges the ending (the station itself "were remembering"). Removal would eliminate spatial logic and thematic anchor. Early setup, three-beat involvement, closure-linked.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through the hush of an overlooked era" appears in paragraph four, establishes the temporal frame (post-astronomers, ongoing neglect), and underwrites the janitor's solitude and the station's forgottenness. It does not create urgency or tighten decisions in the present scene. The timeframe is more atmospheric than tactical. Provides context but could be replaced with "years of abandonment" without major structural loss. Two-gate presence (setup, tone), modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To find strength in vulnerability" is dramatized when the janitor realizes "the universe...was also resting, gathering itself, vulnerable" and mirrors that with his own "small tenderness." The motivation drives his final choice to "stand where he was and be seen" and accept "the hurt felt spacious." It shapes the climax and closure with visible emotional cost. Early implicit presence, late explicit articulation, definitive closure linkage. Minor friction: the phrasing in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Primal elegance" is embodied in "strange, primal elegance" (middle), "molten silver hanging almost still," and the lyric cadence throughout. Tone modulates from weary routine to wonder to spacious hurt, supporting pressure without stasis. The final image—broom as staff, whispered promise—sustains the tone's elevated-yet-grounded register. Coherent across turns, charges the ending. Slight late labeling reduces integration; the effect is stronger than the declaration.</comment>
