<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ilen's motive is stated but largely abstract; his decision to uncork the whisper and pull the lever happens without visceral internal contradiction or embodied hesitation. The chief librarian's alarm feels generic rather than rooted in a particular professional fear. The ending avoids earned cost—Ilen "smiled without triumph" and suggests shelving by feelings, but no path is foreclosed and no visible price paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Ilen is, where exactly he stands, and what the library's physical layout entails remain vague past the 120-word mark, though the disorientation is somewhat atmospheric. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the frost pattern, the whisper, and the press converge to produce a page that "folds timeline." The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the treaties rewrite themselves and the library accepts possibility—but the cost is asserted ("certainty had to share a desk with possibility") rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture or friction on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard, cloud-sea, and letterpress are vivid and purposeful; the frost maps serve as concrete instructions that constrain Ilen's choice. Spatial choreography inside the library remains hazy (where is Ilen's wing relative to the stacks?), and the final image of the library shuddering and the cloud-sea climbing higher charges the ending effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—compressing eternity into a moment—is signaled early but never faces a concrete on-page test with competing options. Ilen's decision to pull the lever unfolds without visible hesitation, trade-off, or narrowing of tactics. The librarians' alarm is told rather than shown as a credible threat, and the resolution bypasses cost: the treaties "rewrote themselves" and "nothing ruptured," leaving the stakes asserted but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of negotiable reality and the tension between certainty and possibility emerges through the library's rules and Ilen's project. The frost pattern and bottled whisper accumulate meaning without overt statement. However, the final suggestion to "start shelving by feelings instead of years" tilts toward thematic echo, and the closing line—"eternity folding gracefully into a single, shared moment"—abstracts the closure rather than anchoring it in a particular image with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Ilen; diction ("deliberate, grammatical elegance," "fragile thunder") is purposeful and atmospheric. The piece teaches its lyric, elevated register early and sustains it without head-hopping. The librarians' dialogue is minimal but functional. Perceptual signature is consistent—frost as cartography, whispers as punctuation—though the voice occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophizing ("certainty had to share a desk with possibility") rather than concrete perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and information density is high; figurative language ("fragile thunder," "condensed horizons") is purposeful but dense, appearing in most sentences of the climax without paraphrase loops. Minor scaffold: "He listened, nodded, and returned to the press, because eternity was still uncompressed" restates prior content. "Rustling awakenings" recurs as a label without evolving. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs that obscure causality; clarity remains intact at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass orchard library, frost-maps as typesetting instructions, and the bottled whisper combine familiar SFF tropes into a specific, atmospheric synthesis. The premise—compressing eternity via letterpress—is fresh in detail. The ending avoids the safety middle: treaties rewrite themselves rather than rupturing, a bold choice. However, the emotional and causal turn feels inevitable in concept but under-dramatized in execution, and the final image risks abstraction over particular consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ilen is present throughout, his motive established early. He makes two key choices: uncorking the whisper and pulling the lever, both shaping the climax. However, his decisions lack visceral hesitation or trade-off; the turn feels conceptual rather than grounded in embodied cost. He is essential but not irreplaceable—another cryptic operator could perform the same function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bottled whisper is introduced early, warned against, and uncorked at the climax where it rearranges the type. It appears in three beats: receipt from the patron, sitting on the desk as a constraint, and the uncorking that enables the final press-pull. The whisper is causally active, though the specific cost of its use is not dramatized—it simply "spilled over the ink" and vanished. Strong integration but lacks a felt price tied to its release.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Rustling awakenings" appears early as atmospheric detail, recurs when the library stirs, and cascades through the stacks at the climax when books "rustled open" to face the printed page. It shapes the ending's charge but remains more thematic than tactical—it does not narrow Ilen's options or constrain his choice. Present in setup, middle, and payoff, but functions more as motif than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Destabilizes perfect systems" is demonstrated early (equations unraveled, clocks forgot) and constrains Ilen's workspace—he is shelved "between dimensions" because of this trait. At the climax, the page destabilizes cataloging formulas, forcing treaties to rewrite. The attribute enables the final act and is essential to the premise, though the cost to Ilen personally is not made visible on the page—he smiles and suggests next steps without forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Rupture" is named late (second half) as a librarian's warning: "one more misprint could rupture the delicate treaties." The climax explicitly avoids rupture—"nothing ruptured; instead, the treaties rewrote themselves"—making the word a red herring rather than a causal pivot. It does not drive a turn; it is introduced to be negated. Late, ornamental, and narratively passive.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frost pattern is present from the opening ("studied the patterns in morning frost"), recurs as Ilen's method ("the universe left notes"), and becomes the climactic instruction when the spiral-sentence "NOW OR NEVER OR ALWAYS" dictates his type-setting. The method is signaled early, shapes his tactics, and drives the final press-pull. Essential and well-integrated, though the specific mechanics of how frost-lines translate to type remain slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is established early, supplies the frost on trunks as instruction medium, and houses the letterpress. The cloud-sea anchors the floating premise and climbs higher at the end, charging the closure image. The library's physical constraint—Ilen shelved "between dimensions"—matters. However, spatial choreography inside the library is vague, and the setting's role is more atmospheric than tactical. Present across all three gates but could be more causally constraining.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After reality became negotiable" is stated early and frames the premise, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a clock. The frost's "NOW OR NEVER OR ALWAYS" hints at urgency, yet Ilen proceeds without time pressure altering his moves. The setting's temporal fluidity is thematic but does not constrain on-page tactics. Present in setup and thematically relevant to closure, but functionally passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To compress eternity into a moment that would not break" is stated early, drives Ilen's daily work, and motivates the climactic press-pull. However, the motive is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—Ilen does not waver, doubt, or face a visible trade-off. The ending asserts success ("eternity folding gracefully") without showing what Ilen gave up to achieve it. Present across beats but lacks embodied friction or cost.</comment>
