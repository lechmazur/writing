<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is vivid and particular—"memory, here, is a matter of weight, not clarity" establishes a concrete stance shaped by grief and ritual. The final choice to "write until the stars came out and the paper finally felt heavy enough" earns closure through accumulative pressure rather than a dramatic pivot, fitting the lens. Embodied emotion appears in anchored details (locket warming "like a second, stubborn heart"), though the apparition sequence risks theatrical externalization. Minor cost: the narrator's stance crystallizes but doesn't meaningfully shift; the work continues unchanged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by line three (walnut-ink archivist, blooming jetty, twilight). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered ritual acts (dipping pen, pressing photo, following footprints) until the apparition reweights the covenant premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mara's directive and the narrator's return to writing crystallize the work's permanence with undeniable emotional cost. One slip: the apparition's mechanics (footprints moving onto wood, Mara stepping from water) arrive without prior signal of such literal manifestation, a small late rule-change that doesn't break causality but nudges convenience.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty operates as micro-setting that charges the closure: barnacle roses and mussel tulips frame the ritual, then intensify ("bloomed thicker") as the supernatural event unfolds. Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's priorities—walnut ink, salt, phosphorescence—filtered through archival focus. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (rail → pylons → far end). The jetty's transformation directly enables the apparition, constraining the encounter to this charged threshold between land and sea.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving small moments to honor Mara and renegotiate loss—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual sequence. The tightening occurs when footprints emerge and lead the narrator to the jetty's edge, narrowing options to confrontation. Cost is felt in the "haunted euphoria" and the commitment to continue writing despite unresolved grief. Escalation is atmospheric rather than dramatic; the apparition validates rather than challenges, limiting tension in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as weight, covenants regenerated through stubborn record-keeping—emerges organically from the ritual without meta-commentary. The locket photo's transformation (faces blurred from laughter → Mara's haunted euphoria) and the ink-as-preservation motif charge the ending without stated moral. Mara's line "let the ink remember what people are afraid to admit they felt" crystallizes the thematic question and reweights the archivist's labor with undeniable stakes. The final image (writing until paper feels heavy) offers resonant closure that honors complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and controlled: the narrator filters the festival through archival metaphor ("streamers dripping...like tired snakes shedding borrowed color"), walnut-ink textures, and oceanic diction. Psychic distance remains stable in first-person reflective mode; the apparition sequence risks theatricality but stays anchored in sensory particulars (streaming light, words on waves). Diction occasionally elevates ("renegotiate the sea's side of our covenant") yet remains voice-consistent. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds (inference reads as inference).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere and stakes simultaneously. Figurative language pervades but remains coherent (paper bruises, memory as weight, gulls circling emptiness). Two frictions: "When context changes and the tide shifts its arguments" leans abstract without anchoring what changes; "tiny silhouettes of footsteps...each print a dark comma linking one heartbeat to another" stacks metaphors that blur the literal action. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the closure beat is clean. No paraphrase loops, though some sentences in the middle third ("I do not summon visions directly; that would be vulgar") edge toward scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of archival ritual, ghost-summoning, and covenant-renegotiation through ink-and-tide mechanics feels specific and non-obvious. The "blooming jetty" at twilight and ink that remembers pressure offer fresh inflections on haunting narratives. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor conventionality: the apparition's function (validating the narrator's work rather than complicating it) and the "keep going" directive trend toward affirming closure that doesn't fully transform the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist frames the opening, drives the ritual sequence (steadying ledger, dipping pen, pressing photo, following footprints), and makes the final choice to continue writing. The role's specific mechanics (walnut ink, steeped paper, proximate causes) constrain tactics throughout and charge the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The locket photo is handled three times with escalating function: warming in pocket (beat one), pressed face-down onto the page to seed the ritual (beat two), and implicitly reweighted in the final image when the narrator returns to writing. Its blurred faces and connection to Mara supply the emotional cost that drives closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The regenerated covenant is signaled early ("My oath is a regenerated covenant"), shapes the narrator's motivation, and is explicitly reweighted by Mara's apparition ("You brought the covenant back...that is how covenants regenerate"). The concept defines the stakes and alters the narrator's understanding at closure, though its mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is dramatized in the narrator's meticulous ritual (steadying ledger, waiting for the nib to quiver, writing "until the stars came out") and directly named in the line "why I am gently thorough even when the hours thin and buzz." The trait enables the sustained attention required for the apparition but doesn't visibly constrain a choice or impose a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Steep" (verb: to soak, saturate) drives the ritual's key turn: "I work to steep the city's paper in tides and silences" sets method, then "opened the locket and pressed its photo face-down onto an empty ledger page, letting the damp dusk soak in" enacts it. The steeped photo catalyzes the footprints and apparition; removing this action collapses the causal chain to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Proximate causes" is signaled early ("I work through proximate causes, aligning ink, tide, memory, and time") and structures the ritual's logic: each element (locket, ink, dusk, tide) accumulates until "the world has no choice but to speak." The method differentiates the archivist's approach from direct summoning and justifies the apparition's mechanics, though the term itself risks abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight anchors all action, supplies the supernatural atmosphere (barnacle violets, phosphorescent blooms), and intensifies at the ritual's peak ("bloomed thicker, barnacle roses opening into slick mouths"). The jetty's far end—where "the sea was darkest"—is the spatial constraint that forces the apparition encounter and charges the final image of writing there.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"When context changes" appears in the opening third ("That is why I came to the jetty tonight, when context changes and the tide shifts its arguments") and frames the ritual's timing. The harbor festival's end and twilight's arrival create the charged threshold, though the timeframe's mechanics (what specifically changes at this moment versus others) remain somewhat elusive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to "preserve the weight of small moments before they wash smooth" is stated early and tested throughout: the narrator chooses to steep the locket despite the pain, follows the footprints despite uncertainty, and commits to continue writing after the apparition. The desire conflicts with the cost (unresolved grief, "haunted euphoria") and drives the ending choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" modulates coherently from the reflective opening through the ritual's atmospheric escalation (iron, lilac, static) to the apparition's charged validation ("expression of someone who has danced too long with a storm and learned its private jokes") and the narrator's final adoption of it ("my heart steeped in that same haunted euphoria"). The tone charges every major beat and the closure image without flattening into single-note mood.</comment>
