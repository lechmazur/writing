<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior life is concrete and consistently rendered through her translator's lens—"analogical thinking" and "kindly methodical patience" shape perception and choice. The guide's vanishing creates genuine uncertainty that drives her final decision, and her "haunted ambitions" conflict visibly with the memory of his surprised inhale. Minor slip: the phrase "haunted ambitions" functions more as elegant labeling than embodied contradiction in peak moments, and the final choice feels slightly under-motivated given the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening lines and holds a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (arbor, seed, frozen wave) and the final act—Mara placing her palm against the trembling air to "reestablish what you have already taken"—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost. The cost is legible: she forgoes the fame of witnessing alone and risks her own dissolution to restore the guide. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seed is placed on the frozen wave and the arbor's pitch shifts, reweighting all prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is vividly particular—"lattice of dark metal trees magnetized to nothing visible," oscillation that makes teeth ache—and constrains Mara's final choice by offering the "agreement" on its terms. The frozen wave functions as micro-setting, a spatial anchor where the seed is placed and the arbor responds. Sensory detail (pressure inside bones, trembling membrane) is filtered through Mara's scholarly attention and charges the closure image without excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding transition physics versus witnessing it alone—is signaled early and tightens when the guide vanishes, leaving Mara the sole witness. Her final choice to "reestablish" rather than exploit the discovery forecloses the path of personal glory with visible cost. The arbor's patient hum and her realization that "transition was not a doorway but a relationship" deepen pressure under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the arbor's physics, the tablets' warnings, and Mara's translator habits: transition as a question, passage as relationship, the cost of crossing. The final image—palm against trembling air, the plea to restore—answers the central question (what shape are you trying to become?) without moralizing. The knowledge fruit seed's shift from cautionary tale to planted offering reweights prior material with quiet force, and "After the spirit leaves, there is still a shape trying to remember itself" resonates without preaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Mara's scholarly idiom: "analogical thinking," "glosses, marginal notes," "brutal plowing of her reality." Diction remains voice-consistent even under pressure, and the narrative certainty matches her knowledge base—inferences read as inferences. The guide's dialogue is minimal but functional. Minor density concern: a few filter verbs ("felt the old rhythm") soften immediacy in mid-pressure beats, though they stay within character voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines advance image, character, and thematic weight simultaneously. No major loops or scaffolding artifacts. Small deduction for occasional elevated diction that slightly exceeds Mara's established register under peak stress ("luminous vines that rooted in the sky itself" reads more authorial than character-filtered) and one near-paraphrase in the arbor's offering sequence. Figurative language is controlled and coherent, with no mixed metaphors harming clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of cuneiform scholarship, speculative physics, and the arbor's patient hum feels specific and non-obvious. The knowledge fruit seed's mechanics—germinating in questions rather than soil—transform a familiar cautionary-tale trope into plot mechanism. The closure choice (restore rather than witness) avoids the expected path of discovery-as-triumph. Risk-taking in the Accumulative structure and the arbor's relational physics heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, though the premise shares DNA with scholar-discovers-ancient-truth templates and needs the specificity here to avoid feeling derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout, her choices drive the key turn (placing the seed) and the closure act (extending her palm to reestablish). Her translator's habits shape perception and tactics in every beat. The final choice forecloses personal glory with visible cost. Strong causal integration across setup, middle, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The seed appears in the guide's hand-off, is examined and contextualized via tablet lore, is placed on the frozen wave to trigger the arbor's response, and its planting charges the closure. Handled across three distinct beats with escalating stakes. The seed's unique property (germinates in questions) matters causally and the closure depends on its presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Haunted ambitions" is named early and returns in the closure beat, where Mara's fame-seeking conflicts with the guide's memory. It shapes one key choice (the final renunciation) and primes the stakes, but functions more as thematic accent than tactical constraint. Present at setup and payoff; middle development is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is introduced early, embodied in her ten-hour tablet sessions and her patient translation of the arbor's "grammar of fields and absence." It enables her analogical reading and constrains her to speak "carefully, tenderly" rather than seize control. The trait shapes at least two beats (the translation attempt, the final plea) with visible cost in time and risk.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Reestablish" is seeded in the expedition's motive (colleagues want to "reestablish their fading careers"), returns as verb in Mara's final line, and defines the closure action: she chooses to restore the guide rather than exploit the discovery. The word's dual meaning—restoration and professional ambition—charges the ending and the stakes pivot on this exact verb. Essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Analogical thinking" is named early as Mara's method, demonstrated when she reasons that the seed needs "a state of not knowing" (soil analogy), and used again when she translates the arbor's changes via Sumerian root connections ("cross over" / "ask"). It shapes two key beats and the method is irreplaceable—remove it and her approach to the arbor becomes generic. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor frames every beat: it hums, aches teeth, draws the guide into a standing wave, responds to the seed's placement, offers the "agreement," and receives Mara's final touch. It supplies the dominant constraint (its patient waiting), enables the closure choice, and the story's logic depends on its unique properties. Setup, development, payoff all tied to this exact setting with high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the spirit leaves" is the map's endpoint, Mara's interpretive key, and the phrase she thinks immediately after the guide's vanishing. It reappears as her realization ("there is still a shape trying to remember itself") and primes the closure by framing transition as a recoverable state. Lyric reprise that reweights the stake; present at setup and closure, middle development is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The desire to "understand the physics of transition" is dramatized in Mara's choice to stay when others flee, her patient translation of the arbor's signals, and her final willingness to risk dissolution. It conflicts with her "haunted ambitions" (fame) and the cost is foregrounded when she chooses restoration over sole discovery. Present in setup, middle (she "translates" rather than flees), and closure with visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Touching distance" appears literally (the seed "at touching distance, never actually eaten"; the arbor's offer "at touching distance") and tonally throughout: closeness without contact, the membrane that "pressed against her skin without touching," the breath "just before they speak your name." The tone modulates with pressure—patience to trembling urgency—and charges the final image when Mara closes the gap by laying her palm flat. Coherent and integral to the ending's emotional texture.</comment>
