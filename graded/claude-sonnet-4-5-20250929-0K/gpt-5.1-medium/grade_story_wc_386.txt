<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marek's interiority shows concrete detail ("pressure in his chest," touching the snow globe), and his stance as truth-weaver is enacted through his careful word choice with the woman. The woman's shift from defensive to crying is grounded in the weight of the revelation. However, the sister's backstory and the extended dream-window mechanism rely heavily on reflective summary rather than micro-choices under present pressure, and the woman's final emotional turn arrives without visible internal resistance or contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (glacier shrine, Marek's role, candles). The piece commits to an accumulative/textural lens: dream-windows, recurring snow globe, and layered backstory build toward the woman's charged moment of recognition. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the woman's tears and Marek's prescription crystallize options with felt cost. However, the cost remains largely implied (future confession/unsealing) rather than legible in a decisive on-page action or sacrifice, and the midpoint dream-sequence relies on told summary rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vividly rendered with candles, ice-walls, and "borrowed starlight," and the melted snow globe functions as a charged object at the altar. The setting recurs at closure when "the glacier creaked and the candles flared," modulating tone with the woman's tears. Spatial anchoring is clean throughout. The snow globe constrains Marek's ritual (he touches it before each session), meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting, but the glacier itself does not visibly limit or enable a tactical choice, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the woman will expose her family's buried complicity—is signaled and tightens through Marek's revelation and her question about vengeance versus "something else." The ending narrows her options to confession and restitution with conceptual cost. However, the escalation occurs largely in Marek's summary of dream-stitching rather than through on-page reversals or the woman's active resistance, and no visible price (loss of time, relationship rupture, renounced inheritance) is paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the image of "windows" as thin places and the snow globe as salvage/wreckage, and the ending offers a non-literal answer: confession as opening doors. The melted snow globe accumulates symbolic weight across beats. However, Marek's late-paragraph articulation—"to salvage something pure from the wreckage"—borders on thematic echo, and the phrase "weaves truth carefully" is repeated almost verbatim, flattening subtext into label. The final image (frozen tears, flaring candles) charges the moment but does not fully reweight prior material with fresh tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: "pressure in his chest," "glitter arrested in cloudy water," and Marek's ritualized gestures anchor voice. Dialogue carries subtext ("the child wants vengeance from me, or something else") and advances stakes. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("windows of connection," "truth carefully"). However, the reflective backstory block (sister's wreck, officials' lies, years of diving) occupies ~25% of the text with minimal on-page micro-choices anchoring it to the present frame, and the repeated phrase "weaves truth carefully" in adjacent paragraphs creates a template cadence that dulls voice distinction at a key beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled: "candles guttered," "glitter clumping like wet ash," "tears froze almost as soon as they slid from her jaw." Information density is high in setting and image. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "weaves truth carefully" is stated twice in adjacent paragraphs, and "windows of connection" / "thin places, where one reality fogged another" / "breath on glass" recycles the same metaphor across three beats without advancing pressure. The backstory summary (sister's wreck, descent, recovery) flattens momentum in the middle third. Template stems ("He saw... saw... saw") in the dream-window sequence create minor cadence monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—wreck-diver as dream-analyst in a glacier shrine—is specific and memorable, and the melted snow globe as first recovered object grounds the metaphor in concrete history. The accumulative structure (dream-windows layering toward revelation) fits the material. However, the core frame (psychic/medium figure reveals hidden family guilt to a descendant) follows a familiar template, and the piece does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or a non-obvious turn. The woman's tears and Marek's prescription arrive as expected outcomes without a hinge that redefines prior stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marek is present throughout and his choices (touching the snow globe, opening dream-windows, prescribing confession) drive beats. However, his role is largely interpretive rather than decisive: he receives the woman, translates dreams, and advises. The wreck-diver credential appears in backstory but does not constrain a present tactic. His final prescription is counsel, not a choice that alters his own stakes or forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears at setup (altar description), is touched in the middle beat (Marek's ritual), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure ("glitter arrested in cloudy water" / "salvage something pure"). It functions as both anchor and thematic charge. However, its use remains largely symbolic and gestural; no on-page action depends on its specific properties, and removing it would weaken resonance but not break plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" / "thin places" is introduced early and recurs across beats (dream-windows, glass pane, invisible glass the child taps). It frames Marek's method and the piece's metaphorical architecture. However, the concept functions primarily as theme and metaphor rather than a mechanism that constrains choices or alters tactics. The woman's decision is shaped by revealed complicity, not by the window-metaphor itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is stated twice (once in action, once as summary) and enacted when Marek "measured each word" and left "space for the living to stand inside it." It constrains his speech at a key beat. However, the trait is largely label-only; no visible cost (withheld fact, lost efficiency, ruptured trust) results from his care, and the repetition across adjacent paragraphs creates template cadence rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Expose" is prescribed at closure ("expose what was done... confession, records unsealed") and is the explicit ask Marek identifies. It shapes the woman's final options and reframes her tears as acceptance of cost. However, the action is future-oriented and told rather than enacted on the page; no on-page beat shows her deciding to expose or beginning the act. It is essential to thematic closure but does not drive a present turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dream-analysis is signaled early ("analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams"), recurs when Marek "let the dream-windows open fully," and enables the revelation of the company's guilt. The method is specific and integral to his role. However, the mechanics remain vague (how he stitches dreams, why this woman received this child) and the key beat is delivered as reflective summary ("faces emerged one by one") rather than dramatized process, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vividly established (ice-walls, candles, altar, "throat swallowing candlelight") and recurs at closure ("glacier creaked," "candles flared"). It charges atmosphere and tone throughout. Marek's ritual (touching the snow globe at the altar) roots action in the setting. However, the shrine does not constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource; its function is primarily atmospheric and symbolic, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Salvage something pure" is articulated late by Marek as the child's desire and prescribed to the woman ("money turned from inheritance into lifeboats"). It reframes her tears and anchors the thematic closure. However, the motivation is attributed to the ghost-child rather than dramatized as the woman's own conflicted want, and it arrives as exposition in the final third without prior on-page friction between desire and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears in the opening ("flames reflected and multiplied until the whole chamber glowed with borrowed starlight") and returns at closure ("candles flared, casting brief windows on the ice before sinking again into borrowed starlight"). The phrase charges the tone with fragility and refraction, coheres across the piece, and modulates subtly from steady glow to flare-and-fade at the ending. It enriches atmosphere and resonates with the window/glass motif, meeting high integration.</comment>
