<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer's interiority is concrete and specific ("cautious exuberance prickling beneath her ribs"), with embodied contradiction between dread and delight. Her final choice to dissolve the resignation letter and commit to restraint rather than documentation feels earned by the library's lesson. Minor weakness: the confidence man remains a static gatekeeper rather than a pressure point, and the protagonist's shift from cartographer-hunger to reverent restraint could show more micro-resistance in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (dusk, river fog, embankment). The closure—dissolving the resignation and choosing a single sentence over documentation—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost: she forecloses the mapmaker's path and accepts unresolved silence. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes documentation would "misrepresent it entirely," reweighting her dominant stake from conquest to reverence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist is vivid and purposeful: shelves that shift with silence delays, alcoves of empty chairs for unsaid invitations, parental reprimands that snap back "like a slammed door." The mist itself acts as both medium and constraint, beading on her lashes as she builds her mental diagram. The library's rule—silence returns at varied speeds—directly shapes her method and final choice, charging the closure image when ink fogs under the lantern book.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find and document the library) is signaled early and tightens when she discovers documentation would be "misrepresentation." One clear turn: her hunger shifts to reverence ("no longer the giddy hunger of discovery, but a reverent thrill at learning how not to conclude"). The cost is legible—she dissolves her resignation and abandons the Council map—but the middle could show more tactical friction or a live threat to force the choice under greater duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (the value of unspoken restraint versus the violence of premature conclusion) emerges from concrete library rules and the protagonist's evolving relationship to silence. The final image—ink fogging and vanishing, replaced by a single unseen sentence—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "Not cowardice alone, but mercy, prudence, love that refused to bind another" edges toward thesis statement, though it's filtered through the man's unspoken implication rather than direct authorial voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is ornate and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: "words are waves; here we read only the silence between them," "the brief jurisdiction of doubt." POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully when she closes her eyes and "paces the aisles, marking each delay in the return of quiet." Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot. Minor drag: some constructions trend toward the lyric-essay register ("the giddy hunger of discovery") rather than sharp immediacy, and a few filter verbs ("she sensed questions") soften peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; no major loops or scaffold. Figurative language is frequent but mostly controlled ("mist rolled past like shy spectators," "dragging chains across the carpet of the air"). Weakness: several lines stack modifiers and lyric constructions in quick succession without peak-beat justification ("cautious exuberance prickling beneath her ribs, equal parts dread and delight at finally touching the rumor"), creating mild density clutter. The final beat is clean, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—a library read by silence-delay differentials rather than text—is fresh and integrated with character goal (cartographer seeking the unmappable). The turn from documentation to dissolution feels earned rather than imposed. Risk: the ornate voice and concept-driven frame commit fully without hedging. Partial friction: the confidence man's cyclically reversed watch and the "unfolding cipher" concept are introduced but not causally decisive, trending toward atmospheric ornament rather than irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: present early (arrives at dusk). Development: paces aisles, builds mental diagram, tests silence. Payoff: dissolves the resignation letter and writes a single sentence. Her choices (testing silence, abandoning documentation) drive two key beats and shape the ending. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Cap would be higher if mid-scene friction showed more internal resistance or a tactical cost before the final turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced at the gate. Development: appears twice (ticking "not forward but in a hesitant seesaw," hands aligning in "rare assent"). Payoff: absent from the closure beat. The watch illustrates time's reversal theme but does not constrain a protagonist choice or return charged at the end. Functionally replaceable with another time motif; the cyclical mechanism is described but not leveraged.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: named early ("unfolding cipher"). Development: explained via propagation delays; shapes her reading method ("testing little coughs of sound"). Payoff: informs her realization that documentation would fix the unresolved. The concept enables her tactic and reweights her stake. Strong middle and closure linkage; score would reach 7+ if the cipher's mechanics drove a second distinct turn or introduced a visible cost mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Setup: the watch ticks "cyclically reversed" at the gate. Development: mentioned again when the man's hands "waggle in their strange, cyclically reversed argument." Payoff: not present in the ending. The attribute is described twice but does not constrain an action or impose a cost. Label-only use; removing "cyclically reversed" and keeping "hesitant seesaw" would preserve all plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "I came to document this library." Development: her documentation intent shapes the middle (building a mental diagram, imagining ink as "dragging chains"). Payoff: she dissolves the resignation and abandons the mapmaker's mission. The action to document creates the conflict and its renunciation forms the closure unit. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; visible cost (forecloses the cartographer path) is legible.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("propagation delays, in how quickly silence returns"). Development: she tests delays, marks them, builds her catalog. Payoff: informs her realization that fixing silence would misrepresent. The method enables her reading tactic and charges the insight. Present across all three gates with solid causal work; score trends mid-6 because the mechanics are explained rather than dramatized under pressure with a visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: signaled in paragraph one ("glowing library in mist"). Development: shelves shift with silence delays, alcoves appear, rules constrain speech. Payoff: the library's lantern book witnesses the ink vanishing. The setting supplies the rules, pressures every choice, and charges the final image. Essential across all beats; removing the mist-library frame would collapse the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: both letters introduced early (resignation folded in pocket, second unwritten). Development: the unwritten letter "vibrated against her chest" mid-scene; the timeframe brackets her decision window. Payoff: she dissolves the first and writes one sentence for the second. The two-letter frame tightens the window and bookends the arc. Strong thematic and structural work; score would reach 7.5+ if the ticking urgency imposed a tactical cost or deadline pressure mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: stated early ("to find the library of unspoken words"). Development: her hunger drives every beat (quickened steps, testing silence, building the catalog). Payoff: she finds it and her desire transforms from conquest to reverence, altering her final choice. The motivation is dramatized in action and conflicted by the library's lesson. Visible friction between want (to map) and cost (to misrepresent) charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: named in paragraph four ("cautious exuberance prickling beneath her ribs, equal parts dread and delight"). Development: modulates to "reverent thrill at learning how not to conclude." Payoff: the final beat (dissolving ink, writing one sentence) carries restrained wonder without declaring it. Tone is coherent and charges the ending image. Minor drag: the label "cautious exuberance" is stated rather than sustained through rhythm alone, and mid-scene the tone flattens into explanation before recovering at closure.</comment>
