<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The oracle's contradictory impulses—obsessed with quiet yet drawn to storms—operate simultaneously in scene through her actions (loosening cloak, laying out booklet, closing eyes to count silences). The captain's shift from disuse to engagement shows embodied emotional layering. However, interiority leans heavily on lyric abstraction ("amber hush," "pooled inside") rather than character-particular perception, and the oracle's final choice to lead him feels asserted more than earned by prior micro-decisions that narrow options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric density, silence as material) and accumulates pressure through the star's dimming, the storm's approach, and the map's gradual completion. Closure arrives on-page as Charged Poise: the finished map offers "passages through the chambers of fear, memory, and patience," reconfiguring the endless night into navigable grammar. Cost is conceptual and felt—the captain must "learn its quiet grammar" and "refuse" familiar modes of navigation—though the final image could make the price more viscerally legible. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraphs (ridge fort, oracle arrival, storm context).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ridge fort's shuddering towers, broken hinges, and shattered battlements constrain the scene's enclosed vulnerability. The gold leaf booklet functions as micro-setting: handled twice (laid on the drum, lifted between them), its flaking gilt and scored surface shape the oracle's method and charge the final image. The storm outside and the "ambered hush" inside create atmospheric pressure that modulates with the narrative's tightening. Sensory selection—rain rivulets, cooling stone ticking, star pulsing—filters through urgency and supports the ending's reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to map an endless night before the last star vanishes. The timeframe tightens options (star trembling, then snuffed), and the oracle's agency—closing her eyes, counting silences, marking arcs—drives the central action. One meaningful deepening occurs when darkness arrives and the captain realizes he can still see by the map's sheen, reweighting the problem from light-based navigation to silence-based passage. The cost is conceptual (abandoning light-charts, embracing "quiet grammar") but remains more implied than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the map of silences as an answer to navigating loss, the shift from light-dependence to listening. The final image—"endless only to those who refuse to learn its quiet grammar"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the captain's flinch and recovery, the oracle's "almost like pity" curve, and the map's "corridors of fear, memory, patience." The piece resists tidy resolution by leaving the journey itself off-page, trusting the charged final image to reweight prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the oracle notices textures of quiet, the captain counts shadows like ships. Psychic distance is controlled, anchored in the oracle's focal perspective with no head-hopping. However, elevated diction ("ambered hush," "marbled hush pooled inside," "veined with the paths of captured silences") remains consistent but occasionally tips toward ornament in high-pressure beats rather than tightening under stress. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("only half of what is lost is written in light"), carrying subtext and advancing the stakes without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and often purposeful ("barnacle," "waves gnawed the land," "shipwrecked constellations"), but in peak beats—oracle working, darkness arriving—metaphoric layering ("hollow corridors left behind by vanished light," "darkness strode in") risks overwriting that pulls focus from propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "hollows" and "lean into them" echo "hollow corridors"; "ambered hush" and "marbled hush" repeat the same textural note. Syntax varies well, and no scaffolding obstructs causality, but density in the closure paragraph competes with clarity rather than sharpening it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—mapping silence rather than light, navigating by listening—feels specific and non-obvious, transforming the familiar trope of lost guidance into a tactile epistemology. The oracle's method (scoring pauses, counting breaths) and the gold leaf booklet's material fragility add fresh inflection. However, the storm-fort-oracle frame follows recognizable fantasy-oracle templates, and the ending's implicit invitation ("learn its quiet grammar") edges toward abstraction rather than a truly indelible particular that resists swapping.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present early, drives the map-making action (two beats: laying booklet, marking arcs), and her final invitation shapes closure. The oracle's choices (closing eyes, counting silences, lifting the finished map) alter the captain's stance, but her decision to lead feels more declared than tested by competing costs on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Handled in three beats: laid on drum (flakes cling to fingers), worked over (tiny arcs and dots marked), lifted between them (gilded surface veined with paths). Its flaking state and scored leaves constrain the method and charge the final image. Removing it would erase the tangible anchor of the map's creation and the sheen that remains visible in darkness.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "ambered hush" appears twice, framing the interior atmosphere and modulating with the storm's withdrawal. It shapes the scene's mood and primes the closure image (stillness as navigable space), but does not constrain a tactical choice or alter options under pressure. Swapping for "suspended quiet" or "honeyed stillness" would shift texture without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Mentioned once in exposition ("mildly obsessed...with the textures of quiet") and reflected in her behavior (coming to the fort during storms, counting silences), but never tested by a visible trade-off or cost. The obsession explains motivation but does not enable or foreclose an on-page action with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The captain's concern—"nothing left to retell the shape of shorelines"—establishes the problem and frames the oracle's map as a solution to lost retelling. The action appears in dialogue and drives the oracle's method (mapping silences as a new mode of retelling), but the oracle's work would function nearly unchanged if the verb were "remember" or "navigate." Two-beat involvement; causal but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("draw a map...by summarizing silence"), dramatized in the middle beat (counting spaces between thunderclaps, breaths, cooling stone ticks, marking arcs where quiet turned), and shapes the closure (the map's "paths of captured silences" offering passages). The method is specific, repeated, and its mechanics matter to the ending's charge. Removing it would collapse the story's epistemological premise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ridge fort supplies enclosure (gate, stone hall, arrow slits) and the toppled drum as a table. The shattered battlements frame the star's visibility. The storm outside pressures the timeline. However, the fort itself does not alter the oracle's tactics or supply a resource that changes the outcome; the map-making would function in any enclosed space with a view of the star. Two-gate participation (setup, closure frame) but limited causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The single star anchors urgency from the opening, tightens through the captain's watch ("pulsed like a frightened heart"), and its snuffing triggers the closure test (darkness arrives, map must work). The timeframe shapes the oracle's pacing and the captain's fear, and its completion reweights the problem from light-navigation to silence-navigation. Removing it would eliminate the ticking constraint that drives the map's necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present in the sea's command ("draw a map of an endless night before the last light slipped"), dramatized through the oracle's work (marking arcs, lifting the finished map), and tested at closure (map offers passages, not light-based routes). Friction appears in the captain's doubt ("what will your map show us, when there is nothing to see"), but the oracle's commitment faces no visible internal cost or trade-off. Two-beat causal involvement; shapes closure but lacks conflicted choice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "marbled hush" modulates from threat (pooled with "old echoes and new fear") to shelter (the hall "strangely dry" as the storm rages), supporting the tonal arc from dread to charged poise. Tone remains coherent through the star's dimming and darkness's arrival, and the final line's invitation ("quiet grammar") extends the hush into method. However, the tone is more atmospheric frame than active constraint, and it does not pressure a choice or visibly shift under the captain's or oracle's decisions.</comment>
