<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elior's interiority is concrete and character-particular—guilt "wove itself into his fingertips," soothing motion as "small rebellion." Internal conflict between redemptive ego and the wish "to forgive oneself…not excuse them, but live beside them without flinching" is embodied in the winnowing work. The prince's remembered gaze and the woven villagers' accusation charge his present choices. Minor slip: the chess-tutor backstory is densely packed but remains accessible; the final self-forgiveness pivot feels earned by the tapestry work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page with visible cost: Elior forgoes redemptive applause and instead sifts motives, finding the "smaller and harder" wish to live beside mistakes; pulling the last thread releases the village and resumes time. The drive lens is Causal (strategy → winnowing → release) with lyric accumulation in the tapestry's texture. One meaningful tightening: the final crossing of "thread and time" that makes the village breathe. Orientation is clear by paragraph three (exiled tutor, frozen village, platinum tower). Cost is legible in the renunciation of pride and the quiet, decisive gesture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The frozen village (raindrops suspended, dust motes "like neglected pawns") and the platinum tower with its etched constellations anchor the opening and constrain Elior's path. The tapestry's frayed border functions as micro-setting, its threads a tactile puzzle that responds to each tug with a groaning stair or darkening center. The final image—"tower's plates rang like chilled goblets; outside, the raindrops resumed their fall"—is charged by the established stasis. No occupational detail clutter; chess idiom is filtered through Elior's perception without exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unfreeze the village) is signaled early and tightens as incorrect tugs darken the tapestry and "tiny woven villagers seemed to look away…in accusation." One meaningful deepening: Elior's mid-work realization that solving for applause would repeat the old pattern, forcing him to sift motives and "forgive himself…not erase them." The final crossing drawn clean is protagonist-driven with visible cost (pride discarded, past mistakes carried forward). No coincidental rescue; the labyrinth responds to earned decoding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—living beside mistakes without flinching versus seeking redemptive applause—emerges from the tapestry work and the prince's remembered trust. The frayed threads and the woven villagers' accusation operate as subtext, not label. The final gesture (drawing the last crossing clean) offers a non-literal answer: time resumes when motive is bare and self-forgiveness replaces erasure. No thematic echo or moralizing; the resonance is quiet and image-based. The ivory pawn's worn crown, rubbed to a sheen, seeds the motif of persistent friction and reappears in the "fierce repose" of his fingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with lyric compression ("a woven hush draped over every shutter and cobblestone like an unfinished thought"). Diction is character-specific: "war of gambits," "hours…sluicing through his concentration," "stripped illusion from necessity." Under peak stress the prose tightens without losing texture ("What remained was smaller and harder"). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Minor slip: a few elevated constructions ("strategies…marched him straight into the killing field") approach abstraction but remain anchored in chess idiom. Perceptual signature is consistent: every image filtered through board logic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short bursts ("Solve it…Or fail") alternate with longer lyric accumulations. Information density is high: "war of gambits," "king toppled into blood," "exile followed" compress backstory into motion. Minor loop: "fidgets productively" in paragraph six echoes "fidgeting not from anxiety but from a fierce repose" in a later beat without added pressure; template cadence appears in two adjacent "He [verb]" constructions mid-piece. No mixed metaphors; figurative language (dust motes as pawns, tower as lightning bolt) remains coherent. Propulsion is strong through the winnowing sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess strategy, time-frozen village, and tapestry decoding is specific and non-obvious; the emotional turn (sifting motives to forgive rather than erase) grows from the puzzle's structure. The frayed-thread mechanic and the woven border as labyrinth feel fresh. Minor derivative note: exiled-expert-solves-mystical-puzzle echoes familiar fantasy templates, but the chess idiom and the self-forgiveness calculus transform it. The "fierce repose" tone and the ivory pawn as tactile anchor add particularity. Risk: the lyric compression and reflection density could obscure, but the closure image lands clearly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elior's choices drive two key beats: accepting the labyrinth challenge ("stubborn calm of someone who no longer knew how to flee") and the mid-work pivot where he sifts motives, discarding pride and redemptive applause. His final action (drawing the last thread clean) releases the village. Early signal (paragraph four), causal pressure (his decisions alter the board), and closure linkage (final gesture) are all present. Cost is tied to him: he must forgive himself, not erase the past. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth (tower and tapestry) appears in three beats: entry (spiral staircase, etched plates), the winnowing work (threads respond with groans and darkening), and closure (plates ring, time resumes). The object's mechanics (frayed threads as puzzle) constrain his choices and enable the final gesture. Early signal (paragraph fourteen), development (each tug alters the tower's state), and payoff (ringing plates at closure) are clear. Specificity: the platinum plates and frayed border are irreplaceable in the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Woven hush" appears as the village's frozen state ("quiet…a woven hush draped over every shutter") and reappears in the tapestry's border, where "white and black, storm and light…braided into knots where time refused to choose." The concept shapes the central stake (unfreeze the hush) and the method (decode woven threads). It charges the closure when the hush becomes motion (raindrops fall). Early signal, thematic resonance, and closure linkage present. Mid-high band: the concept is felt more than tactile, but it constrains the puzzle's form.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" is embodied in two beats: rubbing the ivory pawn (paragraph six, "Movement soothed him, a small rebellion") and later tracing the tapestry with "fierce repose" (paragraph twenty-four). The trait enables the winnowing work—his hands move constantly, stripping "illusion from necessity." Cost: the trait is both comfort and compulsion, tied to his guilt. Early signal, development (hands trace threads), and closure participation (final tug). Solid integration; the fidgeting is irreplaceable in his characterization and the puzzle's execution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Winnow" appears as the dominant action: "winnowing every false path from every true one" (paragraph twenty-two), "stripping illusion from necessity" (paragraph twenty-five), and "sifted his motives as well" (paragraph thirty-one). The action drives the middle sequence (each tug tests a thread) and the climax (final crossing drawn clean). It defines the puzzle's method and Elior's internal arc. Early signal, two distinct beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage. Irreplaceable: no synonym captures the dual sense of tactical sorting and moral discernment. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method—"decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border"—is signaled in paragraph twenty-two and governs the entire winnowing sequence. Each correct tug sets a bell trembling; each mistake darkens the center. The frayed filaments are handled on the page: "traced a braid where dawn followed dusk…and gently tugged the loose filament." The method's mechanics matter: wrong moves tighten knots, right moves advance the stair. Early signal, multiple beats, causal pressure, and closure (final thread drawn clean). The tapestry border is irreplaceable in the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The time-frozen village pressures Elior's choices: the mayor's suspended plea ("Solve it…Or fail"), the woven villagers who "seemed to look away from him in accusation," and the live contrast (only he and the tower obey time). The setting supplies the puzzle (tapestry depicting Harrenfeld) and the stakes (unfreeze the hush). Early signal (paragraphs two–three), development (frozen accusation charges his work), and payoff (raindrops resume). The village is essential to the closure image. Solid integration; the setting is both crucible and closure participant.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" frames the opening (paragraph three) and recurs when the tapestry shudders and "the tower's plates rang like chilled goblets" at closure. The timeframe is more atmospheric than tactical—no live clock tightens decisions, and Elior works "hours that could not pass." The lull charges the threshold moment (arrival coincides with the freeze) but does not constrain mid-work choices. Two-gate presence (setup and closure participation) with lyric reprise, but no development pressure. Mid-band: purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation—"to forgive oneself for past mistakes"—is dramatized in the prince's memory (paragraph nine: "trusting, as though Elior's lines of play were holy writ") and the mid-work pivot (paragraph thirty-one: "discarding pride…the wish to forgive oneself…not erase them, not excuse them, but live beside them without flinching"). The motive is conflicted: redemptive applause versus bare self-forgiveness. It drives the final gesture: drawing the thread clean with "that bare intention steady in his chest." Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage. Cost is visible: he must carry the past forward. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is named in paragraph twenty-four ("fidgeting not from anxiety but from a fierce repose, a stillness honed sharp as a blade") and governs the tone through the winnowing sequence: calm concentration under existential stakes, motion within stasis. The tone modulates subtly—initial dread ("shroud"), focused work, then quiet resolution—without breaking coherence. It charges the final image: the tower rings, the raindrops fall, and the gesture is both fierce (decisive) and reposed (quiet). The tone is consistent and elevates the closure. Solid integration; irreplaceable in the story's emotional register.</comment>
