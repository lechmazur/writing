<comment>Lio's motives are consistent—his drive to create music in silence is embodied through concrete actions (threading copper, shaping living instruments). Interior texture is present but relies on filtered perception ("he wonders," "he reasons," "he believes") that dulls immediacy at key moments. Ina's embodied reaction (gasping silently, feeling vibrations) adds specificity, but the final realization ("knows he has finally created music") edges toward summary rather than lived contradiction. The grove's unified motion and Lio's exhausted collapse provide visible cost, lifting the ending above convenience.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through Lio's history with the sculpture, the grove's instrumentation, and the shared strumming that triggers collective motion. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the grove moves as one, "new music continues inside every moving body," and Lio feels the pulse "between his ribs." Cost is present (exhaustion, sinking to the ground) but felt rather than decisive. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the hedgehog's uncurling (~line 3), satisfying the test. One meaningful deepening occurs when the copper trembles through soil and the grove responds, reweighting the dominant stake (creating music) with visible empathy-in-motion.</comment>

<comment>The siskin alder grove is established early and returns throughout: the tallest alder, porcelain insulator, copper wire, mossy roots, leaf mold, mushrooms, grass blades, and the hedgehog all contribute to spatial choreography. The copper wire threaded between trunks constrains Lio's final action—strumming requires the setup, and the grove's unified sway depends on the rooted network. The insulator as remnant of "electric speech" charges the final image by linking past sound to present motion. Sensory detail (chill of porcelain, trembling copper, leaf litter underfoot) is selective and tied to POV focus, avoiding catalog mode.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake ("create music in a silent world") is signaled in line 7 and drives every beat. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lio and Ina strum the copper together—the grove's unified motion ("each living thing responding with minute adjustments") narrows options from solo experiment to collective empathy. Cost is visible: exhaustion, sinking to the ground, and the hedgehog curling again bracket the expenditure. Agency resides in Lio's decision to place Ina's fingers on the copper and the shared strumming act that transforms the grove. The resolution is earned by prior setup (sculpture cracks, living instruments, copper threading) rather than coincidence.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme—sound as empathy in motion, connection surviving silence—emerges from particulars (cracks in sculpture, grove instrumentation, shared trembling) without overt thesis. The ending image ("quiet pulse between his ribs," "new music continues inside every moving body") offers a non-literal answer: music persists as felt connection rather than audible note. Subtext operates in Ina's signed exchange ("maybe the world will move with us"), the hedgehog's pause mid-sniff, and the grove's shudder, all implying agency and response. The piece resists moralizing; the final line ("finally created music in a silent world") verges on thematic statement but stays grounded in Lio's embodied realization. One recurring image—the porcelain insulator—shifts from "useless remnant" to active conduit, charging closure.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Lio with controlled distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lio reads branches as scores, leaves as scattered notes, cracks as melody—anchoring voice in his symphonic mindset. Filter verbs ("he wonders," "he reasons," "he believes," "he senses") cluster in reflective passages and slightly dull immediacy, especially in the opening third. Ina's signed dialogue ("You are late," "maybe the world will move with us") carries subtext and goal-driven economy. The final lines compress into summarizing interiority ("knows he has finally created music") rather than trusting image alone, which softens the ending's punch.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Opening lines anchor voice and setting cleanly ("Morning comes late to the siskin alder grove, as if light tiptoes on its toes"). Repeated sentence stems in the expository block ("Elders tell," "He learned," "He mapped," "Those lines led") create template cadence across four adjacent lines, triggering −0.5. "Tiptoes on its toes" is a minor stumble. Filter-verb stacks ("he wonders," "he reasons," "he believes," "he learned," "he calls") in the middle third dull momentum without adding pressure, adding −0.3. Information density is uneven: the sculpture backstory (lines 14–19) compresses setup efficiently, but adjacent lines paraphrase the same "cracks recorded silence" idea. No loops in the closure beat; the grove's motion and Lio's final pulse carry clean propulsion.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Premise—sculpting music through motion in a silent world—offers a fresh synthesis of disability narrative, synaesthesia, and ecological connection. The porcelain insulator (remnant of "electric speech") and stress cracks in sculpture as musical notation are specific, non-obvious anchors. "Empathy in motion" as concept and Ina's scarred palms as instruments ground the world in lived detail. The turn (grove moving as one, "dancers obeying an unheard rhythm") feels earned by prior setup. Risk is present but modulated: the ending confirms success rather than testing its limits, and Lio's interiority stays accessible rather than alien. Transformation test: plot and arc would lose specificity if transplanted (the copper, insulator, and sculpture cracks are integral).</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Lio (tree-song sculptor) is present throughout and drives key choices: threading copper, placing Ina's fingers on the wire, and strumming. His sculptural work (shaping living instruments, mapping cracks) constrains tactics and primes the closure beat. The strumming decision is the central action; removing Lio's specific craft would break the story's logic. Causal pressure is evident across setup (analyzing sculpture), middle (showing Ina the sketchbook, positioning her), and payoff (joint strumming triggers grove motion). Cost is visible (exhaustion, sinking to ground). Score reflects strong setup, beat involvement, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The porcelain insulator appears in three distinct beats: introduced as "smooth white remnant" on the tallest alder (line 10), handled by Lio ("cups it gently, feeling its chill," line 13), and threaded with copper wire for the climactic strumming (line 25). It evolves from useless relic to active conduit, charging the closure by linking past "electric speech" to present empathy-in-motion. Removal would weaken the historical resonance and the copper-threading logic. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met; causal role and specificity justify mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>"Empathy in motion" is named explicitly (line 21), defined as "feeling when fingers on bark seem to echo in his chest" (line 21), and demonstrated on-page when the grove moves as one ("each living thing responding with minute adjustments, like dancers obeying an unheard rhythm," line 39). The concept shapes stakes (creating connection without sound), tactics (shared strumming, placement of hands), and closure ("motion carries feeling the way sound once did," line 42). Cost is tied to the concept: exhaustion from collective effort. The phrase recurs in the penultimate paragraph, reweighting prior labor. High integration across setup, middle choice, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"Symphonically minded" is stated (line 8), demonstrated through Lio reading "swaying branches like scores, and fallen leaves like scattered, unheard notes" (line 9), and shapes his approach (shaping living instruments, threading copper). It constrains perception—he interprets motion as music—but does not force a visible tradeoff or cost on the page. The trait is present in setup and colors middle beats (showing Ina the sketchbook "where fractures...spiral into designs for living instruments"), but closure leans on the joint strumming action rather than this specific trait. Functional but not indispensable; swapping to "pattern-minded" would require minor edits only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>"Strum" is the climactic action: "lets his fingers strum the wire in a slow, deliberate arc" (line 37) triggers the grove's unified motion, the turning point. The verb is prepared by "hidden cords of bark wait to be strummed" (line 24) and is irreplaceable—plucking, tapping, or striking would alter the musical metaphor and tactile resonance. Ina gasps, the alder shudders, mushrooms tilt, the hedgehog pauses, and the grove sways: all consequences trace to this action. Setup, beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all strong. Removing "strum" would break the ending's logic and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The method ("analyzing stress cracks in a long-forgotten sculpture") is stated (line 18), expanded ("mapped the spidering fractures, believing the cracks recorded the moment when the world went mute," line 17), and shown in the sketchbook ("fractures from the broken sculpture spiral into designs for living instruments," line 32). It enables Lio's approach (the cracks "led him here," line 19) and primes his belief that motion can wake empathy. However, the method is recounted rather than dramatized; we do not see Lio tracing cracks or testing the resulting designs on-page. Middle development is present (showing Ina the sketchbook), but the mechanics do not constrain a live choice or visibly shape the strumming. Setup and payoff gates met; development is summary-only, capping mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The siskin alder grove is anchored early ("this intensely quiet hollow," line 2; "tallest alder," line 10) and supplies resources that alter outcome: the alder trunks for threading copper, the hollowed knots for wind, the soil and roots for transmitting vibration, and the spatial arrangement (two trunks, distance) that enables the strumming. The grove's unified response (leaves rippling, mushrooms tilting, grass swaying) is the story's climax. Removing the grove's specific features (alders, insulator, copper, roots) would break closure. Setup, development (Lio's work shaping instruments), and payoff (collective motion) all strong. Causal pressure and closure linkage justify mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Timeframe ("after the hedgehog uncurls") is stated in line 3, returns when "the hedgehog pauses mid-sniff" (line 39), and bookends closure ("when at last the hedgehog curls again into its mossy nest, the grove settles," line 44). It provides a lyric bracket but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—Lio's work proceeds without urgency, and the hedgehog's actions are observational markers rather than countdown pressure. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development absent (the hedgehog does not constrain a choice). Functional framing device but replaceable with any diurnal marker; score reflects presence and reprise without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Motivation ("to create music in a silent world") is stated (line 7), dramatized through Lio's daily work (shaping instruments, threading copper, strumming), and tested at closure when the grove moves as one and Lio feels the pulse "between his ribs" (line 45). The desire drives every beat and faces friction: his craft is "useless curiosity" (line 6), sound is gone, and he must invent new forms (motion, empathy). Cost is visible (exhaustion, years of effort implied by the sculpture analysis). The motivation shapes stakes, constrains tactics (partnering with Ina, using copper), and charges the final image. Setup, development, and payoff all strong; high integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"Intensely quiet" is established in line 2 ("even the breeze seems to hold its breath"), sustained through descriptions of silent actions (Lio cupping the insulator, Ina signing, the grove moving without sound), and charged at closure ("world remains silent, yet everywhere around him motion carries feeling," line 42). Tone modulates subtly: calm in the opening, purposeful during the setup, breathless at the climax ("Ina gasps silently"), and settled at the end ("hedgehog curls again"). The tone is coherent across turns and directly supports the premise (music without sound). High integration with setup, development, and payoff; the quiet charges the final image by making motion the sole carrier of feeling.</comment>
