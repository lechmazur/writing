<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and their reflective interiority is distinct ("cowardice," "fear prickled"), but the story relies heavily on reflection rather than dramatized internal contradiction acting simultaneously. The Arithene vow mechanism provides cognitive constraint ("any attempt would snag"), but the protagonist's micro-choices under pressure remain largely cerebral—copying text, feeling relief—rather than embodied struggle with competing impulses. The final resolution (stepping out with "new music") is earned by the archive work, though the change reads more as equipped confidence than a choice that foreclosed a live path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening beat (archive, linguist, Liora backstory). The causal lens holds: silence → archive quest → Arithene discovery → vow construction → meeting departure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the vow "settled into my throat" and the protagonist steps toward the meeting with "something steadier," crystallizing the stance with felt internal cost (can no longer speak half-truths). The cost is legible in the final image's "frantic rhythm" beneath "steadier" music, though the meeting itself remains off-page, so the social price is anticipated rather than paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive's "shelves curved like fossilized ribs" and "crumbling inks" create vivid texture. The glass ink well and vellum page function as micro-setting tools that constrain the protagonist's choices—dipping the pen triggers the room's "attentive as a jury" response, and the script's glow signals the vow's taking effect. Spatial choreography (desk, shaft of light, cleared patch) remains clear. The archive enables the Arithene discovery and charges the final act, satisfying the constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore trust with Liora before the final meeting—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist realizes "no second chance to speak." The Arithene vow construction is a meaningful escalation under the causal lens: copying the script binds the protagonist to honesty, foreclosing evasion as a tactic ("the only safe way forward was honesty"). The meeting departure carries visible cost (fear, "frantic rhythm"), though the confrontation itself is off-page. One clean tightening with felt price is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as cowardice, language as bridge, honesty as structural obligation. The Arithene grammar ("symphonies of truth") functions as both tool and metaphor, and the vow's lattice-of-promises design avoids abstract moralizing. The final image—"frantic rhythm" beneath "steadier" music—reweights the opening's "ghosts of unsaid things" without stating a thesis. The ink well's "relieved" tremor and the throat's changed texture provide non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV distance is stable throughout; the narrative voice carries the protagonist's professional idiom ("arcane linguist," "symphonies of truth") blended with emotional urgency ("wild relief of finally turning toward the wound"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately at peak moments (copying the vow, feeling the lattice settle). No head-hopping. The prose modulates from reflective opening to action-driven middle to emotionally charged ending. Filter verbs ("feeling the grammar tighten") serve voice and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the vow-construction beat. However, several figurative constructions in adjacent lines approach density overload without pattern-teaching: "like fossilized ribs," "like a patient eye," "like a harness," "like braided wire" cluster in the first half. "Attentive as a jury" and "the wild relief" work, but "symphonies of truth" repeats from paragraph to paragraph without evolving pressure. Minor scaffold: "I vowed to..." repeated in two consecutive sentences. Propulsion is strong in the second half, and the closure beat is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Arithene "lattice of interconnected promises" offers a fresh inflection on apology and truth-telling, avoiding therapy-speak. The archive setting and glass ink well are specific rather than generic. The synthesis of extinct language grammar + personal trust repair feels earned in hindsight. However, the "language that binds speaker to honesty" concept echoes familiar fantasy tropes (true-names, binding oaths), and the emotional arc—silence, quest for tool, return equipped—follows a recognizable structure. Transformation is present but moderate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The arcane linguist profession frames the protagonist's competence (reading Arithene, modifying the vow) and enables the archive quest. The protagonist's choices—entering the archive, selecting the Arithene text, inscribing and adapting the vow—drive all major beats. The profession is causally necessary: a non-linguist could not decode or modify the script. Present in setup, development (vow construction), and payoff (departure with transformed voice).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The glass ink well appears in three beats: set on the desk, dipped to activate the room's attention, and cradled at departure. Its "distilled residue of a hundred obsolete dyes" ties it thematically to extinct languages, and the final tremor ("as if relieved") charges it with minor animacy. However, it functions primarily as atmospheric tool rather than causal lever—the protagonist could have used any ink to copy the vow. Lyric reprise (opening mention → final cradle) reweights it slightly, but swappability caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Symphonies of truth shape the entire quest: the protagonist seeks "phrases so precisely tuned that they rang through the listener without distortion" to restore trust. The Arithene grammar's mechanics—interconnected promises that make lying structurally impossible—dictate the vow's construction and constrain the protagonist's future speech. The concept drives the middle beat (copying and modifying the vow) and charges the ending (throat changed, "new music"). Essential to both stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Carefully reckless" is explicitly named in the text ("carefully reckless work, like walking a tightrope") and describes the method of summoning truth-phrases. The protagonist enacts this trait by entering the archive (risky) and binding themselves to honesty (calculated). However, the trait functions more as thematic descriptor than constraint that visibly narrows options—there is no moment where recklessness costs the protagonist or where carefulness prevents disaster. Present in setup and development but not charged with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" appears in the inciting premise ("the key to unsnarl a knot I had tied") and is dramatized in the vow-construction beat, where the protagonist threads "our futures through the syntax like braided wire" to "unsnarl our distance via interconnected promises." The action defines the protagonist's goal and the Arithene method delivers it. The final departure suggests the knot is now workable. Removing "unsnarl" would require reframing the entire conflict; swapping it for "resolve" or "fix" would weaken specificity but not break structure, placing it in mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interconnected promises are the Arithene method, seeded early ("lattice of interconnected promises that made lying structurally impossible"), operationalized in the vow construction ("Each promise I inscribed linked to another, a chain of clauses"), and felt at closure ("the lattice inside me"). The method's mechanics matter: evasion will "snag and tear," forcing honesty as the only safe path. The protagonist's new constraint is the story's pivot. Essential to escalation and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The extinct language archive supplies the Arithene text and creates atmospheric pressure ("breathed around me," "attentive as a jury"). The protagonist's entrance, search, and discovery occur on-site, and the archive's "shelves curved like fossilized ribs" charge the setting with thematic resonance. However, the archive functions primarily as resource rather than obstacle—the protagonist encounters no physical or social friction there. Present in setup, middle, and thematically at closure (stepping "out of the archive's shadow"), but its role is enabling rather than constraining.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Before paths diverge for good" is stated early and the "hour we had agreed to meet one last time" anchors the deadline. The timeframe tightens the protagonist's urgency and motivates the archive quest. However, elapsed time within the archive remains vague—no clock pressure during the vow construction, and the meeting is off-page. The deadline shapes setup and departure but does not alter tactics mid-scene. Present in two gates (setup, payoff) with moderate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Restoring trust after silence is the story's dominant stake, signaled immediately ("I had broken trust... answered her confession with nothing but silence") and dramatized through the vow construction. The motivation is conflicted: fear versus "wild relief," cowardice versus courage. The protagonist's choices (entering the archive, inscribing promises, departing toward the meeting) all serve this desire, and the final cost—binding themselves to honesty—directly addresses the silence that broke trust. Essential across all beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is explicitly named ("beneath it rose a cautious exuberance") and modulates through the story: opening dust and ghosts (cautious), discovery of the Arithene text (rising hope), vow construction (exuberant relief), and departure (frantic yet steadier). The tone supports the emotional arc and charges the final image's dual rhythm. However, the explicit naming reduces subtlety, and the tone is declared rather than purely enacted through syntax and image. Present in middle and ending with coherent progression.</comment>
