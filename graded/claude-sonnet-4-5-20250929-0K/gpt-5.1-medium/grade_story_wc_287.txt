<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior life is rendered through concrete action—threading the tooth, arranging fragments—but her final promise ("keep making small, improbable safeties") edges toward label-speak rather than embodied discovery. The trait "wistfully pragmatic" appears as assertion more than contradiction acting in scene. Embodied emotion is strong in the middle beats (touching the tooth, feeling "foolish and fiercely tender"), and the choice to create the light-scattering installation carries visible cost (exposure, vulnerability made public). Minor deduction for the whispered promise that tells rather than shows the stance shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara steps back "finally certain that vulnerability can stand guard too," reweighting her protective impulse with a new image of openness. The cost is felt—she commits to exposure without guarantee of return. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The story operates under an Accumulative lens: the petal drop triggers a cascade of reflective beats that deepen her understanding of her father's work and her own gardening, culminating in the act of arranging light-scattering objects. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes she wants "to reflect light into dark corners" and acts on it. Minor penalty for the amount of reflective material (roughly 40% of the text) that, while anchored in present stimuli, slightly flattens forward momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fire escape, harbor, and alley are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("blade of moonlight up the alley," "stairwell's throat"). The barge's swing and the resulting light physically cue Mara's realization, meeting the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is coherent across the narrow sill, pots, and railing. The old woman on the second floor provides brief environmental consequence. The harbor functions as both backdrop and symbolic anchor but does not directly constrain a choice at closure—Mara's decision to arrange the fragments is driven by internal realization rather than environmental pressure—keeping the score shy of the high 8s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara's impulse to create safety through tending, inherited from her father. The final petal dropping functions as the inciting pressure that prompts her to reconfigure her method. One meaningful deepening occurs when she admits "what she really wants" and acts on it by assembling the light installation. The cost is legible—she exposes her grief and vulnerability to neighbors' view with no promise of response ("like a child leaving a lamp burning for someone who may never knock"). Escalation is gentle but coherent under the Accumulative lens. Minor deduction: the protagonist's agency feels more like realization than a choice that forecloses a competing option; the decision to hang the fragments carries symbolic weight but limited tactical friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—inheritance of care, vulnerability as a form of strength, light as emotional transmission—emerges organically from the lockmaster motif, the garden, and the final installation without stated moral. The ending offers a resonant answer: "vulnerability can stand guard too" reweights the father's legacy and Mara's protective impulse without sermonizing. The recurring lock/light metaphor accumulates pressure and pays off when Mara arranges the fragments "as if aligning hidden tumblers." Subtext operates strongly in gesture (threading the tooth, whispering the promise). One line edges toward thematic echo: "vulnerability can stand guard" articulates the thesis a bit directly, though it's embedded in dramatized action. The piece sustains complexity—no tidy redemption, only a committed act with uncertain outcome.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout, with psychic distance varying purposefully (closer during the assembly, wider for the harbor description). Perceptual signature is character-specific: Mara notices "cracked teacups," "saved odds and ends," "bottle shards." Vocabulary stays within her lexicon except for one phrase—"reflect light into dark corners"—which, while apt, hovers near metaphor-speak. Rhythm modulates well: longer, lyric sentences during reflection, shorter fragments during the hanging action ("One flash skims the fire alarm, another grazes a forgotten prayer flag"). No dialogue appears; interior voice is consistent. Filter verbs ("feels," "realizes," "thinks") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Minor penalty for the whispered promise, which tilts slightly into helpful-narrator mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but largely coherent ("blade of moonlight," "alley's throat," "low-slung constellation"). Two clusters merit attention: "quivering hush" appears twice in identical phrasing without reweighting, a paraphrase loop. The phrase "with the rhythm of oars in water" is used twice—once as backstory anchor, once as present action—but feels slightly forced on the second use. Template cadence: several paragraphs open with "Mara [verb]" or "The [noun]," though the effect does not obscure causality. Information density is strong; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Proofreading is clean. The accumulation of loops and stems in non-closure beats warrants a −0.5 deduction in this category only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fire-escape garden as emotional laboratory and the lockmaster's tooth as inherited tool are fresh particulars. The transformation of grief into light-scattering installation offers a non-obvious synthesis of the father's work and Mara's tending. However, the core emotional arc—solitary woman processes parental loss through symbolic craft project—follows a recognizable template. The "wistfully pragmatic" label and the "vulnerability can stand guard" articulation feel slightly workshopped. The piece commits to its premise and follows through with specificity (bitting gauge tooth, bollard, harbor masts), but the central turn (realization → installation) is more reflective than boldly risky. Mid-7s reflects solid execution of familiar material with specific detail rather than a truly singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's decision to assemble the light installation is the story's central turn. She appears in every beat, but many are reflective rather than decisional until the final third. Her agency drives the closure: she threads the tooth, arranges the fragments, and steps back with new certainty. The choice alters her stance and creates visible cost (exposure). Setup is early (paragraph 2), development occurs in the middle third (admitting what she wants), and payoff is the final installation and stance shift. Score reflects solid causal pressure and closure linkage, slightly reduced by the amount of observation preceding the decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bitting gauge tooth is introduced early (paragraph 8), returns in reflective beats tied to the father, and is physically handled in the climactic moment when Mara threads it through wire and hangs it above the rosebush. It appears in at least three distinct beats: introduction/backstory anchor, present talisman on the sill, and repurposed pendant. Its specific properties (lockmaster tool, inherited, tagged/returned) matter to meaning. It directly shapes the final image and charges the installation with inherited purpose. Score reflects strong setup, middle reflection, and decisive payoff, with causal pressure tied to the father's legacy and Mara's reconfiguration of "safety."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quivering hush" appears in three beats: the opening night, a reprise when the petal drops, and a final mention as the garden "hums in its quivering hush of glass and leaves." It frames the emotional atmosphere and modulates from grief to invitation to completion. However, it functions primarily as tonal motif rather than a constraint on Mara's options. It does not narrow choices or create tactical pressure; it colors the stakes without altering them. The lyric reprise reweights the opening mood, earning mid-5s for purposeful recurrence, but it remains more thematic than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is labeled in paragraph 6 and demonstrated through saving cracked teacups, rooting cuttings, and the final installation choice—she acts on a tender impulse but grounds it in physical assembly. The trait enables the closure decision: her pragmatic side reminds her "even if ghosts do not come, neighbors might," licensing the act. It constrains sentimentality without foreclosing the gesture. Setup is early, the trait is visible in multiple beats (saving, tending, assembling), and it modulates the final stance. Score reflects solid demonstration and one clear tradeoff (hope tempered by practical framing), slightly reduced by the label-first introduction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Instill" is the verb tied to Mara's goal: she has been "trying to instill a feeling of safety in everyone who glances up." The realization that she wants to "reflect light into dark corners" reprices that impulse and leads directly to the installation. The action is signaled early (paragraph 19), drives the middle reflective turn, and is enacted in the assembly sequence. Her hands "move with the rhythm of oars in water" as she arranges the fragments, and the outcome—neighbors receiving unexpected light—fulfills the instilling impulse in a new form. The verb is central to motivation and closure. Score reflects strong causal involvement and specificity, with minor reduction for the slightly abstract phrasing of the realization.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"With the rhythm of oars in water" appears twice: first as backstory description of the father's explanations (paragraph 11), then as present description of Mara's hands during assembly (paragraph 24). The second use directly links her method to his, charging the act with inherited cadence. However, the mechanics of "rhythm" are not operationalized—Mara does not use a specific technique that we see shaped by this metaphor. It functions as simile rather than method that alters tactics. Setup is early via backstory, and payoff occurs at the climactic beat, but middle development is absent. Score reflects purposeful reprise and thematic linkage, reduced by lack of mechanical specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The harbor is introduced early (paragraph 4) and returns in several beats: the barge swinging sends moonlight up the alley (paragraph 18), cueing Mara's realization, and the harbor bells ring midnight at closure (paragraph 33). It supplies the "blade of moonlight" that strikes the rose and triggers her decision, a meaningful micro-pressure moment. However, the harbor does not constrain Mara's options or supply a resource she manipulates—it functions as atmospheric catalyst and symbolic anchor rather than tactical setting. The luminous quality charges tone and primes the light-scattering theme. Score reflects solid tonal integration and one causal cue, falling short of high bands due to lack of ongoing tactical involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after the final petal drops"—is the story's inciting beat, signaled in the opening line and reprised in paragraph 16 ("as the last petal lets go"). The drop functions as threshold: Mara "feels something inside her loosen," and the night becomes "invitation" rather than grief. The clock is not ticking in real time, but the "after" creates urgency—this is the moment when waiting ends and action begins. The assembly happens "by the time she finishes," and midnight bells mark closure. Setup is immediate, the petal drop enables the middle realization, and the transition from waiting to acting shapes the arc. Score reflects strong thematic and causal involvement with visible cost (end of waiting, acceptance of the rose's death).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To reflect light into dark corners" is articulated in paragraph 20 and directly motivates the installation. Mara realizes this is "what she really wants," repricing her prior goal of "instilling safety." The desire is dramatized through the assembly: she angles fragments "to catch wayward glow and sling it sideways," enacting the metaphor physically. Friction exists between the want (to illuminate, to be seen) and the cost (exposure, uncertain return: "like a child leaving a lamp burning for someone who may never knock"). Setup occurs at the midpoint, the want drives the climactic action, and payoff is the neighbor's gleaming wall and Mara's final certainty. Score reflects strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and embodied cost, with minor reduction for the slightly on-the-nose phrasing of the realization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is introduced in paragraph 5 ("lived like this fire escape garden: exposed to wind and strangers' windows, pulsing with a protected vulnerability") and returned in the final line ("vulnerability can stand guard too"). The tone coheres throughout: tender yet unsentimental, exposed yet self-aware. It modulates as pressure rises—from passive endurance (tending in quiet) to active choice (making the installation public). The final image charges the tone by flipping the premise: vulnerability becomes the guard rather than the guarded. Setup is early, the tone shapes multiple beats (saving teacups, touching the tooth, feeling "foolish and fiercely tender"), and the payoff reweights it decisively. Score reflects strong coherence and charged final reprise, with minor reduction for the slightly thesis-like articulation at closure.</comment>
