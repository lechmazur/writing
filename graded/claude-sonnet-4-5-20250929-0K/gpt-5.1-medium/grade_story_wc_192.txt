<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's journey from isolation to tentative breathing is embodied through concrete images—warm metal, aligned scars, her breath hitching—and the shadow keeper's coaching feels earned by the sanctuary's accumulation of her prior departures. Interior states are mostly shown, though "tired of hovering" and the framing of drowning vs. being seen edge toward summary. The final choice to breathe differently is visible on the page, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than a specific forfeiture; we don't see what bridge-burning habit she must abandon or what relationship she might now attempt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the sanctuary materializes Mara's habit of leaving, scars become a language, and the final breath reconfigures her relationship to silence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "one more bridge began to burn in a different direction" reweights the premise with felt pressure, though the conceptual cost remains oblique—we don't see an on-page forfeiture or a live option foreclosed. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored within the opener), and the lens holds without contradiction through the textural crescendo of shared scars and aligned breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary, roofless under starlight, is vivid and purposeful: dust undisturbed except for one path, broken circles that frame the ritual. The doorknocker's warmth ("as though someone had just let go") and the threshold's static flicker anchor Mara's crossing. Scars as a micro-setting—pale ridges that glow and align—constrain the encounter's method and charge the closure image when their alignment enables breath, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: can Mara learn to breathe where suffocation has pooled? One meaningful tightening occurs when their scars align and memories unfurl, narrowing her option from passive drowning to active breath. The shadow keeper's line "you arrived here every time you walked away" deepens understanding and reweights her habit. Agency is present—she chooses to inhale—but the cost is atmospheric (what specific bridge or person she might approach differently) rather than a visible tradeoff, preventing a higher band under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—escape as drowning, breath as choice—emerges from the sanctuary's architecture and scar-language without overt statement. The final image "one more bridge began to burn in a different direction" offers a resonant, non-literal answer: instead of erasing connection, she begins to direct it with awareness. Minor dip: "loaded emptiness" and "breath you held back from them pooled" risk abstraction, yet the particulars (warm metal, aligned scars, river gnawing its reflection) ground the concept and resist moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; Mara's perceptual signature is consistent (silence "like water she could not swallow," breath "crossing the fading threshold between habit and choice"). Dialogue between Mara and the shadow keeper carries subtext and goal pursuit without over-explanation. Diction remains elevated but coherent; the shadow keeper's blurred edges and shifting shadows are filtered through Mara's encounter rather than omniscient assertion, maintaining distance and voice throughout the escalation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and most sentences advance image or pressure. Minor artifacts: "rehearsed silences and gentle excuses" is near-synonym churn; "the thin line of the threshold flicker along her skin like static" is a mixed metaphor (line/flicker/static); "trembling horizon" in the penultimate beat edges purple without clear vehicle. Figurative density is high but mostly controlled; no outright loops. Information density is strong, yet the repeated framing of breath and threshold risks redundancy across the second half.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The scar-language ritual and sanctuary-as-repository concept offer a fresh inflection on isolation-and-healing templates. "One more bridge began to burn in a different direction" is a memorable inversion. Yet the core arc—wounded person seeks mystical guide who offers wisdom leading to tentative healing—is a familiar scaffold, and the shadow keeper's instruction ("breathe") leans toward expected beats. Specificity (ashen charcoal, roofless circles, warm doorknocker) personalizes the frame but does not fully transform the underlying template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The shadow keeper is present early, offers his hands mid-scene (a choice that enables the scar-linking), and delivers the teaching that precipitates Mara's final breath. His decision to let her "choose which map of hurt she would trust first" shapes the encounter's method, and his command "Breathe" triggers the closure moment. Two beats (hand-offering, teaching) plus closure linkage earn solid mid-band; swappability for a generic guide and lack of visible cost on his side prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The doorknocker appears once: Mara lifts it, notes its warmth ("as though someone had just let go"), and knocks. It does not return or reweight; the warmth is evocative but does not constrain a later choice or charge the closure image. Single-beat use with vivid sensory detail but no development caps the score in functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Fading threshold" is seeded in the opener ("threshold between staying and leaving"), dramatized when Mara steps through and feels "the thin line of the threshold flicker along her skin," and reprised in the closure breath "crossing the fading threshold between habit and choice." The concept shapes stakes (can she cross from suffocation to breath?) and the final action directly invokes it. Three-gate presence and closure linkage with cost (the shift from habit to choice) justify the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Burns bridges carefully" is established early ("she burned bridges carefully, with rehearsed silences"), shown in backstory vignettes (deleting numbers, leaving apartments before dawn), and reweighted in the closure line "one more bridge began to burn in a different direction." The trait constrains her arrival (all contact cut off) and the shadow keeper's teaching explicitly addresses it. The cost—her suffocation—is legible, though the on-page pivot is more conceptual than a visible tradeoff of a specific relationship.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Encroach" appears once: "a cool darkness leaned forward to encroach on the night outside" when the door opens. The verb colors the threshold crossing but does not recur or drive a major turn; swapping it for "spill" or "advance" would not alter structure. Single-use metaphoric coloring without development places it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is signaled when the shadow keeper shows his palms ("This is how we speak here"), enacted when their palms meet and "memories unfurl," and credited at closure when "their shared scars aligned" and breath becomes possible. The method shapes the encounter's escalation (alignment enables teaching) and closure participation (aligned scars permit the final breath). Three gates plus causal pressure justify the score; lack of visible cost tied uniquely to the linking (rather than to the breath itself) prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" is named in the opener, anchors orientation throughout, and supplies the roofless architecture that lets starlight frame the ritual. The single undisturbed path forces Mara's route to the center; broken circles stage the alignment; starlight charges the final image ("within the ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight, one more bridge began to burn"). Setup, development (path and circles guide movement), and closure payoff with specificity that would break if removed earn high integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"After cutting off all contact" frames the story's opening and anchors Mara's isolation; the completed silence is the pressure that calls her to the sanctuary. The timeframe tightens her need (no one left to watch her fail) and the shadow keeper notes "You came late," reinforcing temporal cost. It does not track a live clock during the scene, but the post-contact void is causally active in setup and closure participation (the new bridge burns in a different temporal direction). Two gates plus modest causal pressure place it solidly mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach the suffocating to breathe" is seeded when Mara recalls hearing the shadow keeper "existed to teach the suffocating to breathe in the dark," dramatized when he says "To teach you how to breathe where there is no one to save you," and enacted in the closure command "Breathe" that she follows. The desire drives the encounter and the final action directly fulfills it. Friction between Mara's uncertainty (saved vs. seen drowning) and the teaching creates modest conflict, though the teaching itself proceeds without visible cost to the keeper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" is established in the opener ("emptiness here echoed instead of shouting," "loaded emptiness that pressed close"), sustained through dust, silence, and the shadow keeper's blurred edges, and modulates under pressure (memories unfurl, breath drags "like a river changing direction"). The tone charges the final image by holding the quiet weight through the climax rather than resolving into catharsis. Coherence across turns and closure participation with purposeful restraint justify the score.</comment>
