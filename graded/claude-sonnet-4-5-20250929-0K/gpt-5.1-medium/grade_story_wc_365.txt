<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lio's internal contradiction between mapping for others versus mapping themselves is embodied through the cyclical pattern and the shard-choice. The sensory-mapper trait is specific and shapes perception, though the talent's "seasons of dull, ordinary sight" never constrains an on-page choice. Interiority leans abstract ("dense star bending every decision") and the final shift feels asserted rather than dramatized through a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path. The Archivist remains functional but one-note, existing mainly to deliver exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early (overlapping realities, cyclical pattern) and holds it through closure. The corridor-of-selves moment provides a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lio "cuts loose the binding threads," and the final image—"a pattern that, for once, belonged only to this single world"—charges the ending with conceptual cost (foreclosing repetition). Orientation anchors arrive by the opening paragraph. The weakness: the middle relies heavily on exposition about cycles rather than on-page pressure that narrows options, and the shard's mechanics remain vague until the climax, limiting causal tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The repair bay is anchored early with vivid detail (flaking hazard stripes, ozone tang, cracked deck) and the green shard charges the final image by serving as the tool Lio uses to "redirect that momentum." Sensory hierarchy reflects Lio's mapper perception (currents of sound, heat, memory). The bay itself remains static scenery; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics, keeping it below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—breaking the cycle of repetition and self-abdication—is signaled early and tightens when Lio grasps the shard and chooses to "cut loose the binding threads" rather than "snap back into the comfort of repetition." That moment narrows options with visible cost (foreclosing all parallel Lios who turned away). The escalation is conceptual rather than scene-driven; the corridor sequence tells us about alternate paths without embodying a tactical trade-off, and no secondary loss (stamina, resource) appears to alter later moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cyclical structure and the "withheld truth" motif, which reweights from external secret to internal refusal. The final image—"a pattern that, for once, belonged only to this single world"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. The weakness: the Archivist's line "stop mapping for others and start mapping yourself" edges toward overt theme statement, and the corridor sequence risks abstract philosophizing ("withheld truth is not only what is hidden by others but what we quietly refuse to witness in ourselves") that tells the reader the theme rather than letting the scene dramatize it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature is present ("currents of sound, heat, memory, and probability") and diction is controlled, with purposeful compression ("withheld truth had mass in my imagination, like a dense star"). Psychic distance stays stable in first person. The Archivist's dialogue ("You always arrive here") and Lio's internal voice are clean, though brief. Weakness: Several filter verbs ("I thought my own mind had misfiled reality," "I realized") and the line "There was a tiredness in her that suggested she had delivered this line before" reads as slight emotional ventriloquism—Lio inferring internal state with unwarranted certainty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. The opening anchors voice and the final line recharges prior motifs cleanly. Weaknesses cluster in the middle third: synonym loops ("weave between worlds the way other people weave between crowded market stalls"), abstract scaffolding ("the withheld truth had mass in my imagination"), and filter-verb stacks in reflective beats ("I knew then," "I realized"). The corridor sequence contains paraphrase loops ("Each path carried a different weight… and in the press I finally understood") that dull momentum. These artifacts do not obscure closure but reduce propulsion entering the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The cyclical-loop premise combined with sensory mapping and parallel-universe mechanics offers a fresh synthesis, and the "withheld truth as self-refusal" turn feels earned in hindsight. The shard as a redirect tool rather than mere debris is a specific inflection. Weakness: the core structure—looping protagonist meets guide who explains the loop, then breaks free—echoes widely used templates; transformation arises more from thematic articulation than from lived-in world logic or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lio appears in the opening and closure beats. The mapper trait shapes perception throughout and the final choice to "cut loose the binding threads" is a clear decision that alters tactics. The trait enables the corridor sequence and the shard interaction. Weakness: the sensory-mapping talent is described extensively but never constrains an on-page action with visible cost—Lio does not sacrifice perception or face a tradeoff tied to the cyclical spontaneity. The closure choice is present but its cost is conceptual rather than embodied in a visible price paid.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shard appears early (first third), is handled in the mid-beat ("my fingers closed around the green glass"), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure ("used the shard to redirect that momentum"). Its specific properties—"sharp enough to draw thin threads of color," "the knot in that weave"—matter to the ending. Weakness: the shard's mechanics are vague until the climax; we learn it is "perhaps a broken instrument meant to redirect the flows of experience" but not how or why, limiting irreplaceability. It does not shape a second distinct middle beat; the handle-and-redirect is one contiguous action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept is signaled early ("weave between worlds") and returns in the overlapping-realities bay description and the corridor-of-selves sequence. It shapes the ending's stakes—choosing one world over infinite repetition. Weakness: "weaving between worlds" remains largely metaphorical; no on-page choice is enabled or constrained by the mechanics of that weaving. The talent is a perceptual lens, not a tactical tool that alters options under pressure. The concept charges theme but does not drive a middle beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The cyclical-spontaneous trait is introduced in the first third and mentioned again at closure ("old cycles buck like misaligned gears"). It provides backstory texture and explains why Lio's talent comes in surges. Weakness: the trait never constrains an on-page action with visible cost. Lio does not suffer a dull season mid-story or face a trade-off between surge clarity and ordinary sight. It remains label-only, swappable with "intermittent" or "unpredictable" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The redirect action appears in the climax ("used the shard to redirect that momentum, cutting loose the binding threads") and definitionally turns the story from repetition to singularity. It redefines Lio's options at closure. Weakness: the action is introduced and executed in a single beat with no setup in the middle that makes the redirect possible or teaches its mechanics. The verb "redirect" is present throughout (the shard is "meant to redirect the flows of experience") but the actual redirect maneuver feels like a late capability rather than one earned across beats. Still, it is the hinge of closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Parallel universes are signaled in the first third ("hosting rehearsals of itself from parallel universes") and dramatized in the corridor-of-selves sequence where Lio encounters alternate paths. The method matters to the thematic payoff—choosing one timeline with visible cost. Weakness: the mechanics are decorative rather than tactical; Lio does not navigate the universes as a means to solve a problem or test a hypothesis. The method is shown at closure but does not shape mid-story attempts or enable a choice earlier than the climax.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The repair bay is anchored early, provides vivid atmosphere (flaking stripes, ozone, cracked deck), and the setting's overlapping-realities quality ties to the core concept. The final image returns to the bay "quieter than before" with a charged reprieve. Weakness: the bay does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome; it is a stage rather than a constraint. Micro-setting elements (the shard, the bay's dust motes) charge the ending image but do not shape a middle beat or tactic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe appears in the opening line and is echoed at closure ("suspended in the murmur of half-remembered dreams"). It provides atmospheric texture and ties to the cyclical-loop motif. Weakness: time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the narrative clock is vague, with no urgency or deadline. The phrase functions as lyric flavor rather than a constraint. The element is present but ornamental, easily replaced with "in a fog of déjà vu" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation is introduced early ("the withheld truth had mass in my imagination") and drives Lio to accept the Archivist's summons. It reweights at closure when Lio realizes the truth is "the pattern of my own repetition." The desire creates friction—Lio seeks external revelation but finds internal refusal. Weakness: the motivation is articulated more than dramatized in conflicted on-page choices. The peak choice (grasping the shard) is driven by the motive, but no earlier micro-choice embodies the want-versus-cost tension under pressure.</comment>

---

**Drive Lens Inference:** Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through overlapping realities, cyclical motifs, and reflective layering, culminating in a final image that reweights the premise (singularity versus repetition) with conceptual cost. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Lio's choice crystallizes options and forecloses the comfort of repetition, and the cost is felt even if not physically paid on the page.

**Closure Unit:** Lio grasps the shard, travels the corridor of alternate selves, and uses the shard to "cut loose the binding threads," resulting in "a pattern that, for once, belonged only to this single world." This is a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual and relational cost (foreclosing all parallel paths). The Archivist's waiting silence confirms the shift.

**Dominant Stake:** Breaking the cycle of self-abdication and mapping oneself rather than others' blind spots.

**High-Band Eligibility Check (Q1–Q8 for 9+):** Q2=7.4 (below 9.0 threshold), so no category may reach 9.0 per the global gate. Additionally, Q4=7.2 (below 8.2), Q7=6.9 (below 8.2), which independently bar high-band entry per the tightened gate. All categories capped at 8.7 by rule, though none approached that ceiling on merit.

**Cross-Caps Applied:** None. Orientation is clear, lens is inferrable by midpoint and held at closure, and no heavy line-level debt (Q7=6.9 is above the 7.0 floor for artifact caps).
