<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arlen is established through voice and choices—forging permits, navigating Ministry rules—with consistent roguish competence. The entomologist's moment ("when thoughts became taxable, her students stopped asking why") delivers genuine interiority, but most secondary figures (Mara, Jin) remain functional placeholders distinguished only by props (satchel, seedlings). The core motivation ("stand guard over your own spark of defiance") is declared rather than tested through contradictory impulses, and no visible choice forecloses a path with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first two paragraphs. The accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece layers detail about the secret language project, building density through the gourd seed, the map, the entomologist's arrival, culminating in "a quiet grammar blooms beneath its taxed dreams." Closure reads as Charged Poise—the work continues with no decisive turn, but the final image crystallizes the collective stance and reconfigures the opening vow. Cost is conceptual (ongoing risk, complicity) rather than a visible forfeiture on the page, which keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: glowing terrariums, clicking beetles, fern fronds—all chosen to mask forbidden speech and test the lexicon. "Beetles for verbs, bees for questions, moths for warnings" integrates insects as functional alphabet, not ornament. The map and community gardens supply spatial tactics, and the entomologist's clipboard-shield moment grounds her choice in setting. The final image ("quiet grammar blooms beneath its taxed dreams") charges the setting with thematic weight, meeting the 9+ environment test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—evading Ministry audits to plant a subversive grammar—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates (seed purchases trigger recalculations, the entomologist steps from shadows) but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The entomologist's accession is offered, not won; her request to "save her a seat" lands as affirmation rather than escalation. The piece deepens texture without a tightening choice, fitting the accumulative lens but lacking the felt cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—language as resistance under cognitive taxation—emerges organically from every element: the gourd seed's untraceable syllables, the garden lexicon, the entomologist's lament about curiosity's cost. The final line ("a quiet grammar blooms beneath its taxed dreams") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates consistently in image and implication ("strangers visit with shovels and questions and leave with empty notebooks and dirty knees"). No slips into theme-summary or prompt-echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arlen's voice is distinct and consistent: "my friends call me a charming rogue scholar, which is kinder and closer to the truth," "speaking in footnotes when prosecutors demand simple answers." Diction stays controlled and idiomatically specific ("candidly cryptic," "church of chlorophyll," "taxed ember inside every skull"). The entomologist's single line of dialogue carries subtext and goal. Focalization remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (mantis "as if already taking notes," beetles as "impatient typewriters") reflects Arlen's wry scholarliness throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances world-building, character stance, or the lexicon project. Rhythm varies purposefully, and metaphors ("bottled moons," "dry little heart") remain coherent. Minor template-cadence echoes appear in the exposition blocks ("According to law... According to us," "Mara taps... Jin adds") but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. Propulsion stays clean through the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of taxable thoughts, garden-based semiotics, and insect-mediated code feels specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging, following world logic (Ministry audits, seed purchase tracking) through to the closure. The "candidly cryptic" dialect and multi-species alphabet (beetles/verbs, bees/questions, moths/warnings) demonstrate ingenuity. Risk-taking in the conceptual frame elevates without obscuring clarity. The story would not work with generic substitutions; the particulars are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arlen frames the premise, narrates the club's methods, and states his role (forging permits, warping paper trails). He appears in setup, middle exposition, and the final vow, but no on-page decision by Arlen alters tactics or forecloses a path. His "charming rogue" label colors voice but does not constrain a choice with cost. Functional presence across beats without causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gourd rattle seed is introduced early ("ticks faintly when she moves"), described as "our newest instrument, a dry little heart that shakes out syllables no algorithm can yet decode," and participates in the prototype-phrase test ("marigolds and mealworms"). Two beats with thematic charge, but no choice turns on its properties and it does not reappear in the closure image. Swappable with another untraceable sound device.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The secret language club shapes the entire arc: its formation ("to stand guard over your own spark of defiance"), its method (cipher upgrade to garden lexicon), and its consequences (Ministry audits, entomologist's accession). Setup, middle development (map planning, greenhouse tests), and closure ("a quiet grammar blooms") all depend on this concept. Removing it collapses the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Candidly cryptic" is named once ("a dialect we designed to sound candidly cryptic, as if we are confessing and concealing at the same time") and colors the narrative's double-edged exposition, but no on-page action is constrained or enabled by this trait with visible cost. It describes the group's rhetorical stance without forcing a tactical trade-off. Present in setup, thematically consistent, but label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Warp" appears in two roles: Arlen "warps the paper trail" (middle beat, tactics) and the club plans to "warp the city without a single illegal word" (outcome claim). The forgery tactic matters (dummy collectives, research grants) and enables the project, but the verb itself is swappable with "bend," "obscure," or "manipulate" without altering logic. Functional across beats, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (map showing six gardens in a spiral), detailed in the middle (color, height, flowering time, insect density as alphabet), tested in the greenhouse (marigolds and mealworms), and embodied in closure ("a quiet grammar blooms"). It shapes the club's tactics and the ending image. Mechanics matter and are dramatized across beats. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse anchors every beat: setup (clicking beetles, glowing terrariums), middle (testing arrangements that attract species, entomologist's emergence from shadows), and closure (working "while the city sleeps"). It provides both cover (plausible background noise) and function (grammar school for the lexicon). Spatial details (fern fronds, potting bench, mantis) pressure choices and charge the final image. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is established in the opening line and governs every stake: Thought Tariff adjustments, seed purchase audits, the Ministry's surveillance. It appears in setup, middle (weekly Ministry changes), and closure reference ("while the city sleeps"). However, no on-page clock tightens a decision or forces a tactic shift with visible urgency. Present across structure, conceptually load-bearing, but passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation is declared early ("to stand guard over your own spark of defiance, the tiny taxed ember inside every skull"), drives the lexicon project, and is embodied in the entomologist's accession ("save her a seat in whatever sentence we are writing"). It shapes the group's choices and the closure vow. Friction between desire (resistance) and cost (audit risk, complicity) is present but not dramatized in a single pivotal choice. Strong thematic integration without decisive trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Converging chaos" is named once ("his eyes glitter with the same converging chaos that has been gathering over our city for months") and reflected in escalating Ministry adjustments, audit pressure, and the entomologist's trembling hands. Tone modulates from wry (opening voice) to tense (entomologist's arrival) to resolute (final vow). Present in setup and middle, charges the entomologist beat, but does not dominate or sharply shift at closure. Coherent across beats without decisive tonal turn.</comment>
