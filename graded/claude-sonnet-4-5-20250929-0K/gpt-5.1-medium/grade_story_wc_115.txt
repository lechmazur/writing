<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's religiously skeptical stance operates throughout, embodied in the sarcasm ("You really think dead men punched in for overtime") and the final shift where skepticism softens but doesn't vanish ("my religiously skeptical mind catalogues each name like evidence"). Evan's interior contradiction—swallowing truth to protect his livelihood versus the cost of silence—drives the narrative and is paid off when he presses his forehead to the pipe. The confession dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing both character and plot. However, the narrator's arc is more observational than decisional; the final "small rebalancing" reads as emotional witness rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (narrator, Evan), where (tunnel mouth then interior), and when (night, post-confession) within the first ~100 words. The piece accumulates pressure through layered images—rosary beads on the valve, phantom footfalls, the drip and metallic rhythm—that reweight Evan's guilt and the narrator's complicity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the truth "has finally found a place to rest that is not just his alone"), a measured deepening rather than a decisive physical turn. The cost is felt but oblique: Evan's whispered names and the narrator's shift from dismissal to cataloguing evidence mark a relational and emotional price. One deduction: the causal link between the radio psychics' "patterns" and this specific tunnel location feels slightly underbuilt on the page, though it does not break the closure effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tunnel is vividly anchored—"mineral cold," "gravel," "corroded pipe," "beaded valve wheel"—and evolves from threat to altar as the characters move deeper. The beaded rosary on the valve wheel is a micro-setting detail that charges the final image and constrains Evan's gesture (pressing his forehead to the pipe). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: the drip, the metallic rhythm, "vibrating dust" that resolves into phantom boots. The tunnel's breath metaphor recurs purposefully, framing the confession hush and the final rebalancing. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the setting's claustrophobia amplifies the stake of confronting a swallowed truth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to find the weight of Evan's swallowed truth and rebalance blame. The piece signals this early ("something that will finally let us find the weight of a swallowed truth") and tightens once when Evan's whispered confession names the hidden workers and the narrator moves from sarcasm to cataloguing names as evidence. That shift narrows options—dismissal is no longer tenable—but the narrator's agency remains largely receptive rather than decisional. Pressure accumulates via the tunnel's atmosphere and the beaded valve as rough altar, but the final image is a felt rebalancing rather than a choice that forecloses a path with a hard cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, and the cost is legible in the relational shift and the narrator's acknowledgment of complicity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—guilt, complicity, and the cost of silence—emerges organically from Evan's confession, the "factory ghost shift" metaphor, and the beaded valve as makeshift shrine. The piece resists moralizing; the narrator's skepticism persists even as it softens, and the ending offers a resonant image (truth finding "a place to rest that is not just his alone") rather than a tidy resolution. The swallowed-truth motif recurs with purpose, shifting from literal (Evan's silence) to shared (the narrator's complicity in calling him a liar). Subtext operates in gesture and silence: Evan's forehead pressed to the pipe, the narrator's shift from sarcasm to evidence-gathering. One minor friction: the phrase "factory ghost shift" risks symbolic convenience, but it is seeded early and paid off through the phantom footfalls and the valve-wheel altar, so the tension remains productive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person narration is stable and voice-distinct: the narrator's calmly skeptical filter ("sarcasm is easier than admitting I am the one who called him a liar") and precise sensory attention ("mineral cold," "carnival crown") remain consistent under pressure. Evan's dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit; his halting confession advances both plot and character. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close in the narrator's self-awareness, then widening to observe Evan's gesture at the valve. One deduction: the phrase "religiously skeptical" is repeated verbatim twice, and while thematically purposeful, the second use risks template cadence. Diction stays within the narrator's lexicon throughout, and the free indirect treatment of Evan's thoughts ("He does not pray exactly") is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. The opening ("The tunnel breathes like a sleeping animal") and the valve-wheel description ("carnival crown") are vivid and specific. However, several instances of paraphrase loops and scaffold phrasing reduce momentum: "the hush that follows a sudden confession" appears twice verbatim (opening and midpoint), "swallowed truth" recurs four times with diminishing charge, and "religiously skeptical" is repeated identically. The phrase "factory ghost shift" and "line three, the locked stairwell, the tunnel under the hill" carry a slightly templated cadence. These artifacts do not obscure causality or dull the closure image materially, but they accumulate across the piece. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: −0.8 in Q7 for loops and template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "factory ghost shift" premise—hidden workers used as scapegoats—is a fresh synthesis of labor exploitation and haunting metaphor, and the beaded valve wheel as rough altar is a specific, memorable detail. The piece avoids stock ghost-story beats by grounding the "haunting" in corporate negligence and survivor guilt. Emotional specificity (Evan's work-scarred fingers, the narrator's complicity-tinged sarcasm) prevents generic templates. One friction: the talk-radio psychics as investigative method reads slightly ornamental—mentioned but not deeply integrated into the narrator's skepticism or the tunnel discovery. The ending's quiet rebalancing is earned and feels inevitable in hindsight, though the narrator's passive witness role keeps the originality in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character present and motivates the entry into the tunnel ("I have explored every abandoned mill…but an abandoned train tunnel is new"). The recklessness is more told than shown; the narrator observes and catalogues rather than making risky choices that create turns. The trait is consistent but does not constrain or enable a key on-page action with visible cost. Swappable with "curious explorer" or similar. Setup present, closure tangential (the narrator shifts emotionally but does not act recklessly at the end). Cap at ~4.6 for missing middle development; score 4.2 for minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Object anchors two beats: first appraised as "carnival crown" offering, then becomes the altar where Evan presses his forehead and whispers names. Early signal (first third), middle development (narrator appraises it), and closure linkage (Evan's gesture there charges the final image). The rosary beads' reweighting from cheap decoration to shrine drives the ending's resonance. Irreplaceability high—the beaded valve wheel's specific visual and tactile qualities matter. Visible cost: Evan's vulnerability and the narrator's shift to cataloguing names occur at this object. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Concept seeded early ("factory ghost shift that kept running the machines after hours") and reinterpreted at midpoint as hidden workers rather than literal ghosts. Shapes Evan's motivation and the narrator's evolving understanding; the phantom footfalls and lunch pails are dramatized sensory evidence. Present in closure via the names Evan whispers and the narrator's final thought ("Maybe the ghost shift is only guilt echoing"). However, the concept does not constrain a key choice—it provides context and atmosphere but remains more thematic than tactical. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate. Score 6.4 for solid integration without hard necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Attribute signaled early ("I have always been calmly, stubbornly, religiously skeptical") and recurs at the ending ("my religiously skeptical mind catalogues each name like evidence"). The skepticism shapes the narrator's sarcasm mid-scene ("You really think dead men punched in for overtime") and modulates the final shift—doubt softens but does not vanish. Present in setup and closure; middle development is implicit in the sarcasm beat. The trait constrains the narrator's readiness to believe but does not create a visible tradeoff or foreclose a path with cost. Lyric reprise reweights the stake slightly, lifting into mid-5s. Score 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Action occurs once: narrator appraises the beaded valve wheel with "practiced chill." Early signal (~first third), tied to character trait. The appraisal introduces the valve as significant, but the beat does not create a turn or narrow options—it is observational setup. Closure linkage weak; Evan touches the valve at the end, not the narrator. Functional but replaceable with "examine" or "study." One beat involvement, no causal pressure at closure. Score 5.1 for functional setup without development or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Method mentioned in the drive scene ("by interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics late at night") and briefly at the ending ("built a religion out of late night radio"). Early signal present, but the mechanics are told rather than shown—we do not see Evan listen, decode, or act on the calls on the page. The method provides backstory context for why they are in the tunnel but does not shape a present choice or tactic. Missing middle development and closure participation; the final mention is summary reflection. Cap at ~4.6 for missing middle; score 4.8 for weak thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setting anchors the piece: tunnel mouth, interior gravel and rails, corroded pipe, and the claustrophobic "lid…screwed on" atmosphere. Early signal (opening lines), middle development (spatial progression deeper, metallic rhythm, phantom footfalls), and closure linkage (the valve wheel as rough altar where Evan's gesture occurs). The tunnel's mineral cold and drip-rhythm pressure choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, and the environment's breath metaphor recurs purposefully. Irreplaceability high—remove the tunnel and the closure image collapses. Strong integration across all three gates with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Timeframe signaled in the opening line and recurs at midpoint ("The hush that follows his sudden confession feels thicker than the dark"). The "hush" frames the emotional window and tightens the present moment—the confession has just occurred, and the tunnel exploration is immediate consequence. Present in setup and implicitly in closure (the hush resolves into shared acknowledgment). However, the timeframe does not create urgency or constrain choices in a ticking-clock sense; it sets emotional tone rather than tactical pressure. Two gates (setup, closure echo), moderate specificity. Score 6.7 for purposeful frame without hard necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("something that will finally let us find the weight of a swallowed truth") and drives the tunnel descent. Present in setup, middle (Evan's confession and the valve discovery test the truth's weight), and closure (the truth "has finally found a place to rest"). The desire is dramatized through Evan's halting confession and the narrator's shift from sarcasm to cataloguing names. Friction between wants (vindication for Evan, absolution for the narrator's complicity) and costs (vulnerability, shared guilt) is legible. All three gates met with causal pressure and closure linkage. Strong integration; score 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone anchored early ("my body hums with a drowsy alertness, like the hour before dawn when dreams still cling but the mind has already moved on") and modulates with pressure—the tunnel's mineral cold and drip-rhythm sustain the liminal mood. The phrase "drowsy alertness" does not recur verbatim, but the contradictory sensory texture persists: hush, breath, phantom footfalls. Coherent through turns and charges the final image (the small rebalancing occurs within this half-awake state). Present in setup and closure; middle development implicit in sustained sensory texture. Tone does not constrain a choice but enriches atmosphere and deepens the ending's resonance. Two gates plus lyric coherence; score 6.1.</comment>
