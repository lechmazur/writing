<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "logical dreamer" protagonist shows clear interior contradiction—wanting to revitalize through gentler numbers while fearing the gauge's implications—and micro-choices (arranging objects, testing patterns) reveal values under pressure. Embodied emotion appears in "hush roared in my ears" and "flash of grief," though some interiority leans toward abstraction ("statistics of collapse"). The final choice to rehang the orbs is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of apathy with visible cost, but the peak moment lacks the visceral particularity that would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the protagonist arranges and rearranges objects while the gauge needle responds, building pressure through pattern iteration until the final configuration yields "modest but undeniable ascent." Orientation anchors (grotto, narrator with gauge, tonight) land by line 3. Closure is Charged Poise: the final needle position crystallizes options with felt cost ("enough to begin"), reconfiguring prior material without requiring a decisive physical act. The cost is legible in the removal of bleak clippings and the grief for "versions of us who might settle there," though the conceptual weight slightly outpaces the dramatized stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The grotto functions as micro-setting: tide-polished floor, algae-lit ceiling, iron hooks from forgotten fishermen create vivid spatial grounding. The gauge and decorations (glass orbs, mirrors, maps) are handled on the page and constrain choices—moving an orb left models generosity and the needle rises; clustering mirrors triggers frantic loops. The tidal opening and closing frame the experiment with urgency. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the mathematician's lens ("wavering constellations," "water-logged ceiling"), charging the final image when the grotto "resembled a patient cosmos, waiting for us to choose."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—puzzling out new equations for hope—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tested repeatedly: orb arrangement raises the needle, mirror clustering sinks it, bleak clippings drive it to "Unlifted." One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator tests apathy and the needle sags, forcing confrontation with stagnation's cost. The final act (removing clippings, rehanging orbs) is protagonist-driven and narrows options with visible cost: grief for lost futures and the acceptance that "this is enough to begin." Escalation under Accumulative lens reads as deepening rather than reversal, meeting the sufficient-tightening standard for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—hope as calculable through kindness rather than survivability—emerges from the gauge's responses to arranged objects, not from assertion. The final image (needle at modest ascent, grotto as "patient cosmos") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the three overlaid reflections and the grief for parallel selves. The "trial balloons" concept integrates cleanly as both metaphor and method, avoiding prompt-echo. One slip: "new equations for hope that weighted kindness with the same rigor as survivability" edges toward thematic statement, though it's anchored in the notebook action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single first-person POV remains stable with clean focalization. Voice carries a distinct texture—academic precision layered with lyric compression ("air felt like a held breath," "hush roared in my ears")—and the perceptual signature (mathematical framing, pattern-seeking) filters all detail. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during gauge operation, reflective during timeline speculation. Diction mostly stays within the mathematician's lexicon, though "serene upheaval of realizing" and "topology of possibility" risk elevated register in peak beats. No head-hopping; experimental compression (parallel-timeline asides) is taught early and remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance setup, test, or closure. Rhythm varies (short declarations, longer reflective turns) without template cadence. Minor loop: "lucidly watchful" repeats in paragraph 2 and 18 without added pressure (−0.2). "Trial balloons, mathematical models I launched in silence like invisible lanterns" stacks metaphors that slightly blur. Filter-verb use ("I saw," "I felt," "I wanted") clusters in the opening third but eases later. No major scaffold or clarity breaks; the figurative density in "braided the moonlight" and "slipping around my fingers" enriches without obscuring cause/effect at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—mathematician uses rewired gauge in tidal grotto to test ethical models via object arrangement—feels specific and non-obvious. The parallel-timeline frame and "trial balloons" conceit avoid template metaphysics by grounding tests in physical needle responses. The transformation of altimeter into futures-gauge and the orb-mirror equation are fresh inflections. Risk-taking (speculative setup, accumulative structure, conceptual stakes) heightens meaning without gimmickry. Slight proximity concern: the "decorations as equation" and tidal-metaphor pairing echo familiar contemplative-science tropes, but the gauge mechanics and "Unlifted" label add specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: introduced line 2 as "logical dreamer, trained in proofs and paradoxes." Development: the trait constrains choices—creates patterns, tests gauge, writes notation—across multiple beats. Payoff: final decision to rehang orbs and accept modest ascent is shaped by the logical/dreaming duality. Causal pressure moderate; the trait enables methodology but doesn't force a high-cost tradeoff. Two gates met; present in closure reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph 6, rewired to measure futures. Development: needle responses drive beats 14, 20, 24, 29. Payoff: final needle position ("modest but undeniable ascent") delivers closure image. Causal pressure strong—needle behavior narrows options and forces pattern revision. Specificity high (brass dial, "Unlifted" label, trembling mechanics). Three gates met; indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph 8 as "trial balloons, mathematical models I launched in silence." Development: concept shapes methodology—gauge traces trajectories, narrator tests arrangements as models. Payoff: final acceptance that modest ascent is "enough to begin" completes the trial. Causal role solid; the framing changes tactics (arrangement-as-test) and charges the ending. Swappability low; remove the balloon metaphor and the futures-testing logic weakens.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: appears line 2 and paragraph 18 ("lucidly watchful"). Development: the trait describes observation mode but doesn't visibly constrain action—no on-page cost or enabled choice tied specifically to this watchfulness. Payoff: present in the closure stance ("quiet figure who stayed") but not causally active. Label-only use trends this toward mid-band; would need a moment where watchfulness prevented an impulse or revealed a pattern another stance would miss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: signaled paragraph 10 ("revitalize a world numbed by statistics"). Development: every object arrangement and gauge test enacts revitalization—generosity model raises needle, apathy sinks it. Payoff: final rehanging and needle's modest ascent complete the revitalization attempt. Major turns trace to this action; swapping for "analyze" or "measure" would flatten the ethical stakes. Three gates met; essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 11, "creating patterns with decorations along the grotto walls." Development: mechanics matter—orb position, mirror clustering, clipping arrangement all alter needle responses (paragraphs 25, 26, 32). Payoff: final pattern (orbs and mirrors rehung) yields closure image. Causal pressure high; the method is irreplaceable—remove the physical arrangement and the gauge has no input. Three gates met; indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 1, "tide-polished grotto" opening "at low tide." Development: algae light scatters through decorations, hooks supply infrastructure, tidal window imposes urgency (paragraph 31). Payoff: grotto as "patient cosmos" charges final image. Micro-setting qualifies; space constrains and enables. Two strong beats plus closure participation; essential to atmosphere and methodology.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 4, "across parallel timelines." Development: mentioned in paragraphs 16–18 (three overlaid reflections) but doesn't tighten decisions—no live clock or tracked window. Payoff: parallel-self grief colors final choice but remains thematic rather than operational. The timeline frame enriches concept but doesn't constrain tactics; easily swappable with introspection. Two gates (setup, weak payoff); functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 5, "puzzle out new equations for hope." Development: every gauge test dramatizes the motivation—testing generosity, confronting apathy, accepting modest progress. Payoff: final acceptance that "this is enough to begin" completes the hope-calculation. Friction present: skepticism (paragraph 28), grief (paragraph 33), desire distorting data (paragraph 9). Three gates met; desire drives all choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 15, "serene upheaval of realizing." Development: tone modulates—calm arrangement contrasted with "frantic loops" of needle, quiet grief with transformative choice. Payoff: final tone ("patient cosmos," "modest but undeniable ascent") charges closure with earned serenity after upheaval. Coherent through turns; the oxymoron is earned rather than declared. Strong closure linkage lifts this into upper 7s.</comment>
