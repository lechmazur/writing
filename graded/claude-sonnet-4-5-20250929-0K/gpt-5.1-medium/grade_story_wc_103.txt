<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to "discover the texture of time" drives a coherent arc from morning pruning to final dissolution. Interior states are rendered through concrete sensory detail ("warm as fever," "roots pulse like distant drums") rather than labels. However, the climactic dissolution reads more as abstract concept than embodied choice with visible cost—the narrator's agency at the threshold lacks a micro-decision that would make the surrender feel earned rather than inevitable. The reflective mode dominates without sufficient present-tense friction to test commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates density through layered images (halo fragment, photographs, hyperbolic geometry) and reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration (dissolution as diffusion into the lattice). However, the cost remains conceptual and abstract—"outline fray" and "histories smeared" lack a concrete forfeiture or visible price that would make the before/after legible with felt weight. The closure image is poetic but does not reweight prior material decisively enough to satisfy the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vividly realized through specific detail: "tender shoots braid the handrails," "bark spiraling in golden logarithms around my ankles." Sensory selection reflects the narrator's professional lens (measuring hedge shadows, noting root-knots). The halo fragment and photographs anchor micro-setting that charges the final image. The hyperbolic geometry functions as both spatial constraint and thematic vehicle, shaping the narrator's approach to the middle span and the dissolution that follows.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering time's texture—is signaled early and coherent throughout. The journey from youngest bridge to middle span provides spatial escalation, and the narrator's decision to "attempt what the maze hints at" marks a tightening. However, the escalation reads more as dreamlike drift than agency-driven pressure; the narrator's movement toward dissolution lacks a live trade-off or visible cost that would narrow options. The final step "after" the halo fragment feels passive, and no credible alternative path is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the hyperbolic geometry and temporal lattice rather than assertion: time as "trembling lattice, every moment touching many others" crystallizes through concrete images. The halo fragment's "circle shattered yet endlessly recompleting" and the realization "disintegration is not destruction but diffusion" avoid platitude by grounding abstraction in the garden's mechanics. The final image—stepping into the pupil-like water—offers a non-literal answer to the texture-of-time question without moralizing. The recurring photographs and "quaking reverie" motif charge the closure without forcing symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person singular throughout; psychic distance is consistent and apt for the meditative lens. Diction is controlled and poetic without violating the narrator's designer-mystic register: "emulsion blistering with invisible fire," "roots curl around it like cautious fingers." Perceptual signature is selective and character-specific, filtering the garden through a professional's eye for geometry and growth patterns. However, some figurative constructions border on overwriting ("sky colored ghosts," "swallowing distance the way water swallows stones") and the rhythm occasionally flattens into template cadence during the dissolution sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere or thematic accretion. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing images frame the arc cleanly. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The bridges rose... time here has never moved only forward; it ricochets" restates the same temporal instability across adjacent beats. The dissolution sequence suffers from figurative overload—"smeared across perception," "emulsion blistering," "outline fray," "histories smeared"—where four metaphors in quick succession blur rather than sharpen the final image. Template cadence in lines like "I see myself as... I see future versions too..." triggers mild momentum drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of hedge-maze designer, hyperbolic geometry, and retrocognitive photographs is specific and non-obvious. The halo fragment as "recurring keeper" device transforms a familiar mystic-object trope through the narrator's realization of serial custody. However, the core journey—solitary seeker dissolves into transcendent unity—follows a well-worn template without a fresh moral calculus or sharp counter-pressure. The hyperbolic geometry provides conceptual originality but remains more ornamental than causally decisive. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative-lyric mode) heightens atmosphere without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hedge maze designer role anchors the narrator's professional lens (measuring shadows, pruning) and frames the opening stake. It appears in the opening line and returns at the dissolution ("a designer no longer separate from the maze"). However, the vocation does not drive key turns—the narrator's choices in the climax flow from mystic seeker logic rather than designer expertise. The role is present and thematically coherent but functionally replaceable with "gardener" or "keeper."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment is introduced early ("lodged in the oldest bridge trunk"), handled in multiple beats (pressed to chest, clutched during the walk, placed on the bridge floor), and directly shapes the dissolution when roots curl around it and light spills into the water. Its properties—humming, warm, projecting ghost paths—enable the hyperbolic perception and charge the final image. Removing it would break the story's closure mechanism. However, its causal role in the middle span is more atmospheric than decisively constraining a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fading photographs are signaled early, laid in a ring at dusk, and return with reweighted meaning when the narrator touches them and feels "retrocognitively trapped." They anchor the temporal lattice concept and provide sensory proof of the halo's recurrence across frames. However, their mechanical role is secondary to the halo fragment—they illustrate rather than drive the dissolution. The concept shapes atmosphere and theme but does not constrain a pivotal on-page choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is demonstrated on the page when the narrator touches photographs and becomes "another version of myself, silently watching" with frozen wind and sharpened colors. This enables the perception of overlapping timelines and justifies the final dissolution. However, the attribute does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it functions more as passive perception than tradeoff-laden ability. The trait is specific and shapes the narrator's experience but remains one step removed from agency.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Disintegrate" is seeded early ("where time must disintegrate"), defines the climactic action ("I step after it, feeling my outline fray"), and provides the story's final image ("disintegrate together, our histories smeared"). The dissolution redefines the narrator's relationship to the maze and fulfills the texture-of-time quest. However, the action itself is more conceptual than physical—no specific gesture or tool-use makes the disintegration legible as a decisive act with immediate consequence. The verb charges the closure but could be swapped with "merge" or "dissolve" with only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled early ("hedges twist through hyperbolic geometry"), its mechanics—angles stretching, distance doubling—are demonstrated when the narrator walks, and "bark spiraling in golden logarithms" anchors it in the middle span. However, the geometry functions more as atmospheric metaphor than tactical constraint; no choice hinges on understanding or navigating its specific properties. The method enriches the world logic and charges the conceptual texture but does not enable or foreclose a key decision.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is established in the opening paragraph, supplies resources (vines, roots, handrails) that the narrator handles across multiple beats, and directly shapes the dissolution when roots curl around the halo and the water opens. The garden's organic architecture—youngest bridge to middle span—provides spatial progression and the bark "spiraling in golden logarithms" charges the climactic moment. Removing the living bridges would break the story's spatial logic and thematic resonance between growth and time.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated early, dramatized through the narrator's morning walks and pruning rituals, and tested at the threshold decision ("to step where time must disintegrate"). The desire drives the arc from observation to dissolution. However, the motivation lacks visible friction—no competing want or cost makes the final step a trade-off. The narrator's commitment is asserted rather than tested by a choice that forecloses an alternative path. The motivation is coherent and thematically integrated but functions more as premise than conflicted stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" is established early ("I walk beneath them in quaking reverie"), recurs as a refrain ("reverie is too deep to escape, trembling through bone and breath," "one quaking reverie of time"), and modulates with pressure—calm observation gives way to embodied trembling as the narrator approaches dissolution. The tone coheres across turns and charges the final image without becoming static. However, the single-note dreamlike register occasionally flattens urgency; more tonal contrast during the threshold decision would sharpen the stakes.</comment>
