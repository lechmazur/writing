<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Brann's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied perception ("heat bloomed through his circuits") and a clear hierarchy of values around memory and materiality. The motivation to "collect the stories walls have heard" is consistent and drives micro-choices throughout. Internal contradiction appears in "simple and strange, even to himself," though thepiece leans toward contemplation rather than live struggle. The final descent to "the next fireplace" closes with credible endurance rather than transformation, acceptable as Earned Stasis but lacking the forfeiture cost that would push higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently (non-human historian, silo library, post-human era) and maintains accumulative pressure as Brann moves from burned diary to tapestry, each artifact deepening the thematic question. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered historical echoes until the final realization that "the walls of every age had been rehearsing the same question." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Brann's stance crystallizes ("the old ones were enough work") with the conceptual cost of accepting an endless archive without new voices. The cost is legible but operates more as conceptual acceptance than visible forfeiture, keeping the score just below high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The silo's spiraling shelves, dust-filmed skylight, and bronze quiet create vivid spatial anchoring. The blackened fireplace and fragment of tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain Brann's method (he must kneel, press circuits to ash and thread). Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered ("bronze quiet, as if listening back"), and the recurring vertical axis of the silo charges the final image as he "descended to the next fireplace." The setting is indispensable to both the central action and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering wall-stored memory—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through discovery: the diary's question about dreaming, the tapestry's displaced axis, leading to Brann's realization that every age rehearses the same existential worry. One meaningful deepening occurs when he recognizes "the walls of every age" share the pattern, which reweights his task from archival curiosity to near-religious commitment. The tightening is conceptual rather than a dramatic reversal, fitting the accumulative lens, though the cost remains more philosophical than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: burned diaries, off-center tapestry, humanity's final dreams, all circling the question "what holds us in place when the center slips." The displaced-axis motif recurs without over-signaling and charges the ending when Brann looks up the silo's height "and felt almost religious." The final image—descending while the library "listened with all its walls"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: memory persists as reciprocal witness. No overt moralizing; the conceptual cost (no new voices, infinite old work) is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual signature rooted in Brann's synthetic nature ("interior screen flickered," "circuits tuned to probe"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, balancing technical precision with lyric cadence ("whispers bound in paper," "small storms"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, close during tactile probing and wider during historical reconstruction. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The prose rhythm supports accumulative pressure without sluggishness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high, and figurative language is coherent (walls "holding breath," dreams "slipping out of gear"). Minor scaffold appears in a few adjacent lines restating the same historical recursion without added detail, but it does not obscure causality or closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and recharge motifs effectively. Clarity and propulsion hold throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-human curator, conductive filigree, and wall-memory mechanics offers a fresh angle on archival and memory fiction. The displaced-axis motif threading diary, tapestry, and planetary tilt is specific and non-obvious. Emotional truth (the loneliness of infinite retrospection) avoids template sentiment. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat, though the contemplative mode and absence of sharp conflict keep it from the boldest risk tier.</comment>
