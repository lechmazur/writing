<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is embodied through gesture and perception: "shoulders rounded inward as if words themselves were watching," "allowed their trust to settle over him like an old coat." His micro-choices—climbing the ladder, touching the crystal, deciding to testify in fractured sequences—constrain his options with visible cost. Internal conflict appears in "frightened him; he had spent a lifetime hiding behind indices and footnotes, trusting clarity more than courage," showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The backstory fragments (why he stayed, his fragile hope) anchor in the present crystal-touch stimulus and tilt his final stance toward fractured testimony, satisfying BRR anchoring requirements.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second sentence ("Elias unlocked the shadowed library at dawn"). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered crystal-voices, culminating in a cadence shift when Elias realizes "growth did not move in straight lines" and chooses to testify in fractured sequences. Closure is Charged Poise: the final image—"the suspended hush followed, clinging to his clothes, a barely audible armor"—crystallizes his stance with felt cost (fear, loss of safety) and reconfigures his relationship to silence and testimony. One meaningful deepening (from cataloging to active resistance) narrows his options with undeniable pressure at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The library is grounded early with concrete anchors: "high, grimy windows," "iron ladder," "contraband notebooks," "chandelier whose candles had long ago been replaced by humming glass orbs." The cracked crystal functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's method (he must touch it to replay voices) and charging the final image when "the suspended hush followed, clinging to his clothes." Sensory details—dust spirals, echoing sigh, crystal's fracture—filter through Elias's scholarly bias and shape his climactic choice to speak in fractured sequences rather than ordered arguments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: whether Elias will testify loyally or resist the council's erasure of "grow." Pressure tightens when the courier's note arrives, forcing him to choose between hiding and shaping testimony. The crystal-voices deepen his understanding, revealing that "growth did not move in straight lines," which forecloses the option of linear testimony and narrows his path to fractured resistance. The final beat—"descended the ladder, the suspended hush followed… a barely audible armor"—delivers visible cost (fear, loss of safety) and reconfigures his stance from reticent cataloger to active witness under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: language as living system that "wriggled past fences," growth that "leapt, stalled, bent back on itself." The cracked crystal literalizes fragmented resistance; the voices of child, botanist, lovers form a shadow grammar. Elias's final insight—"to map it faithfully, he would have to speak… in the same fractured sequences"—is earned by on-page experience, not asserted. The ending image ("suspended hush… a barely audible armor") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how does life change) without stating a moral, reweighting prior silence from refuge to weapon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is selective and scholarly ("practiced quiet," "weathered innocence"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "the joints from the skeleton of meaning," "clinging to his clothes, a barely audible armor." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the crystal-voice sequences ("First came… Next… Then…") teaches a pattern that pays off when Elias adopts fractured testimony. No dialogue, so those bullets do not apply; internal voice remains distinct and rhythmically coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; strong verbs and concrete nouns drive momentum ("dust rose in slow spirals," "chandelier whose candles had long ago been replaced"). High information density: most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor template cadence in the crystal-voice sequence ("First came… Next… Then…") is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, so no penalty. One paraphrase loop: "growth did not move in straight lines" is immediately echoed by "leapt, stalled, bent back on itself," but the second adds specificity and serves escalation, so deduction is minimal (−0.2). No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The premise—language under authoritarian control, sound-recording crystal, banned verbs—synthesizes dystopian trope with fresh specificity (orbs that "focused sound instead of light," the fracture that catches "intentions beneath"). The crystal's crack is irreplaceable: it enables fractured testimony and charges the final image. Risk-taking in structure (layered testimony fragments) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending's choice to testify "in fractured sequences" feels inevitable in hindsight, rooted in the crystal-voices and Elias's scholarly bias. No close echoes of famous lines; the "shadow grammar of resistance" is a non-obvious, earned synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias appears in the opening line; his reticence shapes perception ("shoulders rounded inward") and tactics (hiding behind indices). Two key choices: touching the crystal (mid-story) and deciding to testify in fractured sequences (climax). His reticence is dramatized through embodied hesitation ("the thought frightened him") and overcome with visible cost ("allowing their trust to settle over him"). Causal pressure: his traits constrain and enable the final stance. Closure linkage: his decision to speak fractured testimony grows directly from reticent scholarly habits meeting the crystal's pattern.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystal appears early ("climbed the iron ladder and reached toward a small crystal") and is handled in two distinct beats: mid-story touch to replay voices, and the descent at closure when "the suspended hush followed." Its unique property—"a fracture that caught not just sound but the intentions beneath it"—enables the fractured-voice discovery and constrains Elias's method. Causal pressure: without this exact crystal, the layered testimonies and final tactical shift would fail. Closure linkage: the suspended hush "clinging to his clothes" charges the final image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Suspended hush" is introduced early ("the reverberations… settled into a suspended hush") and recurs in the final image ("the suspended hush followed, clinging to his clothes"). It shapes stakes on the page: Elias needs the hush to decode growth patterns, and it becomes "a barely audible armor" that reconfigures his stance from refuge to weapon. The concept constrains tactics (he must work in silence) and charges the closure image with felt cost. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake; visible pressure at the ending qualifies it for mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Sonically reflective" is introduced mid-paragraph ("Each orb focused sound instead of light, rendering the air sonically reflective") and enables one on-page action: replaying crystal-voices. It constrains Elias's method (he must touch the right glass) but does not visibly shape the final image or impose a tradeoff cost at closure. Functional in the middle beat but not irreplaceable; a different mechanism could serve. Present in setup and development, but closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Testify" is signaled early ("the council had summoned him to appear as neutral expert, to testify") and frames the dominant stake. Two beats: the courier's note forces the decision to prepare, and the climactic realization redefines how he will testify ("not in ordered arguments but in the same fractured sequences"). The action is irreplaceable: removing it collapses the plot. Cost is legible on the page ("the thought frightened him" / "weary faith"). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong, though the testimony itself occurs off-page, limiting the final beat's immediacy.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Fractured sequences" is introduced mid-story ("the room answered through fractured sequences") and its mechanics matter: the crystal's fault line stitches earlier mornings into overlapping, misaligned fragments. The method shapes two attempts: understanding the voices and deciding to testify in the same mode. Causal pressure: Elias realizes "he would have to speak… in the same fractured sequences the crystal offered him," making the method indispensable to the final stance. Closure linkage: the fractured pattern charges the final image and forecloses linear testimony with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn anchors the opening line and provides resources: the chandelier, iron ladder, contraband notebooks. Spatial choreography is clear (climbing, reaching, descending). The setting enables the crystal-touch and constrains Elias's access to forbidden voices. Minor closure linkage: the library's suspended hush clings to him at the end. Two beats of causal involvement (setup and ending) with specificity that matters, but the library itself does not impose a tactical tradeoff at the climax; the crystal does the heavier work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after the last dictionary is printed"—is introduced early and establishes the decree that drives the plot: no new words, three verbs will be erased. It tightens Elias's decision ("Tomorrow the council will erase three verbs") and shapes his urgency. However, the story does not track a live clock during the single-morning scene; the pressure is conceptual rather than temporal. Two beats: setup and the note's deadline. Causal involvement is clear, but the timeframe does not visibly alter tactics or the final image beyond establishing the world rule.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation—"to decode the pattern of growth"—is introduced early ("he might understand how any life changed at all") and dramatized through embodied choice: touching the crystal, listening to layered voices, adopting fractured testimony. Internal friction: "a fragile, almost childish hope" versus "frightened him; he had spent a lifetime hiding." The desire forecloses linear testimony (cost) and enables the final stance. Three beats: initial framing, crystal discovery, climactic decision. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; the motivation is irreplaceable and charges the final image with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Weathered innocence" is signaled early ("a fragile, almost childish hope… clung to him with weathered innocence, like a toy mended too many times") and modulates under pressure: the voices carry "weary faith," and Elias's final acceptance of their trust is "shabby at the cuffs but still warm." Tone coheres through turns without static repetition. Closure linkage: the "barely audible armor" image fuses innocence (hope) with weathering (fear, cost). Charges the final beat with felt pressure, though the phrase itself does not recur verbatim at the end.</comment>
