<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and voice-specific ("innocently cunning heart," painting dreams "whose bubbles and warps finally made sense"). Her choice to take the impossible commission is motivated by prior established traits. The stranger arrives with clear motive and specificity (the warped reed, the plant alphabet). Minor slip: Mira's internal contradiction could be more dramatized in action rather than declared; the final choice feels slightly inevitable rather than costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Mira, courtyard, post-phoenix dawn) arrive within the first few lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (phoenix rising, marketplace perfection threatening her barter practice, the stranger's request) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the reed falls silent and the plant blooms, reweighting her stake (finding beauty in imperfection) with visible cost (she completes the painting, the sound escapes). The closure lands on the page with felt cost: her refusal of symmetry and her honoring of hesitation allow the trapped note to rest. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stranger's request raises the impossibility and Mira accepts it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The courtyard is established early with tactile detail (ash glowing in cobblestones, cooling glass, kiln-warm air) and recurs as the frame for the barter economy. The reed tongue and plant function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice: Mira places them on easel and sill, their presence shapes her painting process, and the plant's bloom at closure charges the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful (bare feet on ash, mug of cooled tea, metallic sound in bones). The setting does not explicitly block a tactic, preventing entry to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding beauty in imperfection, sustaining her barter practice against marketplace perfection) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the stranger's request is impossible, which raises the cost of acceptance. Mira's choice to paint imperfectly enough that "the sound can finally escape where it cracked" narrows options and is executed on the page (refusing straight lines, honoring hesitation). The final cost is visible: the reed falls silent, the plant blooms—she achieves the awakening. The piece does not show a second reversal or an explicit foreclosed path beyond her acceptance of the commission, capping the score slightly below 8.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in imperfection, the necessity of honoring fracture) emerges from concrete action: Mira's colorblindness, her barter of awakenings, the warped reed that holds unbearable sound, her refusal of symmetry. The final image (the reed falls silent, the plant blooms) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the stranger's plant-alphabet question and Mira's reply ("I cannot promise forgiveness, only the ability to stay awake next to the wound"). The phoenix motif recurs with purpose, reweighting the opening image of cleansing versus Mira's sharper notice of cracks. Minor note: "innocently cunning" is slightly label-speak but is quickly embodied in her acceptance of impossible commissions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtering all perception through Mira's colorblind, texture-focused lens. Voice is distinct: "nursing a mug of cooled tea and a pocket full of unsold sketches," "the old ache of temptation; this was impossible, which made it irresistible." Diction is consistent and poetic without obscuring clarity. The stranger's dialogue is functional and goal-driven. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Minor slip: a few lines approach elevated register ("imagined note of the phoenix's final exhale trembling in her bones") that slightly exceed Mira's established idiom under peak pressure, but the effect remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and image-dense: "Ash still glowed in the seams between cobblestones, sketching trembling constellations beneath Mira's bare, paint-splattered feet." Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor artifacts: "She could not name colors, but she could feel when a painting almost apologized for existing" reads slightly ornamental; "the glassblower had gone inside to sleep off a night of shaping molten birds that would never burn out" is a beautiful image but momentarily stalls momentum. Two adjacent sentences in the stranger's entrance paragraph restate his arrival without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the phoenix-description opening but does not pervade. Apply −0.4 for paraphrase loop, −0.2 for minor ornamental drift in one beat. Closure beat remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise (colorblind painter who barters awakenings of flaws, confronted by a phoenix-marked object that holds unbearable sound) is specific and fresh. The plant-alphabet communication, the warped concertina reed, and the courtyard barter economy combine organically. The final turn—painting imperfection to release trapped sound—feels earned in hindsight and transforms the opening phoenix image. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, unconventional cause-effect pacing) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor note: the phoenix trope is familiar; the piece transforms it through the specific angle of the reed and Mira's refusal of symmetry, but the synthesis does not quite reach the 8.8+ threshold of indispensable inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (colorblind painter) is present throughout, her colorblindness shapes her perceptual signature and her choice to paint imperfectly. Her decision to accept the commission and her final refusal of straight lines are key turns. She appears in setup, middle choice, and closure. Cost: she accepts no coin, only the warped tongue and a plant; she completes the impossible painting. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The concertina reed tongue is introduced early (stranger opens case), handled in two beats (Mira places it on easel, she hears its sound while painting), and its state changes at closure (falls silent). It drives the commission request, shapes Mira's painting process, and its silence is the closure payoff. Visible cost: the sound escapes where it cracked. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Bartered awakenings" is introduced early (Mira's practice: she paints dreams, clients walk away seeing their lives differently). It frames her motive and the stranger's request fits the pattern. The concept shapes the middle beat (she agrees to trade in awakenings, not forgiveness) and is present at closure (the painting awakens the flaw, the sound escapes). Two-gate involvement (setup, closure reprise). The concept does not explicitly constrain a tactic in the middle; it reweights meaning at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Innocently cunning" appears once as a label ("her innocently cunning heart") tied to her acceptance of the impossible commission. It does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; the label summarizes her motive without dramatizing a tradeoff. Present in one beat (middle turn), but ornamental rather than causal. Cap at swappability threshold.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Awaken" drives the core premise (she paints dreams to awaken hidden flaws), the stranger's request (awaken the unbearable sound so it can escape), and the closure (her painting awakens the flaw, the reed falls silent, the plant blooms). Three beats: setup (her practice), middle (the commission), closure (the painting completes). High causal pressure, specificity, and cost connection. Major turns trace to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plant arrangements appear in two beats: the stranger arranges pots to spell his question, and Mira receives one plant as payment, placing it on the sill where it blooms at closure. The method is signaled early, its mechanics matter (the glassblower is mute, this is their shared alphabet), and it shapes the stranger's request. Closure participation: the plant blooms when Mira finishes. Two gates (setup, closure), causal pressure in the commission beat. Specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard is established early, recurs across beats (cooling glass, kiln-warm air, courtyard wall for plant pots), and is present at closure (courtyard sketched into the painting, plant on the sill blooms). It frames Mira's barter practice, supplies the kiln-warm air for her canvas, and the setting's existing plant-alphabet system enables the stranger's communication. Three gates met. It does not explicitly block a tactic, but it pressures her livelihood (marketplace perfection threatens her courtyard practice) and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the phoenix rises" is established in the opening and recurs (the stranger says the reed was inside the phoenix's throat during its last burn). The timeframe shapes context (world is supposedly cleansed, yet Mira notices cracks more sharply; fewer people want awakenings) and the stranger's problem (he wakes with teeth buzzing from the sound). Two gates (setup, middle involvement). It does not tighten a decision clock on the page or alter Mira's tactics during the painting; it reweights the closure image (the phoenix motif bookends). Lyric reprise function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to find beauty in imperfection" is dramatized early (she paints dreams to awaken flaws, stays in the courtyard where "broken things forgot to be ashamed"), tested in the middle (stranger's request to paint the unforgivable into the bearable), and resolved at closure (she refuses symmetry, honors hesitation, the flaw awakens and the sound escapes). Three beats. Friction: her practice is threatened by marketplace perfection; she accepts no coin, only the plant. Cost is visible on the page. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>
