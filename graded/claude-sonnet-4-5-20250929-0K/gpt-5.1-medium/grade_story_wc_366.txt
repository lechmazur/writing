<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is characterized through specific embodied habits—"steering his stub-nosed boat like an apology," "warmly observant eyes cataloged every creak"—and his internal contradictions are visible: he "did not believe in ghosts" yet his fingers tremble and he rearranges stones. The decision to write the letter and alter the stone message is earned by his accumulated loneliness and the pull of the anonymous chain. Minor slip: the interiority occasionally edges toward label-speak ("luminescent ache," "painful urge") without full embodiment, but the final choice forecloses his shadow status with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers letters, stones, and sea glass through a single continuous lantern-room visit, building density toward the final act of writing and stone-scuffing that reweights Elias's role from carrier to keeper. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): he commits to answer future messages, foreclosing his observer distance with the cost legible in "I am only the one who comes and goes…but I will answer." Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening—discovery of the letter chain—tightens the stake from delivery task to communal protection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lantern room is rendered through vivid sensory fragments: "curved panes held the sea in fragments, black water and white foam slicing around him like shattered film." The sea glass and stone spiral function as micro-setting objects that constrain his choices—he handles the glass, rearranges stones, and angles the glass to cast a halo. The haunted reputation and the extinguished lamp pressure his actions. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the climb and lantern-room moves. The setting charges the final image when he scuffs the spiral "so the message would mean safe."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: who will protect the community now that the light is gone. The discovery of the anonymous letters is a clear tightening that narrows Elias's options from routine delivery to custodial decision. His agency—rearranging stones, writing the unsigned letter, placing it under the glass—forecloses his invisibility with visible cost: he steps from shadow into covenant. The second letter's question ("Who will protect us now") directly escalates pressure. No antagonist required; the void left by the extinguished lamp supplies situational pressure. The final scuffing of stones to signal "safe" is a micro-turn that completes the earned stance shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the anonymous letter chain literalizes unseen care, and Elias's realization that "protection needed to begin" with his own hands answers the question without moralizing. The sea glass shifts from nostalgic token to active beacon, charging the closure image. The final unsigned letter—"we will keep each other"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the posed question. No thematic echo or sermonic intrusion; the piece trusts image and action to carry meaning. Subtext operates in the stone code, the unaddressed letters, and Elias's habitual reticence finally breaking into covenant.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices "every creak, every draft, every swallowed echo" and filters the world through his grandfather's teaching and twenty years of ferry observation. Diction is controlled and voice-specific—"steering his stub-nosed boat like an apology," "a luminescent ache." No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: a few phrases edge toward elevated register not fully rooted in a supply skipper's lexicon ("luminescent," "credence"), but the overall voice remains coherent and the slight lyricism reads as intentional tonal choice rather than drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, density is high, and clarity holds throughout. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information flows through action: the stone spiral, the letters, the sea-glass placement all advance story without scaffolding. Minor issues: "luminescent ache" and "the shuffle of his own breath and far-off surf" edge toward slightly overwritten figurative language; "a foolish, painful urge to bottle the feeling" uses abstract framing where concrete image would sharpen. No loops, clean grammar, strong verbs dominate. The piece propels without drag, and the final beat—scuffing stones "so the message would mean safe"—lands with precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of fisherfolk stone code, anonymous letter chain, and post-lamp custodial grief offers a fresh synthesis. The piece transforms the lighthouse-keeper trope by centering the invisible supply worker and making written gratitude the mechanism of connection. Emotional specificity—Elias's trembling fingers, his decision to write without signing—avoids generic templates. The stone-scuffing closure and the green-glass halo are vivid, non-obvious particulars. Risk: the lyric register and accumulative structure deepen rather than obscure stakes. The story commits fully to its premise without hedging or retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias the supply skipper is present from the opening and his reticence shapes every beat: he "did not believe in ghosts" yet trembles, he recognizes the stone code from his grandfather, he writes the letter "without signing, as they had done." His choices—rearranging stones, angling the sea glass, writing the unsigned reply—create the key turns. His decision to answer future messages and scuff the stones to signal "safe" is the closure act with visible cost: he abandons his shadow role. Setup early, development middle, payoff final. Causal pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sea glass appears in the lantern room, Elias presses it against his palm feeling "a foolish, painful urge to bottle the feeling of safety it suggested," then he sets it on the dead lens to cast a small green halo, and finally tucks his new letter under it as "a fragile beacon for whoever came after." Three distinct beats; the object shifts from nostalgic token to active light-maker to anchor for the new covenant. The glass directly shapes the closure image and its luminous properties charge the final scene. Irreplaceable: no other object could serve this exact optical and symbolic function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain appears in the middle third when Elias finds three envelopes, realizes their pattern, and decides to continue it by writing his own unsigned reply. The concept shapes stakes: "Who will protect us now" becomes the question he must answer, and his choice to participate redefines his role. Setup delayed but clear by midpoint, development strong (the letters "hummed in his chest, a luminescent ache"), payoff present (he writes and tucks the new letter under the glass). The chain enables his final act and charges the closure, but late arrival and ornamental phrasing ("luminescent ache") lower the score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is signaled early—"his warmly observant eyes cataloged every creak, every draft"—and the trait enables him to recognize the stone code ("Elias recognized the pattern at once") and to infer the letter chain's purpose. The attribute constrains his choices: because he notices, he acts. However, the phrase "warmly observant" itself is slightly label-like; the trait is better shown through his cataloging of details and his grandfather's teaching. Present in setup, enables middle recognition, indirectly charges closure. Functional but not indispensable; a more embodied presentation would lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The action "protect" is the story's spine: the extinguished lamp raises the question "Who will protect us now," Elias realizes "protection needed to begin" with his own hands, he writes "I have been watching the water longer than any of you…we will keep each other," and he scuffs the stones "so the message would mean safe." Setup early (the absence of the beam, the letters' plea), development middle (his recognition of the need), payoff final (his written promise and stone-scuffing). The action redefines his role and forecloses his observer distance. Removing "protect" would collapse the stakes and closure entirely.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The stone-stacking code is introduced on the landing outside the lantern room: "a way of stacking stones as messages when paper could not survive the damp." Elias recognizes it from his grandfather and immediately rearranges two stones to change the message from "invitation to warning." At the end, he scuffs the spiral "so the message would mean safe." Setup and mechanics clear early, development middle (his deliberate alteration), payoff final (the scuffing act closes the protective loop). The method is specific, irreplaceable, and shapes two key beats. Late first appearance (after the climb) and brief treatment prevent a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is the sole setting after the opening transit. Its dark lens, curved panes holding "the sea in fragments," and the floor holding letters and glass all supply resources for Elias's choices. The room's reputation ("haunted") and the absence of the beam ("its lantern room dark for the first time in ninety-seven years") pressure his actions. He angles the sea glass on the dead lens to cast a halo, uses the keeper's desk, and leaves the letter there. The setting enables and constrains throughout, but its pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical; a stronger causal link between room features and final choice would lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the lamp finally flickered out" sets the inciting condition: "the lighthouse loomed, its lantern room dark for the first time in ninety-seven years." The post-lamp void creates the question "Who will protect us now" and drives Elias's visit. However, the timeframe itself does not tighten decisions—there is no live clock or urgency within the scene; Elias explores at his own pace. The "after" framing is present in setup and informs stakes, but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure during the lantern-room sequence. Functional but replaceable with minor edits (e.g., "during a storm" would serve similar stakes).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to bottle the feeling of safety" appears when Elias holds the sea glass: "feeling a foolish, painful urge to bottle the feeling of safety it suggested." This desire drives his decision to angle the glass on the lens to cast a halo and later to write the letter promising "we will keep each other." The motivation is embodied (he presses the glass against his palm) and conflicted (he knows it's "foolish" yet acts on it). Setup middle, development immediate (the halo-casting), payoff final (the written promise). The friction between the urge and his habitual reticence adds cost. Slightly abstract phrasing ("urge to bottle") prevents a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone of "luminescent ache" is established early—"He felt the absence of the beam like a missing rib, a sharp, cold vacancy under his own skin"—and sustained through "the letters hummed in his chest, a luminescent ache" and the final green halo cast by the sea glass. The tone modulates with pressure: cold vacancy → humming ache → fragile beacon. Coherent across turns, charges the final image when the small green light "reached his own hands, and strangely, that was where protection needed to begin." The phrase "luminescent ache" itself is slightly label-like, but the tonal work is consistent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
