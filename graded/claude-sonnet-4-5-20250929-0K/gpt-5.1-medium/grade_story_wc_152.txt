<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation and performance register clearly—she disguises wisdom as foolishness through deliberate miscounting and tea-spilling—but her internal contradiction never materializes in scene choices; she tells the prince what he wants to hear without visible cost or conflicting impulse in the moment. The prince's fever of rebellion is declared rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices. Both characters remain instrumentally consistent, serving theme and atmosphere over messy human contradiction, which keeps the score out of the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (Liora, observatory, autumn night before coup). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure gathers through rumor, flame-trembling, and stitched adjacencies until the final knotted emptiness reconfigures the prince's path with conceptual cost (becoming a ghost, vanishing from history). However, the closure unit—"move where no story predicts you will move" and "those who walk there vanish completely"—lands as told wisdom rather than a dramatized forfeiture or stance crystallization with felt cost in the scene. The conceptual repricing is legible but the cost remains abstract, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory, frost-pressed glass, and eternal candle anchor setting purposefully; the flame's leaning and trembling signal hidden currents in two beats and charge the final stitching moment. Micro-setting (desk, needles, cloth) constrains Liora's ritual and the spatial choreography (prince climbing stairs, dropping scroll between scissors and candle) remains clean. However, the observatory itself does not pressure the prince's choice or alter tactics beyond atmospheric framing, which holds the score just below the 8.0 gate where environment would need to constrain a key decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—chart the prince's path through the coup without leaving traceable ink—is signaled when he enters and deepens when Liora stitches the emptiness at the palace's location. The tightening is conceptual: she warns that placelessness erases both route and traveler. Yet the prince's agency collapses into passive receipt of wisdom; he neither chooses nor renounces on the page, only half-scoffs and listens. Escalation is present but resolution is told rather than dramatized, and cost remains conceptual rather than visceral, preventing entry into the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—power moves through adjacent possibilities, and erasure awaits those who step outside recorded stories—emerges organically from Liora's stitching practice and the knotted emptiness at closure. The final exchange ("only ghosts hear them clearly") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The eternal flame and the stitched constellations recur with shifted meaning. However, the piece leans toward stating its thesis ("synchronize those branching currents into a single pattern no tyrant could fully erase") rather than letting it emerge solely from image and choice, which nudges the score just below the 8.5 threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited from Liora's POV holds cleanly; perceptual signature (flame-bending when lies are told, rumors as threads) is character-specific and consistent. Dialogue carries subtext and indirection: the prince's impatience, Liora's performed foolishness. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("adjacent possibilities…explode," "histories are rewritten, places without stories become easy to erase") in ways that read more authorial than filtered through a galaxy-chart embroiderer's working idiom under pressure. Psychic distance remains stable but the voice in peak beats sometimes smooths into explanatory prose rather than embodied thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language (frost as ghosts' fingerprints, conspiracies that unravel and reweave, flame as rumor-listener) is vivid and mostly coherent. Sentence openings vary. However, multiple lines loop conceptually: "follow one tributary…follow another," "when histories are rewritten, places without stories become easy to erase, and those who walk there vanish completely" restates the same idea across two clauses. Template stems recur ("she had learned," "her task was to synchronize," "the court thought her harmless"). Filter verbs ("feeling the rumors…swirling," "sounding almost amused") stack in the prince's scene. Apply −0.6 in Q7 for loops and template cadence; −0.3 for filter-verb density in a high-pressure beat. Total artifact debt: −0.9, preventing 9+ eligibility globally and capping this category at mid-7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—embroidering star-routes as coded resistance, flame-bending as lie-detection, adjacent-possibility navigation—is specific and non-obvious. The disguised-wisdom performance and the stitched absence at the palace's location feel fresh. However, the core frame (advisor warns rebel prince of existential cost before coup) is a familiar template, and the piece does not transform it through lived contradiction or a non-obvious moral calculus. Transformation is present but partial, which places the score in the solid mid-band without reaching the high-8s where premise and execution would feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora (galaxy-chart embroiderer) is present throughout, frames the story, and performs two key actions: stitching the emptiness and advising the prince. Her role is essential to closure participation. However, her choices do not create meaningful turns—she executes her established practice without visible cost or internal conflict in the moment. She enables the prince's decision rather than making one herself. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is advisory rather than decisional. Score in mid-6s: essential presence, limited agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The eternal candle flame appears in three beats: introduction with lie-detection property, leaning toward the prince when he enters, and trembling during the stitching ritual. It signals hidden currents and charges the atmosphere. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it observes rather than pressures. Setup, development, and closure participation are present but the flame remains atmospheric rather than causal. Score in low-7s: recurring with reweighted meaning, but not indispensable to the decision or its cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unraveling conspiracies shapes Liora's vocation and tactics throughout: she listens for unheard stories, translates them into constellations, synchronizes branching currents. The prince's scroll and her stitching are conspiracy work. The concept is present in setup, middle, and closure, but it operates as framing rather than creating a live dilemma with cost. Liora never faces a choice about which conspiracy to unravel or suppress. Score in mid-6s: essential framing, but no on-page conflict driven by the concept itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Disguises wisdom as foolishness is established early (miscounting stars, spilling tea) and demonstrated when Liora lets foolishness soften her mouth while her mind tugs at conspiracies. However, the trait is told and briefly illustrated; it does not constrain or enable a key on-page action with visible cost. The prince half-dismisses her riddles but then listens anyway, so the disguise does not create friction that alters the outcome. Setup and closure participation are minimal; middle development is label-only. Score in mid-5s: functional but replaceable trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Synchronize appears as Liora's task ("synchronize those branching currents into a single pattern") and the candle's purported function (synchronizes heaven with memory). She performs a synchronization ritual when stitching the chart. However, the action is executed without complication or cost; no competing pressures force a choice about what to synchronize or omit. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is execution without friction. Score in low-6s: present and thematically central, but does not redefine options or create a turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Through adjacent possibilities is named explicitly ("power moved…through adjacent possibilities," "move through adjacent possibilities without stepping on the ones that explode") and demonstrated in the stitched chart: routes of merchants, deserters, and the knotted emptiness. The method shapes the advice but does not constrain Liora's process or force a choice between adjacencies. Setup and closure participation are clear; middle development is illustrative rather than pressured. Score in mid-5s: functional method, not essential to a turn or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory in autumn anchors setting from line 1. Frost on glass, the spiral stairs, stone and glass drawing breath, echoed silence all contribute atmosphere. Autumn timing ties to the pre-coup moment. However, the setting does not pressure the prince's choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is a container rather than a constraint. Setup and closure participation are solid (observatory as the stage for the final stitching ritual). Score in low-6s: purposeful atmospheric anchor, does not drive tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Before the coup is signaled early ("guards patrolling before the coup," "The coup had not officially begun") and frames urgency. The timeframe tightens the prince's need for untraceable charts and charges Liora's warning about erasure. However, no countdown or live clock alters tactics on the page; the prince arrives, asks, and receives advice without temporal pressure forcing a trade-off. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is framing rather than escalating. Score in mid-6s: coherent urgency frame, does not constrain choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>To listen for unheard stories is Liora's secret vocation, drives her nightly practice, and grounds her final advice ("listen for unheard stories…only ghosts hear them clearly"). The desire is dramatized through her needle-work and rum rumors-gathering. However, no on-page friction tests the desire against a competing want or cost; she executes her vocation without conflict. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present. Score in high-6s: motivation is clear and shapes action, but lacks internal contradiction or visible cost at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Echoed silence is named in line 1, recurs in "the echoed silence deepened until even the prince dared not speak," and tonally coheres through the piece: frost-ghosts, flame-trembling, stone breathing, shadows arguing on walls. Tone modulates with the prince's arrival (urgency) and the final stitching (charged quiet). The final image of Liora's murmured advice carries the tone forward with understated weight. Setup, development, and closure participation are all clear. Score in low-7s: tone is coherent, charges the final image, and modulates purposefully under pressure.</comment>
