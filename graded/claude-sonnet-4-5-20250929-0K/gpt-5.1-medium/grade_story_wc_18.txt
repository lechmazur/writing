<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is characterized through concrete action (mirror-making craft, synchronized breathing) and his interiority shows embodied tension when he worries briefly about losing himself but grounds himself with the feel of cobbles. His motivation to capture the dream drives coherent choices across beats. The final merging moment feels earned by prior causality, though the arc leans heavily on atmospheric accumulation rather than sharp internal contradiction acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through density increase (fog thickening, frost brightening, dream fragments appearing) and cadence shift at closure when figure and maker merge. Orientation anchors (mirror maker, ruined orchard, twilight) land early. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (boundaries erased between dream and maker) with felt cost (his face goes translucent, "edges still smudged"). One meaningful deepening—synchronized breathing enabling the trap—sufficiently tightens options under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ruined orchard's fog, frost-crusted stones, and decayed infrastructure constrain Elias's work (he must breathe with the fog to thin boundaries) and the glass mountains metaphor charges the final flare. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through craft-POV (sand-glass, silver dust, copper bowl). The sextant and mirror function as micro-setting objects that enable the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes he's losing himself, then grounds to proceed. The synchronized breathing is a meaningful tactical choice that narrows his approach. Closure cost is visible: his face becomes translucent, the figure steps into him, erasing boundaries. One deepening under Accumulative lens is sufficient; the piece forgoes multiple reversals in favor of steady intensification.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries (dream/waking, body/weather, reflection/self) emerges organically from craft particulars without stated thesis. The final image—figure merging with maker, district flaring then dimming—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: traps and trapped share substance. Subtext operates in the sextant's hum, the fog's exhalation, and Elias's promise to the district. The mirror drinking his features layers literal craft with identity cost, and no moralizing intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is craft-specific (notices details, measures with sextant, traces silver). Diction remains elevated but consistent ("glass mountains rising out of vapor," "ribs of blown glass"), matching a lyric-precise voice under pressure. No head-hopping. Brief elision (astronomer's vanishing "years ago") primes the present without dragging; the piece teaches its pattern early and holds it. Rhythmic control tightens as the merging nears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every line advances atmosphere, craft action, or boundary-thinning. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence or loops detected. Figurative language ("glass mountains," "trapped frost mites," "anchors dropped through a frozen sea") is dense but coherent and serves the accumulative design. Minor density concern: a few lines restate fog-breathing mechanics without new pressure, costing ~−0.3 within band, but no artifact obscures the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—mirror-making as dream trap via synchronized breathing—feels specific and non-obvious. The ruined orchard, broken sextant, and fog as collaborator combine freshly. Risk is present: the lyric-dense prose and static external action could stall, but the piece commits fully to its accumulative method and the merging payoff justifies the approach. The astronomer backstory and "runaway dream" trope are familiar but transformed through craft particulars and embodied cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias the mirror maker is present from the opening, his craft shapes all tactics (unpacking tools, tracing silver, pressing palm to mirror), and his final choice to match breathing and press the mirror drives the merging closure. Causal across three beats with closure linkage and irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The astronomer's broken sextant is introduced early (wrapped in wool, humming), used mid-scene to align and spot dream fragments, and its crack enables the dream's escape—priming the problem Elias solves. Present in setup, development, and indirectly at closure (the dream it charted merges). Two distinct beats; causal but not irreplaceable (another broken instrument could serve).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Erasing boundaries is the story's operational logic: Elias thins boundaries through synchronized breathing, his reflection blurs, and the final beat enacts the concept when figure steps into him "erasing boundaries between orchard and corridor, glass and flesh, dream and maker." Shapes stakes, constrains method, and is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" appears twice as a phrase: Elias is "firmly grounded in the habit of noticing details" (opening) and he tells the fog "he was firmly grounded…as promise" when he worries about losing himself. It enables his perseverance under ego-dissolving pressure but does not constrain a specific tactic with visible cost. Lyric reprise that reweights the stake but lacks causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Recreate (the sky the sextant once mapped, now on glass) is Elias's stated task and frames all mid-scene action: laying glass, breathing onto it, tracing with silver. The final merging is the culmination of that recreation. Present across setup, development, and closure; causal and essential, though the verb itself could swap for "rebuild" or "map anew" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Synchronized breathing is introduced early as the discovered method ("through synchronized breathing…boundaries…could thin"), dramatized across multiple beats (inhaling with fog's surge, exhaling with retreat), and directly enables the figure to step toward and into him at closure. Mechanically specific, causally indispensable, and tied to visible cost (loss of self-boundary). Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district supplies the fog Elias must partner with, the courtyard workspace, the decayed props that anchor the setting, and the atmospheric pressure throughout. The district "answers with its own faint exhalation," becomes co-actor in the breathing method, and flares at closure. Drives tactics, provides resources, and charges the final image; essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Upon the shimmer of twilight frost" anchors tone and provides ambient light for the work but imposes no temporal urgency or tracked progression. Time is static; no countdown tightens choices. Present in setup and atmosphere but does not constrain decisions or shape closure beyond initial mood-setting.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to capture a runaway dream is stated early, drives Elias's journey and all mirror-making action, and succeeds at closure when the dream merges with him. Friction appears when he worries about losing himself, creating a brief want-versus-cost tension. Causal across beats and linked to closure, though the internal conflict could deepen further.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Glass mountains" appears in the second line ("turning the dead trees into glass mountains") and returns at closure ("the ruined district flared like suns on glass mountains"). The metaphor establishes fragile-luminous tone, modulates subtly with frost brightening and dimming, and charges the final flare. Coherent and purposeful reprise, though tone remains relatively static between opening and peak.</comment>
