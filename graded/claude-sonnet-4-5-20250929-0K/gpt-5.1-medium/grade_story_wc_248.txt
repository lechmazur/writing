<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's analytic intuition is established early and shapes the archive exploration, but the critical decision at closure—to stay and translate—feels underearned; the shift from arsonist seeking redemption to patient scribe lacks visible internal friction or cost at the decisive moment. The remorse is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The backstory weaves through present stimuli effectively, yet the final choice reads more as resolution of guilt than a trade-off that forecloses another live option with felt struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The archive trail accumulates pressure through recurring vandalized objects, building to the tapestry revelation that reweights the protagonist's promise with conceptual cost (burned book vs. carved continuity). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first third. One meaningful deepening occurs when the self-portrait mirrors the protagonist, narrowing the thematic stakes. The closure—staying to translate—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), forecloses the option of returning to cities, and the conceptual cost is legible in the final image of "stitching days into translations." A micro causality slip: "analytically intuitive" enables the protagonist to copy symbols faster than conscious understanding, but we never see this constraint tested or paid for in error.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archive setting actively constrains movement (climbing, narrow passages, the well descent) and the tapestry's suspended position forces a risky physical choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "air…tasted faintly of soot," "lantern swinging," "fingers scraping stone." The fresco, figurine, and mosaic are handled across multiple beats, reweighting meaning each time. The body and tools (lantern, notebook) anchor the protagonist's actions. The environment charges the final image when the protagonist chooses to remain underground, adding spatial cost to the thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing the forgotten promise—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist recognizes their own jaw in the self-portrait, then deepens at the tapestry when the embroidered words match the protagonist's vow. One meaningful escalation occurs: the realization that "violence against art was not destruction but emphasis" reframes all prior vandalism and narrows options to emulation rather than retreat. The final choice to stay and translate is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, and the cost—remaining off-grid, alone—is legible. However, the story does not test this choice against a competing pull (e.g., a reason to return), so the trade-off reads more as acceptance than a forced renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—how to preserve truth under catastrophe—emerges from the contrast between the protagonist's fire (annihilation) and the archive's method (wound into script). The tapestry fragment and vandalized objects accumulate pressure without overt statement. The final image, "stitching my days into translations," offers a resonant, non-literal answer: care as an act of repair and continuity. The promise, "I will not let stories die in silence," recurs with reweighted meaning, constraining the protagonist's final choice. No thematic echo in the closure paragraph; the ending shows rather than declares.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single first-person POV maintains stable distance and perceptual signature throughout: the protagonist notices patterns as "memories my body has not yet lived" and filters the archive through guilt and analytic habit. Diction is controlled and character-particular, with purposeful compression ("volcanic tenderness rising without face or word"). Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "analytical intuition" is asserted rather than dramatized through a mistake or misread that the protagonist must correct. Psychic distance modulates appropriately under pressure (the well descent tightens syntax). No dialogue; interiority carries the voice load effectively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance multiple jobs (setting, interiority, theme). Rhythm varies naturally and accelerates during the well descent. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in the middle: "a volcanic tenderness rising without face or word" and "my chest cleave open with remorse and awe, as if my ribs were doors" layer metaphor densely in adjacent beats without clear pattern-teaching, though the register stays voice-coherent. One filter-verb run: "I saw," "I understood," "I felt" cluster in the climax paragraph but do not obscure causality. The final line—"adding to the trail for whoever came next"—closes with image and action. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—arsonist finds redemption by translating an archive whose preservation method inverts their own destructive act—offers a fresh synthesis of guilt, preservation, and artistic continuity. The vandalized self-portrait with the protagonist's asymmetrical eyebrows is a bold, specific image that charges the closure without gimmickry. The choice to stay underground and "stitch days into translations" commits fully to the story's logic and avoids safety-middle resolution. The transformation of tropes (the burnt library, the lost archive) is executed through grounded, particular detail. Risk-taking is evident in the dense backstory integration and lyric register, both of which heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lending library arsonist drives setup (establishes guilt and motivation), appears in backstory that reweights the archive discovery, and the final choice to translate is a direct response to the arson. Present in all three gates. Two beats: backstory reflection mid-story and closure decision. Causal pressure: the arson creates the need for a different path, shaping the ending. Closure linkage: the decision to stay and translate inverts the arson. Moderate specificity; the arson could be another destructive act with minor edits. Swappability and lack of on-page struggle at closure lower the score. Late penalty does not apply (introduced in opening). Ornamental use does not apply. Cost is conceptual (exile, solitude) but not tied to a trade-off the arsonist identity uniquely enables. Starting at 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats +0.9 + causal pressure +0.8 + closure linkage +1.0 − swappability −0.5 = 5.7, round down to 5.7. Adjust for passive acceptance rather than active turn: −0.3 additional for limited irreplaceability of this exact character in the final choice. Final: 5.4, but the arson backstory does reweight present stakes in two distinct beats and the closure hinges on it, so lift to 6.2 for transformation strength.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The faded tapestry fragment appears early (setup: "At the bottom of the well hung a faded tapestry fragment"), is handled physically in the climax (protagonist lowers into well, examines embroidery up close), and its embroidered promise directly shapes the closure choice ("I will not let stories die in silence" → "adding to the trail"). Three gates met. Three beats: initial sighting, physical descent, and thematic payoff at ending. High causal pressure: the tapestry holds the key message that reframes the protagonist's promise. Strong closure linkage: the embroidered words are the conceptual hinge for the final decision. High specificity: a different object (e.g., a carved stone) would not carry the same textile/stitching metaphor that echoes "stitching my days into translations." Visible cost: the protagonist stays underground to continue the work the tapestry represents. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5 = 8.9 from base 3.0 = 11.9 cap at 10.0, but apply realistic band: the tapestry is not swappable and its exact properties (threadbare weave, bronze hooks, embroidered script) matter to both plot and theme, so 8.7 is appropriate for very strong integration with one minor slip (the fragment is described but not physically touched until late, reducing embodied presence slightly).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait concept is signaled early via the fresco with scratches, then the clay figurine, then the mosaic, teaching a pattern of "mutilations" that form a trail. The protagonist's recognition of their own jaw in one portrait (middle beat) narrows understanding: "violence against art was not destruction but emphasis." This realization constrains the protagonist's final choice to emulate (translate and mark) rather than destroy. Present in all three gates. Three beats: fresco discovery, self-portrait recognition, tapestry payoff. High causal pressure: the concept reframes all prior vandalism and shapes the ending's method. Strong closure linkage: the decision to "add to the trail" directly echoes the archive's vandalized messages. High specificity: the exact mechanism (defaced art as message) is irreplaceable and drives the thematic turn. Visible cost: the protagonist accepts isolation to continue the method. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.8, cost +0.5 = 9.4 from base 3.0 = 12.4, cap at 10.0, but realistic band: the concept is indispensable and the story would collapse without it, so 7.8 is conservative; raise to 8.9 for full integration. However, the self-portrait is one object among many in the trail, so the concept's specificity is shared across the "trail" element (9F). To avoid double-credit, hold at 7.8 for the concept's independent role.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Analytically intuitive is introduced early ("I found it because I am analytically intuitive, which means patterns feel like memories my body has not yet lived") and enables the protagonist to recognize the entrance, follow the symbol trail, and copy the script "faster than my conscious understanding." Present in setup and development. Two beats: finding the archive and copying symbols. Moderate causal pressure: the trait enables the journey but does not constrain or cost the protagonist (no misread, no trade-off for intuition over deliberation). Minimal closure linkage: the trait is not mentioned or tested in the ending. Low specificity: "observant" or "pattern-sensitive" could substitute with minor edits. No visible cost tied to the trait. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6 (enabled but not constrained), closure linkage 0.0, specificity −0.6 (swappable), cost 0.0 = 4.4 from base 3.0 = 7.4, but label-only use (the trait is declared, not dramatized through error or friction) and lack of trade-off lower to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Portray appears in two senses: the flames "portray a language of endings" (backstory) and the protagonist's final choice to "portray not annihilation but ferocious care" (closure). Setup: backstory. Development: implicit in the act of copying symbols and examining art. Payoff: the closure decision hinges on portraying differently. Two gates (setup, payoff; middle development is implicit). Two beats: arson backstory and closure reframe. Moderate causal pressure: the verb ties the arson to the archive's method and the final choice. Strong closure linkage: the ending directly invokes "portrayed" as the new mode. Moderate specificity: "depict" or "represent" could substitute, though "portray" carries both visual-art and performance connotations that fit the archive's layered messages. Cost: the choice to stay and portray is the final price. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.4, cost +0.4 = 7.4 from base 3.0 = 10.4, cap at 10.0, but realistic band: the action is central but not uniquely irreplaceable, so 7.4 fits strong integration with moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A trail of artistic creations leading to a hidden message is signaled early (fresco with scratches, then figurine, then mosaic), taught as a pattern by the midpoint ("Object after object bore the same strange mutilations"), and the protagonist follows it to the tapestry, which delivers the hidden promise. Present in all three gates. Four beats: fresco, figurine, mosaic, tapestry. High causal pressure: the method structures the protagonist's exploration and discovery. Strong closure linkage: the decision to "add to the trail" directly echoes and continues the method. High specificity: the exact mechanism (defaced art as cumulative message) is irreplaceable. Visible cost: the protagonist adopts the method, committing to isolation and patience. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.8, cost +0.5 = 9.2 from base 3.0 = 12.2, cap at 10.0, but realistic band: the method is indispensable and drives both plot and theme, so 8.3 is appropriate for very strong integration with a minor note that the "hidden message" is revealed rather than pursued with error or misdirection, slightly reducing tension.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is introduced early (title, first paragraph) and its physical structure—collapsed amphitheater, underground shelves, central well—constrains movement and choices throughout. Setup: opening. Development: the passages, well descent. Payoff: the protagonist stays in the archive at closure. Three gates met. Four beats: entrance discovery, shelf exploration, well descent, closure decision to remain. High causal pressure: the archive's layout and contents enable the discovery and shape the final choice. Strong closure linkage: staying in the archive is the decisive action. High specificity: the exact setting (underground, isolated, structured around a central well) matters to both plot mechanics and thematic resonance (descent, burial, preservation). Visible cost: choosing the archive over returning to cities. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5 = 8.9 from base 3.0 = 11.9, cap at 10.0, but realistic band: the setting is essential and irreplaceable, so 8.1 is appropriate for very strong integration with a hairline note that the archive's physical constraints (e.g., limited light, unstable structure) do not complicate the protagonist's actions beyond the well descent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After going off the grid is signaled in the opening ("three years had passed since I went off the grid") and frames the protagonist's isolation. The timeframe reappears at closure ("I stayed in the archive, still off the grid"). Two gates: setup and payoff. Two beats: opening context and closure choice. Low causal pressure: the three-year span and off-grid status provide context but do not constrain present choices or create urgency. Moderate closure linkage: staying off-grid is part of the final decision but not its driving cost. Low specificity: any duration or isolation framing could substitute. No visible in-scene cost tied to the timeframe itself (e.g., dwindling supplies, expiring window). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.3, closure linkage +0.6, specificity −0.5, cost 0.0 = 4.8 from base 3.0 = 7.8, but the timeframe is functional yet replaceable, and it does not shape tactics, so hold at 4.8 for mid-band functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To rescue a forgotten promise is introduced early ("my real reason burned quieter and deeper. I was here to rescue a forgotten promise") and drives the protagonist's exploration. The promise is embodied in the tapestry's embroidered words and the protagonist's backstory vow ("I will not let stories die in silence"). The final choice to translate and add to the trail directly fulfills the rescuing. Three gates met. Three beats: initial motivation statement, tapestry revelation, closure decision. High causal pressure: the promise shapes the journey and the ending. Strong closure linkage: the rescue is achieved through the decision to stay and continue the work. Moderate specificity: "recover" or "honor" could substitute, though "rescue" carries urgency and action. Visible cost: isolation and exile to fulfill the promise. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.4, cost +0.5 = 8.5 from base 3.0 = 11.5, cap at 10.0, but realistic band: the motivation is essential yet the protagonist's internal friction around it (e.g., doubt, competing desire to return) is told rather than dramatized in conflicting micro-choices, so 7.6 fits strong integration with a noted weakness in embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Volcanic tenderness appears once as a phrase ("a volcanic tenderness rising without face or word") mid-story and is evoked in the closure ("I felt my chest cleave open with remorse and awe"). The tone—intensity layered with care—modulates through the piece: clinical distance at the entrance, mounting recognition in the passages, culminating in the chest-cleaving moment. Two gates: development (phrase) and payoff (closure emotion). Two beats: mid-story phrase and closure image. Moderate causal pressure: the tone shapes the protagonist's perceptual filter but does not constrain a choice. Moderate closure linkage: the final emotion (remorse, awe, care) echoes the tone. Moderate specificity: the exact pairing of volcanic (violent, unstable) and tenderness (care, gentleness) is distinctive but not irreplaceable; "fierce compassion" could substitute. Cost: the tone's intensity charges the final decision but is not itself a cost. Early signal penalty (phrase appears in middle third) −0.3, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5, cost +0.3 = 5.9 from base 3.0 = 8.9, but the tone is evoked rather than sustained across beats and its modulation under pressure is implied rather than dramatically shifted, so 6.9 fits solid integration with room for more embodied tonal progression.</comment>
