<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is concrete and embodied throughout—"metallic chill gather in my palms," "stellar doubt flooded me"—and the final choice to stop casting lots is earned through cumulative pressure. Internal contradiction drives the climax: the cast lots decision maker must choose to stop listening to chance itself. Tamsin's "quietly enthusiastic" demeanor is established through action and stance rather than labels. Minor deduction for the precollapse litany feeling slightly inserted rather than fully earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density increase (static bursts thickening, backwards prophecy arriving inverted) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the protagonist places hands on the tuning dials and chooses to "wavelength align with purpose already latent within." The closure forecloses the path of randomness with visible cost—"to stop casting was to amputate my function"—and the final hum reweights the dominant stake. The backwards-prophecy directive "Do not cast again; the choice loops; step off the spiral" provides a meaningful tightening that narrows options under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck, contracted universe, and "stars packed so closely that their light became a thick marmalade" create a vivid, purposeful sensory environment filtered through the protagonist's professional focus. The glass floor and console are micro-setting elements that constrain choices: coins cast on glass create visual constellations, and the tuning dials become the final tactile anchor. The contracting universe functions as both macro-setting and pressure mechanism, tightening around the characters' choices. One small miss: the cosmologists' exposition about the new burst feels slightly external to the POV's immediate sensory frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to continue relying on randomness or trust autonomous choice—is signaled early and tightens through the backwards prophecy's direct command. The spiral coin pattern ("motion itself had been wounded") provides a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and options. Agency operates through renunciation with visible cost: "to stop casting was to amputate my function" makes the price legible. The protagonist's final act of placing hands on the dials and tuning "not seeking an order from beyond" provides a decisive tightening under the Accumulative lens. Minor cap at 8.2 due to the cosmologists' explanation feeling slightly externalized rather than dramatized through immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of agency versus randomness emerges organically from the coin-casting ritual, the backwards prophecy, and the final tuning choice. "Chance knows what cause forgets" becomes a precollapse litany that the ending must renounce, and the spiral pattern ("the choice loops; step off the spiral") provides a non-literal answer to the central question. The final image—"trying to wavelength align with purpose already latent within our own trembling atoms"—offers resonant closure without moralizing. Stellar doubt and backwards time create thematic density without abstraction. The piece resists tidy resolution: the protagonist "chose to trust that hum anyway" acknowledges ongoing uncertainty rather than certainty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and controlled: "space was no longer an expansion but a held breath," "coins minted on worlds where gravity had once pointed outward, not inward." The narrator's perceptual signature is consistent—professional, metaphorically precise, filtering the universe's compression through the lens of decision-making and chance. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Tamsin's single line of dialogue ("What does that say?") is natural and goal-driven, and her non-verbal reactions ("smiled with raw relief") distinguish her stance from the protagonist's doubt. The phrase "quietly enthusiastic in the way of people who had decided that fear could be rebranded as curiosity" demonstrates character-specific filtering. Under peak stress the voice maintains texture without collapsing into generic simplicity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high throughout: most lines advance multiple elements (character, atmosphere, concept). Rhythm modulates appropriately—longer contemplative sentences during coin-reading, shorter syntax at the tuning choice. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor ding for one phrase bordering on stock: "the universe were groping for my outline" feels slightly generic compared to the otherwise precise figurative language. The opening and closing images bookend effectively: "ambered observatory deck" recurs as the spatial constant while action transforms. Sentence openings vary; no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of backwards prophecy, contracting universe, and randomness-versus-agency creates a non-obvious premise that feels earned rather than gimmicky. The specific detail of foreign coins from "nations had evaporated with the first collapse of spacetime" anchors the speculative frame in tangible loss. The reversal—receiving a prophecy already inverted, then choosing to stop casting lots in response—feels inevitable in hindsight. The piece avoids the safety middle: it commits fully to its cosmological compression conceit and follows through to a stance crystallization rather than hedging. Small deduction for the cosmologists' explanation feeling slightly expository, a minor template move in an otherwise bold execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The cast lots decision maker role frames the protagonist's function, drives the central conflict (to cast or not to cast), and is present in the opening, middle coin-casting beat, and the climactic refusal to "scoop them up." The final choice—"I should stop listening to it"—is causally rooted in this exact role and forecloses the protagonist's defining function with visible cost ("amputate my function"). Setup early, developed through the coin pattern, and decisively reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The foreign coins appear in setup (battered wooden bowl, evaporated nations), are handled and cast in the middle beat (creating the spiral constellation), and are present at closure as "guilty witnesses" when the protagonist chooses not to scoop them up. The coins' symbolic weight shifts: from tools of randomness to evidence of a choice-loop that must be broken. Used in three distinct beats with escalating meaning. Not quite indispensable (the refusal could involve another ritual), but deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy shapes the premise (messages "told from ending to beginning"), drives middle tactics (tuning the dish, flipping sequences), and delivers the key directive at the climax ("Do not cast again; the choice loops"). The protagonist and Tamsin's work throughout involves understanding and responding to these inverted messages. The concept is present in setup, alters middle choices, and directly triggers the final turning-away from randomness. Strong integration, though the concept could be replaced with a different temporal mechanic without breaking the renunciation arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tamsin's "quietly enthusiastic" trait is established early ("in the way of people who had decided that fear could be rebranded as curiosity"), constrains her request for a casting before replying, and pays off in her "smiled with raw relief" reaction to the prophecy. The trait enables her stance at closure ("You may choose your own way now") and contrasts with the protagonist's stellar doubt. Present in setup and closure, with visible choice consequence in the middle. Solid lyric reprise that reweights the dominant stake, but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Distill" appears in cosmologists' framing ("distill from uncertainty a pattern worth bequeathing forward") and implicitly in the protagonist's coin-reading ("tracing coins...cutting inward"). The action is present conceptually in the protagonist's role and is articulated at a key turn, but it doesn't drive a major reversal on its own—the tuning and refusal to cast are the visible acts. Present in two beats with thematic charge, but somewhat swappable with "interpret" or "extract" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Understanding static bursts is the method taught a decade ago, shapes every shift's work (tuning the dish by hand, flipping sequences), and becomes the climactic action when the protagonist and Tamsin "adjusted the frequency in slow, careful turns." The method is signaled early, enables middle attempts, and structures the final choice to wavelength align. Mechanics matter: the static thickening creates urgency, and the final "low, continuous hum" provides closure feedback. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck anchors the opening and provides the spatial constant (console, dome, glass floor) for all action. The amber light under which coins are cast and the bruised sky visible through the dome contribute atmosphere and reflect compression. The setting is present in setup and closure and supplies the console as a key resource. However, the deck itself doesn't constrain a pivotal choice—the action could occur in a similar control room. Solid lyric reprise (ambered deck mentioned first and implied throughout) but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The contracted universe timeframe is established immediately, drives the stakes (final turns before a new burst), and creates urgency ("this compression finished"). The timeframe shapes the protagonist's reflection on bequeathing patterns forward and the cosmologists' prediction. Present in setup, middle cosmological framing, and implicit in the closure's forward-looking choice. The timeframe adds pressure but doesn't tighten tactics beat-to-beat—there's no live countdown. Solid thematic integration with one meaningful constraint on the ending's weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>To wavelength align with purpose is the protagonist's ultimate desire, articulated early in the dish-tuning work and culminating in the climactic action: "trying to wavelength align with purpose already latent within our own trembling atoms." The motivation is conflicted throughout—stellar doubt versus the backwards prophecy's directive—and the final choice embodies the friction between surrendering to randomness and trusting autonomous purpose. The desire drives the ending image and forecloses the randomness path with visible cost. Essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stellar doubt is named explicitly, pervades the protagonist's stance ("stellar doubt flooded me," "still ruled by stellar doubt, chose to trust"), and modulates with pressure: doubt intensifies when the prophecy arrives, peaks at the decision to stop casting, and persists even as the protagonist acts. The tone charges the final image ("chose to trust that hum anyway") by maintaining ambiguity rather than resolving into certainty. Present throughout with consistent texture and clear closure participation. Not quite indispensable (another doubt-register could serve), but tightly woven.</comment>
