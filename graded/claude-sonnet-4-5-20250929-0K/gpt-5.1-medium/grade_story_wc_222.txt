<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior voice is distinct and carries contradictory impulses—swagger masking fear, desire for wonder constrained by cynicism. The central choice to trade away the fear of not returning is earned through the climb's pressure and the king's setup. Emotional embodiment is strong ("chest ache," trembling afterwards) but the final shift leans slightly toward diagnostic self-awareness ("afraid and still climbing"). Minor: the chivalrous-thief frame remains largely asserted rather than dramatized through specific on-page ethical friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure builds through sensory density and the sundial's transformation rather than causal reversals. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lid clicks, questions brush the protagonist, and the final line reconfigures the script with felt cost ("unarmed"). Orientation anchors quickly (spire, sky, climb). One meaningful deepening occurs when the king is placed and the lid responds. Cost is visible in the renunciation of cynicism and the acceptance of vulnerability, though the phrase "agree to meet it unarmed" verges on abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire, glassy rungs, and black-glass pedestal constrain the climb and charge the setting with tactile specificity. The "wrong sky" with bruise-colored pulsing recurs and pressures the protagonist's choices. The sundial lid's temperature paradox ("neither cold nor warm") and the engravings that ripple mid-scene transform the pedestal from postcard to active constraint. Micro-setting (hand on stone, frost on stairs) alters tactics and the final platform silence shapes the ritual exchange.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: to embrace wonder without cynicism's shield. One meaningful deepening occurs when the king's secret is revealed and the lid responds, narrowing options to acceptance or retreat. The cost of vulnerability is legible in the final choice to "meet it unarmed." However, the escalation is more textural (accumulation of atmospheric pressure) than a causal tightening of agency; no live antagonist or time-pressure forces the peak choice, relying instead on the protagonist's internal readiness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the climb and the trade: cautious abandon, wonder versus cynicism, the cost of unguarded openness. The children-playing-with-stars engraving and the final "unarmed" image offer non-literal answers to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (bowing before touching) and silence (the wind's shiver). Minor slip: "Thematic Echo" appears in "what I really wanted was not the lid itself, but the chance to amend the script I had been following since childhood," which borders on prompt-language articulation of the thesis, though it's embedded in realization rather than summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single POV with stable distance and a lyric, elevated register consistent throughout ("chivalrous thief," "sacredly playful," "bruise-colored sky"). Perceptual signature is strong—the protagonist notices aesthetic and ethical nuances (engravings, prayers, silence). The voice modulates under pressure: sentence rhythm shortens at the pedestal, lengthens in reflection. No head-hopping. Minor: the diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("argument between fire and ice," "prophecy") that reads slightly ornamental rather than voice-rooted, but the lapses are brief and the texture remains character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is vivid ("clouds like torn pages," "sky overhead pulsed"). Information density is high. However, several lines loop or restate: "cautious abandon" appears twice with near-identical framing, "afraid and still climbing" echoes "embrace the unknown with open arms," and "wrongness of the sky" / "wrong sky" recur without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" constructions in the summit paragraph. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats. Applying −0.6 for loops and template cadence under the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of chivalrous thief, tactile setting (icebound spire), and the chess-piece-with-secrets method feels specific and non-obvious. The "apprentice of wonder" frame and the sundial-that-asks-questions premise are fresh inflections on quest-for-artifact templates. Emotional specificity (fear of not returning, longing beneath swagger) avoids generic templates. The final turn—meeting the future unarmed—grows from prior particulars (the king's secret, the engravings). Risk-taking in tone and voice heightens stakes. However, the core arc (cynical thief learns to be vulnerable) is a familiar template; transformation is present but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; the thief's code ("Take only what is freely given") and the decision to trade the king drive the climb and closure. The chivalrous frame is asserted more than tested—no on-page ethical dilemma forces a choice between code and desire. The character's final act (lifting the lid, accepting vulnerability) is causal but could function similarly if the thief were simply "reckless" rather than chivalrous. Two beats (offering the king, lifting the lid) involve the trait; closure links to it. Setup early, development weak, payoff present. Applying −0.4 for swappability and −0.3 for label-only code mention.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Central object; appears in four beats: arrival at pedestal, touch, the click, and the final lift. Its properties (neither cold nor warm, engravings that ripple) constrain the protagonist's approach and charge the closure. Removing it would collapse the story's logic. Setup immediate, development across middle (the click and questions), payoff decisive. High specificity (closed over "an absence of time") and irreplaceability. Cost connection clear: the lid's questions reveal possible lives and the final lift commits to vulnerability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Apprentice of wonder" is declared early and frames the climb's motive. It shapes the dominant stake (rejecting wisdom for wonder) and the final choice to "meet it unarmed." However, the concept is largely thematic rather than tactical—it does not constrain a specific on-page action or alter a middle choice. The protagonist's behavior (careful climb, ritual offering) could proceed identically if motivated by curiosity or greed. Setup strong, development minimal (no beat where "apprentice" status enables or limits), payoff thematic. Applying −0.5 for lack of middle causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Sacredly playful" appears once as descriptor for the engraved children and implicitly in the protagonist's approach (bowing, whispering bargain, "cautious abandon"). It charges the closure image by modeling the desired stance. However, it's never a constraint—no moment where the protagonist must choose playfulness over caution or vice versa. Setup mid-scene (engravings), development absent, payoff lyric (charges the final image). Applying −0.6 for late first appearance and −0.4 for lack of on-page tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Amend" is the story's conceptual hinge: the protagonist wants to "amend the script" and the final line delivers it ("let the wrong sky write me anew"). Setup early (implicit in "embrace the unknown"), development in the realization paragraph, payoff explicit in closure. The action defines the resolution and is irreplaceable. However, "amend" as verb is slightly abstract—could be "rewrite," "change," "transform" with similar effect. Strong causal role and closure linkage. Applying −0.3 for moderate swappability at the word level.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The chess-piece method is signaled early (paragraph 4), detailed with prior examples (rook, knight, pawn), and executed in the peak beat (placing the king with hidden fear). Its mechanics matter: the king's icewood and the secret inside enable the bargain. Removing it would require rewriting the exchange logic. Setup early, development across multiple beats (explanation, preparation, placement), payoff causal. High specificity and irreplaceability. Cost connection: the protagonist trades the only thing never stolen, a personal vulnerability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spire is present throughout, constrains the climb (glassy rungs, frost, stairs), and provides the pedestal where closure occurs. Its verticality and isolation above clouds pressure the protagonist's choice—no retreat is dramatized but the setting's extremity charges the final commitment. Setup immediate, development across climb beats (slick rungs, ringing silence at summit), payoff as stage for closure. Micro-setting (hand on stone, platform) alters tactics. Applying slight reduction for lack of a moment where terrain explicitly narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"When the sky is wrong" is declared in the opening and recurs ("wrong sky" in final line, "bruise-colored sky," constellations drifting). It frames the climb's urgency and charges atmosphere but does not tighten decisions—no clock runs, no consequence for delay is dramatized. The timeframe is more tonal than tactical. Setup immediate, development textural (repeated atmospheric cues), payoff lyric (final line reprise). Applying −0.5 for lack of middle causal pressure and −0.3 for ornamental recurrence without cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation to "embrace the unknown with open arms" is declared early, dramatized in the climb despite fear, and conflicted in the realization that the protagonist has always "let myself be that open, that unguarded" only in aspiration. The secret in the king makes the desire concrete and costly. Setup early, development in internal friction (swagger vs. trembling), payoff decisive (the final lift and acceptance). Strong causal linkage and cost connection. Minor: the phrase itself is slightly abstract; more embodied phrasing would elevate.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Cautious abandon" is named explicitly, modeled in the climb (careful steps, reckless goal), and charges the tone throughout—lyric elevation with risk-taking specificity. The tone modulates: tightens at the pedestal, expands in reflection, pulses in the final line. However, the phrase is stated twice rather than purely embodied, and the tone is more consistent than dynamically modulated under pressure. Setup immediate, development steady, payoff present but not intensified. Applying −0.4 for static mood and −0.3 for label reliance over embodiment.</comment>
