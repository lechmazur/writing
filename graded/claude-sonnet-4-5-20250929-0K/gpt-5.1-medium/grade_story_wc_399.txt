<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The line walker's motivation is clear and his perceptual mode (peripheral awareness) is consistent, though the prophet's "strangely honest" trait feels more asserted than embodied in contradictory action. The merchant beat shows internal shift through dramatized mirror-work, but most other characters (the mother, elders) remain sketched rather than inhabited with embodied contradiction. The line walker's final realization and whispered intervention earn the closure choice, but the prophet's sudden receptivity and the merchant's shoulder-sag lack the messy resistance that would deepen the turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines; the timeframe "after the prophet arrives" is signaled early and held. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through the parapet's grinding and the line walker's cable-steadying work until the whispered intervention deepens the prophet's method, producing a final stilling with visible cost (the merchant's exposure, the parapet's exhale). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the city gains a "quiet, enduring wall" of echoes), and the cost is legible in the merchant's trapped mirror-moment and the dunes' rest. One meaningful deepening (the line walker's realization that honesty alone won't suffice) tightens the approach and shifts tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The pavilion's "silken walls" and "conjured clearings" create spatial zones that guide the prophet's interactions, and the kinetic parapet beneath the dunes supplies tactile pressure (grinding, shuddering, exhaling) that tracks emotional stakes. The cable—invisible to all but the line walker—functions as embodied setting, his balance registering the city's truthfulness. The dunes and distant camels offer sensory grounding. However, the "whisperfield calm" and "murmuring" remain largely atmospheric labels rather than concrete sensory anchors that constrain a specific choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wisdom's echo to prevent the parapet from breaching—is signaled early and drives all subsequent beats. Pressure accumulates through the parapet's grinding (tracked across the mother's question, the merchant's ledger-building, and the final stilling), and the line walker's near-fall supplies a visceral cost. The whispered intervention is protagonist-driven and narrows options: the prophet must name cruelties, not merely predict futures. The merchant's mirror-moment forecloses his denial with visible cost (sagging shoulders, ledger collapse), and the final image (parapet asleep, dunes resting) registers the price paid and the new equilibrium earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—truth's echo versus denial's kinetic cost—emerges through concrete images (the grinding parapet, the cable's lurch, the merchant's ledger-fortress) rather than abstract claim. The half-mask's design (one side for lies, one for unsaid wishes) embodies the thematic question without over-explaining it. The ending offers a resonant answer: shaped honesty (not raw prophecy alone) stills denial and anchors memory. However, the final paragraph's "whisperfield calm against forgetting" edges toward thematic summary, and the "echo of wisdom" phrase recurs as a near-label rather than evolving through fresh imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on the line walker; psychic distance contracts during his near-fall and his whispered realization without head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated and lyric ("kinetic parapet," "liminal art," "conjured clearings"), fitting the fable-like voice. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("cable of thought," "parapet shuddering," "whisperfield calm"). The prophet's dialogue ("You must lose most of it") and the line walker's whisper are goal-driven and move the plot. Minor register drift: "ledgers like fortresses" and "mirror" as verb feel slightly modern against the archaic-fable texture, but the slips are brief and do not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual modulation; no template-cadence runs. Information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure). However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("iron and distant thunder," "whisperfield calm," "conjured clearings," "ledgers like fortresses," "cable lurched," "stone remembering stillness"), and while individually clear, the accumulation risks overwriting in peak beats (the merchant scene and the line walker's near-fall). Two paraphrase loops: "to preserve the echo of wisdom" (repeated across lines 17–18) and "strangely honest" (lines 11–12). No scaffold or synonym churn, and clarity remains intact at closure, so deductions are modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—half-masked empath, kinetic parapet as denial's physical cost, cable-walking between minds—feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock prophet-in-tent clichés. The merchant beat (named cruelties as precise mirror) transforms the prophecy trope through tactical specificity. However, the premise (truth-teller in a city that prefers lies) is familiar, and the resolution (honesty + empathy stills the city) follows a predictable arc. The "whisperfield calm" and "echo of wisdom" phrases recur as thematic shorthand rather than earning fresh inflection at closure. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric voice and peripheral-awareness mechanic are distinctive, but the emotional and structural trajectory remains within well-charted territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The half-masked line walker is present in the opening third, drives the middle choice (his near-fall and realization), and delivers the whispered intervention that shifts the prophet's method and resolves the parapet threat. His decision to whisper "speak not only what will be, but what paths might soften" is causally central and alters the prophet's tactics, which in turn stills the kinetic parapet. The ending explicitly credits his "path of echoes" as the "quiet, enduring wall." Early signal, two distinct beats (near-fall, whispered counsel), causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet is introduced in the opening third (line 13), returns in the merchant beat (line 30: "bucked, stones grinding"), and appears in the ending (line 42: "the kinetic parapet slowed… exhale like stone remembering stillness"). Its grinding tracks denial and its stilling tracks the resolution, so it shapes two beats and participates in closure. However, it is not handled or directly manipulated by any character; it functions as atmospheric consequence rather than a tactical object. Causal pressure and closure linkage are present, but irreplaceability is moderate (any metaphorical cost-tracker could serve a similar role).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conjured clearings are introduced early (line 9: "conjured clearings in the crowded city of thought") and frame the mother's and merchant's question scenes (lines 24, 28, 38). They organize the pavilion's spatial logic and enable the prophet's one-on-one truth-telling, so they constrain how the prophet operates. However, they do not return at closure or shift meaning; they remain a static staging device. Setup and middle development are present, but closure participation is absent. Functional but replaceable: any spatial frame (circles, platforms, curtained alcoves) could serve the same role without altering the story's core pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" is introduced in line 11 ("this one was strangely honest") and recurs in line 36 ("strangely honest gentleness"). It drives the prophet's blunt prediction to the mother and his naming of the merchant's cruelties, both of which trigger the parapet's grinding and eventual stilling. The trait enables the core conflict (honesty triggers denial, denial feeds the parapet) and is present in two beats. However, the cost is largely borne by others (the merchant's exposure, the mother's tangled grief); the prophet himself pays no visible price for his honesty. Setup, middle development, and closure linkage are present, but the tradeoff is not internalized by the character who holds the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Consecrate" appears in line 7 ("to consecrate a path between voices") and is reprised in line 33 ("honesty alone would not consecrate the city") and implicitly in the ending ("his path of echoes had become a quiet, enduring wall"). The line walker's realization that honesty alone is insufficient turns the middle beat, and his whispered intervention completes the consecration by shaping how truth is delivered. The action is present in setup, middle realization, and ending payoff, and it is causally irreplaceable: the story's stakes hinge on consecrating wisdom's echo. Early signal, two beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Peripheral awareness" is introduced in line 5 ("reading tremors in minds like gusts along wire"), recurs in line 21 ("drawing instead through peripheral awareness the fragile threads"), and appears in line 35 ("as if hearing through peripheral awareness a chorus"). It defines the line walker's method and is present when he nearly falls (line 31: "catching himself"), when he listens to the merchant's interior ledger-building, and when the prophet receives the whispered counsel. The method shapes how the line walker perceives pressure and informs his intervention. Early signal, two beats, causal pressure, and closure contribution all present, though the specifics of how peripheral awareness differs from direct observation remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion is introduced in line 2 and its silken walls are described in line 8 ("sighed with every movement, murmuring like patient teachers"). It frames all the action and supplies the atmospheric calm that contrasts with the restless dunes. However, it does not constrain a specific choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The pavilion is a static container; the story would function identically in any enclosed space where the prophet holds audience. Setup and middle presence are clear, but the pavilion does not participate in closure or reweight meaning. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the prophet arrives" is stated in line 2 and establishes the story's temporal anchor. However, the phrase is used primarily to sequence causality (everything follows the prophet's arrival) rather than to create urgency or a live clock. No on-page deadline pressures decisions, and time does not tighten tactics. The opening lines also include "By then, the half-masked line walker had already strung his cable," which introduces a brief flashback, but the story quickly returns to the present and remains there. Setup is present, but the timeframe does not develop or constrain choices in the middle or ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of wisdom" is introduced in line 7 and recurs in line 17 ("wisdom without echo dies faster than silence") and implicitly in the ending ("his path of echoes had become a quiet, enduring wall"). The motivation drives the line walker's acceptance of the elders' call, his near-fall when honesty scatters instead of anchoring, and his whispered intervention to shape the prophet's method. It is present in setup, middle crisis, and closure payoff, and it is dramatized through his choices (stepping onto the cable, whispering to the prophet) with visible cost (near-fall, the merchant's exposure). Early signal, two beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and felt cost all present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Whisperfield calm" appears in line 6 ("settled a whisperfield calm, a hush that seemed to fold sound into itself") and is reprised in the final line ("the city held a new, whisperfield calm against forgetting"). The tone is coherent across the opening, middle (the prophet's quiet truth-telling, the line walker's silent cable-walk), and ending. However, the tone remains largely static; no modulation occurs during the parapet's grinding or the line walker's near-fall, where tension might heighten diction or rhythm. The final reprise charges the closure image by linking the initial calm to the earned stillness, but the tone does not evolve in response to pressure. Early signal and closure linkage present; middle development minimal.</comment>
