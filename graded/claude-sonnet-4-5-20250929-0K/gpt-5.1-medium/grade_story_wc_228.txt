<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The painter's interiority shows concrete particulars—turpentine on hands, the cobalt shell, the promise kept—and the final act of painting fulfills an arc of endurance. However, motivation remains largely reflective rather than tested by on-page friction; the protagonist walks, paints, and leaves without meaningful internal contradiction or a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present but muted; the introspective texture flattens agency into observation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered reflection and the cavern discovery, culminating in the painting act as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant—witnessing and bringing back proof). Orientation anchors late (~150 words for full spatial grounding in the cave), triggering a −0.3 penalty, but the closure unit lands cleanly with felt cost (the promise kept, the secret held). Causality is elliptical yet legible under the accumulative lens; the cracked mirror frames expectation and the painted shell charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coastal cave network constrains the protagonist's path and supplies the pool, stalagmites, and moon-shaft that anchor the closure painting. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—lime taste, wet-cloth darkness, glass-clear pool—and the cavern's temporary-eternity motif directly enables the final image. Spatial choreography is clean through the descent and chamber widening. The setting fulfills the Q3 9+ gate criterion by charging the final image, though early quay anchors arrive slowly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (paint the place that does not yet exist, keep the hidden promise) and the wrong-turn discovery narrows options spatially, but escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on atmosphere and reflection rather than a live trade-off or reversal that forecloses a path. The painting act itself is a quiet fulfillment without visible on-page cost beyond effort; no tactical sacrifice or competing urgency tests commitment. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist recognizes the scene, yet the resolution feels given rather than earned by prior friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cracked mirror, temporary eternity motif, and the protagonist's liminal relationship to the quay—intimately aloof, belonging yet unfinished. The painted seashell and its cobalt storms recur with reweighted meaning, and the final image (painting the pool as unbroken mirror, washing brushes without mixing) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the hidden promise without stated moral. Subtext operates in gesture and silence; "witness and bring back proof" distills longing into specifics. Minor slip: "temporary eternity" is invoked slightly more than earned by image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single first-person POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture—"darkness pressed against me like wet cloth, intimate yet somehow still aloof." Diction remains within the painter's lexicon; perceptual signature is selective and biased (noticing spirals, storms, turpentine). Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and contemplative remove. No dialogue; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned imagery (mirror/shell/pool) are taught early and paid off at closure. One minor filter-verb cluster in the cave-walk beat slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure the lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density is high in the cave sequence, and the prose integrates sensory detail with action cleanly. However, several adjacent lines loop conceptually—"promised to paint the place that did not yet exist, then make it real" / "hidden promise to myself" / "time for waiting was over" echo without added pressure—triggering a −0.4 paraphrase-loop penalty. A run of "I [verb]" stems in the middle third adds template cadence (−0.2). Figurative language is vivid but occasionally clusters densely without pattern payoff ("spiderweb fractures dividing yesterday from now" adjacent to "bottle thrown into an empty sea").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of cracked mirror, hidden promise, and cave-as-unfinished-place offers a coherent if not wholly unexpected frame; the painter-as-witness trope is elevated by the temporary-eternity motif and the seashell compass. Transformation is present—walking into the cave to fulfill a reflective vow—but the emotional arc and final discovery feel inevitable in a soft rather than sharp way. No derivative template penalty applied, yet the piece does not take bold structural or perspectival risks. Specificity in the cave imagery (stalagmites as frozen waves, pool as glass before breaking) distinguishes the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The painter is present throughout and makes the key choice to enter the cave, paint the scene, and leave. However, most narrative weight rests on observation and reflection rather than decisions that narrow options under pressure. The character drives the walk and painting act, shaping two beats (cave entry, painting) and the closure image, but agency reads more as witness than protagonist constrained by trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The painted seashell appears in three beats: boyhood memory, beside the cracked mirror (setup), and as compass beside the pool during painting (closure linkage). It charges the final image by anchoring the protagonist's hand and carries thematic weight (cobalt storms, temporary eternity). However, it is not handled or used in a way that alters tactics; its role is symbolic and reflective rather than causally active. Early signal and closure participation earn mid-6 range; lack of causal pressure caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Temporary eternity is signaled early ("the illusion that a moment could stretch without ever breaking"), dramatized in the cave (stalagmites "forever about to crash yet motionless"), and directly shapes the protagonist's recognition of the scene and the act of painting. The concept constrains the protagonist's understanding of what to paint and reweights the pool as "mirror unbroken." It appears in setup, middle reflection, and closure image, meeting all three gates with causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Intimately aloof is declared ("People called me intimately aloof, close enough to smell the turpentine on my hands yet distant as the horizon") and echoed once in the cave ("darkness pressed against me like wet cloth, intimate yet somehow still aloof"), but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait flavors the voice and theme but remains label-level; no choice or trade-off turns on this duality. Setup present, no middle or closure participation in choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Reveal operates as the thematic spine: the protagonist seeks to "reveal" the hidden place by painting it, and "every stroke I laid on the board felt like a reveal, stripping away stone to show the shape of longing beneath." The painting act at closure is framed as revelation. However, the action is more interpretive than a concrete plot turn; it could be reframed as "witness" or "capture" with minor edits. Present in setup (promise to paint) and closure (painting act), but middle development is reflective rather than tactically constrained by this verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wrong turn at the fishermen's fork is signaled on the page ("at the fork I took a wrong turn"), leads directly to the hidden cave oasis, and enables the entire closure sequence. The mechanism matters: without this specific navigational error, the protagonist does not find the pool or fulfill the promise. Appears in setup (walking the quay), drives the middle beat (cave entry), and supplies the setting for closure. Causal pressure, specificity, and closure linkage are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is introduced early (warned about as children), structures the entire second half, and supplies the pool, stalagmites, moon-shaft, and spatial constraint that define the painting scene. It pressures the protagonist's movement (narrowing path, guttering lantern, darkness) and provides the resources (clear pool, frozen waves) for the closure act. The setting is indispensable to the final image and the promise's fulfillment; removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the mirror cracked" anchors the story's opening and frames the decision to stop waiting, creating a before/after. However, time within the narrative is loose and untracked; the cave journey and painting unfold without temporal pressure or a live clock. The mirror crack sets the inciting mood but does not tighten later tactics. Setup gate met, middle and closure participation weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The hidden promise ("I had sworn to paint the one place in this town that did not yet exist, then make it real") is signaled early, dramatized in the protagonist's decision to walk the quay, and fulfilled on the page in the painting act. Desire shapes the protagonist's choices (entering the cave, setting up board and brushes, painting) and the final realization ("my promise had never been to paint a masterpiece, but simply to witness"). Friction is present between longing and the years of delay; cost is felt in the act of carrying the proof back. All three gates met with causal and thematic pressure.</comment>
