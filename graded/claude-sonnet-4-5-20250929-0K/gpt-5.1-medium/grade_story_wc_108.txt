<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior contradictions are embodied: phobia-ridden yet aiming to weaponize vulnerability, shaking hands against steady voice. The encounter with the boy creates a micro-choice—adding her own code to his cast—that shifts her stance toward agency. The final decision to walk into the production office "shaking" but armed with truth is motivated by the prior beats and forecloses passivity with visible cost. Minor slips: "firmly adaptive placeholder" feels like borrowed corporate language rather than lived experience, and the phobia catalog ("knives, crowds, deep water") reads slightly list-like without pressure differentiation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows a Causal-Situational Hybrid lens: the burned file and cast list force the library wait, the boy's arrival and cipher provide the method, and the final decision to confront the studio lands as Charged Poise—options crystallized, cost undeniable but not yet paid on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes the pattern on the cast and rewrites her own purpose. The cost is felt (walking in shaking, risking further erasure) but not fully dramatized in consequence, which keeps this in the 7s rather than higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted library under soundstage stars is specific and purposeful: metal ribs, plastic-sealed books, the whispering seashell half-wired to a speaker all anchor the stunt-double world and constrain the scene to a waiting space. The cast with smudged ink becomes micro-setting—a physical object that the protagonist must lean close to decrypt, and its rain-mottled plaster and cryptic loops charge the final realization. Spatial choreography (table between them, leaning closer, writing between codes) is clean and the setting evolves with the protagonist's internal shift from erased to author.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early: proving identity and worth after erasure. The pressure tightens when the protagonist finds the cast list with her face beside another name, then deepens when the boy's cipher offers a method to rewrite the script. The final choice to walk into the production office shaking forecloses passivity with visible cost (risking further professional erasure), but the escalation remains more conceptual than tactical—no live trade-off or loss alters moves mid-scene. Agency is clear but the consequence is Charged Poise rather than a decisive on-page reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the boy's cipher (FALL/LEARN, FIRE/WARM, ALONE/LISTEN) transforms vulnerability into method without stating a moral. The protagonist's addition—"TRUST HURTS, TRUST HEALS"—feels earned by the betrayal and the shared decryption ritual. The final image of holding out the "burned, bruised resume like a protest sign" and claiming "the audience felt my falls because I was terrified" reweights the premise non-literally, proving vulnerability as power through specific action rather than assertion. No thematic echo or sermon mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, distance controlled. Voice carries distinct texture: "kinked around fear like a wire around a magnet," "organs in jars," "smudged into cryptic loops." The dialogue is sparse but purposeful ("What happened to your name"; "They decided I was better invisible") and advances the plot without exposition. Perceptual signature is consistent—the protagonist notices scaffold, seams, codes—and modulates under pressure (steady voice, shaking hands). Minor slip: "firmly adaptive placeholder" in the cast list reads like corporate boilerplate infiltrating the narrator's lexicon without ironic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, and most sentences do multiple jobs. Some scaffold phrases recur: "the way a [X] is [Y]" appears three times ("the way kids stare at roadkill," "the way a stunt mark on the floor is familiar," "the way a fight choreographer's map lets terror become timing"), creating mild template cadence. A few near-paraprase loops: the protagonist's fear list is told ("knives, crowds, deep water"), then immediately summarized again ("every phobia in me by first name"), and the seashell's hiss is described twice in adjacent paragraphs without new detail. No major muddle in peak beats, and the final paragraph propels cleanly, but the loops prevent entry to higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—phobia-ridden stunt double erased by the studio, finding agency through a child's injury cipher—offers a fresh synthesis of marginalization, Hollywood machinery, and physical vulnerability. The boy's cast as both literal artifact and metaphorical key to rewriting the self is non-obvious. The inflection point (decrypting fear/answer pairs) grows organically from prior particulars rather than arriving as a late rule change. The risk is coherent: the protagonist commits to visibility despite systemic erasure. Minor derivative echo: the broader "manufactured star vs. real human" premise has template DNA, but the specificity of the cipher method and trembling certainty as power lifts it above the median.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The phobia-ridden stunt double is foregrounded in paragraph two, drives the inciting problem (burned file, cast list betrayal), and her phobias are named and embodied throughout. Her decision to add her own code to the boy's cast and then to walk into the production office shaking create two key turns. The closure choice—claiming "the audience felt my falls because I was terrified"—is irreducible to this character. Strong causal work and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The whispering seashell appears in paragraph five, returns in paragraph twenty-eight when it "half crackled above us, finally catching a signal," and frames the library space. It supplies atmosphere and a sense of incomplete sentence/identity, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The protagonist and boy work beneath it, but removing the seashell would not break story logic. Present in two beats but ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal is the inciting event (burned file, identity erasure) and shapes every beat: the protagonist's anger, the boy's arrival as counterpoint, the cipher as method, and the final choice to weaponize vulnerability. The betrayal transforms from erasure into proof of authenticity ("the audience felt my falls because I was terrified"). Removing this concept collapses the stakes and closure. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" appears once in the cast list as corporate label ("firmly adaptive placeholder") but is not dramatized in on-page action. The protagonist adapts by decrypting the boy's cipher and rewriting her purpose, but the specific phrase does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic with visible cost. Functional presence but swappable with "resilient" or "flexible" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Outwit" is signaled in paragraph twenty-three ("I might outwit the script that had been written for me") and recurs in paragraph thirty-two ("by decrypting every smudge they tried to paint over me, I would outwit their control"). The action frames the middle turn (deciphering the cipher) and the final stance (stepping into the frame as writer of her own danger). The cipher work embodies the outwitting method. Drives two beats and contributes to closure; not easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged notes on the child's cast is introduced in paragraph twenty-two, occupies three sustained beats (tracing letters, matching symbols, recognizing the pattern), and supplies the exact method by which the protagonist rewrites her purpose. The mechanics matter: FALL/LEARN pairs become the template for her own addition (TRUST HURTS, TRUST HEALS) and her final confrontation strategy. Removing this method breaks the causal chain to closure. Essential integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is established in paragraph three and frames the entire scene. The space is a "quiet holding cell" that enables the encounter with the boy, the table where the cast list and cast rest, and the soundstage ceiling that houses the fake seashell. The setting constrains movement (sitting, leaning closer, bending over the cast) and supplies the sensory charge (rusted ribs, sealed books, whispering shell). The closure gesture—holding out the resume like a protest sign—will occur elsewhere, but the library enables the pivot. Drives setup and middle beats; micro-setting (the table, the cast) charges the turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering you're not who you thought" is signaled in the opening line and sustained throughout: "the time after discovering you are not who you thought, when everything feels borrowed, even your breath." The discovery tightens all decisions—waiting for new records, reading the cast list, decrypting the cipher, planning the confrontation. Time does not tick as a live clock, but the psychological window of identity crisis shapes every tactic. Present across all beats and essential to stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation to prove vulnerability is power is stated in paragraph thirteen ("the urge to prove that vulnerability is power, not a liability") and dramatized through the cipher work, the protagonist's addition to the cast ("TRUST HURTS, TRUST HEALS"), and the final choice to walk in shaking and claim "the audience felt my falls because I was terrified." The friction between the want (to be seen) and the cost (risking further erasure while admitting fear) creates authentic tension. Drives the arc and closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Trembling certainty is embodied from paragraph seven onward: "shaking quiet," "my voice steady in a way my hands could not match," "trembling certainty on screen." The tone modulates with pressure—shaking becomes steadiness, vulnerability becomes weapon—and charges the final image (walking in shaking, holding the burned resume). Coherent through turns and essential to the thematic closure. The phrase itself does not appear until late, but the pairing of trembling and certainty runs throughout.</comment>
