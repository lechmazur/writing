<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is richly embodied through sensory perception ("felt moods in the air, tasted fear in the soil") and her micro-choices are legible—sheathing her talent, repurposing the engraver, choosing pruning over violence. The contradictory impulses (her father's training vs. her pacifism) are dramatized through action rather than summary. However, the final passage offers more atmosphere than a decisive choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; the closure reads as resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) but the agency in that moment is diffuse rather than sharply embodied in a single beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive early (Mara, dome, post-tower). The story accumulates pressure through the progression of visitors (hunters, then raiders) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the raiders hesitate and surrender, enacting the "engraved quiet" that has accumulated across the piece. Cost is legible in the grief they feel and Mara's sustained, isolating stance. However, the closure beat itself ("letting the engraved quiet breathe through her") is more lyric echo than a single decisive image that reweights prior material with sharp on-page cost, landing it solidly in the 7-range rather than higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glass dome, cracked from the shockwave, constrains the farm's neutral-ground status and charges the atmosphere throughout. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: the roses' colors and scents are tied to the engraved values, and the sandbag scrap anchors both past and present. Spatial choreography (terraces of roses, threshold, rows) is coherent. The dome's fractured starlight recurs at the closure and the environment subtly guides choice (raiders "hesitating at the door"). The setting functions as micro-setting and participates in the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—weaving continuity through chaos via the rose farm—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure escalates through two on-page visits (hunters, then raiders) that test Mara's vision, and the raiders' hesitation and surrender constitute a meaningful tightening. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; no sharp reversal narrows Mara's options or forces a visible trade-off on the page. The cost (Mara's isolation, the sustained effort) is felt but not crystallized in a single high-stakes choice at closure, keeping the score in the strong 7-range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the rose-tending practice and the contrast between Jorek's violence and Mara's sheathing. "To sheathe...was not only to slide steel into leather but to bury a possibility and let it compost into something gentler" is a fresh, non-literal articulation that reweights the inheritance motif. The closing image (raiders surrendering blades, engraved quiet breathing) offers a resonant answer to the central question of how values persist after collapse. The piece resists moralizing and invites reflection without confusion. Minor: the line "inculcating plants with values the way you inculcated me with caution" edges toward direct statement, though it remains character-voiced and grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara's sensory attunement ("felt moods...tasted fear") and metaphor register ("senselessly perceptive calm") remain consistent. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with phrases like "the tranquil blaze of her gaze" and "grief they could not name" creating texture. Free indirect style is clean. The hunters' brief dialogue is functional but underdeveloped; Mara's speech to the veteran is more expository than subtext-laden. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose rhythm supports pressure without artifact, though a few near-duplicates ("one scarred veteran") slightly reduce density.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. No loops or scaffolding mar the text. Figurative language is vivid and controlled ("roses that never stopped drinking light," "debt she carried...as if it weighed as much as an airship") without overwriting. However, several beats edge toward summary where scene would sharpen: "Some laughed...others listened despite themselves" tells rather than shows the hunters' reactions, and "struck by a grief they could not name" abstracts the raiders' experience. These summary moments prevent entry into the 8+ band, where immediate scene pressure would dominate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The premise—a bounty hunter's pacifist daughter tending memory-encoded roses after societal collapse—synthesizes familiar post-apocalyptic and inheritance tropes into a fresh, specific angle. The metaphor of "engraved quiet" and the practice of inscribing values into plant stems are non-obvious and purposeful. The transformation of her father's tools (ballast sandbag, engraver) into gardening instruments is organic and resonant. The piece commits fully to its vision without hedging or retreat. Risk is moderate: the story stays within lyric-literary conventions and the closure is more atmospheric than structurally bold, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's identity as the bounty hunter's pacifist daughter frames the entire story from the opening and drives her choice to sheathe her talent and repurpose her inheritance. Her pacifism creates the farm's neutral-ground status and shapes her interactions with hunters and raiders. The final image—letting "engraved quiet breathe through her"—is a stance crystallization rooted in this character attribute. Setup, development (greeting hunters, facing raiders), and payoff are all present with visible cost (isolation, sustained effort, rejection of her father's path).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sandbag scrap appears in one extended beat: Mara carries it at her belt, and the text contrasts its former use (dropping onto fleeing warrants) with its current use (weighing seed packets). It smells of "rust and faraway storms," charging it with sensory memory. However, it does not return at closure or constrain a second on-page choice. The lyric reprise is strong (past violence vs. present cultivation) and reweights the inheritance theme, but the single-beat presence limits the score to mid-6s under the two-of-three gate model.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" is signaled early, enacted across multiple beats (inscribing stems, hunters brushing petals, raiders hesitating), and articulated in the closure ("letting the engraved quiet breathe through her"). The concept shapes Mara's tactics (writing patience, mercy, continuity into the plants) and creates the farm's effect on visitors. The mechanics—etching words into stems so seasons repeat them in color and scent—are specific and causally active. The closure image directly invokes the concept with undeniable pressure, meeting the indispensable threshold.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is introduced early ("felt moods...tasted fear...read intentions in the angle of a thorn") and enables Mara's choice to sheathe the talent after witnessing a killing. It shapes her rose-tending practice (listening to plants, reading leaf tilt) and is present in the closure beat (the "tranquil blaze of her gaze" and her perceptive calm). However, the trait does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost in the final third—it functions more as ongoing capability than as a trade-off that forecloses a path. Two gates solid, third partial.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Sheathe" recurs as both literal action (her father's blades, raiders surrendering theirs) and conceptual anchor: "to sheathe...was not only to slide steel into leather but to bury a possibility and let it compost into something gentler." This metaphor drives the story's central turn (Mara's rejection of violence, the farm's effect on visitors) and recharges in the closure when raiders "surrendered their blades in exchange for work, their violence quietly sheathed among the roots." The action is irreplaceable and causally active across all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Inculcating plants with values is signaled early (inscribing words into stems, teaching patience/mercy/continuity) and the mechanics matter: the engraver, the nightly practice, the hope that cuttings keep memory. The method shapes Mara's tactics (choosing which roses receive which values, walking hunters through the rows) and is dramatized rather than summarized. The closure beat—raiders hesitating and surrendering—enacts the method's success. However, the final image does not foreground the inscribing itself; it resonates thematically rather than showing the method in direct use, capping the score in the solid 8-range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is introduced immediately and pressures every choice: the dome's cracks from the tower's fall, the "neutral ground" status, the terraces of roses that visitors brush against, the threshold where raiders hesitate. The setting supplies the resources (roses, soil, dome's fractured starlight) and constraints (post-collapse city, lack of allies) that shape Mara's tactics. The dome reappears in the closure ("Under the cracked dome, Mara walked...") and charges the final image with continuity and resilience. All three gates are met with high causal integration and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the tower fell" anchors the timeframe in the opening line, and "the eighth dawn" signals progression. The post-collapse context (shattered order, vicious little kingdoms) tightens Mara's decision to create neutral ground. However, the time does not constrain tactics beat-to-beat—there is no live clock or urgency that alters moves. The timeframe functions as backdrop rather than active pressure. Setup and thematic development are present, but the time does not participate causally in the closure, placing it in the mid-5s under the gate model.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to weave continuity through chaos" is stated explicitly mid-story and dramatized through her rose-tending practice and interactions with hunters and raiders. The motivation is conflicted: she inherits enemies and debts but chooses cultivation over violence, creating friction between survival and vision. The closure—raiders surrendering and the engraved quiet persisting—enacts the motivation's fulfillment with visible cost (her isolation, sustained effort). However, the motivation is more told than shown in high-stakes choice; it guides action but does not force a decisive trade-off at the ending beat, capping the score in the high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is embodied in Mara's gaze and demeanor from the first encounter with hunters ("the slow, tranquil blaze of her gaze, which neither challenged nor submitted"). The tone holds through pressure—quiet intensity pervades the rose-tending, the engraving practice, and the closure walk. The tone modulates subtly (calm description → raiders' unnamed grief) without breaking coherence. However, the tone does not sharply escalate or charge the final image with new intensity; it remains consistent rather than transforming under peak pressure, placing it in the solid 7-range rather than higher.</comment>
