<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-specific ("functionally creative," engineering lens on emotion as "flows"), but her agency operates mostly through observation and metaphorical mapping rather than pressured choice. The sextant discovery and pipe rerouting feel more like enacted thought experiments than decisions with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (hope as engineering problem vs. grief as hydraulics) but never forces a trade-off on the page. No second character appears to test relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraphs. The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through interwoven carnival/spaceport systems, metaphor clusters (flow, navigation, intention), and the midnight-to-dawn span. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's nod and hand-drawn signs crystallize her stance—redirecting hope through systems no one may see—with the conceptual cost implicit in "no one might ever see them, but the building would." One meaningful tightening occurs when she links graywater lines to planters. Cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spaceport's sensory detail is vivid and selective: "ribs and bones," cracked skylights, dust films, candy wrappers. Spatial choreography is coherent (concourse, checkpoint, maintenance closet, atrium). The sextant's arc "matching almost perfectly the arc of a proposed distribution main" charges the final moment and constrains her choice to honor existing infrastructure. Micro-setting (pipes, planters, manual) alters tactics. Strong integration of body, tool, and recurring object.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resurrecting the terminal through redirected purpose—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: linking restroom drains to planters narrows her options to quiet, unseen care. Escalation is consistent with the Accumulative lens but passive; Mira's decisions are enacted without opposition or a moment when she risks abandoning the project. The cost is conceptual (invisible labor, no audience) but legible. No antagonist required, yet the lack of a live friction point keeps pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—hope as redirected flow, navigation through loss—emerges through image and action rather than statement. The sextant/plumbing diagram braiding and the final image of hand-drawn signs for a building that "would absorb her stoic wonder" offer a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (clipping the sextant, touching it at dawn) and metaphor (carnival as temporary equations, spaceport as frozen intention). The closing line "simply nodded" resists tidy resolution and reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: engineering idiom ("flow rate," "junctions," "gradients") filters every observation. Diction remains controlled, but elevated register ("stoic wonder," "spectral departure hall," "unconcerned with what came next") occasionally drifts from a civil engineer intern's plausible lexicon under nocturnal solitude. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early and legible. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines do double duty (e.g., "Carnivals... were masters of temporary systems that pretended to be permanent" advances theme and situates her observation skill). Template cadence appears in a mid-section run: "She could not summon... but she could redirect... In the maintenance closet she found... The manual's pages crackled... Mira laid the sextant..." (five consecutive "She/The/Mira" stems). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching a payoff for every metaphor (intentions as stress, flows as belief, navigation as lostness). Clarity holds but momentum sags in the expository middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of carnival graywater systems, abandoned spaceport, and navigational relic is specific and non-obvious. The emotional calculus—hope engineered through invisible care for a building no one uses—feels fresh. Transformation test passes: the arc depends on these exact particulars. Risk-taking is moderate: lyric compression and extended metaphor heighten the premise without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its stoic, nocturnal register and avoids the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's curiosity seeds the opening, her engineering lens filters all perception, and her final nod closes the piece. She makes two on-page choices: clipping the sextant and rerouting the pipes. Both choices advance the dominant stake (resurrection through flow), but neither encounters friction or visible cost beyond conceptual solitude. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle development is observational rather than decisional, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sextant appears in three beats: discovery at the checkpoint, laying it on the schematic (where its arc matches the distribution main), and the final touch. Its arc constrains her choice to honor existing infrastructure rather than impose new design. The object's properties (fractured, hinge sure, navigational purpose) matter and return with reweighted meaning (navigation = admitting lostness). Setup, development, and closure participation are met, but causal pressure is moderate—it guides rather than narrows options under stress.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions frozen mid-thought" is explicitly stated and shapes her reading of the terminal's unrealized plans as "stress in the joints." The concept informs her diagnostic lens (reading structures as half-finished sentences) and her solution (redirecting purpose). It appears in setup and thematic reflection but does not alter a tactical choice on the page. Lyric reprise in the closure image (intentions absorbed into gradients) reweights the stake, qualifying for mid-band under accumulative logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is labeled by professors and demonstrated through her unconventional hydraulic mapping, but it does not constrain a choice with visible cost. The trait enables her solution (linking carnival methods to terminal plumbing) but no moment dramatizes a tradeoff where the attribute itself forecloses an option. Setup and development are present; closure linkage is weak. Swappable with "resourceful" or "inventive" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is the dominant verb of the piece, framed early ("resurrect systems through redirected flows") and enacted through pipe rerouting. The action drives two beats: her diagnostic mapping and the midnight construction. It defines the central stake and shapes the closure image (signs for future drips, the building absorbing her care). Causal pressure is strong; cost is conceptual but undeniable. Irreplaceability is high—removing "resurrect" would collapse the thematic spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" is signaled early (Hydraulics 201, carnival graywater rigs) and enacted through her pipe work: "rerouted the least corroded lines, linking restroom drains to planters." The method's mechanics matter—she traces junctions, sketches maps, uses the graywater manual. Setup, development, and closure participation are met. Causal pressure is moderate; the method enables her solution but does not face friction or require adaptation under stress.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The terminal anchors every beat: concourse, checkpoint, maintenance closet, atrium. Its infrastructure (dead pipes, planters, graywater system) supplies the resources and constraints for her solution. Spatial detail is concrete and purposeful. The setting's dual identity—frozen intention vs. salvageable flows—pressures her choice to work invisibly. The building's capacity to "absorb her stoic wonder" charges the final image. Essential across beats and ending; removing the terminal would collapse both stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves" bookends the piece (opening line, carnival trucks rattle out; her work spans "by midnight" to "when dawn outlined the cracked skylights"). The timeframe creates solitude and a natural work window but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. Setup and closure participation are met; middle development is ambient rather than pressuring. The carnival's departure enables her access but does not alter tactics under time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated early and drives her diagnostic mapping. The motivation is dramatized through her pipe work and the closing touch of the sextant, but no moment tests conflicting desires or forces her to weigh hope against another value. Friction is conceptual (invisible labor, no audience) rather than enacted through choice. Setup, development, and closure participation are met; causal pressure is moderate, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" coheres throughout: restrained awe at systems ("every beam... hinted at systems waiting to be read"), quiet conviction in her midnight labor, and the final nod without fanfare. Tone modulates appropriately—curiosity in discovery beats, resolve during construction, acceptance at dawn—and charges the closure image (the building absorbing her care). Diction sustains the register without lapsing into sentimentality or excess. The tone is indispensable to the piece's emotional effect.</comment>
