<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's interior life is richly embodied—her signing practice in pockets, her lip-reading fatigue, her mother's camera as weighted inheritance. The whispering advisor remains thinly sketched (label-only "quietly charismatic," no on-page choices that reveal contradiction or cost), capping the score. Her final laugh harmonizing with silence demonstrates earned shift from isolation to coherent expression, though the advisor's passivity keeps this from 8+.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly (harbor, Lena, camera, moonlight) within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through signing the spaces between words, thickening silence into fabric, until the final laugh harmonizes—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where pressure crystallizes into felt music. Cost is legible in the trembling hands and "ragged sound," though the advisor's role as facilitator rather than obstacle keeps escalation modest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The harbor setting is vivid and purposeful: moonlight pouring through the empty camera back, the breakwater stones as staging ground, rigging clinks and fish jumps as answering sounds. The camera functions as micro-setting, constraining the ritual and charging the closure image when it "clicks like a chord resolving." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the setting enables the final transformation rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and tightens through signing memory's shapes until the harbor answers. The escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens: pauses thicken to fabric, then resolve into melody. However, the advisor provides the method without opposition; Lena's agency is more demonstration than choice under pressure, and no live option is foreclosed with sharp cost, keeping this below 8.2.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: sign language as permanence versus scattered speech, silence as material to weave, the camera's empty frame as instrument. The final image—laugh harmonizing with harbor—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: sorrow and joy cohere when mapped and heard. The piece resists the explain-everything ending; the "long-hidden score" unfolds without thematic summary, and the conceptual repricing (silence as music) lands with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lena's perceptual signature is distinct and controlled: "sign language, invisible sentences traced against palms," "signed words sank into people and stayed, like stones in water." The advisor's whispered dialogue carries subtext ("disrupt its echo" instead of "break"), though his consistent murmur risks convergence. One minor slip: "boat**s** dozed" then "their masts" creates brief pronoun fuzz, and the advisor's echo of her sign movements ("older, slower dialect") is told rather than shown in distinct gesture vocabulary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and most lines multi-task (e.g., "breathing steam into the luminous harbor" anchors POV, setting, and interiority). However, several figurative constructions strain: "bowl of spilled stars," "underlining forgotten prayers," "music inside the quiet" cluster in the opening without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting (−0.4). "Whispering advisor arrived without footsteps, only the faint shift of air" is elegant compression, but the density of metaphor in early beats slightly dulls momentum before the signing sequence clarifies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of sign language, silence-mapping, and a filmless camera as musical instrument is specific and non-obvious. The advisor as facilitator rather than antagonist is a fresh structural choice that risks passivity but serves the Accumulative design. The piece avoids the therapy-speak trap in peak beats and commits fully to its premise—silence thickened to fabric, gestures as shadows to catch—without hedging. The final harmonization feels inevitable in hindsight, lifting the score despite the quiet stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The whispering advisor appears early, offers the "disrupt its echo" framing, opens the camera back, tilts it during her signing, and delivers the "Listen" cue at closure. He enables two beats (camera opening, final listening) and his "mapping silence" instruction shapes her method. However, his choices are purely facilitative—no opposition, no cost tied to his presence—making him replaceable with an internal realization. Present across setup/development/payoff but without causal pressure or specificity that would break the story if removed.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vintage camera appears in beat one on the stones, is opened by the advisor (moon pouring through the empty frame), tilts to catch her gesture-shadows, and closes "with a soft click that sounded improbably like a chord resolving" at closure. Three distinct beats, charged reprise, and the empty frame becomes the instrument for capturing absent light. Strong integration, though the camera's mechanics (how tilting it "catches shadows") remain abstract, preventing full indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Sign language shapes Lena's interior life from the start (practicing in pockets, "signed words sank into people and stayed"), drives the central beat (signing spaces between words, not words themselves), and the advisor echoes her movements in "older, slower dialect." The concept alters her perception of silence and enables the final mapping that produces melody. Cost is visible in her trembling hands and the specificity of what she signs (mother humming, father slamming door, lonely birthdays). Removing sign language would collapse the story's logic and thematic core.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" is mentioned once in description ("the kind of quietly charismatic face you trusted without knowing why") but never demonstrated through action or trade-off. No on-page moment where his charisma enables or constrains a choice, nor any cost tied to trusting him. Label-only, ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Disrupt" appears in the advisor's key line ("not to capture light, but to disturb its echo") and Lena internalizes the distinction ("not break, not shatter, but disrupt, like a new rhythm"). It frames the method and recurs conceptually when silence thickens and she weaves it. Two beats (framing + enactment) and lyric reprise at closure when the laugh "harmonized." However, swapping "disrupt" for "reshape" or "rewire" would not break the story's mechanics, only its diction. Functional across setup/development/payoff but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is introduced by the advisor early ("By mapping silence…every harbor keeps a chart of sounds that never happened"), shapes Lena's signing method (she traces spaces between words, not the words), and the closure delivers on it ("felt melodies rise from the mapped silence"). The method is signaled, its mechanics demonstrated on the page (hands as cartography, silence as fabric), and the payoff lands with cost (trembling hands, ragged laugh). Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. The abstract nature of "mapping" keeps it short of full irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight provides the empty frame for the camera (moon pouring through), supplies answering sounds (rigging clink, fish jump), and charges the final image (harbor waiting for her laugh's note). The breakwater stones position her at the threshold where water meets stone, a spatial choice that matters. Setting enables the ritual and participates in closure, though the moonlight itself could swap for dawn or twilight without breaking logic. Two gates strong, closure linkage present but replaceable with effort.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"When no one remembers you" frames the opening ("the kind of hour that arrives when no one remembers you") and recurs when she signs "this moment…when no one remembered she existed." The timeframe shapes her isolation and permission to attempt the ritual without witness. However, it does not tighten tactics or create a ticking pressure; the scene could occur at any lonely hour. Setup and thematic reprise present, but no causal constraint on choices. Lyric resonance without escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desire to translate silence into music is stated early ("she wanted something harder: to translate silence into music") and drives every beat: bringing the camera, signing spaces rather than words, the advisor's mapping instruction, and the closure when melodies rise "coherent and whole." The motivation is dramatized through embodied action (trembling fingers, ragged laugh) and costs (lonely birthdays signed, pressure in her chest). Friction between want (to hear) and method (exposing pain) is visible. Strong causal role and closure charge, though the want could be rephrased as "give silence form" without breaking the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Joyful sorrow is enacted from the start: harbor "glowed like a bowl of spilled stars" (beauty) juxtaposed with "boats dozed…like underlining forgotten prayers" (loss). The tone deepens when she signs painful memories, then peaks in "The sorrow in them was real, but so was the joy of hearing it at last" and the final "ragged" laugh that "harmonized." The oxymoron is not declared but embodied in simultaneous trembling and laughter, charged fully at closure. Modulates with pressure, charges the final image, and the piece would lose coherence without this exact tonal fusion.</comment>
