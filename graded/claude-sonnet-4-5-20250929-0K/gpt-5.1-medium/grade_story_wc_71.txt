<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's interior is concrete and contradictory: he notices creeping normality yet creates his own rituals, revealing a character driven by competing impulses. The orris-root gesture and bed repositioning show agency under pressure, embodied through spatial choices. The final realization that the house examines him lands with visible cost—his observational authority inverted. Minor: the grandmother's explanation feels slightly expository, but the trait shapes every on-page choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): Eli's question "if his own life was a creeping normality the house had noticed" inverts observer/observed with felt cost, reweighting the premise. The accumulative lens—pressure built through cataloging, ritual creation, orris-root placement—coheres and tightens when the corner "stiffens" and he answers by moving the bed. Orientation anchors (bay house, spring, rental) arrive early. One meaningful deepening (dropping the shard, repositioning the bed) narrows options and charges the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The corner that "never took sunlight" constrains Eli's final choice: lodging the orris root there and moving the bed toward darkness is a spatial decision with cost. Rust-stain coastline, warped sunlight pooling, tidal breathing, and the gap by the bedroom corner function as micro-setting that charges both tactics and closure. Sensory hierarchy (faint violet, metallic air, old rain in flour sacks) filters through Eli's observational bias. The bay itself pressures less directly but the house's particulars—floorboards sighing, doorways narrowing—anchor every beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and tightens when the dropped orris root forces a choice: retrieve or leave it, then move the bed into the "dense" corner. The accumulative pressure (cataloging patterns, sanctifying rituals, house breathing syncing) crescendos at the storm/drop beat, and Eli's response (shifting his weight into the house's sentence) narrows options with visible cost: he now sleeps inches from the altered corner, vulnerable to examination. One meaningful deepening with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: houses speak through displaced objects; observer and observed are reciprocal. The final image—"every scuff on the baseboard was the structure trying, inadvertently profound, to say I am still here"—offers a non-literal answer that reweights Eli's cataloging without stating a moral. The orris root's shift from remembering scent to "sliver of hush" and the phrase "inadvertently profound" recur with new pressure at closure. Subtext operates in gesture (touching doorframe twice, rotating clock) and the house's response (lights brightening, draft withdrawing). No thematic echo or prompt language in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is specific and stable: Eli notices "displaced objects," marks where paint thins into fingerprints, and treats the orris root as "a shard of hush, cool and faintly violet, soaking up noise." Diction ("creeping normality noticer," "hazed sodium halo," "hushed blaze") stays character-particular and voice-motivated. No dialogue present. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure (storm, dropped shard). Minor: "inadvertently profound diagrams that looked like constellations of furniture" reads slightly meta, but the phrase recurs purposefully at closure and fits the narrator's idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and pressure. Rhythm varies (short declaratives under tension, longer accumulative clauses during cataloging). Figurative language—"streetlights daydream," "moths wrote urgent letters," "pushing curtains across the sky"—is consistent and voice-motivated, but clusters heavily in the night-observation beats without full payoff at closure. One paraphrase loop: "seemed to breathe" / "house's breathing" / "synced with his own." No pronoun drift or scaffold. Opening and closing images anchor and recharge. Propulsion is clear; no opacity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—observer as observed, house as active noticer—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight, earned by orris root mechanics and spatial repositioning. Eli's role ("creeping normality noticer") and the method ("through displaced objects") transform a familiar haunted-house frame into a study of reciprocal attention with visible cost. Risk-taking in tone ("hushed blaze," "inadvertently profound") heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The premise avoids template arcs; the final inversion is non-obvious and grows from prior particulars. Minor: the "streetlights daydream" device is elegant but slightly ornamental in early use.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eli's identity as "creeping normality noticer" is signaled immediately, drives his cataloging and ritual creation (touching doorframe, rotating clock), and shapes the key turn: moving the bed toward the corner after dropping the orris root. The final realization—that the house has noticed him—inverts his observer role with cost. Present in setup, middle choices, and closure participation; causal pressure is high; irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The orris root shard appears in beat one (pocket, threshold test), beat two (cataloging, implicit presence), beat three (dropped during storm, lodges in corner), and charges the final night (dreams, scent anchor). Its shift from "remembering scent" to "shard of hush" to listening device reweights meaning at closure. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, and specificity (violet, cool, noise-soaking) all present. High causal pressure and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" is introduced early via the orris root metaphor and shapes Eli's perception (soaking up noise instead of fragrance). It recurs implicitly in his quiet observation and explicitly when he lodges the root "like a listening device." The phrase reweights at closure (house trying to say "I am still here"), but its mechanics are more thematic than tactical. Two-of-three gates (setup, closure reprise); lyric resonance present but middle development is diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" is introduced early (diagrams that looked like constellations) and recurs at closure ("inadvertently profound, to say I am still here"), reweighting Eli's cataloging as the house's own speech. The trait constrains his self-awareness—he doesn't intend profundity, yet his observations carry weight—and pays off when he recognizes the reciprocal condition. Setup and closure present; middle beat weaker. Lyric reprise with thematic cost; swappability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Sanctify" is introduced mid-story (touching doorframe twice, rotating clock) and drives Eli's experimental stance: these are "not superstitions, but experiments, tiny offerings." The action enables the house's response (lights brightening, draft withdrawing) and primes his final choice to answer by moving the bed. Setup arrives at ~30%; development and closure participation clear. Causal pressure moderate; specificity high; not easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Through displaced objects" is signaled early ("houses speak through displaced objects: a skewed rug, a leaning picture frame") and drives every beat: cataloging, marking where paint thins, noting the rust-stain coastline, moving the bed toward the corner. The method shapes tactics (Eli reads the house's grammar) and closure (he answers by shifting his own weight into its sentences). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, high causal pressure, and irreplaceability all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring anchors orientation immediately and supplies micro-setting (tidal breathing, gulls tracing sigils, storm rolling down the bay) that pressures Eli's choices. The bay's exhale syncs with the house's breath, and the storm triggers the orris-root drop—a key turn. Coastline rust-stain and porch steps provide spatial grounding. Setup, development (storm beat), and closure atmosphere participation all clear. Causal pressure moderate; the bay shapes mood more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" is introduced early (blue minute, hum uncertainly between duty and sleep) and recurs at night observation beats (glowing absentmindedly, moths writing letters). The phrase charges atmosphere and marks ritual time but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Setup and closure mood participation present; middle development weak. Lyric resonance without causal pressure; swappable with "twilight" or "dusk" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desire "to understand why some houses feel alive" is stated early and drives every choice: renting the house, cataloging patterns, creating rituals, moving the bed toward the corner. Conflict emerges when the house examines him in return, inverting observer/observed with cost (vulnerability, loss of epistemic authority). Setup, development (cataloging, rituals, bed move), and closure participation all clear. High causal pressure and cost connection; irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is present throughout: "hushed blaze of observation: no drama, only an intensity so quiet it left the air scorched." Tone modulates with pressure (calm cataloging, storm tension, night stillness) and charges the final image (dreams in rooms, house memorizing his breath). Coherent across turns; the oxymoron integrates quiet observation with burning attention. Setup, development, and closure tone participation all clear; high specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>
