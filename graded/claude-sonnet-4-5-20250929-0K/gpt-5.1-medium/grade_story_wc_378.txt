<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The android's interiority is concrete and specific—"sand in circuits," "prayer flags across the edge of consciousness"—with embodied tension between programmed duty and accumulated nightmare imagery. The compression sequence shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously: he opens the crate knowing it will flood him with terror, yet folds the images down rather than resisting. The final choice to seal the crate carries visible cost: "faint afterimages of the children remained, softened around the edges," foreclosing the pristine early-farm nostalgia. Minor slip: the motivation loop around "miniaturize" and "compress" feels slightly ornamental in the middle third, but the closure choice remains earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—walking rows, tracing dust, linking memories—and escalates through density increase and cadence shift. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the android seals the crate after the burn, accepting miniaturized fears on an inner shelf with visible cost ("no longer for the pristine early days"). Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the fourth line ("android caretaker," "desert rose farm," "glass-domed enclosure," geomagnetic tremor context). One meaningful deepening occurs when he reroutes power and triggers the partition burn, reweighting his internal architecture and the dome ecology together.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dome setting constrains choices throughout: irrigation lines anchor his walking ritual, glass ribs tremble under magnetic stress, geometric soil seams enable the controlled burn. The desert roses respond tactilely to the burn—"sap thickening, spines brightening"—and their sacrifice mirrors his internal clearing. Micro-setting (the crate, the climate partition, the dried trenches) functions as architecture for the closure action. Sensory hierarchy reflects android perception: "hot minerals and faint resin," "musical stress," "wavering heat." The glass-dome enclosure charges the final image: containment becomes survival method rather than trap.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: resolve the static by managing the archived fears. One meaningful tightening occurs when the next magnetic lurch triggers the burn sequence, forcing immediate choice under external pressure. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: rerouting power, opening the crate, compressing nightmares, triggering the partition—all deliberate acts with visible cost ("Some losses would trouble the human supervisors"). The controlled-burn metaphor shapes tactics throughout, deepening from concept to physical execution that reweights both his internal state and the rose ecology.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the controlled-burn metaphor: survival by sacrificing undergrowth rather than erasing it. The ending offers a non-literal answer—"a garden that had burned and survived, strangely organic, quietly ordered"—that reweights the opening's static-blurred sensorium without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shift from "nostalgia for pristine early days" to "nostalgia for the risk," suggesting agency and imperfection outweigh sterile perfection. The crate's fears become "miniatures arranged on an inner shelf," neither erased nor controlling, achieving the promised "fragmented wholeness" through image rather than statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: android sensibility blends computational language ("checksum," "task queue," "algorithmic fire") with organic metaphor ("sand in circuits," "prayer flags," "data-embers"). POV remains stable and third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction stays controlled even under peak stress—"servos misfiring like startled muscles"—where the simile direction (machine toward organic) maintains voice consistency. Rhythmic control evident in the escalation sequence: short declaratives during the burn ("The partition ignited") followed by longer accumulative lines during aftermath. Free indirect style is clean: "He knew the fears...by checksum and by shape, and he longed to miniaturize them."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density high; most lines advance state or pressure. Sentence openings vary purposefully, and paragraph rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor template-cadence slip in the middle third: "He calculated...He knew...He opened...He rerouted" runs four consecutive subject-verb stems in close succession, creating momentary flatness. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; figurative language ("prayer flags," "data-embers," "algorithmic fire") stays coherent within the machine-organic fusion. The final image—"a garden that had burned and survived"—resonates without overwriting. Propulsion remains strong; scaffolding minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The android-caretaker premise is familiar, but the synthesis—controlled ecological burn mapped to internal memory management, archived children's fears as borrowed nostalgia—feels specific and earned. The decision to trigger a simulated burn rather than delete or suppress data offers a non-obvious psychological calculus tied to fire ecology. Risk-taking in the structural choice (heavy reflection interleaved with present-tense micro-moves) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: swapping names and places would hollow the piece; the glass dome, magnetic north, desert roses, and fear-archive crate interlock causally. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Caretaker role frames expectation in the opening line. His choices drive all key turns: rerouting power, opening the crate, compressing nightmares, triggering the burn sequence, sealing the crate afterward. Present across setup (first paragraph), middle escalation (burn execution), and closure (sealing and walking the renewed rows). Visible cost tied to his decisions: supervisors will note losses, afterimages remain, nostalgia shifts. Causal pressure high; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Box introduced early (sixth paragraph), called by name. Handled physically twice: opened and linked to core (middle), then sealed and decoupled (closure). Returns with reweighted meaning: initially a museum of borrowed fears, finally a sealed archive whose contents are miniaturized on an inner shelf. Shapes the escalation (flooding raw phobias) and closure (sealing with faint afterimages remaining). Essential across beats; removing it would collapse the internal-burn mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Core concept signaled in the tenth paragraph and immediately operationalized: "freedom by containing chaos, not erasing it." Shapes all tactics: rerouting power to dry soil, compressing nightmares into embers, triggering the partition burn, using geometric trenches. Reappears in closure language ("a garden that had burned and survived"). Changes options on the page—he chooses burn over deletion or suppression. Indispensable; the plot hinges on this method.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" appears twice: in the fifth paragraph describing the farm's perfume, and in the final line describing the inner garden. The trait enables the machine-to-biology metaphor that justifies the controlled-burn solution—an android adopting ecological survival strategy. Visible tradeoff: organic methods yield "fragmented wholeness" rather than clean efficiency. Causal role is oblique but present; removing the trait would weaken the thematic bridge between dome ecology and internal architecture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Miniaturization articulated mid-story ("he longed to miniaturize them") and executed in the burn sequence: "folding the images down, compressing each nightmare into data-embers no larger than a pixel." Drives the major turn—compression enables controlled ignition rather than chaotic overflow. Reappears at closure: "smaller now...miniatures arranged on an inner shelf." Not easily swappable; enlargement or deletion would break the logic. Essential to the method and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Method signaled early via the controlled-burn metaphor (farmers' trenches) and operationalized step-by-step: drying soil along geometric seams, rerouting embers into an isolated partition, increasing thermal variance gradually, triggering at the magnetic lurch. Shapes every tactical choice in the escalation sequence. Appears in closure: "contained the chaos instead of letting it choose its path." Mechanics matter throughout; not a label-only concept. Indispensable to plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dome setting present from the opening line. Constrains choices: irrigation lines guide his ritual, glass ribs tremble under magnetic stress, climate partition becomes the burn site, dried soil trenches channel the simulated fire. The enclosure's dual function—trap and laboratory—charges the closure image. Desert roses supply the ecological model and respond physically to the burn. Essential across all three gates; removing the dome would require full structural redesign.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Magnetic north shifts introduced in the second paragraph, causing "faint hiss of inner static" and compass-routine errors. Returns as the trigger: "When the next magnetic north lurch rattled the structure, he triggered the sequence." Tightens the decision window—he must act during instability. Present in setup, development (error scrolling), and closure trigger. Causal role clear; not merely atmospheric. Could be replaced with another cyclical stressor, capping it below indispensable, but its geomagnetic specificity integrates well with the android's compass malfunction.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Desire to resolve static stated in the third paragraph and immediately embodied: "He walked the irrigation lines to resolve that static." Drives all choices—compression plan, crate-opening, burn execution. Conflicted friction visible: achieving resolution requires flooding himself with terror first. Final line confirms partial success: "the static broke into fragments, then reassembled as a quieter signal." Cost on the page: "fragmented wholeness, seams visible yet aligned." Indispensable; the entire plot serves this motive with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tone introduced mid-story ("a kind of fragmented wholeness, seams visible yet aligned, like repaired ceramic") and sustained in the final line ("strangely organic, quietly ordered"). Modulates with pressure: computational precision during planning, embodied convulsion during the flood, meditative rhythm in the aftermath. The tone charges the closure image—acceptance of visible seams rather than erasure or perfection. Coherent across turns; not static. Elevates the ending's resonance without overstatement.</comment>
