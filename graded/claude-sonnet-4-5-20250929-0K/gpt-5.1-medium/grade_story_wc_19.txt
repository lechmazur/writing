<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's voice is distinctive and their claustrophobia/collecting duality creates genuine interior contradiction. The father's arc from "design flaw" dismissal to shared vocabulary feels earned through the gravity inversion experience. Embodied moments are strong ("my fear uprooted and shaking soil from its roots"), though some interiority edges toward lyric abstraction ("an intangibly tangible awareness") that dilutes specificity. The final shared moment credibly forecloses the old conflict with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through silence-collecting beats, intensifies during the shared inversion, and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (the father's recognition that bunkers were built to keep silence out, followed by mutual acceptance). The "shared vocabulary of silences, sprouting quietly between us" delivers Charged Poise with conceptual cost—the father's entire bunker-building logic is reweighted. Orientation is clean by paragraph three. One meaningful deepening occurs when the father stays for the second inversion, altering their relational stance with visible cost (his unspoken fear confronted).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The trellis functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its beams offer specific silence flavors, the crossbars become "hands held out," and the porcelain doll resonates differently on western versus eastern struts. The inversion hour reconfigures spatial logic (gravity tilts, bodies rise) and charges the final shared float. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's collecting obsession—metallic taste, dusty quiet, wet hush—filtered through their particular mission. The setting directly enables the father's transformation and the closure image of two bodies "unbound from the math of fear."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to metabolize silence without numbing—is signaled early and tightens when the father joins the second inversion. The protagonist's agency is renunciation/endurance (staying on the trellis despite initial fear) that forecloses the bunker-builder path. The father's participation creates a credible reversal: his helmet-strapped arrival, breath hitch, and admission ("we were building bunkers to keep that kind of silence out") narrow options for their future relationship. Cost is visible in the final line's "new weight" and the shared vocabulary that replaces prior isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silences as collectible flavors, the porcelain doll as resonator, the trellis as anti-bunker. The inversion hour functions as both event and metaphor without stating a thesis. The father's insight—"Maybe… we were building bunkers to keep that kind of silence out"—lands as earned discovery, not sermon. The protagonist's answer ("you can let it in until it loses its edge") offers a non-literal resolution to the central question of how fear and silence coexist. The final image of "new weight" and "shared vocabulary" reweights the bunker-builder/claustrophobic-child binary with undeniable relational cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured: "xenial trellis," "stretching contracted tone," "intangibly tangible" create a lyric register that fits the protagonist's collecting obsession. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful ("What are you doing, sprout?" / "Collecting"). The father's line "You cannot collect nothing" lands with subtext—his literalism versus the protagonist's metaphoric practice. Some filter verbs ("I watched his shoulders unclench") slightly dull immediacy, and a few abstract constructions ("an intangibly tangible awareness") soften peak moments. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The porcelain doll's hollow body "catching silences the way bottles catch wind" demonstrates strong perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Strong images: "my fear uprooted and shaking soil from its roots," "every unspoken word had been gold leaf pressed against my tongue." Minor template cadence in the middle third ("I came for," "I had a purpose," "I began to carry") slightly dulls propulsion. One paraphrase loop: "each crossbar a hand held out" is echoed by "hands wide as if accepting a delayed embrace" without added pressure. No loop touches closure. "Intangibly tangible" and "stretching contracted" read as lyric compression rather than muddle, but the pattern isn't taught early enough to fully authorize the density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise—collecting silence flavors via a porcelain doll on a sky-trellis during gravity inversions—synthesizes fresh specifics (resonating doll, taste-based taxonomy) with the bunker-builder/claustrophobic-child relationship in a non-obvious way. The "gilded hush" motif transforms sensory experience into thematic pressure. Risk-taking in the lyric register and the quiet ending heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The father's arc from "design flaw" to "shared vocabulary" feels inevitable in hindsight, driven by the protagonist's methodology rather than a late pivot. Proximity check clean; no famous-line echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The claustrophobic child is present from the opening, drives the middle beats (collecting silences, hanging during inversion), and their methodology transforms the father at closure. Early signal strong; causal pressure across three beats; closure linkage direct. Cost is visible in the final "new weight" and shared vocabulary that replaces isolation. Specificity high: the trait constrains bunker life and enables trellis dwelling. No swappability; the claustrophobia/collecting paradox is structurally load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The porcelain doll appears early (paragraph 8), is used on western and eastern struts (paragraph 10), balanced on the protagonist's forehead (paragraph 13), and slips free during the second inversion with "arms wide as if accepting a delayed embrace" (paragraph 19). Setup, development, and closure payoff all present. It resonates to catch silences, enabling the collecting method. Cost linkage: the doll's drift during inversion mirrors the protagonist and father's unmooring. Specificity strong ("spiderweb crack from collar to cheek"). Causal role in two beats and charged reprise at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "gilded hush" is introduced early (paragraph 7: "Afterward, the world seemed coated in a thin gilded hush") and charges the climax (paragraph 22: "the silence around us bloomed" and paragraph 24: "We hung there together in that gilded hush"). It shapes the protagonist's collecting methodology and reappears with reweighted meaning when the father experiences it. Setup and closure payoff present; middle development less direct. The concept constrains the protagonist's stake (learning to metabolize silence without numbing) and charges the father's transformation. Specificity moderate; "gilded" could be swapped for another metallic descriptor with minor loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" appears once (paragraph 7: "something new had sprouted in me, an intangibly tangible awareness of quiet") and describes the protagonist's post-inversion state but does not constrain later action. It is a label rather than a demonstrated tradeoff. Missing middle development and closure participation; only setup is present. No visible cost tied to this exact phrasing. Swappable with "paradoxical" or "contradictory" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Sprout" appears once as the father's nickname (paragraph 13: "What are you doing, sprout?") with immediate irony noted ("the nickname that never fit, since my fear never let me dig deep"). It seeds the final line's "sprouting quietly between us" but does not drive a turn or constrain a choice. Setup present; middle and closure development weak. The final reprise reweights the nickname but the action itself (being called "sprout") is ornamental. Swappable with any other nickname without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"By limiting exposure" is signaled early (paragraph 11: "I learned the art of listening by limiting exposure, never staying too long in any one stillness, so none would numb me") and implicitly governs the protagonist's collecting methodology. It shapes the middle choice to return repeatedly rather than remain, and the father learns this method in the climax ("you can let it in until it loses its edge"). Setup and development present; closure participation oblique (the method is taught but not re-named). Causal role in one beat; cost connection moderate (the method prevents numbing). Could be paraphrased as "moderation" with minor loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The xenial trellis is present from paragraph 2, described with specificity ("lattice of rusted beams and glass ribs"), and directly enables the protagonist's collecting and both inversion scenes. It pressures the father's arrival (paragraph 13: "helmet strapped on as if the sky were another bunker") and anchors the closure (paragraph 24: "We hung there together"). Setup, development, and closure payoff all strong. The trellis constrains the father's choice to climb despite fear, supplies the beams that catch different silences, and charges the final shared float. Irreplaceable: no other setting would supply both anti-bunker symbolism and the physical structure for inversion.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The inversion hour is introduced early (paragraph 5: "after the first time, when gravity inverts for an hour"), drives the protagonist's initial transformation (paragraphs 6-7), and structures the climactic beat when the father joins (paragraphs 17-24). Setup, development, and closure payoff all present. It tightens decisions (the father must choose whether to stay; both must clip themselves) and alters tactics (hanging versus grounding). The hour's mechanics matter: alarms howl, everything drifts, gravity "settles back." Cost is visible in the father's breath hitch and unspooling. Time window tracked implicitly but clearly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The collecting motivation is introduced early (paragraph 4: "I had a purpose: to collect the flavors of different silences"), dramatized through porcelain-doll use on different beams (paragraph 10), and tested when the father challenges it (paragraph 14: "You cannot collect nothing"). The protagonist's answer defends the practice, and the father adopts it by closure (paragraph 25: "a shared vocabulary of silences"). Setup, development, and closure payoff all present. Friction between want (collecting) and cost (limiting exposure to avoid numbing) is visible. Causal pressure across three beats; cost connection strong (the method prevents overwhelm). Irreplaceable: the collecting logic organizes all other elements.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Stretching contracted" appears once (paragraph 4: "the air had its own gravity, a stretching contracted tone that made every breath feel like a question half answered") and establishes the trellis atmosphere. The oxymoron fits the protagonist's paradoxical collecting and the inversion's physics (things stretch upward, then contract back). It does not modulate visibly under pressure or charge the final image directly. Setup present; middle and closure development weak. The tone is coherent but static; a single mood rather than a dynamic that shifts with escalation. Could be replaced with "tense suspension" without altering structure.</comment>
