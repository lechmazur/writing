<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is consistently embodied through sensory anchors (the wood grain, kettle clicks, ash blank weight) and concrete micro-choices (closing fingers around the blank, not pouring tea, finally lifting the knife). Internal contradiction operates effectively when she keeps the wood uncarved "not to create, but to hold a pause," yet the final act of drawing the first line earns its cost through prior reflection on Luca's practicality. Minor deduction: the reflection on Luca's taming of "seconds between heartbeats" edges toward abstraction without full embodiment, though it recovers through the circus-routine physical memory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening beats (loft, skylight, kettle, fairgrounds below). The Accumulative lens holds: pressure builds through interleaved memory and present tactile engagement with the blank, culminating in the knife's first stroke—a Charged Poise moment where the cost (ending the pause, allowing change) is felt even if not yet paid in full. The circus truck taillights reinforce the "here and gone" frame, and the final line reweights the blank from container of grief to tool of forward motion. One micro turn (setting the blank down, then reaching for the knife) supports rather than fragments the arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight functions as recurring micro-setting that constrains perception and charges the closure: steam clouds the glass, softening memory, and the rain whispers as crowd noise fading. The loft's spatial details (hot plate, table, rafters) ground choices without catalog excess. The ash blank itself operates as object-as-setting, its grain and weight shaping Mara's tactile engagement. The final beat's dual frame—trucks disappearing outside, knife opening wood inside—uses setting to articulate the stakes with economy and purpose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to carve (engage forward motion) or preserve the pause (contain grief)—is signaled early and tightens through embodied hesitation: whitening knuckles, rolling the blank, considering then rejecting forms. The kettle's boil-and-cool cycle provides a pressure clock. The escalation is Accumulative: density increases as memory of Luca's practicality reweights her stance, enabling the knife stroke. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of stasis and the opening of the wood. No explicit antagonist needed; the choice itself carries visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars without thesis statement: the ash blank's "forgiving" grain vs. the unforgiving big cats, Luca's boots-and-bolts love vs. romantic abstraction, the pause that holds wildness vs. the stroke that opens future form. The "rust-hued peace" operates as earned emotional texture rather than declaration. The final image—"opening the wood so something useful can stay"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the animating question of how to live with loss, reweighting the entire frame from containment to cautious creation. The piece resists moralizing and sustains ambiguity (not forgiveness, but a softer edge).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable, with Mara's perceptual signature consistent: circus idiom ("big top," "straw," "caravan"), tactile focus (grain, steam, smooth wood), and a rhythmic patience that mirrors her grief work. Diction stays character-bound; no register leaps. The prose modulates effectively under pressure: shorter clauses when she tightens her grip, longer reflective periods during memory. Free indirect style is clean. Minor observation: "hauntingly practical" recurs as both descriptor and concept without full scenic grounding in one instance, though the boots-and-bolts detail rescues it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance both present action and thematic weight (e.g., "Steam begins to cloud the glass above, softening the gray sky into something nearer to memory"). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer reflective sentences giving way to clipped present beats at closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is controlled and voice-appropriate ("beads on a broken string," "crystallized time"). Minor penalty: "accidents, they called it, the way a storm is called weather" skews slightly abstract for peak emotional beat, and one or two filter-verb clusters ("she thinks," "she knew") could tighten, though they remain voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—circus widow in loft with uncarved wood—avoids template grief-processing by anchoring specificity in Luca's practical love (polished boots, tightened bolts, checked latches) and Mara's embodied circus memory (step, turn, extend, pause). The ash blank as object of hesitation rather than token memorial elevates the frame. The "hauntingly practical" descriptor and rust-hued peace offer fresh emotional texture. The transformation test holds: swap names/places and the arc loses its circus-idiom specificity and tactile grain. Risk-taking is moderate but effective; the piece commits fully to its quiet, accumulative design without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara drives all key turns: she closes fingers around the blank (setup), traces invisible arcs to soften memory (middle), and finally lifts the knife to draw the first line (closure). Her occupation as widow frames stakes and idiom throughout. Cost is visible in each choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The ash blank appears in at least four beats: lies in palm (setup), she closes fingers around it (embodied hesitation), rolls it between palms (middle consideration), sets it on table and finally opens it with knife (closure). Its grain, weight, and "forgiving" quality constrain her choices and charge the final stroke. Removing it breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Here and gone" shapes stakes explicitly: the circus packed up and left, Luca is gone, the trucks disappear with red taillights smearing. The concept pressures Mara's choice between holding a pause (here) and allowing change (gone). It appears in closure framing and reweights the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" is dramatized through Luca's tightened bolts, polished boots, and checked latches—love measured in maintenance rather than romance. It enables Mara's final choice: carving something useful honors his practicality. The trait constrains her options (no romantic monument) and charges the resolution with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Contain" operates throughout: she contains the blank's smoothness with whitening knuckles, considers carving a box "meant to contain matches or buttons," and the entire pause is an act of containment. The final turn—opening the wood to let "something useful stay"—inverts containment into release. Swapping "contain" for another verb would require structural rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through crystallized time" is signaled when Mara traces invisible arcs "as if she moved through crystallized time," reenacting Luca's ring routine to soften memory. The method shapes her middle tactic (air-carving to live with silence) and primes the ending's forward stroke. It does not drive closure directly but enables the shift from pause to action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft anchors every beat: rain whispers overhead, steam clouds the glass, the view of emptied fairgrounds positions her above loss, and the final image occurs "under the rain-beaded skylight." The setting's vertical separation and weather-tactility constrain perception and charge the closure. Removing it collapses spatial logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The kettle boils at story open, clicks off mid-reflection, and ticks as it cools near the end, creating a live pressure clock. Mara does not pour tea—a refusal that marks hesitation—and the cooling kettle underscores the brief permission of heat, mirroring her pause. The timeframe tightens decisions and charges the final stroke's timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To harvest lessons from loss" is stated once, then dramatized: "at first all she could reap was silence," then she begins tracing arcs to soften edges, and finally lifts the knife to carve something useful. The desire conflicts with the impulse to hold the pause, creating visible friction. Cost is legible in each yielded step toward forward motion.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace, stained by memory yet somehow warm" is named once and sustained through diction (weathered metal, ash, tarnished calm). Tone modulates gently under pressure—longer reflective sentences yield to shorter present beats—and charges the final image with tempered hope rather than resolution. Coherent but not dynamically reconfigured at closure.</comment>
