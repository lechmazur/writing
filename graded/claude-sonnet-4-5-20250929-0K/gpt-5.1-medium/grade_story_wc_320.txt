<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is concrete and character-particular ("practical as an accountant of miracles"), with embodied contradictions visible when she navigates the tension between encouraging destruction and protecting the valley. Micro-choices under pressure—placing the shard on her tongue, redirecting the signal toward gradual dismantling—reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final compromise (decades-long dissolution vs. catastrophic fall) feels earned by prior causality and forecloses the immediate-collapse path with felt cost. Minor deduction: the miner's complaint launches the journey but never returns to test stakes or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (signal interpreter), where (tower city over gorge), and when (lunar perigee night) by the second paragraph. The closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she teaches the towers to imagine gradual ending rather than catastrophic fall, a compromise that forecloses immediate destruction with visible cost ("decades, I promised"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increase (emergency codes, love songs, weather reports) and cadence shift ("sighing dial tone") reweighting the dominant stake. One meaningful tightening occurs when the city's wish to fall threatens valley lives, narrowing her options to redirect or deny.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The gorge, suspended towers, and rusted platform constrain every choice: she must climb ladders, spread a blanket on steel slick with moonlight, and balance falling-city physics against valley safety. The shard of hush (a micro-setting object) charges the closure by dissolving on her tongue and aligning her heartbeat with the towers' stutter, enabling the final redirection. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "rust drifted into the black gorge like exhausted confetti" embodies the city's weariness without catalog-touring. The body-as-setting (tongue, chest vibrating, veins leaking stillness) directly enables the protagonist's tuning action at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to grant the city's wish to fall and risk valley deaths or deny it and trap the city in perpetual echo—is signaled early and tightens when "underneath all those phases pulsed a single wish: to fall, to shatter." The protagonist's agency (teaching gradual dismantling) forecloses the catastrophic-fall path with visible cost: the city must wait decades, and she must carry the responsibility of that compromise. One meaningful deepening occurs when she becomes the city and tastes its longing, changing her knowledge of what it truly wants. Escalation is driven by protagonist attention and embodied perception under the chosen Accumulative lens, though the lack of a second on-page reversal keeps this shy of 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (beginnings hidden in endings, rehearsal within farewell) emerges organically from the protagonist's work and the city's recursive wish without thesis statements. The final image—towers imagining self-dismantling over decades, repurposed as bridges and gardens—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: endings need not be erasures but transformations seeded into new forms. Subtext operates in the hollywood fragment's "I never expected it to end" (fame's denial of mortality) and the city's embarrassment ("steel cables groaned as if in embarrassment"). The piece resists tidy morals: the compromise is neither triumph nor tragedy, and the newly awakened frequency "already searching for its own eventual ending" suggests the cycle continues without resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, voice distinct and consistent: the blend of technical precision ("serenely electric," "radioscape snapped into focus") and wry self-awareness ("practical as an accountant of miracles") anchors every line. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices signal hitches, tuning mechanics, and the moment transmissions rehearse their disappearance. Purposeful compression ("licensed by nobody, employed by those who still believe") accelerates without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: free indirect style occasionally tilts into filter-verb stacks ("I heard the real transmission") that dull immediacy in a high-pressure beat, though voice texture remains consistent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally, information density is high (most lines do two jobs), and figurative language is precise without muddle: "moon swelled like a silver lantern," "rust drifted...like exhausted confetti." The opening anchors voice and stakes; the final line recharges the recursive-ending motif with cost. Deductions: minor paraphrase loop in paragraphs explaining the shard of hush and hollywood fragment (both "taught me" constructions feel templated), and one scaffold moment ("That was what I had always chased") that restates theme rather than advancing pressure. Runs of "I [verb]" stems across the middle third approach template cadence without quite triggering the −0.4 threshold, but the cumulative effect slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of signal-interpretation labor, collapsing-city physics, and fame's afterlife fragments feels specific and non-obvious. "Fantasy practicality" (the protagonist negotiating infrastructure timelines with a haunted city) transforms the wise-mystic archetype through grounded problem-solving and visible tradeoffs. The ending's gradual-dismantling compromise is earned in hindsight by the protagonist's stated method ("find the beginning in every ending") and avoids both deus-ex resolution and nihilistic collapse. The hollywood fragment and hush shard are inventive tools whose mechanics matter to the outcome. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens, lyric density, unconventional stakes) heightens coherence without obscuring clarity, warranting +0.3 within-band adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The celestial signal interpreter role frames expectation early, drives two key beats (listening/tasting the signal; redirecting it), and is indispensable to the closure: only her tuning skill enables the compromise that prevents catastrophic fall. Her choices (placing shard on tongue, discarding assumptions about gravity, teaching gradual ending) create all major turns. Causal pressure is strong, cost is visible (decades-long responsibility), and the specificity (licensed by nobody, reads signals by discarding assumptions) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hollywood star fragment is introduced early, handled in two distinct beats (set beside her, pressed to ear), and its glamour-translation function enables her to understand the city's recycled-fame language. It shapes one key turn (hearing the real transmission beneath rehearsed surprise) and contributes meaning to the closure by revealing the doorway the city seeks. Swappability friction: a different translation tool could perform a similar function with minor edits, and the fragment does not return in the final image to charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shard of hush is introduced early, drives three beats (placed on tongue, cools words to stillness, dissolves to align heartbeat with towers), and is causally essential: without it she cannot tune herself to redirect the signal at closure. Its serenely-electric silence directly enables the protagonist's embodied perception ("every heartbeat aligned with the stuttering towers") and the final compromise. Cost is visible (she must surrender speech and absorb dense silence), specificity is high (no generic tuning device could replace it), and it appears in the closure unit.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" is introduced early as the shard's defining trait, constrains two on-page actions (cooling words, leaking stillness into veins), and enables the final tuning that redirects the city's wish. The trait's paradoxical quality (serene yet electric) matters: it allows her to hold contradictory states (calm and charged) simultaneously, which is necessary to become the city without collapsing. Visible tradeoff: she must endure the dissolution and heartbeat-stuttering to access the signal. Swappability friction keeps this shy of 7.5+.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Tune" (and its variant "tuned") appears in five beats, frames the protagonist's method early ("tune myself by discarding assumptions"), drives the midpoint turn (becoming the city), and is indispensable to closure (teaching towers to tune gradual ending). The action redefines options: tuning is not passive listening but embodied redirection with cost. Causal pressure is strong, cost is visible (heartbeat aligned, veins flooded), and the specificity (tuning via discarding assumptions, not mechanical adjustment) is irreplaceable. The final "new frequency...already searching" echoes the tuning cycle with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"By discarding assumptions" is signaled early ("employed by those who still believe the sky is sending messages") and explicitly named mid-story as her tuning method: "I had to tune myself by discarding assumptions about gravity, about time flowing downhill, about cities needing ground." This method enables the closure action (teaching gradual rather than catastrophic fall) and shapes two key attempts (listening past words, aligning heartbeat). It is not merely asserted at the end but demonstrated through her perceptual shifts. Minor friction: the method could be rephrased as "letting go of constraints" without deep structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city suspended over a gorge is introduced in the opening, pressures every choice (she must climb ladders, balance on slick platforms, negotiate falling-city physics vs. valley safety), supplies the core conflict (the city's wish to fall), and is indispensable to closure: the setting *is* the protagonist of the wish she must redirect. Its specificity (rusted dishes, swinging cables, gorge below) shapes tactics (gradual lowering vs. catastrophic shatter) with irreplaceable constraints. The setting charges the final image (sections repurposed as bridges, gardens) and without this exact suspended-city configuration the story's logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is mentioned in the opening line and motivates the night's intensified signal conditions ("moon swelled like a silver lantern"), but it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The protagonist works at her own pace; no deadline forces tactical trade-offs, and perigee does not return at closure to shape the ending. Functional atmospheric detail that primes the mystical tone but remains swappable with "full moon" or similar timing without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the beginning in every ending" is introduced early, drives the protagonist's method (listening for the moment transmissions try to begin again), and shapes the closure: she teaches the city to seed a new town from its wreckage, literalizing beginning-in-ending. Friction between desire and cost is visible: granting the wish risks valley lives, denying it traps the city in echo, so she must find a third path with decades-long cost. The motivation is dramatized in choice (redirecting rather than allowing fall) and reweights the final image. Swappability friction: "to transform endings into renewals" could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" (treating mystical signal work as labor with trade-offs) is coherent from the opening ("practical as an accountant of miracles") through peak pressure ("explaining that nothing truly ends, it only changes channels") to closure (negotiating decades-long infrastructure timelines with a sentient city). Tone charges the final image by grounding the fantastical wish in logistical compromise: the city won't shatter dramatically but will be "lowered and repurposed as bridges, theaters, gardens" during "safe daylight hours." The tone modulates with pressure—wry calm at setup, embodied intensity at tuning, resigned practicality at closure—without breaking coherence or flattening into static whimsy.</comment>
