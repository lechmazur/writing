<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Calder's interiority is concrete and embodied—"feeling the tug of threads that no longer existed," "vows like rust beneath his skin"—and his contradictory impulses (duty vs. doubt) act simultaneously in scene. The final choice to stay but not serve is earned by the greenhouse's pressure and the marionette metaphor. However, the insight "They were not loyalty...but a choreography" edges toward tidy diagnostic labeling, and Mira's wisdom-dispenser role lacks personal friction or cost; she applies pressure without risking anything herself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening beats. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through charged images (masks, spinning fruits, the program) and cadence shifts ("Then you become the first thing this orchard has ever grown that cannot be predicted"). The closure unit is Charged Poise—Calder's declaration "I will stay...but I will not serve" crystallizes his stance and forecloses allegiance to the king with felt cost (exile implied, "the future had just unsnapped its strings"). One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, and the final image reweights prior material. Cost is legible: he steps outside duty and predictability, losing the identity that defined him.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard is vividly particularized—glass apples hum, metal trees rise from silver soil, crystal masks hold trapped possibilities—and the greenhouse environment constrains Calder's choices (he enters to catalog but confronts his allegiance). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through his weary knighthood. The marionette program functions as micro-setting, recurring with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the "endless night" frame remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint that materially alters tactics or decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Calder's allegiance and identity—is signaled early and tightens through the mask-reveal and orchard pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs: Mira's challenge shifts his understanding from duty-as-virtue to duty-as-choreography, narrowing his options to serve or step aside. The cost is felt: choosing unpredictability means forsaking the identity and role that gave him purpose ("I will not serve" forecloses his knightly function). Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres and the final stance is earned. No explicit antagonist is required; the kingdom's invisible demand and Calder's internalized vows supply sufficient friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the marionette program, the orchard's impossible fruits, the masks holding alternate lives. Calder's arc—from dutiful inventory to self-authored unpredictability—is inextricable from the thematic question of agency versus choreographed loyalty. The final image ("the future had just unsnapped its strings") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence (Mira's smile as "shivering bliss," the folding of the program until the knight "unsnap[s] into fragments"). However, the line "They were not loyalty...but a choreography" skirts thematic echo by articulating the premise in near-prompt language, and the marionette/strings motif is heavily underlined rather than trusted to resonate quietly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; Calder's perceptual signature is distinct—he notices vows as rust, threads that no longer exist, the tug of invisible strings. Diction remains character-appropriate: "withdrawn knight exiled from legend," "factually mystical," "shivering bliss" all carry elevated, fable-inflected texture consistent with the voice. Dialogue feels purposeful and carries subtext ("You are late" / "Time moves strangely here"). Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening at the mask-reveal and final choice. No head-hopping. The prose rhythm supports pressure: longer, image-laden sentences in exposition compress to shorter declarations at closure ("I will stay...but I will not serve").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; many lines do double work (e.g., "lanterns inside glowed like bottled comets" establishes atmosphere and hints at contained impossibility). Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent ("vows like rust," "bottled comets," "constellations as small, steady wounds"). However, density spikes into overwriting in several beats: "factually mystical, like proof disguised as rumor" and "shivering bliss, like someone stepping barefoot onto new snow" stack metaphors without clear grounding, and "feeling the tug of threads that no longer existed" borders on abstraction. Template cadence appears in the orchard-description paragraph ("Glass apples hummed...pear-shaped flasks whispered...clusters of gears blossomed"), where three parallel clauses flatten momentum. No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but the figurative load in high-pressure beats (mask reveal, final choice) occasionally obscures rather than sharpens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemical orchard, marionette theater, and allegiance-as-choreography is specific and feels inevitable in hindsight. The marionette metaphor transforms the familiar knight-quest trope by literalizing invisible strings and making the program a physical object that Calder handles and folds. The orchard's impossible fruits and mask-reveal offer fresh angles on possibility and choice. However, the knight-who-questions-loyalty premise remains a well-worn template, and while the marionette frame is vivid, the emotional calculus (duty vs. self-determination) does not surprise. The ending's quiet rebellion is earned but predictable once the stakes are clear. Risk-taking in voice and imagery is evident, but the core arc follows a recognizable path.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Calder is present in all beats, and his choices create key turns: he enters the orchard (complication), examines the program (deepening), considers the masks (confrontation), and declares "I will stay...but I will not serve" (closure). His withdrawal and doubt are signaled early ("withdrawn knight exiled from legend"), and his final decision alters tactics and forecloses allegiance. The "withdrawn" attribute is embodied in his cloak, careful movements, and reluctance to claim heroism. Setup, development, and payoff are all present. The element is indispensable: without Calder's specific withdrawal and doubt, the allegiance question and final stance collapse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The marionette program appears early, is handled in two beats (given to Calder, folded by him), and returns with reweighted meaning in the closure paragraph ("the theater program still trembling in his gauntlet," "unsnapped its strings"). It primes the allegiance metaphor and charges the final image. However, its middle involvement is thin—Calder folds it and traces it, but the action does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it remains primarily symbolic. Setup and payoff are strong; development is present but light. The element is integral to theme but not indispensable to plot: a different seed-image could carry similar weight with adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Murmured allegiance" is signaled early in Calder's reflection on "quiet moment when he had longed to step aside" and in Mira's line "confusion hardens into a murmured allegiance you dare not speak aloud." It shapes the dominant stake (allegiance to king vs. self) and is paid off when Calder chooses to stay but not serve, forsaking murmured obedience. However, the concept is more thematic accent than causal engine: the orchard and masks drive the turn; the "murmured" quality is gestured at rather than dramatized in a specific whispered vow or confession. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is indirect. The element adds texture but is not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is applied to Mira early ("every movement she made felt factually mystical, like proof disguised as rumor") and establishes her tone. It colors the orchard's impossible fruits and the mask-reveal, lending the scene an aura of undeniable strangeness. However, the trait is largely descriptive; it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. Mira's mysticism creates atmosphere and lends authority to her challenge, but the attribute could be replaced with "uncanny" or "enigmatic" without structural loss. Setup is strong; development and cost-linkage are weak. Trend: mid-band, functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unsnap" appears twice with escalating force: Calder folds the program "until the knight seemed to unsnap into fragments," then the closing line declares "the future had just unsnapped its strings." The action literalizes the breaking of choreographed control and charges the closure image. However, the first use is Calder's perception of an illustration, not a decisive physical act; the second is metaphorical. The verb is vivid and specific, and the final image depends on it, but it does not directly enable or constrain a middle choice. Setup, thematic payoff, and closure linkage are strong; causal pressure is indirect. The element is nearly indispensable to the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Forgotten patterns" is invoked in Calder's realization: "a choreography, carried out through forgotten patterns he had mistaken for virtue." It names the allegiance trap and appears in the closure reflection. However, the method is not signaled early or dramatized in tactics; we do not see Calder recognize, trace, or exploit a pattern on the page. The phrase summarizes the insight rather than shaping attempts or choices. Setup is weak (arrives late), development is absent, payoff is thematic only. The element is present but ornamental; swappable with "hidden scripts" or "invisible rehearsals" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is anchored early, described in vivid detail (glass apples, metal trees, silver soil, crystal masks), and supplies the resources (masks, spinning fruits) that pressure Calder's choice. The setting's impossible fruits and the masks holding alternate lives directly shape the confrontation and closure. The "endless night" and frost-breathing glass establish tone and urgency. The orchard is not mere backdrop; it functions as crucible and catalyst. Setup, development, and payoff are all strong. The element is indispensable: without the orchard's specific alchemical pressure, the allegiance turn lacks concrete anchoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"As reality shifts" is invoked in Calder's line "I preferred to arrive as reality shifts" and again in "the world tilt, as reality shifts around a question." The timeframe establishes atmosphere and signals instability, but it does not function as a live clock or deadline that alters tactics. The midnight arrival and the orchard's timeless quality create mood, yet decisions are not visibly tightened by temporal pressure. Setup is present; development and cost-linkage are weak. The element adds texture but is functionally replaceable with "at the threshold" or "in transition" without significant loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Calder's desire "to capture the shape of possibility before it slipped forever" is stated early and drives his entry into the orchard. The motivation is tested in the mask-reveal (seeing alternate lives) and resolved in his choice to become "the first thing this orchard has ever grown that cannot be predicted." The desire is conflicted—he claims to inventory, but truly seeks self-definition—and the cost (forsaking duty) is visible. Setup, development, and payoff are all present. However, the motivation is somewhat abstract and internally focused; it does not generate external friction or force a trade-off between competing goods. The element is integral but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Shivering bliss" appears in Mira's smile at the closure beat ("in that smile was shivering bliss, like someone stepping barefoot onto new snow") and charges the final turn. The tone combines cold wonder and fragile joy, coherent with the endless-night orchard and Calder's uncertain freedom. However, the tone is localized to one image rather than modulated across beats; earlier passages lean toward foreboding and melancholy without the "bliss" accent. Setup is weak (arrives late), but closure linkage is strong and the image is memorable. The element enriches the ending but is not structurally indispensable; "quiet exhilaration" or "cold relief" could serve similarly.</comment>
