<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The luminous skeptic carries a consistent perceptual signature (taste-based sensing, bioluminescent doubt) and makes a micro-choice at the end by answering "without words." However, the final choice feels more received than wrestled-with; the protagonist is largely observational until the closing moment. The weather-bearers deliver their exposition cleanly, but their interiority remains opaque. Internal contradiction is minimal; the arc from doubt-as-wall to doubt-as-lens is told rather than dramatized through on-page friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, sensory-accumulation pattern early (taste shifts, aurora descriptions, forest parliament) and sustains it. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist stands with the weather-bearers under a dimming aurora, four bodies carrying "the weather of a larger tomorrow"—options crystallize, cost is felt (volunteering the body as meeting place), and prior material reweights. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (lavender bluff, aurora, narrator present). One meaningful deepening occurs when the ring melts into skin and the weather-bearers explain their archive burden. The final image reconfigures the skeptic's stance with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lavender bluff, aurora, spiral-grass patch, and voting trees create a vivid, purposeful micro-setting. The spiraling grass marks the convergent meeting point, and the aurora's dimming brackets the encounter temporally. The tin compass ring functions as a body-tool hybrid that constrains navigation (pull on tongue, melting into skin). Sensory hierarchy is strong: taste dominates (rust, burnt sugar, ozone, salt, old paper), filtered through the skeptic's bioluminescent POV. The setting charges the final image (twilight, four bodies on the bluff) and the trees' voting provides atmospheric pressure without dictating choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: learning why some people carry weather. The ring's pull leads the protagonist to the weather-bearers, who explain the archive burden and request help with letting go—this tightens options and introduces a trade-off (doubt-as-lens applied to collective remembering). However, the escalation is expository rather than action-driven; the weather-bearers narrate the problem, and the protagonist's acceptance is signaled obliquely ("answered without words"). One on-page tightening occurs when the ring melts into skin, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible but felt more as atmosphere than as a specific forfeiture. No clear antagonist; coincidence (four strangers waiting) complicates without resolving, consistent with Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—archives of climate, doubt as lens, voluntary embodiment of collective memory—emerges through image (weather-wrapped strangers, melting ring, dimming aurora) rather than statement. The final line ("four small bodies carrying the weather of a larger tomorrow") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the weather-bearers' speeches veer toward prompt echo ("the world needed a way to converge its scattered seasons," "archives are heavy") and border on thematic summary. The piece resists tidy resolution (the request to "help us remember how to let go" is accepted but not enacted on the page), preserving ambiguity. Subtext operates in the taste-compass mechanic and the forests' silent voting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: taste-dominant sensing, bioluminescent skin, metaphor-rich diction ("gravity with an accent," "postcard of the future"). Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early (aurora draped low, waves imitating sky, leaves clicking like beads) and sustained. The weather-bearers' dialogue carries subtext and goal (persuading the skeptic to join the archive work), though their speeches occasionally flatten into exposition. Register remains consistent; no filter-verb stacks or awkward shifts. Under peak stress (ring melting, taste flood), syntax tightens appropriately without losing voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high (most lines advance image, concept, or choice). However, several beats loop near-synonyms: "the taste shifted, sweetening" / "I tasted ozone, salt, and something like old paper" cluster within three paragraphs; "Because the world needed…" / "We became walking archives…" / "But archives are heavy…" form a stacked exposition run. Template cadence appears in the weather-bearer portraits ("One carried sunlight…another wore drizzle…the third was wrapped in slow snow"). These artifacts dull momentum in the middle third but do not obscure the closure image. No filter-verb stacks or pronoun ambiguity. The final line's rhythm charges the ending effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination—taste-navigation, bioluminescent skeptic, forest elections as timeframe, climate-archive embodiment—feels specific and non-obvious. The "emergent compass" and "terrestrially cosmic" constructs synthesize ecological urgency with lyric sf in a voice-consistent way. However, the weather-bearers' role (living climate archives post-ocean-rise) echoes solarpunk/climate-fiction templates; the transformation lies in the taste mechanic and the protagonist's doubt-as-lens frame. The final turn (doubt sharpens rather than obstructs) is earned in hindsight. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines. Risk-taking (sensory-led navigation, mosaic backstory, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting a within-band lift of +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Luminous skeptic: present throughout as POV identity. Setup clear (first paragraph). Development: the skeptic walks toward the spiral grass guided by taste (middle beat). Closure participation: the skeptic "answered without words" and stands with the group in the final image. However, the character's choices are largely reactive (following the ring's pull, listening to exposition); the final acceptance is gestured rather than dramatized as a turning-point action. Two gates met (setup, closure); middle involvement is observation more than decision. Causal pressure is moderate; cost connection is atmospheric (joining the archive burden) rather than a visible forfeiture tied to the skeptic's specific traits. Band 5.0–6.9 guidance: shapes one key turn (acceptance at the end). Minor lift for closure presence; held back by passive middle.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tin compass ring: introduced early (first third). Handled in at least three beats: receiving it from the climatologist, slipping it on the bluff, the ring pulling on tongue and guiding by flavor, melting into skin. Development: the ring's pull leads the protagonist to the spiral-grass meeting point (constrains navigation). Closure: "the ring pulsed, and images surfaced on my tongue" precedes the final acceptance. Three gates met; beat involvement spans early, middle, closure. Causal pressure: the ring enables the convergence (without it, no meeting). Specificity: "emergent compass…pulling not on my hand but on my tongue" is irreplaceable. Cost connection: melting into skin forecloses removal, a visible price. Band 7.0–8.4 guidance approached; held slightly below by the fact that the ring's mechanics (taste-based navigation) overlap heavily with element F and the ring itself could be replaced by another taste-activating artifact without major structural change. Still, strong integration across beats and closure linkage justify upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emergent compass: introduced early (first third) as the ring's property. The concept shapes tactics on the page: "guiding me by flavor rather than force" leads the protagonist to the spiral-grass patch where the weather-bearers wait. Development: the compass's pull is the mechanism for convergence. Closure: the ring pulses and delivers taste-images ("thunderstorms trapped in subway tunnels…") that crystallize the protagonist's understanding. Three gates met. Causal pressure: the compass is the means of finding the weather-bearers; without it, no meeting. However, the concept is largely synonymous with element F (sensing through taste changes) and element B (the ring); much of its work is already scored under those elements. Specificity: "emergent…not pointing north or south but toward whatever pattern was trying to be born" is thematically resonant but mechanically overlaps the taste method. Band 5.0–6.9 guidance: shapes middle navigation and closure realization. Minor lift for thematic charge at the end; overlap with B and F limits independent necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Terrestrially cosmic: introduced early (first third) as the promised feel of the ring's pull ("like gravity with an accent, local yet impossibly far-reaching"). The attribute is mentioned again in the final paragraph ("that fleeting, terrestrially cosmic twilight"). Setup and closure gates met; middle development absent (no on-page action is enabled or constrained by this specific trait). The term is label-only; it colors tone but does not alter tactics or choices. Lyric reprise at closure reweights the opening frame slightly, but the attribute is swappable with a near-synonym ("cosmically local," "universally intimate") without structural loss. Band 3.0–4.9 guidance: functional but replaceable, present at setup and closure but without causal pressure. Held in mid-4s by lack of middle beat involvement and ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Converge: introduced early ("the world needed a way to converge its scattered seasons") and enacted as the protagonist's arrival at the spiral-grass patch where the weather-bearers wait. Development: the ring's pull achieves convergence spatially (four bodies meeting). Closure: the final image ("four small bodies carrying the weather of a larger tomorrow") literalizes the convergence and charges it with collective purpose. Three gates met. Causal linkage: the action is the story's hinge (meeting enables the archive explanation and the protagonist's acceptance). However, "converge" is a high-level verb; the specific beats (walking to the spiral grass, standing together) could occur under many action labels (gather, meet, assemble). Specificity is moderate; cost connection is present (convergence requires the protagonist to join the archive burden). Band 7.0–8.4 guidance: drives two beats (spatial arrival, final standing-together image) and contributes to closure. Held from higher bands by replaceability at the verb level.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sensing through taste changes: introduced early (first third) and used across multiple beats. The climatologist explains it; the protagonist tastes rust and lightning upon donning the ring, then burnt sugar and pine as she walks, then ozone/salt/old paper when the weather-bearers appear, and finally "bitter and bright" when asked to help. Development: taste guides navigation (the emergent compass pulls on the tongue, not the hand). Closure: "I tasted the question, bitter and bright, and answered without words"—the method shapes the final acceptance. Three gates met; beat involvement spans early, middle, closure. Causal pressure: without taste-sensing, no navigation and no recognition of the weather-bearers' nature. Specificity: the method is irreplaceable (no other sense could carry the same diegetic logic). Cost connection: the method requires the protagonist to "stand to notice it," a perceptual vulnerability. Band 7.0–8.4 guidance clearly met: drives at least two beats and shapes the ending's charge. Strong integration across all three gates and high irreplaceability justify upper 7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lavender bluff under aurora: introduced in the opening line and sustained throughout. Setup clear. Development: the aurora's low drape and the spiral-grass patch supply spatial anchors and atmospheric pressure (the aurora dims as the forests finalize their vote, bracketing the encounter temporally). Closure: "that fleeting, terrestrially cosmic twilight" and "lavender bluff under aurora" recur in the final line, charging the image. Three gates met. However, the setting is largely atmospheric; it does not constrain navigation or alter tactics (the protagonist could meet the weather-bearers on a beach, a rooftop, or a field with similar effect). The bluff's "edge" is mentioned but never used as a resource or obstacle. Micro-setting note: the spiral-grass patch (where grass leans toward an invisible center) more directly signals convergence. Band 5.0–6.9 guidance: shapes setup and closure reprise but does not pressure middle choices. Held at upper 6s by strong closure linkage and tone contribution; lack of tactical constraint prevents higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>While forests hold elections: introduced early (opening lines) and sustained as backdrop. The trees' voting (leaves clicking, branches lifting) provides atmospheric texture. The narrator waited "years to come here while forests hold elections, because that is when the sky listens hardest." Development: the forests finalize their vote near closure ("as the forests finalized their vote and the aurora dimmed to a promise"), bracketing the encounter. Setup and closure gates met; middle beats reference the voting as ongoing ambiance but do not tie a tactic or choice to the election's progress. Timeframe does not tighten decisions (no countdown or urgency tied to the election's end). The election functions more as world-detail than as a pressure mechanism. Band 5.0–6.9 guidance: shapes setup and closure framing but lacks tactical clock. Lyric reprise at closure (voting finalizes as protagonist accepts the request) adds mild causal resonance but does not create urgency. Held in mid-5s by ornamental middle use and lack of countdown pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To learn why some people carry weather with them: introduced early (first third) as the protagonist's stated motive. The climatologist said "the answer would be written in taste"; the ring is given to pursue this goal. Development: the taste-sensing leads to the weather-bearers, who explain their nature ("walking archives of rain and frost and sunlight"). Closure: the protagonist's understanding crystallizes ("I understood then that my doubt was not a wall but a lens"), and she accepts the request to help. Three gates met. However, the desire is more pursued by following instructions (wear the ring, taste the air) than by wrestling with conflicting wants; friction is minimal until the final acceptance. The motivation is told and enacted but not dramatized as a struggle between competing costs. Band 5.0–6.9 guidance: shapes one key turn (acceptance at the end) and frames the quest structure. Cost connection is moderate (joining the archive burden is accepted, but no visible forfeiture precedes it). Held in mid-6s by clean integration across beats but limited on-page friction between wants and costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia: established early and sustained. Diction blends speculative elements (bioluminescent skin, emergency climates stitched into blood, oceans risen into clouds) with elegiac, backward-looking imagery (old postcard, old tin roofs, water you once called home, children teaching clouds to spell their names). Tone modulates subtly: wonder in the opening aurora description, melancholy in the weather-bearers' speeches, quiet resolve in the final standing-together image. The tone charges the final image ("a larger tomorrow" carries both hope and weight). However, the tone is largely uniform; no sharp cadence shift under pressure. Three gates met (setup, middle consistency, closure charge). Coherence is strong; the tone supports the accumulative lens and reweights the ending. Band 7.0–8.4 guidance: essential across beats and ending. Held at lower 7s by lack of modulation under peak pressure (the tone does not tighten or break when the ring melts or the request is made). Still, the tone is indispensable to the piece's effect and charges the closure image meaningfully.</comment>
