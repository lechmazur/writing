<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Eira's interiority is concrete and embodied—"weight that pressed against her bones," "vacancy cracked"—and her motivation (to defeat numbness) shapes the cavern scene. The children's micro-choices (Jorin pressing his palm, others following) demonstrate embodied emotion under pressure. Minor slip: the students remain somewhat undifferentiated beyond Jorin, and Marlo's role stays functional rather than layered. The final act earns transformation through cumulative sensory contact, though the ending leans slightly toward summary ("numbness thinning like ice") rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through sensory detail, the filament installation, and the children's progressive contact with the drums until the final beat ("silence finally became music again") reconfigures the central stake. Orientation anchors (drum cavern, Eira, students) arrive early. Closure lands on the page with visible cost—tears, sobs, the thinning of numbness—and the backward-recorded mechanism shapes tactics throughout. One micro turn (the boy Jorin's sob) deepens pressure before the group follows. The ending reconfigures via pattern accumulation rather than a single causal pivot, which fits the inferred lens cleanly.</comment>

<comment>The cavern's sensory particulars—dust in shafts of light, rough stone arcs, drums as "sleeping hearts"—are vivid and selective. The setting constrains choice: Eira threads the filament through drilled tunnels, the drums translate silence into touch, and the floor's tremor becomes a shared tactile medium. The micro-setting (drums, filament, stone) charges the final image as children press against skins and earth. Scope fits: no occupational depth beyond what the scene demands, and spatial choreography remains clear across movements.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—defeating the children's numbness—is signaled early and tightened when the phonograph activates and the drums wake. The tightening occurs through Jorin's contact (one reversal from flinch to sob) and the group's follow-through, narrowing options from vacant stares to embodied grief. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each tactile beat adds density until the final release. Minor limitation: the mechanism's success feels somewhat assured once activated; a moment of doubt or friction mid-scene would have sharpened the stakes further.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—silence as presence, numbness versus feeling—emerges from particulars: the filament, the backward songs, the drums' mirrored hush. The final image ("silence finally became music again") reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (Jorin's laugh-to-sob, Eira's shoulder touches) and the conceptual paradox of a deaf teacher using soundless music. The piece invites reflection on sensory loss and emotional access without reducing complexity to a tidy lesson. A recurring motif (silence/weight) shifts meaning across beats and charges the closure.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV anchored to Eira maintains stable distance and perceptual filter; Marlo's signed dialogue and the children's reactions are rendered through her attention. Diction is purposeful—"audibly muted light," "mirrored hush"—and rhythmically controlled. Brief elision (the filament's exact threading) serves efficiency. Minor slip: occasional elevated register ("bewildered by the invitation," "enthrall") drifts slightly above Eira's embodied voice under peak stress. Dialogue mechanics are clean; Marlo's signing carries goal and subtext without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or mechanism—and syntax varies to support rhythm. Overwriting appears in clusters: "distant thunder refusing to sound," "sleeping heart," "wounded beetle," and "vines, curling up their legs and spines, coaxing chill places awake" stack figurative language in adjacent sentences without pattern-teaching, applying −0.5 in Q7. A paraphrase loop ("audibly muted" / "mirrored hush" / "filament of hush") recurs without functional shift, adding −0.2. Stock metaphor "ice in spring" at closure adds −0.2. Total deduction −0.9 from a base ~8.1. No causality obscured, so penalties remain here. Clarity and propulsion otherwise strong.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—deaf teacher, backward-recorded songs, filament of hush translating silence into tactile rhythm—is specific and non-obvious. The drum-cavern setting and the phonograph-without-needle mechanism feel fresh. Transformation test passes: swap names or places and the arc loses its particularity (deafness, drums, filament). Risk-taking (soundless music that "enthralls" through touch) heightens stakes without gimmickry, earning +0.3 within band. Minor limitation: the climactic success feels slightly frictionless once the mechanism activates; a beat of doubt or resistance would sharpen inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Eira's deaf-teacher identity is signaled early, shapes her motivation (she cannot hear but feels the drums), and drives the cavern choice and filament threading. Her final walk among students—touching, being held—demonstrates decision under pressure. The trait constrains tactics (sign language with Marlo, reliance on touch) and participates in closure. Two beats (threading filament, touching students) and causal pressure present. Swappability moderate: a hearing teacher could theoretically lead this scene with minor edits, though the silence/deafness paradox would lose thematic charge. Score reflects solid integration across setup, middle, and payoff with one beat of direct choice and closure linkage, but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>The broken needle appears early (setup) and its absence enables the filament mechanism—Eira threads filament "through the broken groove where the phonograph needle should have been." It participates in one causal beat (the threading) and is mentioned at closure in the phonograph's "needleless arm." Two-gate integration (setup, payoff) with one functional beat. Swappability moderate: the mechanism could work with a "removed" needle rather than a "broken" one. Specificity (the break as "bitten by silence") adds thematic texture but does not alter tactics. Score reflects functional presence across setup and ending with mid-band causal work, but lacks middle development or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The filament of hush is introduced early, Marlo explains its function ("carries silence the way strings carry sound"), Eira threads it through the cavern tunnels, and it transmits rhythms from the phonograph to the drums and children. The concept drives at least three beats (introduction, threading, transmission) and shapes tactics (Eira must thread it, the drums wake via it). It is causally active at closure ("filament of hush shivered with their contact") and irreplaceable—no generic wire would carry the symbolic and functional load. Setup, development, and payoff all present. Score reflects essential integration across the arc with high specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>"Audibly muted" appears once as description ("audibly muted light") in the cavern's sensory catalog. It does not constrain action, enable a choice, or return with reweighted meaning. Label-only ornamental use. Missing middle development and closure participation. Late-element and ornamental caps apply. Score reflects presence without causal work or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Enthrall" appears once in dialogue ("drums pulsed with a mirrored hush to enthrall") describing the drums' effect on the children. The term captures the story's climactic mechanism—the children are drawn in, their numbness cracks—but the verb itself is not repeated or causally foregrounded across beats. The underlying action (children captivated by tactile rhythm) drives the ending, yet "enthrall" as a labeled action is swappable with "captivate" or "hold" with minor tonal shift. Setup implicit, payoff present, middle development weak. Score reflects functional closure participation with moderate swappability and single-beat presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Backward-recorded songs are signaled early ("etched with backward recorded songs Marlo had made at Eira's request"), explained in one beat ("notes would unfold not outward but inward, walking back along the paths where memories first hid"), and activated at closure when Marlo cranks the phonograph and the songs "poured silently into the stone." The method shapes tactics (Eira must use this specific recording type) and participates in the ending's sensory cascade. Setup, development (brief explanation), and payoff present. Specificity moderate: the backward mechanism is thematically resonant but functionally the songs could be "special" recordings without the backward detail and still work. Score reflects three-gate integration with causal presence and closure linkage, but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The drum maker's cavern is introduced in the opening, anchors all action, and supplies the drums, stone tunnels, and resonant space essential to the mechanism. The setting constrains choice (Eira brings students here specifically for the drums and acoustics) and charges the final image (children pressing against drumheads, backs to stone). It appears in at least four beats (arrival, threading filament into tunnels, drum activation, children's contact) and is irreplaceable—the story's logic depends on this exact location. Setup, development, and payoff all strong. Score reflects essential integration across the arc with high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>"During the faint rustle of turning seasons" appears once as a contextual note ("She had brought them here during the faint rustle of turning seasons, when even the city seemed to hold its breath"). It does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or alter tactics. Time within the scene is untracked; no clock pressure shapes moves. Ornamental label without causal work. Missing middle development and closure participation. Score reflects presence in setup with thematic texture but no functional pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Eira's motivation—to defeat emotional numbness—is signaled early ("She hoped, secretly and desperately, to defeat emotional numbness before it hardened inside their chests like stone"), drives her choice to bring students to the cavern and activate the filament mechanism, and is tested at closure when the numbness thins and tears appear. The desire is dramatized through Eira's preparations (backward songs, filament, Marlo's help) and the final beat's payoff. Setup, development (threading and activation), and payoff present. Friction between want (break numbness) and cost (vulnerability, tears) is visible. Score reflects solid integration across the arc with causal pressure and closure linkage, though the success feels slightly assured once the mechanism activates.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Mirrored hush" appears in one line ("drums pulsed with a mirrored hush to enthrall") and echoes the broader tonal strategy—silence as presence, tactile quiet—sustained throughout. The tone coheres across turns (Eira's interior, Marlo's signing, the drum activation, the children's release) and modulates with pressure (from anticipation to sensory cascade to quiet tears). The final image ("silence finally became music again") charges the tone's thematic paradox. Tone is not static; it intensifies through accumulation. Setup implicit, development present in sustained sensory restraint, payoff strong. Score reflects coherent tonal architecture with closure linkage and pressure modulation.</comment>
