<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's character is rooted in a vivid sensory gift (olfactory navigation), embodied emotion ("salt of fear," "metal tang"), and contradictory impulses—her hunger to transform death into life and her anxiety around stillness. Her final choice to plant the seed is earned by her articulated philosophy ("death blooms among us, perhaps we will…hear the undercurrent of wisdom"), and the piece tracks her micro-choices: bargaining for the seed, journaling scents, and arguing before elders. Interiority is concrete ("mind darted like swifts") and no therapy-speak appears in peak beats. Minor slip: grandmother's wisdom arrives via reflection and does not constrain a present choice on the page; per BRR it primes the closure but does not alter a mid-story option, so no large deduction applies, yet it slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph (Liora, treetop village, dawn) and establishes the dominant stake clearly by line 10 (elders' vote on descent; Liora's seed as answer). The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density of imagery and motifs (rot/death, swaying/serenity, journals/intentionality) until the final planting reweights those terms. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the village inhales to listen, options crystallize, and cost is felt in Liora's "fragile serenity growing inside the motion" and the elders' surrender. The cost is visible in Maru's nod ("surrender to something older than his caution") and the requirement that watchers accompany her, foregrounding accountability. One escalation step—Maru's initial challenge → Liora's argument → permission with watchers—narrows options cleanly. No causality breaks or lens contradictions touch closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setting is anchored with specificity: rope bridges, platforms stitched by weathered intention, resin ghosts on branches, and sensory detail (old cedar smoke, crushed juniper, bitter root tea). The canopy functions as micro-setting that constrains movement ("feet knew the rhythm of each rope") and charges the final image (highest branch as planting site). Spatial choreography is clear across the climb. Minor slip: while the village setting shapes Liora's argument ("Up here we sway and shudder"), the marshes below remain abstract and do not constrain on-page tactics. No occupation-level depth is required at this length; the herbalist role informs perception without needing technical systems.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (line 10: elders' descent decision) and Liora's seed represents an alternative answer. Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens reads as a meaningful tightening: Maru's challenge → Liora's counter-argument invoking fear and undercurrent wisdom → permission with watchers and notebooks, forecloses easy refusal. The final planting narrows the village's future options (now they must "listen" as the flower speaks). Cost is legible: Liora must climb "higher still" under watchers' scrutiny, and the village inhales in collective waiting—the outcome remains charged and irreversible. No reversals are required in this lens; the single deepening and crystallization suffice. Agency is hers: she argues, climbs, and plants with visible risk ("if this flower speaks"). Minor note: the elders' internal reasoning remains opaque, but their surrender to "something the wind already knew" provides sufficient friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: cultivating serenity within motion, stillness inside decay, death blooming to teach wisdom. Liora's final act literalizes the metaphor without stating a moral—the seed planted in moss becomes an answer to the unnamed question. Subtext operates in silence (Maru's nod, the village's inhalation) and in the doodling ritual (private forest that steadies restless hands). No thematic echo or sermon in the final paragraph; the violet dusk "tasted of iron" and the village "inhaled to listen" charge the closure without explaining it. The piece resists binary resolution: descent vs. ascent, rot vs. bloom, fear vs. wisdom all remain in tension. One minor slip: "undercurrent of wisdom" is articulated twice by narration and once by Liora's speech, risking slight over-articulation, but the phrase is rooted in grandmother's teaching and does serve as the conceptual spine. Earned wisdom arises from Liora's three-month bargain and her journaling practice, not platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Liora throughout; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Perceptual signature is vivid and consistent: olfactory mapping ("salt of fear," "metal tang," "resin ghosts"), sensory hierarchy that reflects her herbalist focus. Dialogue (lines 23–24, 27–30) is spare, purposeful, and carries subtext—Maru's "do you know what it means" questions her hubris without naming it; Liora's reply turns metaphor into argument. Syntax modulates with pressure: the opening uses longer, lyric rhythms ("dawn unraveled the last threads of mist") while the confrontation tightens to shorter beats. Minor slip: some elevated diction ("olfactorily," "undercurrent") risks register drift, but it fits an herbalist's lexicon and remains consistent across the piece. Free indirect style is clean; no quote-mechanic errors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies naturally, sensory images are specific and purposeful ("corpse flower seed," "wildflower hush," "violet that tasted of iron"), and information density is high. Sentence openings vary; paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Minor artifact pattern: a few lines edge toward elevated register or stock poetic constructions ("dawn unraveled the last threads of mist," "pollen, golden and heavy") without harming clarity; they read voice-motivated rather than template-generated. One small scaffold slip: "hands trembling only slightly" is a filter-adjacent modifier that could be tightened. No figurative muddle in peak beats; metaphors (swaying/serenity, rot/bloom) cohere and build across the piece. Propulsion is consistent; no bogged reflective loops. Final image recharges prior motifs cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The corpse flower premise offers a fresh angle on the familiar descent-vs.-ascent village dilemma: rather than choosing safety, Liora imports the feared element to force collective reckoning. The olfactory navigation trait and journaling ritual with doodled wrapping paper are specific, non-obvious details that feel earned rather than quirky ornament. Emotional specificity (hunger braided with fear, serenity within motion) avoids generic templates. The story resists the safety middle—Liora does not hedge her argument or wait for consensus; she climbs and plants with watchers as witnesses. Transformation test: swapping the corpse flower for another symbol or the treetop village for a generic setting would collapse the logic. Minor note: the "undercurrent of wisdom" phrasing and the grandmother's aphorism ("like ink settling before it writes itself") occasionally tilt toward poetic abstraction, but they remain anchored in Liora's practice and do not devolve into sermonizing. No close echoes of famous lines detected; the synthesis of herbalist, olfactory gift, and philosophical stakes feels unified.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present by line 2 (setup). Liora's choices drive two key beats: bargaining for the seed (middle setup) and arguing before the elders (middle), and the final planting (closure). Her olfactory sensitivity and journaling practice are character-specific traits that enable her argument and final act. Removing her would collapse the story's agency and stakes. Causal pressure: her decision to plant the seed narrows the village's options and forecloses easy refusal. Cost: she must climb higher under watchers' scrutiny and accept the village's future judgment. Irreplaceable: the herbalist role and sensory gift are load-bearing. Strong three-gate integration and beat involvement lift the score into the high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Introduced by line 3 (setup). The seed is handled or referenced in four beats: the opening satchel mention, Liora's reflection on its promise, Maru's recognition and challenge, and the final planting. It shapes Liora's argument ("ask death to bloom where children sleep" → "Let me plant it on the highest branch") and the elders' decision to grant permission with watchers. Causal pressure: the seed's presence forces the elders' choice and crystallizes the village's waiting stance. Closure: the seed pressed into moss triggers the village's collective inhalation—the final image depends on it. Visible cost: Liora climbs higher with watchers; the village's future now hinges on whether the flower "speaks." Irreplaceable: no other object could substitute without rewriting the core conflict. Strong four-beat involvement, high causal pressure, and closure linkage justify the 8.4 score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced by line 13 via grandmother's teaching (setup). The concept shapes Liora's argument in lines 28–30 ("the undercurrent of wisdom in every root and gust") and her goal to make the village "listen to the trembling." It reappears at closure when the village inhales to listen, reweighting the prior stakes. However, the concept operates more as thematic spine than tactical constraint—Liora does not make a mid-story choice explicitly because of it; rather, it names her motivation. Cost connection: the village's future accountability is tied to this idea. Specificity: the phrase is repeated twice by narration and once by Liora, risking slight abstraction. Two-gate presence (setup via grandmother, payoff at closure) and moderate causal pressure place it in the mid-6s; it does not enable a distinct middle beat independently.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Present by line 2 (setup). The olfactory sensitivity enables Liora to "map directions by the faintest resin or crushed leaf," smell the elders before she sees them (line 20), and track "resin ghosts of past storms" during the final climb (line 35). It informs her argument implicitly: her sensory knowledge underwrites her confidence that the seed can answer the village's question. Cost: her acute sensitivity may amplify the corpse flower's stench, though this is not dramatized on the page. Irreplaceable: the trait is character-specific and shapes her perception throughout. Two beats with clear enabling function (elder identification, final climb navigation) and strong specificity justify low-7s placement. It does not constrain a choice with visible tradeoff, so it does not reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Introduced by line 16 (setup). Journaling is referenced twice: the wrapped notebooks with doodled interiors (line 17–18) and Maru's instruction to "take your notebooks" as record-keepers (line 33). It does not drive a key turn independently—Liora's argument and planting would succeed without the notebooks—but it reinforces her character (restless hands, methodical observation) and Maru's requirement adds accountability pressure. Middle development is weak: no on-page choice depends on the act of journaling. Closure: the notebooks will witness the flower's "first breath," but this is deferred rather than paid off in the ending image. Functional but swappable with another record-keeping method. Two-gate presence (setup, minor closure mention) and modest causal role place it in the low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Introduced by lines 17–18 (setup). The custom of doodling on wrapping paper interiors is described as steadying Liora's restless hands and creating a "private forest," metaphorically paralleling the larger canopy setting. However, the custom does not constrain or enable any on-page action—Liora does not doodle in the story, and no choice depends on this practice. It enriches characterization (her need for stillness within motion) but remains ornamental. Closure: not present in the final image. Lyric reprise potential: the "private forest" metaphor could echo the physical forest at closure, but the piece does not make that link explicit. Two-gate presence (setup only; absent from middle and closure) caps eligibility around 4.6 per the gate model; mild thematic resonance lifts it slightly into the high 5s. Swappable with any other personal ritual without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced by line 1 (setup). The treetop village is central to the story's conflict: the elders debate whether to descend, and the village's swaying, creaking physicality embodies the tension between motion and stillness. Setting details (rope bridges, platforms, highest branch) shape Liora's tactics: she must climb to argue her case and then climb higher still to plant the seed. Causal pressure: the village's elevation and precariousness motivate the elders' fear and Liora's counter-proposal. Closure: the highest branch becomes the planting site, and the village's collective inhalation at the end is spatially anchored. Visible cost: Liora's climb under watchers' eyes and the village's future exposure to the flower's stench. Irreplaceable: relocating to a marsh or ground-level setting would collapse the story's central metaphor and stakes. Strong three-gate integration, high causal pressure, and closure linkage justify the 8.1 score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mentioned once in line 10: "Tonight, at the turning of the tide's thought, the elders would decide." The phrase is poetic but vague—it does not establish a legible clock or tighten Liora's decisions on the page. The story unfolds from dawn to dusk within a single day, but no intermediate time pressure is dramatized; Liora's climb and the council meeting do not race against a countdown. Setup only; absent from middle escalation and closure. The metaphorical phrasing ("tide's thought") adds tone but does not function as a tactical constraint. Swappable with "tonight the elders would decide" without structural loss. One-gate presence (setup mention) and no causal work cap the score in the mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Present by line 6 (setup). Liora's desire to "cultivate serenity within motion, stillness inside decay" is the story's emotional spine and drives her argument to plant the corpse flower rather than flee to the marshes. The motivation is dramatized: her restless mind (line 15), her journaling to steady herself (line 16), her willingness to climb higher (line 35), and her final feeling of "fragile serenity growing inside the motion" (line 36). Friction: the fear braided with hunger (line 7) and the visible risk (climbing under watchers, the village's future judgment) create cost. Closure: the final line pays off the motivation when she feels the serenity emerge as the seed is planted. Causal pressure: her desire shapes her argument and actions across three beats (reflection, council argument, planting). Strong three-gate integration, clear conflict between want and cost, and closure payoff justify mid-7s placement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Introduced by line 9: "wildflower hush that steadied her heartbeat." The tone is established early and recurs subtly: the village "listening" (line 8), silence gathering "like pollen, golden and heavy" (line 31), and the final inhalation (line 37). The tone modulates appropriately—lyric and contemplative in the opening, tightening during the council confrontation, then expanding again during the climb. Closure: the village's inhalation and the "fragile serenity" charge the final image with the quiet, attentive quality the tone promises. However, the phrase "wildflower hush" appears only once and is not reprised explicitly at closure; the tonal effect must be inferred from the final beats. Three-gate presence (setup, implicit middle, closure charge) and coherent modulation place it in the low-7s. Strong closure linkage but modest specificity prevent higher placement.</comment>
