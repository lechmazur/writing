<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's voice is distinct and internally consistent—"attentive mystic" who communes with objects—and the hierarchy of values (curiosity, honesty, proof) shapes micro-choices at the frost reading and door-to-door visits. Interiority is concrete and character-particular ("the quarry never sent me into town for nothing"), and the final stance (telling "truthful lies") emerges from prior pressure. Embodiment is strong in sensory action (pressing palm to quartz, angling prism), though the closing renunciation—accepting that belief cannot be proven scientifically—could foreclose a live option more visibly to reach the high 8s.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—layered perception, sensory communion—and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors (Maple Street, quarry, blue sedan) land by ~15% and remain stable. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist crystallizes the stance of "truthful lies," reweighting the premise with conceptual cost (proof remains subjective, belief cannot be mechanized). One meaningful deepening occurs at the frost-reading beat, where the prism refracts "colors never named" and the protagonist acknowledges that "no instrument but myself" can record it. Cost is felt in the acknowledgment that science will ask for numbers he cannot provide, yet he proceeds door to door, embedding the price in each visit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting is purposeful and constrains choice: the quartz arbor sends the protagonist to town (directive function), and the frost on the sedan supplies the method of communion. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the mystic's lens ("bones the mountain had decided to wear outside its skin," "remembered temperatures of emotion"). The prism angled against glass charges the final image by refracting unnameable colors, and spatial choreography (uphill quarry, downhill town, post office, porches) remains clear. Environment does not constrain a peak choice as tightly as needed for 8.5+, but the quartz arbor and frost function as micro-settings that reweight the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: to prove that objects absorb emotions. One meaningful tightening occurs at the frost-reading beat, where the protagonist sees proof but realizes "no instrument but myself" can verify it, narrowing options to subjective testimony. The door-to-door sequence applies this insight with visible cost (people stare at possessions "as though meeting abandoned relatives"), yet the escalation remains accumulative rather than decisively confrontational. Agency is present—the protagonist chooses to tell "truthful lies"—but the final reconfiguration is more stance crystallization than a choice that forecloses a live path with on-page consequence, capping entry into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from action: objects as repositories of unspoken emotion, and the gap between subjective truth and objective proof. The final image—"objects only hold what we refuse to feel"—resonates as a non-literal answer without moralizing, and the door-to-door sequence dramatizes the cost of belief without evidence. The quartz prism reappears with reweighted meaning (from tool to metaphor for the mystic's irreplaceable subjectivity), and the "truthful lies" frame integrates voice, concept, and closure. Minor oversharpening in "that objects only hold what we refuse to feel" edges toward articulation rather than pure implication, keeping it below 8.8.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is singular and controlled: lyric compression, purposeful parallelism ("I told Mrs Harper... I told the mechanic"), and a perceptual signature that refracts the ordinary through communion and metaphor. Psychic distance is stable (close first-person), and internal thought is concrete ("the last time had ended awkwardly at the diner"). Diction stays consistent under pressure, and the final turn—"truthful lies"—is voice-motivated and earned. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the elision of scientific proof is taught early and paid off at closure. The prose compresses at peak beats without obscuring clarity, meeting the 9+ perceptual and rhythmic tests.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied rhythm, high information density, and metaphoric control ("frost feathered its windshield in branching rivers, every vein a sentence"). Sentence openings vary purposefully, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence appear. However, figurative language is dense throughout—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor or elevated image—without pattern-teaching or payoff differentiation, triggering the overwriting check (−0.3 for density). "Inconvenient honesty," "responsible liar," and similar constructions occasionally drift toward paradox for its own sake rather than clarity. No artifacts touch closure, so non-closure deduction applies, capping the score in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—mystic who reads objects' absorbed emotions through frost and crystal—offers a fresh synthesis of divination and material memory. The "attentive mystic" frame and the quartz arbor as directive setting are specific and memorable. However, the final stance (subjective truth vs. objective proof) is a familiar thematic territory, and the door-to-door sequence, while thematically coherent, replays a single beat (reporting moods) without significant variation. The "truthful lies" paradox is voice-specific but not fully transformed into a non-obvious turn. Risk-taking in voice and structure is evident, yet the piece does not quite achieve the inevitable-in-hindsight synthesis required for 8+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The attentive mystic's choices drive two key beats: leaving the arbor after receiving the image and choosing to tell "truthful lies" door to door. Present in setup (title claim), middle (frost reading), and ending (door-to-door visits with final stance). The final choice crystallizes the character's method and reweights the premise, though the door-to-door sequence is more iterative than decisively altering tactics. Observation dominates, but the decision to proceed without proof and to frame subjective truth as "truthful lies" earns mid-6 placement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The glass prism appears in two beats: tucked into coat at the arbor and pressed against the sedan windshield to refract frost into "colors never named." The second use matters causally (enables the communion method), and the prism's irreplaceability is signaled by its role in refracting proof that cannot be recorded. However, it does not return at closure with reweighted meaning or constrain the final choice, limiting it to functional involvement. Early signal and middle development are present; closure linkage is absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Shifted hush" shapes the inciting pressure—dogs pause, clock forgets to ring—and the protagonist recognizes it as "the quiet kept for when assumptions shatter," prompting the journey to the quarry. The hush reappears at mid-descent ("turned the world down from ten to a tentative seven") and again at dusk ("the hush lowered, not oppressive now, but attentive"). It modulates tactics (the protagonist listens more carefully) and charges the final image (the town "leaning closer to hear its own echoes"). The concept is indispensable to the story's pressure arc and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" appears once as self-description ("I was firmly grounded in my purpose") but does not visibly constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The trait is label-only and does not alter tactics when the protagonist faces the gap between proof and belief. No middle development or closure linkage; ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Commune" drives the quarry visit (pressing palm to quartz column) and the frost-reading beat (letting attention soften to hear the sedan's absorbed emotions). Both beats are causally necessary, and the method defines the protagonist's proof-gathering attempt. However, the action could be described with near-synonyms (meditate, attune, listen deeply) without breaking story logic, and it does not reappear with reweighted meaning at closure. Two-beat involvement and middle development present; closure linkage weak; swappability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frost patterns are signaled early (quarry's image of frost on Maple Street car window), enable the central communion beat (reading "remembered temperatures of emotion" through ice whorls and fans), and the mechanics matter—the prism must refract frost to see "colors never named." The method shapes the protagonist's proof attempt and the gap between subjective and objective verification, which drives the final stance. Present in setup, middle causal turn, and thematically active at closure. High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The quartz arbor in mist supplies the inciting directive (the image of frost on Maple Street) and frames the protagonist's method (communion with objects). It appears in setup and returns implicitly at the frost-reading beat ("I could almost hear the quartz arbor humming agreement"). The mist and translucent pillars create atmospheric pressure, and the arbor's role as guide constrains the protagonist's choice of destination. However, it does not reappear physically at closure or supply a resource that alters the ending, limiting it to strong setup and middle enablement without final-image charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"When assumptions shatter" frames the opening beat (the hush, the clock forgetting to ring) and motivates the protagonist's recognition that something requires attention. The timeframe recurs thematically in the door-to-door sequence ("people stood on porches... staring at their possessions as though meeting abandoned relatives") and at closure ("the whole town leaning closer to hear its own echoes"). Time does not tighten decisions via a live clock, but the conceptual moment—assumptions under pressure—shapes the protagonist's stance and charges the final image. Lyric reprise with thematic cost rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation to prove that objects absorb emotions is stated early ("firmly grounded in my purpose"), tested at the frost-reading beat (protagonist sees proof but realizes "no instrument but myself" can verify it), and reweighted at closure (the choice to tell "truthful lies" accepts that proof remains subjective). The friction between wanting scientific validation and accepting personal testimony drives the door-to-door sequence and final stance. Visible cost: the protagonist foregoes objective proof and embraces belief. Strong setup, middle friction, and closure transformation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Truthful lies" is named at closure and integrates tonally throughout: the protagonist communes with nonsense the town rejects, tells stories "so truly that disbelief feels impolite," and ends by replying "with truthful lies: that objects only hold what we refuse to feel." The paradox modulates under pressure—early curiosity, mid-story communion, final acceptance—and charges the ending image. Coherent through turns, purposeful compression, and the tone reweights the premise. High integration, though the explicit naming in the final paragraph slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>
