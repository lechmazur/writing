<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orrin's interiority is concrete and specific—his "accidentally prophetic" trait shapes past and present choices with embodied examples (clouds streaming ads, sea remembering streets). The final choice to "tilt hoarded shadows into the waiting sky" emerges from decades of tending and a forgotten oath, creating earned agency. Internal contradiction appears in his "shadowed elation" and the laughter that "snagged on something sharp," showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Minor slip: the backstory weight (~25%) occasionally pauses present pressure, though it anchors the closure choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Orrin accepts the lighthouse's invitation and aims "hoarded shadows into the waiting sky," crystallizing his decades-old oath with visible cost—abandoning the dead shipping lanes for "unused futures." The Accumulative lens holds: the hum, reflections straightening into his own handwriting, and the fermented promise build density until the beam thickens and invites. Orientation anchors quickly (Orrin, emerald lighthouse, night the last newspaper died). One meaningful deepening when the lighthouse "had been listening the whole time" reweights all prior tending. Cost is conceptual but legible: steering a new dawn replaces the lost mornings of shared print.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse under stars constrains the final choice—its glass throat, lenses salvaged from observatories and server farms, and the beam that "folded, ricocheting inside" all enable Orrin's ability to steer. The glass lantern wick (silicon and sand) catches "ghost-light" and stores oaths in refractions, directly shaping closure. Micro-setting (the beam wrapping him, the open hatch) charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Orrin's professional lens (data-spun oil, total internal reflection, sigils in storm charts). The drowned harbor town and repositioning stars create atmospheric pressure without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Orrin's obsolete routine versus the lighthouse's invitation to "steer something else entirely." The hum introduces one meaningful tightening—it wakes him, straightens the reflections into his own handwriting, and thickens the beam into an invitation. The final choice to "tilt hoarded shadows" is driven by Orrin's agency and the lighthouse's decades-long listening. Visible cost: abandoning the fading curiosity of seagulls and dead shipping lanes to aim at "unused futures." The trade-off between lost print-newspaper mornings and algorithmic feeds sharpens the peak choice. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between shared print-newspaper mornings (ink-stained rustle, coffee over headlines) and isolated algorithmic feeds that "knew their fears too well to contradict them." The glass lantern wick storing oaths in refractions, the lighthouse listening for decades, and Orrin's accidentally prophetic muttering all accumulate into the final non-literal answer: steering a new dawn not along the horizon but "into the hollow sky where unused futures waited." The ending reweights prior material—his forgotten letter, the obsolete beacon, the drowned harbor—without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the "shadowed elation" and the invitation's core, avoiding platitudes while maintaining emotional honesty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited throughout, with Orrin's perceptual signature (storm herald, accidentally prophetic, tending obsolete beacons) filtering every detail. Diction remains consistent—"data-spun oil," "ghost-light," "total internal reflection"—reflecting technical knowledge without register drift. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, winding sentences during the hum's rise compress into shorter, clearer beats at closure ("He took the helm"). No head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture (emerald lighthouse under stars, drowned harbor town) that serves the Accumulative lens. Minor slip: occasional near-uniformity in sentence stems during exposition ("He had once joked," "He had quipped") slightly flattens voice in the middle third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere (the wick grown from silicon and sand, the lenses turning starlight sideways). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at closure ("Laughing again, with a steadier, stranger joy, Orrin took the helm"). No paraphrase loops or major scaffold. Minor overwriting appears in the middle third: "the beam that wrapped around him thickened, a column of almost-solid light pointing not toward the dead shipping lanes but straight up through the open hatch" stacks modifiers without pattern-teaching. Filter verbs ("he sensed, rather than heard") occasionally dull immediacy. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong, with the final image recharging prior motifs (glass, light, shadows) cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of obsolete lighthouse keeper, accidentally prophetic trait, glass lantern wick storing oaths, and the death of print newspapers feels specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms a familiar "lonely keeper" trope through the data-spun oil, total internal reflection optics, and the lighthouse as listener. Emotional truth anchors freshness: the contrast between shared mornings and algorithmic isolation avoids generic templates. The final choice to steer unused futures rather than dead shipping lanes arises inevitably from prior particulars (the forgotten letter, decades of tending, the hum). Minor limitation: the "drowned harbor town" and "last print newspaper" setting touches on familiar post-collapse territory without fully transforming it through verifiable lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orrin shapes the inciting beat (wakes to the hum), the middle recognition (lighthouse listening the whole time), and the closure choice (takes the helm, tilts shadows into the sky). His accidentally prophetic trait and storm-herald role pressure the final image. Early signal, two distinct beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. Swappability low—his specific role as tender and his oath anchor the story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass lantern wick appears in three beats: burning data-spun oil (routine), flaring without flame when the hum rises (inciting), and swallowing oaths in refractions (closure mechanics). It enables the final act by storing Orrin's letter and the lighthouse's listening. Specificity high (silicon and sand, tuned to catch ghost-light). Early signal, beat involvement across the arc, and closure participation qualify it for the high band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "otherworldly routine" frames the opening (decades of tending, reading omens in trapped stars) and is disrupted by the hum, creating the stakes. It reappears at closure when Orrin abandons the routine to steer unused futures. The concept constrains the before-state and makes the after-state legible with cost. Early signal, middle pressure (the hum changes the script), and closure participation present. Causal work solid but secondary to the lighthouse and wick.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "accidentally prophetic" trait is demonstrated through two past examples (clouds streaming ads, sea remembering streets) that establish character and lend credibility to the lighthouse listening. It pressures the middle beat when Orrin recognizes his handwriting in the reflections. Closure linkage indirect—his prophetic oaths fermented into the hum. Early signal and one middle beat present; closure participation oblique. Swappability moderate—another trait could serve similar narrative function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Steer" anchors the core metaphor (he steered seagulls, now steers the dawn) and defines the climax: "Orrin took the helm and helped the emerald lighthouse tilt its hoarded shadows into the waiting sky." The action differentiates the closure from passive witnessing. Early setup (nightly tending as steering), middle recognition (the beam asks him to steer "something else entirely"), and closure execution all hinge on this verb. Irreplaceability high—the shift from steering dead lanes to steering futures is the story's spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Total internal reflection" appears once in the middle third, describing how the lenses turn starlight sideways and gather weight. It signals the mechanics enabling the closure (light folding, ricocheting, storing oaths). Setup present but development limited—the method is explained but not tested or altered mid-scene. Closure linkage oblique: the hoarded light is tilted at the end, but the reflection mechanism itself isn't foregrounded. Swappability moderate; another optical metaphor could serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse supplies the glass throat (Orrin's dwelling), the lenses (enabling light manipulation), the open hatch (exit for the beam), and the stone that hums and listens. It constrains every choice—Orrin cannot steer without it, and the lighthouse's invitation is the inciting force. Early signal (title, opening line), beat involvement across the arc (the hum, the beam thickening, the helm), and closure participation (tilt shadows into sky). Irreplaceability high—remove the lighthouse and the story collapses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last print newspaper" establishes the world state (algorithmic feeds replaced shared mornings) and motivates Orrin's oath decades prior. It pressures the thematic question at closure. Early signal (opening line) and closure resonance present (reflecting on lost mornings versus new dawn). Middle development weak—time doesn't tighten decisions during the hum sequence. The decades-long gap between oath and fulfillment adds weight but isn't a live clock. Lyric reprise lifts it past ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is dramatized in the forgotten letter, reflected in decades of tending the obsolete beacon, and enacted at closure when Orrin tilts hoarded shadows into the sky. Conflict present: he laughs with "shadowed elation" and feels something "sharp in his chest," showing friction between hope and cost. Early setup (the letter), middle recognition (the promise fermented), and closure execution all channel this desire. Cost visible—he abandons the old routine and dead lanes. One small friction: the motivation is partly told in backstory rather than solely tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Shadowed elation" appears in the opening descriptor (storm herald), the first laugh ("not with joy exactly, but with the shadowed elation of someone who has waited"), and the final laugh ("steadier, stranger joy"). Tone modulates across turns—from routine to surprise to recognition to commitment—while holding the core ambivalence. The tone charges the final image: Orrin's laughter as he takes the helm blends hope and the cost of abandoning the past. Coherent through pressure and integral to closure.</comment>
