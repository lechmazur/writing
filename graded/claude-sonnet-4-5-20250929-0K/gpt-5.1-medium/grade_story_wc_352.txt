<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is coherent—his "prism-minded" training and pursuit of forbidden combinations drive him forward—but interiority leans heavily on exposition rather than contradictory impulses in scene. Embodied emotion appears ("racing pulse," "prickle on his skin"), yet peak moments describe the archivist's thoughts more than force live micro-choices between competing desires. The chains' "assessing" and his "tempered fire of curiosity" read as told qualities rather than dramatized struggle. No on-page secondary character applies immediate pressure, so relationship bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (archivist, eastern wall, monthly gravity inversion). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers threshold crossings, symbolic arrangements, and atmospheric density until the final codex moment reconfigures the archivist's memory with "newly nested combinations." Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he reads the arrangements, gains the knowledge, and returns, foreclosing the option to remain ignorant; cost is conceptual (he now bears "watchful stars" of responsibility). One meaningful deepening occurs when the chains dissolve, granting access. Minor causality smoothness: the chains' logic (tasting "tempered fire") is asserted rather than tested on-page, but the lens holds and closure lands with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Spatial choreography is vivid and coherent: the archivist glides through mist veils, pushes off rock, crosses thresholds marked by sensory cues (prickle, metallic taste). The grotto's "columns like frozen smoke," "shelves carved from basalt," and "chains of calcified ink" are purposeful and filtered through his professional gaze. The margin doodle unfolds into "corridors, spirals, tiny staircases," constraining his path and enabling discovery. Time pressure (the waning hour) forces urgency at the climax. The body and environment charge the final image when "dust began to rise" signals gravity's return, compelling him to close the codex and retreat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: to find and parse the forgotten combinations before the hour expires. Pressure accumulates through threshold crossings and the chains' assessment, culminating in the codex reveal. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chains dissolve, granting access with the cost of proving his "tempered fire." The archivist's agency is limited to reading and returning; no on-page reversal forces a trade-off between competing goods. Cost is conceptual (he now holds dangerous knowledge), legible in "watchful stars" settling "behind his eyes," but the lack of a contested choice or visible sacrifice caps the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge as burden, vigilance as inheritance—emerges organically from the "seeds of vigilance" and the archivist's role as guardian. The codex's "arrangements" (not words) and the chains' moral test (rejecting cruelty and laziness) avoid overt thesis. The final image of "watchful stars" settling behind his eyes and the doodle lying "quiet…its work complete" offers a resonant, non-literal answer: knowledge is both won and borne. Minor slip: "scorched away laziness and cruelty alike" borders on thesis statement, and the piece occasionally leans into abstractions ("forgotten arrangements," "latent blaze") that risk portentousness, but the concrete action and image work hold the thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, with purposeful compression and elevated diction ("clandestinely luminous," "prism-minded," "serpentine grotto") that reads as consistent voice rather than drift. Perceptual signature is clear: the archivist notices thresholds, patterns, and symbolic structures. The prose teaches its lyric rhythm early and sustains it. Minor friction: some passages verge on expository interiority ("His own mind, split like a prism, had been trained to refract such patterns") that tells training rather than showing thought under pressure. Filter verbs ("felt the threshold effects shiver," "tasting that tempered fire") appear but remain voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("wall thinned like skin over a racing heart," "columns rose like frozen smoke," "chains of faint lightning") and mostly coherent, but the accumulation across nearly every sentence risks overwriting without pattern-taught payoff. Mixed register: "clandestinely luminous" and "prism-minded" feel elevated relative to the moment's urgency. Paraphrase loop detected: "forgotten combinations" and "where forgotten combinations hide" recur without added pressure. Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports the lyric mode, but the density in peak beats (chains dissolving, codex opening) does not always advance new information. Template cadence minor: several "He [verb]" stems cluster in the middle third. Apply −0.6 for density and loop friction combined, routed here per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—gravity inversion as threshold to a hidden archive—is fresh and executed with specificity (stalactite passwords, calcified-ink chains, margin doodle as map). The "seeds of vigilance" and moral-testing chains offer a non-obvious synthesis of fantasy and ethical calculus. Emotional specificity appears in the archivist's "narrower and sharper than patience" motivation. Minor derivative note: the hidden-library-with-forbidden-knowledge frame echoes familiar fantasy templates; transformation lies in the execution (gravity mechanic, sensory thresholds, the doodle's unfolding) rather than a bold structural or moral risk. No proximity issues. Risk-taking in lyric compression and patterned diction elevates within band (+0.2).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present throughout; his choices to follow the doodle, glide through veils, and open the codex drive key turns. Setup early, development in threshold navigation, payoff when he reads and internalizes the arrangements. Causal pressure moderate: his actions enable discovery but are not contested or forced into trade-offs. Cost connection weak: his agency is more observer than decider. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, causal pressure +0.6, swappability −0.5 (another archivist could perform the same moves). Band: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup in opening paragraph ("margin doodle in his hand"), development when it "unfolded into corridors, spirals, and tiny staircases," payoff in final line ("the margin doodle lay quiet on its page, its work complete"). Three beats: warming in recognition, unfolding as map, lying quiet at closure. Causal pressure high: its unfolding enables navigation. Closure linkage strong: the final image reweights it from active guide to fulfilled artifact. Early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.2, cost +0.4, irreplaceability +0.6; total pushes toward 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup oblique (mentioned in paragraph describing the grotto's history), development as abstract context (patterns "designed to awaken when certain combinations aligned"), payoff when he reads "arrangements" in the codex. Present in closure but more as theme echo than active stake-shaper. Two gates (development, payoff). Development beat +0.4, closure participation +0.5, causal pressure weak +0.3, ornamental in middle passages −0.6, swappability −0.4 (could be "ancient safeguards" without loss). Band: 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup early ("clandestinely luminous beneath the veil of dust"), mentioned again when chains brighten ("clandestinely luminous links"), payoff weak (no final reprise or cost tied to luminosity itself). Two gates (setup, development). Does not constrain a choice; functions as atmospheric descriptor. Early +0.4, one beat +0.4, ornamental use −0.8, label-only trait −0.3, swappability −0.6 (could be "faintly glowing" with no story change). Band: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup in title and opening ("reenter the stacks that were not supposed to exist"), development when he "fell upward into the serpentine grotto," payoff implicit when he "emerged into the ordinary stacks." Three gates. Causal pressure extreme: without reentry, no discovery occurs. Closure shaped by successful return. Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.6, closure +1.3, irreplaceability +0.8, cost +0.5. Band: 8.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup when "threshold effects shiver along his tendons," development across veils ("crossing into a layer where sound traveled backwards," metallic taste), payoff when he moves "back toward the thinning wall." Three gates. Mechanics matter: thresholds enable passage and add texture. Causal pressure moderate: crossings allow progress but do not force contested choices. Early +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal +0.8, closure +0.6, swappability −0.4 (could be "magical barriers" with minor edits). Band: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup when he "fell upward into the serpentine grotto in mist," development as he navigates columns, veils, and basalt shelves, payoff when "dust began to rise from the grotto floor" signaling time's end. Three gates. Constrains navigation and supplies the codex's location. Causal pressure high: the grotto's structure (hovering shelves, mist veils) shapes his path and urgency. Early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.3, closure +1.0, irreplaceability +0.7. Band: 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup in second paragraph ("single hour each month when gravity inverts"), development tracked when "dust began to rise…as the hour waned," payoff when gravity reclaims direction and he exits. Three gates. Tightens decisions: he must finish before the hour ends. Clock is dramatized, not merely declared. Early +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal +1.1, closure +0.9, cost +0.4, specificity +0.5, late middle mention −0.2. Band: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup explicit ("to find where forgotten combinations hide"), development implicit as he follows the doodle, payoff when he reads and internalizes the combinations. Three gates. Desire is declared more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices; no on-page friction between competing wants or costs during the search. Early +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure +0.8, causal +0.5, told-only in peak moments −0.7, swappability −0.3. Band: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup in opening third ("latent blaze of curiosity"), reprise when chains taste "that tempered fire," payoff when combinations "settle behind his eyes like watchful stars." Lyric-resonance model: seed and charged return. Coherent through turns, modulates with pressure (cool analytical early, heated assessment mid, watchful at closure). Early +0.5, two touches +0.9, closure reweight +1.0, modulation +0.6, static mood patches −0.4, label reliance −0.3. Band: 6.3.</comment>
