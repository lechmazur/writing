<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("luminous skeptic" manifests in the tendency to doubt beautifully, to treat sacred routes as question marks), and the resolving stance—standing in the clearing, waiting to see if homecoming begins—reads as earned endurance with palpable cost. Internal contradiction operates: the skeptic chosen for doubt yet sent inward, rebellion coexisting with compliance. However, the piece skews heavily reflective; micro-choices in the present (kneeling to touch footprints, holding up the amber) remain modest gestures rather than decisions that foreclose paths, and the final stance crystallizes options without a visible trade-off that alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by ~120 words (tower, spring, after first contact, pilgrimage directive). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases as footprints multiply, equations curl in their edges, and the spiral clearing gathers statue path, moss patterns, and the amber into a charged final image. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the narrator stands in the center, waiting, homecoming poised between thunder and bronze quiet—with conceptual cost legible (the species at the threshold, decision unmade). One tightening occurs when footprints triple and equations appear, reweighting the pilgrimage from rote path to chain reaction. Cost is felt but oblique; no concrete forfeiture or agency shift lands on the page, keeping this shy of high bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, sculpture path, and fly amber function as micro-setting that charges the final image: the amber's dull refusal mirrors the narrator's stance, the spiral clearing's bare earth becomes the palm awaiting chemistry. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("bronze quiet," "ocher comma," moss "like old handwriting"), and the environment subtly guides choice—footprints double and converge, the hill descent structures the pilgrimage's rhythm. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from tower stairs down the overgrown path to the clearing. The amber as recurring object constrains perception (its refusal to pulse comforts more than any model) and charges closure when it stays cool in the narrator's hand at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understand the chemistry of homecoming to tune the species before visitors return—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens once when footprints multiply and equations appear in their edges, deepening the pilgrimage from physical route to conceptual chain reaction. Agency at closure is limited: the narrator stands and waits rather than choosing or renouncing with visible cost. The fly amber's refusal and the spiral clearing reconfigure meaning, but no on-page reversal forecloses a live option or forces a trade-off. The cost is conceptual (the species clinging to "almost") but not dramatized as a price paid by the protagonist in this scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—belonging, thresholds, the chemistry of return—emerges from particulars: the fly trapped mid-flight, the world at the edge of its leaf, homecoming as chain reaction rather than single event. The final image (standing in the clearing, rain steaming, amber cool, waiting for thunder or bronze quiet) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image (the amber's refusal, the sculptures' eroded faces, the footprints as "equation of absence"). One minor slip: "bronze quiet" is defined mid-text in a way that edges toward thematic statement ("the mood that had settled over the world"), and the phrase "the comfort of almost" in the penultimate paragraph comes close to articulating the thesis rather than letting the image do the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices "tremor of meaning under every variable," sees moss as "old handwriting," and filters the world through academic rebellion and metaphor drawn from chemistry and astronomy. Diction remains within the focalizer's plausible lexicon (xenochemists, reagents, kinetics of cultural change) without unmotivated register shifts. Free indirect style is clean. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong: shorter clauses at the closing beat ("rain steaming from my coat, fly amber cool in my hand") compress without losing texture. One minor artifact: "bronze quiet" receives a three-part definition that reads slightly over-explained, and "luminous skeptic" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs, creating a loop that slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high and rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify, and figurative language (moss as handwriting, amber as ocher comma, homecoming as chain reaction) charges perception without overwriting most beats. Clarity and momentum hold. Two line-level issues lower the score: "bronze quiet" receives a three-part catalogue definition mid-text that stalls the beat, and the phrase "luminous skeptic" appears in both the third and ninth paragraphs, creating a paraphrase loop. The final paragraph compresses effectively ("rain steaming from my coat, fly amber cool in my hand"), but the mid-text definition and loop apply a −0.6 penalty in Q7 per the template and paraphrase-loop checks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of pilgrimage-as-chemistry, alien contact as catalyst for inward journey, and the fly amber as fossilized threshold is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms a familiar first-contact frame by routing the narrative inward rather than outward, and the voice (academic rebellion, metaphor drawn from science) feels particular to this narrator. Emotional complexity (skeptic sent to doubt beautifully, ritual as performance yet capable of revealing hidden math) avoids template resolution. One friction: the core arc—skeptic walks path, contemplates homecoming, waits—remains contemplative without a bold structural or perspectival choice that heightens stakes. Risk-taking is present in the lyric accumulation and chemistry metaphor but does not escalate pressure or foreclose options on the page, keeping this in the solid mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Luminous skeptic is signaled early (Academy insult kept as medal, chosen to go because of beautiful doubt) and returns in the narrator's resolve to treat the sacred route as question mark. The trait constrains perception (suspecting grand performance, comforted by the amber's refusal) but does not drive a key turn or on-page choice that alters tactics. The narrator's skepticism informs interiority throughout but remains observational; no decision at closure traces to the skeptic stance with visible cost. Present in setup and development, absent from closure action. Two-gate fulfill pushes this to mid-5s; lack of causal pressure or closure linkage caps further rise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fly amber is introduced early (thumb-sized bead given by visitors, meant to resonate where history is thick), handled in at least three beats (holding it up leaving the tower, glancing at it halfway down, cool in hand at closure), and its refusal to pulse reweights meaning: the trapped insect "still refused to believe" comforts the narrator more than theory, and the amber's coolness at the ending charges the final image of waiting. Setup, development, and closure gates are met. The object enables the narrator's stance (academic rebellion validated by the amber's refusal) and contributes specificity to the closure image. Not indispensable—story logic would survive its removal—but causally active across beats and closure-present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Artificial pilgrimage frames the directive, stakes, and structure: the Council sends the narrator inward to understand homecoming's chemistry before welcoming visitors. The concept shapes tactics (follow dusty footprints, treat sacred route as question mark) and recurs in the realization that homecoming is a chain reaction, not single event. Present in setup (Council directive), development (footprints multiply, equations appear), and closure (standing in the clearing, waiting for the chemistry to begin). The pilgrimage's artificial nature charges the narrator's skeptical stance and the final poise between thunder and bronze quiet. Causal pressure is clear; the concept narrows the question the story asks and reweights it at the end. Could score higher with a more decisive closure turn tied directly to the pilgrimage's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Academically rebellious is signaled early (refusing to bow to equations unless meaning trembles underneath, chosen for beautiful doubt) and returns when the narrator resolves to treat the sacred route as question mark "even in assignment." The trait constrains perception and stance but does not enable or constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. It colors interiority (suspecting performance, comforted by the amber's refusal) but remains label-adjacent; no moment shows the rebellion foreclosing an option or forcing a trade-off. Present in setup and development, weak in closure linkage. Two-gate fulfill and thematic contribution lift this to mid-5s; lack of dramatized cost caps higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Converge appears explicitly in the Council's goal ("converge the scattered frequencies of our species") and physically when footprints, statues, and moss patterns "finally converged into a single spiral clearing" at closure. The convergence is more spatial metaphor than action that drives turns; the narrator does not choose to converge or resist convergence with visible cost. The clearing's convergence charges the final image but does not redefine options or tactics on the page. Present in setup (Council's stated aim) and closure (physical convergence), absent from middle development as protagonist-driven action. Functional and closure-present but replaceable with minor edits; swappable with "gather" or "unite."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Via dusty footprints left on an overgrown sculpture path is signaled early (earlier pilgrim left footprints, narrator told to follow them) and structures the journey: the narrator follows the prints down the hill, kneels to touch them when they multiply, and sees equations curl in their edges. The method shapes attempts (following rather than forging a new route) and contributes to the realization that homecoming is a chain, each step altering reagents. Setup, development, and closure gates met (footprints converge into the spiral clearing). The means matter to tactics and meaning but do not constrain a choice with felt cost; the narrator could proceed without them. Solid causal role across beats and closure-present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rainwashed tower in spring is the starting point, signaled in the opening line and anchored with sensory detail (moss in runnels, spiral stairs, old observatory). The tower supplies the launching point for the sculpture path and frames the pilgrimage's beginning. Spring's "first true" designation and the tower's history (listening to stars, now footsteps) contribute atmosphere and theme but do not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Present in setup, absent from middle development and closure (action moves to the path and clearing). Functional anchor but replaceable; any landmark could serve the same structural role. Setup gate only; missing middle and closure participation caps this at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>After making first contact is the framing timeframe, signaled early (after we made first contact, narrator was sent inward) and recurs when the narrator recalls the visitors giving the amber "when we first spoke." The timeframe establishes stakes (understand homecoming before visitors return) but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; no live clock or deadline alters moves. The bronze quiet mood "since we learned we were not alone" deepens atmosphere. Present in setup and thematically woven through development, but the timeframe does not pressure the narrator's choices in this single scene. Two-gate fulfill (setup, thematic development) without closure tightening; lack of live clock or tactical constraint keeps this in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>To understand the chemistry of homecoming is the Council's directive and the narrator's stated mission, signaled early and recurring in the realization that homecoming is "not a single reaction but a chain." The motivation shapes the journey's purpose and the narrator's interpretive lens (seeing equations in footprints, thinking in reagents and kinetics). Present in setup (Council's charge), development (realization mid-descent), and closure (waiting to see if the chemistry will begin). The desire is told more than dramatized; no on-page friction between wanting to understand and cost of that pursuit. The motivation frames stakes but does not drive a conflicted choice. Three-gate fulfill and thematic coherence lift this to mid-6s; lack of dramatized friction or visible trade-off caps higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Bronze quiet is introduced early (the narrator senses it leaving the tower), defined mid-text (color of old telescopes, silence of cooled metal, the mood since we learned we were not alone), and returns in the closing sentence ("waited to see whether the chemistry of homecoming would begin with thunder or with more bronze quiet"). The tone is coherent through turns and modulates subtly: descriptive early, reflective in the middle, charged at closure when thunder and bronze quiet become the alternatives. The tone shapes the final image's poise and reconfigures the earlier mood into a live question. Setup, development, and closure gates met. The tone constrains emotional register and charges the ending. Strong integration; could reach higher with less mid-text definition and more implicit modulation.</comment>
