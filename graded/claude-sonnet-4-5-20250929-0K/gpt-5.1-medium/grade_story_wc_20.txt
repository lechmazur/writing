<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eira's internal landscape is rendered through distinct, embodied perception—"carrying her refusal like another lantern"—and her motives are layered (grief, alchemical purpose, defiance of finality). The brother Arlen exists only in memory and vision, so relationship pressure is oblique; Eira's choice to "offer her own name as solder" shows contradictory impulses (staying/going) acting simultaneously. Minor slip: "balanced alchemist" remains a label without on-page demonstration of what balance costs her in this moment, and the final renaming feels more conceptual than a visceral forfeiture that narrows future options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates pressure through layered imagery (coin, crucible, vapor-vision, crack, new sign) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the thirteenth sign and Eira's dual recognition reweight Arlen's disappearance from "lost" to "still walking, path uncharted." Cost is conceptual and felt—she steps back "with a name tempered but unclosed"—though the price could be more viscerally legible on the page (what exactly has she foreclosed for herself?).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: "rust to mirrored ink," the "coal that never quite died," puddles bending reflections "like time refusing a straight line." The crucible functions as micro-setting, actively constraining Eira's ritual and producing the vapor-vision that charges the climax. Spatial choreography is clear (doorway, floor, satchel beside bowl, touch rim, step back) and the setting's history (bells, coins, anchors, astrolabes) directly supports the thematic weight of names.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redemption of Arlen's name and story—is signaled early and tightens through Eira's ritual: placing the coin, whispering the amendment, witnessing the crack and new sign. The deepening is accumulative rather than a sharp reversal; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as each step reweights meaning. Agency manifests in her choice to "offer her own name as solder," and the cost is conceptual (dual identity, "unclosed" name), though a more immediate forfeiture—something she loses in the room or must leave behind—would raise the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the coin's zodiac signs, the foundry's history of naming instruments, and Eira's kintsugi intention: "Names were molds, and the world poured us through them until our edges matched their expectation, even if our molten selves screamed to overflow." The final image—a thirteenth sign, two footprints facing opposite horizons—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without sermon. The "luminous regret" and recognition of dual presence ("the one who had stayed and the one who had secretly gone") charge the closure without declaring a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: "reflection bending around puddles like time refusing a straight line," "promises did not melt when broken; they corroded, clung, and changed the name of whoever carried their rust." Single POV holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Minor density concern: some lines tip toward elevated register that risks distancing the reader during peak beats ("bordering on factually mystical," "kintsugi intentions of broken oaths"), though the diction remains internally coherent and the closure image lands with clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm is strong and sentence openings vary; figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Two accumulation issues prevent higher scoring: (a) paraphrase loop in the middle section—"promises did not melt" / "they corroded, clung, and changed" restates across two sentences without added pressure, and (b) elevated register in several high-pressure beats ("bordering on factually mystical," "projection that felt as precise as any ledger, terrible and tender") drifts slightly outside Eira's embodied lexicon. No loops touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.6 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemical practice, kintsugi philosophy, and zodiac symbolism feels purposeful and specific to Eira's voice; the "thirteenth sign shaped like two footprints facing opposite horizons" is a non-obvious image that grows from prior material. The piece takes a familiar grief-and-search premise and transforms it through the lens of names as molds and the protagonist's refusal to finalize loss. Minor limitation: the alchemy-as-metaphor frame is not entirely novel, and the story might score higher if the coin's mechanics or the foundry's remaining forge introduced a riskier constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eira frames the piece (setup), makes the ritual choice to place the coin and whisper the amendment (middle beat), and steps back into the night with a transformed name (closure). Her decisions alter the coin's state and reweight Arlen's story, meeting the causal test. The "balanced alchemist" label itself does not constrain a choice with visible cost—her balance is thematic rather than mechanically tested—so the score trends mid-band rather than high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears early (setup), is placed in the crucible and sings (middle beat), cracks along its sigils, and emits molten light that sketches the thirteenth sign (closure). It is handled in multiple beats, its state evolves causally, and its properties (twelve signs, precision "judicial") are specific and irreplaceable. Strong integration; scores in the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kintsugi intentions are articulated mid-story: "the alchemy she practiced now: not the transmutation of metals, but the kintsugi intentions of broken oaths and shattered expectations." The concept shapes her goal (fuse scars with understanding) and the final image (cracked coin with new sign) enacts it. However, the piece tells the concept more than it demonstrates a visible tradeoff or tactic constrained by kintsugi logic on the page, so it trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is used once to describe the coin's presence. The trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost; it reads as atmospheric label rather than a mechanical property that alters Eira's choices. Score trends low-mid.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Redeem" is signaled early ("she would redeem the word itself"), drives Eira's ritual action in the crucible, and shapes the ending (redefining "Wanderer" and creating the thirteenth sign). The action is causally central and not easily swappable. Solid integration across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"By exploring limits" appears once in backstory about the zodiac virtues ("by exploring limits without losing balance"). It does not shape Eira's tactics on the page or constrain her choices; the method is thematic rather than procedural. Score trends low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry is anchored early, its crucible enables the ritual, and its history (bells, coins, anchors, astrolabes) directly supports the theme of naming. The coal that "never quite died" and the steaming water are tactile resources that shape Eira's action. The setting pressures and resources are integral; strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the search party disbands") is signaled in the title and opening paragraph, frames Eira's decision to turn toward the foundry, and primes her refusal to accept finality. However, the clock does not tighten her tactics within the scene; the ritual unfolds without visible time pressure. Lyric reprise (early signal → ending stance) earns mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation ("to understand the weight of names") is stated early, drives every beat of the ritual, and is tested in Eira's choice to "offer her own name as solder." The desire is dramatized through action (placing coin, whispering amendment, touching crucible) and the cost is felt in the final image ("name tempered but unclosed"). Strong causal linkage and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is established in the opening ("sky the color of cooled iron," "refusal like another lantern") and sustained through the vapor-vision ("terrible and tender") to the ending ("luminous regret she recognized herself"). The tone modulates with pressure—cooled iron to molten light—and charges the final image of dual footprints. Coherent and purposeful across the arc.</comment>
