<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio's interior landscape is consistently rendered through embodied sensation—"like wreckage in black water," the ferry memory surfacing through physical recall. His decisions to engage the equipment and conceptualize the city-wide system arise organically from established trauma and prior expertise. The characterization avoids diagnostic label-speak and maintains contradictory impulses (bewilderment vs. purpose, isolation vs. connection) acting simultaneously. Minor deduction: the shift from passive survivor to active designer could show one more micro-choice with visible cost before the final crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered images of silence, memory fragments, and the heat-mapping system until the final vision of architecture-as-orchestra reconfigures the opening bewilderment into purposeful endurance. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: Lio's body becomes "the first instrument," a renunciation of hearing in favor of felt vibration with the cost legible in "wrecked and waterlogged." Orientation anchors clearly by line 60 (conservatory, post-capsize, tuning forks). One small gap: the transition from individual grief profiles to city-wide deployment compresses quickly; one additional tightening beat showing a tactical constraint would firm the escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting and constraint: frozen ivy, glass that chimes faintly, the cold sensor-gloves all press against Lio's choices and charge the final image of "architectures themselves become orchestras." The Quiet's sensory deprivation is filtered through his professional bias (tuning forks, actuator rigs, heat-mapping monitors) rather than tourist description. Spatial choreography remains coherent across equipment shelves, glass table, roof, and implied city beyond. The conservatory's transformation from concert venue to laboratory directly enables the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating silence into felt music—is signaled early through the note and tuning forks, then tightened when Lio triggers Grief 1 and feels the glass chime in his ribs, narrowing his options from passive survival to active rectification. The escalation is textural: sensor-gloves, actuator rig, city-wide vision each deepen the commitment with the final cost clear: "his own body, wrecked and waterlogged, would be the first instrument." Agency is renunciation with purpose. Minor note: the middle beat (Wonder 3 profile) adds texture but does not introduce new friction; one obstacle or failed attempt would add a second pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: tuning forks that "shivered without a whisper," the capsized ferry as metaphor for inverted reality, "unshaken marvels" reweighted from acoustic instruments to vibrational proxies. The final image—Lio's body as teaching instrument—answers the thematic question of how connection persists after communication fails, without stating a moral. The heat-mapping conceit integrates sensory loss with emotional cartography. One phrase, "what it can still rectify," borders on prompt echo but is anchored in Lio's handwriting and immediately dramatized through action, avoiding full thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is consistently third-limited with tight psychic distance, diction matching Lio's technical background ("actuator rig," "thermal smudges," "waveforms") while maintaining lyric compression ("flames forgot how to roar," "waterline forever at his lips"). POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective: he notices vibrational proxies (glass chime, rib-felt wave) over visual spectacle. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Minor texture note: two instances of "shivered/shudder" within close lines create slight echo, and "silently expressive" in the doctors' scene and again at story's end risks template feel, though both are functional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening fragments ("Every pane trembled...") give way to longer accumulative structures at closure without becoming sluggish. Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "tuning fork case someone had found knotted to his lifejacket" anchors object, memory gap, and survival in one beat). Two minor artifacts lower from 8.6: "like wreckage in black water" and "like a curtain lifting" are near-stock metaphors, and the phrase "silently expressive" appears twice with slight redundancy. The final paragraph's longer syntax supports the conceptual expansion without losing propulsion. No paraphrase loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic silence with heat-mapping synaesthesia and survivor guilt is specific and non-obvious; the premise transforms "sound loss" from horror trope into a tactile communication puzzle. The Quiet's physics-blink setup risks genre familiarity, but the tuning-fork–heat-sensor combination and the architectural orchestra endpoint feel fresh. Risk-taking in structure (heavy reflection, lyric compression) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The "unshaken marvels" motif threads through without becoming overtly symbolic. Deduction for one proximity concern: "God put a finger to His mouth" is a semi-stock image for imposed silence; replacing it would lift originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lio as capsize survivor frames the inciting bewilderment, drives the middle choice to activate the equipment, and is explicitly reweighted in the final image ("his own body, wrecked and waterlogged, would be the first instrument"). Present in setup, middle agency, and closure. The survival status constrains his sensory access (deaf, trauma-fogged memory) and enables the heat-mapping pivot. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tuning fork case appears in four beats: discovery knotted to lifejacket (setup with mystery), reading the note (inciting choice), placing fork on actuator rig (middle turn), and implied in the final city-wide vision. Its nested forks and handwritten note supply both immediate tool and thematic anchor. The case's physical properties (dark velvet, twelve silver forks) recur with reweighted meaning: from archive to active instrument. Strong causal and closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" is seeded early ("believed in unshaken marvels"), recurs at the midpoint ("vast choirs of unshaken marvels"), and implicitly charges the closure (instruments that "had not forgotten how to vibrate"). It shapes Lio's motivation and reweights from past ideal to present method. The phrase risks abstraction but is concretized through the tuning forks and actuators. Present across beats and tied to closure, though not irreplaceable—"persistent instruments" could serve similarly. Solid but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" appears twice: doctors' faces and Lio's final circuits. It labels the paradox of communication without sound but does not directly constrain a choice or enable a tactic. The attribute is thematically consistent and colors the setting, yet remains somewhat ornamental—Lio's choices would proceed identically if the phrase were removed. Functional label without hard causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Rectify" appears in the handwritten note ("what it can still rectify") as the inciting imperative and echoes in the final vision of city-wide symphonies that might make survivors "feel less alone." The action drives the middle turn (activating the system) and defines the closure stance. Swapping "rectify" for "repair" or "restore" would slightly soften thematic edge but not break the structure. Strong integration with visible cost (his body as instrument), just short of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is introduced via the note diagram in beat two, explained through sensor-gloves and monitors in beat three, tested with Grief 1 and Wonder 3 profiles in beat four, and projected onto the city's architecture in the closure. The method's mechanics (thermal smudges, color-fields, actuator vibrations) are on-page and shape every tactical choice after discovery. Removing it would collapse the entire causal spine. High specificity, beat involvement, and closure necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is named in the opening line, supplies spatial anchors (glass roof that chimes, equipment shelves, frozen ivy), and is explicitly recast in the closure as prototype for city-wide "architectures themselves become orchestras." Its acoustic properties (glass amplifying faint vibrations) enable the proof-of-concept. The setting constrains Lio's initial isolation and provides the tools that unlock his solution. Strong setup, middle resource use, and closure transformation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after noise becomes impossible" is established in beat one (The Quiet, ferry capsize "hours ago"), shapes every sensory constraint (no sound, reliance on vibration), and directly motivates the heat-mapping system as alternative. The Quiet is not a vague backdrop—it removes Lio's prior vocation (tuning orchestras) and forces the pivot to felt music. The finality of the silence ("air refuses to sing") charges the closure's cost. Essential temporal condition with causal force across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to translate silence into music is seeded in the note ("remember why we built this place"), dramatized through Lio's triggering of grief and wonder profiles, and crystallized in the closing vision of architecture as orchestra. The want (restore connection) conflicts with cost (his wrecked body as instrument, isolation as first volunteer). Desire drives every choice post-discovery and is inseparable from closure. High causal integration and visible sacrifice.</comment>
