<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's proprioceptive hyperawareness is embodied consistently through concrete sensory detail ("shoulders brace on their own," "ribs remembered compressions"). Interior contradiction operates effectively in the final choice—the body's defensive brace transforms into a preparatory one, marking agency through embodied shift rather than stated epiphany. Backstory is substantial but anchored to present stimuli (the mask strap, the forest hum) and tilts the present stance via micro-choices throughout. Minor weaknesses: some interiority edges toward diagnostic register ("proprioceptively enhanced balance") and the final paragraph's "angle chosen instead of imposed" approaches explaining what the prior embodiment already showed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (interrogation survivor), where (ultraviolet forest), and when (post-anesthesia) by the second paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered sensory detail, the forest's equations, and the frame's proposition, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where the protagonist steps into the frame with visible cost (surrendering "the last unquantified parts" to a system echoing her abusers). The cost is legible in "at last my pain began to factor"—the final image reweights the entire journey. One tightening: the walk toward the clearing compresses prior trauma into convergent "lines of force," and the frame's proposition crystallizes the ethical calculus. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest constrains movement and shapes perception throughout: roots the protagonist doesn't see yet compensates for, light "flashing brief equations" on skin, branches etching graphs. The clearing's frame—cables into soil, mycelium threads—grounds the abstract proposition in tactile detail. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: under nausea the protagonist notices only essentials (roots, the frame's hum), while calmer beats admit subtler wavelengths. The pewter mask strap functions as micro-setting, a concrete object that charges the closure choice. Minor gap: the forest's mechanics (how light translates nerve damage) remain atmospherically vivid but functionally vague, limiting how directly environment pressures tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to become "the dataset of compassion"—is signaled early ("discover the mathematics of mercy") and tightens through the walk to the clearing. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: each step is a micro-choice (pushing upright despite nausea, continuing toward the frame), and the final decision to enter the frame forecloses the path of refusal with visible cost ("surrendered the last unquantified parts"). The tension between yielding to a system that "spoke in the register of my abusers" and closing "an equation the world kept miswriting" is earned by prior embodied memories. The brace shifting from defensive to preparatory marks protagonist-driven transformation. Cost is unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the forest as interface, trauma stored in joints, the straps as "propositions in an unfinished proof." The central question—can mercy be measured, and at what cost—is answered non-literally by the protagonist stepping into the frame, a gesture that weaponizes her own pain for collective good without stating a moral. The ultraviolet penance concept integrates as both image and ethical calculus. Subtext operates in silence (the forest's hum "felt more than heard") and charged objects (the broken strap as "discarded question mark"). The final line "my pain began to factor" reconfigures prior material: pain shifts from private wound to variable in a larger equation, with the conceptual cost (self-instrumentalization) undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: the protagonist reads the world through bodily memory ("flinches and heart stutters the way other people read diaries") and sees impossible spectra. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during embodied flashbacks, slightly cooler when parsing the forest's geometry. Diction remains within the POV's plausible lexicon (clinical precision fused with lyric compression: "proprioceptively enhanced," "gallows taught quantum ethics"). Minor slips: "systematic disassembly of the self" and "penance" edge toward abstract register in early beats, and the final paragraph's explanatory clarity ("an angle chosen instead of imposed") slightly loosens the established oblique voice. No head-hopping; focalization is stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "pewter mask strap broken, the metal coiled like a discarded question mark" establishes prop, image, and thematic motif). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during the nauseous walk, longer syntactic arcs when parsing the proposition. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("stained glass wounds," "gallows taught quantum ethics"). Two frictions lower the score: some metaphoric vehicles strain coherence ("anesthesia's gray fingers" is tactile; "ultraviolet leaves flashed brief equations" mixes light and math without clear linkage), and several sentences in the middle third use identical stems ("I reached... I realized... I pushed"), creating mild template cadence. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality, and the closure beat is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of body-as-archive, forest-as-interface, and consent-to-instrumentalization is specific and non-obvious. The ultraviolet penance frame transforms the interrogation-survivor premise by literalizing "reading" trauma through light and geometry rather than therapeutic recall. The protagonist's proprioceptive enhancement drives plot (balance compensates for unseen roots) and theme (body as dataset). Risk-taking is evident in the elevated diction and compression, which heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. One constraint: the forest-as-computational-system and the frame's mycelium cables gesture toward SF tropes (neural upload, consent-as-interface) that are recognizable, though the moral calculus—trading unquantified selfhood for collective mercy-math—sharpens the premise enough to avoid pure derivation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in setup (waking post-anesthesia), middle (walk interpreting trauma through body), and closure (stepping into frame). The survivor's choices—pushing upright, continuing toward the clearing, entering the frame—drive all key turns. The final act is motivated by prior embodied memories and the ethical calculus articulated by the voice. Cost is visible: surrendering "the last unquantified parts." The decision alters tactics from evasion to voluntary participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Appears in setup (broken strap beside protagonist), middle (shoulders brace anticipating a blow when reaching for it, triggering compression/tongue/lung memories), and closure (straps "identical" descend on the frame). The strap's broken state and its return as restraint reweights meaning. However, the protagonist never physically handles the strap in the middle beat—the description is observational—and the closure straps are parallel objects rather than the exact strap transformed. Two beats of engagement, closure participation via echo, but swappability (any restraint object could serve) and lack of unique causal properties cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Signaled in setup ("ultraviolet penance" surfaces as embodied phrase), shapes middle tactics (forest translating nerve damage into "geometry of forgiveness"), and frames closure proposition (becoming the dataset to finalize mercy equations). The concept narrows options: refusing leaves mercy conjectural, agreeing instrumentalizes the self. The voice explicitly asks whether mercy can be measured, and the forest+frame literalize the question. Cost is conceptual and felt. The penance is both setting and ethical lens.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Introduced in setup ("proprioceptively enhanced"), used once in middle beat (balance compensating for unseen roots "as if someone had rehearsed this walk inside me"), and implicit at closure (body's brace shifting signals agency). The trait enables one on-page action with narrative consequence (continuing the walk) and charges interiority throughout. However, the enhancement is more often described than causally deployed; the balance moment is the sole specific instance where it alters tactics. Present across arc, but thin middle development and label-heavy usage limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Appears in setup (shoulders brace anticipating blow), recurs in middle (spine braces again when viewing the frame), and pivots at closure ("this time the brace was mine... preparatory, an angle chosen instead of imposed"). The action differentiates defensive reflex from chosen stance, marking the protagonist's shift from object to agent. The final brace redefines options and is irreplaceable—no other gesture carries the same embodied history and transformation. Strong causal role, closure linkage, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled early ("I had learned to remember through trauma responses, reading flinches and heart stutters"), used in middle beats (ankle angle recalls shackles, arm rise recalls baton sting, walk triggers flashes), and implicit at closure (entering the frame to let pain "factor" is the method's culmination). The method shapes multiple attempts and is irreplaceable—without it, the protagonist has no access to memory or the forest's interface. Mechanics are clear and causally active. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Present in setup (waking beneath glowing trees), middle (forest hums in sympathy with scars, roots guide steps, branches etch graphs), and closure (forest flares as straps descend). The forest pressures choices: its "lines of force" converge on the clearing, guiding the walk; its equations make the proposition legible. The ultraviolet spectrum and mycelium cables are specific and irreplaceable. The forest is both atmosphere and active participant, constraining movement and charging the final image. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Signaled in setup (anesthesia wears off) and frames the immediate present. However, time does not tighten decisions—there is no countdown or urgency beyond the protagonist's physical state (nausea, trembling). The walk and choice proceed at the protagonist's own pace. The timeframe establishes causality (post-procedure disorientation) but does not create tactical pressure or alter the closure. Functional but replaceable with "after waking" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stated in setup ("to discover the mathematics of mercy encoded in damaged brains"), tested in middle (protagonist parses forest's equations, walks toward clearing despite nausea), and dramatized at closure (choice to enter frame and finalize the mercy math). The desire conflicts with cost: becoming the dataset means surrendering autonomy to a system echoing her abusers. Friction between want (solve the equation) and fear (re-traumatization) drives the final choice. Clear causal role and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The phrase "displaced yet rooted" recurs verbatim twice (setup and closure), anchoring tone. The paradox operates throughout: protagonist is physically disoriented (waking in unknown forest, nausea) yet anchored by embodied memory and the forest's gravitational pull toward the clearing. Tone modulates with pressure—wonder at ultraviolet light, dread at the frame's proposition, resolve at the final brace. The tone charges the final image: "displaced yet rooted" as voluntary self-planting. Coherent across turns, with purposeful recurrence that reweights meaning.</comment>
