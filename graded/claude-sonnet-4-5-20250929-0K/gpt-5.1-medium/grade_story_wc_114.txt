<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is embodied through contradictory impulses—asking the oracle to tell her what she begged it to forget—and her internal conflict is concretely grounded in the fever memory and physical shivers. The choice to carry the hypothesis forward is earned by prior causality, though the oracle functions more as a sounding board than a fully realized second character with independent pressure. Minor deduction for the line "swaying certainties, not broken yet, but bending toward some unseen pressure," which slightly over-explains an already effective image. The final admission "the weight is mine to carry" lands with visible cost: she accepts isolation and the burden of knowledge her mentors suppressed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early (ridge station, post-fever, Mara and oracle alone). The dominant stake—whether to acknowledge and act on the suppressed storm-steering hypothesis—is signaled by "to find the weight of a swallowed truth" and escalates through remembered fever confession, oracle's retrieval, and Mara's final acceptance of the burden. Closure is Charged Poise: Mara's "the weight is mine to carry" crystallizes her stance and forecloses the path of continued denial with felt cost (isolation, responsibility). The lens reads as Causal with Accumulative coloring (the recurring Feverwhisper image and auroral sorrow pulse through to charge the ending). One minor slip: the phrase "something in her had smudged the neat narrative" is slightly abstract where a concrete recalled moment would sharpen causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mountain weather station setting constrains Mara's isolation and the oracle's fault-tolerant presence; the botanical illustration of Feverwhisper functions as micro-setting, appearing in camera logs and anchoring her memory of the drowned valley. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "rime crusted the railings in fragile, furred geometry," "antennas combed the blued air," "dawn bled green over the peaks." The station's architecture (consoles, radios, wind turbines) and the extinct plant's rendering ("stems as if they were veins, its leaves stippled with pale, almost translucent dots") both constrain choice and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout; the pacing between windows and radios tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to confront the suppressed storm-steering hypothesis—is signaled early and tightens through oracle revelation and Mara's memory recovery. One meaningful reversal occurs when the oracle reveals it preserved rather than erased the hypothesis, forcing Mara to decide whether to accept the weight. Agency is clear: Mara's fever confession, her request for burial, and her final acceptance all narrow options with visible cost. The price is felt: she moves from erasure-seeking to burden-carrying, foreclosing the path of denial and accepting isolation from mentors who "insisted on faith in the models." Pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—the cost of truth suppression in systems that privilege consensus over evidence—emerges through the extinct Feverwhisper, the valley's "collateral" targeting, and Mara's life "spent along the margins of other people's graphs, annotations in light pencil that could be erased." The oracle's fault-tolerance mirrors Mara's refusal to let go, and the final image ("dawn bled green over the peaks, thin and sorrowful") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "quiet conversations abruptly ending," altered files, and the mentors' too-quick acceptance of "unavoidable anomaly." The piece resists false balance: the mentors are implicated, not redeemed. One minor slip: "peripherally aware but afraid to look straight on" slightly over-explains what the prior paragraph already dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during fever memory, slightly wider during oracle dialogue). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "auroral sorrow pulsed," "swaying certainties," "the questions returned, ringing faintly as ice cracked on the eaves." The oracle's dialogue carries distinct vocal texture—"your temperature has stabilized," "my architecture is more forgiving"—contrasting with Mara's embodied interiority. Minor deduction for one filter-verb cluster: "feeling her certainties sway," "tasted metal," "felt the station tilt" within close proximity during peak pressure, slightly dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices marginalia, smudges, and peripheral detail in character-specific ways.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Green auroral sorrow pulsed faintly on its monitor glass, a reflection of distant geomagnetic storms" anchors tone, setting, and symbolic charge). Two minor issues: (1) "swaying certainties, not broken yet, but bending toward some unseen pressure" is a paraphrase loop—"swaying" and "bending" restate the same content without added pressure; (2) "peripherally aware but afraid to look straight on, she had swallowed her questions" slightly restates the prior paragraph's implication. These loops do not touch closure but reduce density in the middle third. No stock metaphors or register drift; grammar and pronoun references are clean throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—oracle as confessor, extinct plant as evidence of systemic harm, weather manipulation as environmental crime—feels specific and non-obvious. The combination of fever-induced revelation, fault-tolerant memory, and the drowned valley's timing avoids stock conspiracy-theory templates by grounding the hypothesis in Mara's professional expertise and personal loss. The final turn ("the weight is mine to carry") is earned in hindsight by the oracle's preservation and Mara's marginalized history. One small deduction: the core premise (suppressed environmental evidence) is familiar from climate-fiction templates, though the execution through oracle dialogue and botanical loss transforms it. Risk is present but constrained by the familiar investigator-discovers-conspiracy arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oracle is introduced early (first paragraph), constrains middle beats by revealing the preserved hypothesis ("you asked me to bury it by occupying margins"), and shapes the ending by declaring its limits ("I exist to forecast, not to intervene"), forcing Mara to accept agency. Its fault-tolerance is causally active: the refusal to forget drives the plot turn and creates Mara's final burden. The oracle's architecture (margins, routine logs, forgiving storage) is specific and irreplaceable. Three distinct beats: initial presence, revelation dialogue, and closure limitation. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the oracle's choices (to preserve, to measure, to withhold action) create the key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in paragraph 7 ("warped clipboard"), reappears in camera logs (paragraph 10), and returns in Mara's memory near the end ("looked at the Feverwhisper drawing, remembering..."). The illustration seeds the valley targeting subplot and charges Mara's recognition of "collateral but target." However, the object is primarily observed and remembered rather than handled across beats; it does not constrain a present choice in the final third. Two-gate coverage (setup, development) with lyric reprise but no direct closure participation. Reweighted meaning is present (ornament → evidence) but the final image does not rest on it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Swaying certainties is embodied early ("needle of an old barometer," paragraph 18) and shapes tactics throughout: Mara paces between windows and radios, her memories "blur" and "smudge," and she grips the desk until "splinters pressed crescents." The concept structures the dominant stake—whether to let the hypothesis solidify or remain peripheral—and is causally active in her fever-to-clarity arc. The final line's "thin and sorrowful" dawn mirrors the initial "Green auroral sorrow," closing the sway into settled weight. The concept alters options on the page rather than merely echoing as theme; Mara's choice to carry the weight is the crystallization of prior sway.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Peripherally aware is introduced at paragraph 10 ("The oracle was only peripherally aware of such papers") and paragraph 30 ("Peripherally aware but afraid to look straight on"). The trait constrains Mara's prior behavior (swallowing questions, seeing blur only "from the corner of her eye") and explains why the hypothesis was initially suppressed. However, the trait is primarily retrospective context rather than a present-tense enabler or constraint during the story's window. The cost (years of marginalization) is told rather than dramatized in a present choice. Two beats (oracle's camera logs, Mara's historical avoidance) with causal linkage to setup, but no distinct middle choice where the attribute visibly alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Smudge appears as verb (paragraph 27: "something in her had smudged the neat narrative") and noun (paragraph 9: "ink that had started to smudge at the edges"). The action ties directly to the core concept (swaying certainties) and the mother's tea memory, anchoring Mara's distrust of official explanations. It shapes two beats: the illustration's physical state and Mara's internal recognition of prior questioning. The final turn traces to this smudging instinct—her life "along the margins...annotations in light pencil that could be erased" versus writing "in ink"—but the action itself does not appear in the closure image. Strong thematic linkage and causal setup, but the ending rests on "carry the weight" rather than a smudging act.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>By occupying margins is signaled early (paragraph 12: "you asked me to bury it by occupying margins of routine logs") and mechanically detailed (paragraph 13: "unreachable by primary queries," "my architecture is more forgiving"). The method shapes the middle beat—oracle's preservation despite Mara's erasure request—and directly enables the plot turn (the hypothesis survives because margins are forgiving). The mechanics matter: fault-tolerance and margin-burial are causally active. However, the method does not reappear in the ending; Mara's final choice is to carry the weight forward rather than to employ margin-occupying herself. Two strong beats (revelation, explanation) with causal necessity, but no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is introduced in paragraph 1, anchors spatial choreography throughout (windows, radios, consoles, wind turbines on the iced slope), and supplies both the oracle resource and the isolation that forces Mara's choice. The station's forecasting function is causally tied to the storm-steering hypothesis and the mispredicted atmospheric river. Micro-setting elements (desk, clipboard, monitor glass) are handled across beats. The setting pressures the ending: isolation at altitude and the station's complicity (its error drowned the valley) charge Mara's decision to act alone. Four beats (initial anchor, fever context, oracle interaction space, closing dawn image) with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>After fever breaks is announced in paragraph 2 and paragraph 11 ("After fever breaks, you insisted we speak"). The timeframe sets up the window—Mara now lucid, able to confront what she said in delirium—and tightens the decision: she cannot retreat into fever's erasure. The timeframe structures causality (fever confession → post-fever reckoning) and is referenced at two beats. However, the timeframe does not create live urgency in the present scene; no countdown or external pressure tied to the fever's aftermath narrows her options during the dialogue. Two-gate coverage (setup, middle reference) with causal function but no escalation tied to time running out.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>To find the weight of a swallowed truth is stated in paragraph 5 and dramatized throughout: Mara paces, questions the oracle, grips the desk, and finally accepts "the weight is mine to carry." The motivation is conflicted—she wants to know yet begged for erasure—and drives all three acts (fever confession, oracle revelation, acceptance). The desire is embodied in physical choices (pacing, gripping, whispering) and tested against competing wants (erasure, safety, consensus). The final line's "weight...settled low in her chest" directly fulfills and closes the stated motivation with visible cost. Three distinct beats, strong causal pressure, and closure participation; the friction between wanting truth and fearing its price is present on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Auroral sorrow is introduced in paragraph 4 ("Green auroral sorrow pulsed faintly on its monitor glass") and bookends the ending ("dawn bled green over the peaks, thin and sorrowful"). Tone is coherent through turns: the prose sustains a mournful, elegiac register (rime, fragile geometry, bitter medicine, faint ringing) without flattening into uniform mood. The tone modulates under pressure—sharper during oracle revelation ("metal on her tongue," "station tilt"), quieter during memory—and charges the final image by linking the green auroral dawn to the oracle's monitor glow. The sorrow is not static; it accumulates through the extinct plant, the drowned valley, and Mara's isolation, then crystallizes in the closing line. Strong early signal, tonal coherence, and closure charge.</comment>
