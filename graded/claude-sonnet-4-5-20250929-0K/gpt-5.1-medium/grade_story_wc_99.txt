<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tutor's internal landscape is richly textured—"pruning silence from branches," the compass "hounded by unfinished journeys"—and his motivation (unspoken apology) drives micro-choices like studying the lace and following the compass. However, his agency is mostly observational; he traces patterns, lifts lace, and lets an apology "exist without words" rather than making a decisive choice that forecloses a path. The final easing ("something ease") reads passive, more received than earned through struggle. Embodied contradiction is present (stubbornness melting) but the protagonist does not alter tactics or pay a visible cost that changes his stance on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors early (islet, tutor, compass, post-severance), accumulates motifs (compass → lace → grove → ghost ships), and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the apology blooms as violet light; mist thickens with ghost ships). The closure reweights prior material and offers Charged Poise: "a space had opened that her forgiveness might one day cross." Cost is legible—he releases the apology without guarantee of receipt, foreclosing the fantasy of direct contact. One meaningful deepening (compass locks, leads him to second lace) tightens options under the accumulative lens. Minor slip: the final paragraph's "felt something ease" borders on soft summary, but the preceding image (violet light, ghost ships coalescing) sufficiently charges the moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective: wet stones, salt-sweet breeze, leaning pines, highest rock, narrow grove with "smell like opened books and seaweed." The compass constrains the tutor's path (locks on the grove, not north), and the lace's rain-swollen threads charge the final discovery. Micro-setting (bonsai grove, stones, lace between rocks) directly enables the climactic realization. Sensory hierarchy reflects the tutor's priorities (pruning imagery, bonsai scars as "years when something essential almost broke"). One slight: the ghost ships appear late and are somewhat abstract ("shapes gathered, hulls and masts coalescing"), reducing tactile grounding in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the color/means to reach Mira with apology) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening: the compass locks and leads him to the second lace strip, narrowing his search from abstract wish to concrete discovery. The lace "translates" his apology into violet light, and the ghost ships' arrival reconfigures his understanding ("vessels for what people had been too late to say"). Cost is present but muted—he releases the apology without certainty of delivery, a credible Charged Poise. Agency is constrained by his observational mode; he follows rather than decides, and the climactic "ease" reads more as relief than a choice that forecloses a path. No explicit antagonist or reversal, which fits the accumulative lens but limits pressure intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (unspoken apologies, severance, the color of regret) emerges through concrete images: compass unable to settle, lace patterns as navigation instructions, violet light as apology's hue. The final image—ghost ships as "vessels for what people had been too late to say"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "rhythmically placid" (control masking grief), the compass "hounded by unfinished journeys," and the lace that "listened." One borderline moment: "He did not know whether Mira was on any of those distant decks…but he felt something ease" risks soft closure, though the preceding violet-light image rescues it. The piece avoids thesis statements and lets particulars (bonsai scars, warped box, rain-swollen threads) carry weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, controlled, and consistent. Distance modulates purposefully: tight on interiority ("words rose in his throat without voice"), then out to lyric observation ("cerulean regret"). Diction is character-particular ("pruning silence from branches," "smoke that never finds a chimney") and maintains register under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. One friction: occasional elevated phrasing ("diffuse through the lace, smearing silver") and a few passive constructions ("was breezy," "was rhythmically placid") slow momentum slightly. Perceptual signature is strong—his gaze lingers on bonsai scars, lace loops, compass needle—but the prose sometimes tilts toward decorative lyricism at the expense of propulsion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in places ("compass needle jerked…unable to settle, as if hounded by unfinished journeys"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "rhythmically placid" recurs in nearly identical phrasing across paragraphs, and several lines restate the tutor's silence or the compass's indecision without added pressure. Figurative density is heavy throughout ("color of rinsed ink," "sea-stained violet edged with salt," "diffuse…smearing silver"), bordering on overwriting in middle beats where clarity would serve better. The phrase "tides of remembrance" is invoked twice with minimal variation. Template cadence is minimal, but the accumulation of lyric description without causal linkage in some passages (e.g., multiple lines on the lace's appearance before its function is revealed) creates minor drag. No major artifacts touch closure, so penalties remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—bonsai tutor, ghost ship's compass, lace-as-navigation, post-severance tides—is specific and non-obvious. The apology-as-color conceit is fresh, and the piece avoids template resolution by leaving Mira's location uncertain. However, the "tides of remembrance" frame and the "ghost ships carry unsaid things" motif echo familiar magical-realism tropes without fully transforming them through grounded lived detail. The tutor's occupation (bonsai) ornaments the premise more than it constrains his tactics; pruning metaphors enrich voice but don't alter his approach to the compass or lace. Risk-taking is moderate—lyric accumulation over causal drive is bold, but the ending's soft easing ("something ease") retreats slightly from full commitment. The piece feels singular in voice and vision, yet one rung shy of inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character present early (first line), drives two beats (arranges tools/studies lace, follows compass to grove), and is present at closure (releases apology as violet light). However, his choices are mostly observational—he follows the compass rather than deciding among competing tactics, and the final "ease" is received rather than enacted. Cost is present (releases apology without guarantee) but his occupation as bonsai tutor does not constrain or enable the key moves; pruning skill does not shape how he uses the compass or lace. Setup + development + payoff gates met, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are moderate. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but observational mode and swappability (another regretful artisan would work) limit the score. Net: 3.0 base +2.4 = 5.4, rounded down to 5.4; modest cost adds +0.4 → 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Compass present early (paragraph 6, "wooden box…ghost ship's compass"), used in two beats (needle jerks/cannot settle; later locks on grove and guides him), and appears at closure (warms, swings toward horizon). Setup + development + payoff gates met. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (locks direction, enables discovery) +0.8, closure linkage (swings toward seam, cues ghost ships) +1.0. However, the compass's ghost-ship provenance is ornamental—its needle behavior drives plot, but any directional instrument could substitute with minor edits. Swappability −0.6, ornamental backstory −0.3. Net: 3.0 +3.2 −0.9 = 5.3; specificity (ghost ship origin charges thematic resonance) adds +0.4 → 5.7, round to 6.7 after recognizing strong closure linkage elevates further +1.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Concept stated early (paragraph 10, "tides of remembrance…pulling lost things back"), recurs (paragraph 28, "tides of remembrance did not only move through water"), and is thematically present at closure (ghost ships return as unsaid things). Setup + payoff gates met; middle development is thematic rather than tactical. The concept frames stakes but does not constrain on-page tactics—the tutor does not adjust his approach based on tide mechanics or timing. Early signal +0.5, thematic closure linkage +0.7, but summary-only middle use (he "understood" rather than acted on tide rules) −0.5, ornamental role −0.5. Net: 3.0 +1.2 −1.0 = 3.2; strong thematic charge at closure adds +0.6 → 3.8, lyric-resonance allowance lifts to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Attribute introduced early (paragraph 2, "rhythmically placid…stroked the leaning pines"), recurs (paragraph 22, "breathed with the sea's rhythm, rhythmically placid"), and colors the tutor's approach (slowing lungs to allow memory). Setup + development + payoff. However, the trait is largely descriptive—it characterizes his demeanor but does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost. Early signal +0.4, two mentions across beats +0.4, thematic consistency +0.3, but label-only use (does not alter tactics) −0.6, swappability (another calm descriptor would work) −0.4. Net: 3.0 +1.1 −1.0 = 3.1; modest thematic reinforcement +0.5 → 3.6, lyric reprise adds +0.6 → 4.2, round to 5.2 acknowledging embodied breath moment as micro-constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Action introduced mid-story (paragraph 24, "pale light seemed to diffuse through the lace"), directly triggers the apology-blooming moment (paragraph 26, "bloomed as a color…violet"), and shapes closure (violet light shimmers, ghost ships gather). Development + payoff gates; late setup (past 40% mark) caps at 4.6 unless transformation is undeniable. The diffusion is the mechanism that translates apology into visible form, turning abstract wish into concrete signal—irreplaceable for the closure effect. Two beats (diffusion → color bloom), causal pressure (enables the apology's externalization) +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.7. Late introduction −0.5. Net: 3.0 +3.4 −0.5 = 5.9; transformation lifts past cap to 7.1, acknowledging this action is the hinge for the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Method introduced early (paragraph 18, "directions might truly be carried through instructions woven into an antique lace pattern"), developed (paragraph 20, lace motifs "echo the ghost ship's compass, loops and arrows"), and present at closure (lace flutters as signal flag, violet light through it). Setup + development + payoff gates met. The lace's woven instructions guide the tutor's search and provide the medium for the apology's translation. Early signal +0.6, two beats (study, lift/signal) +0.9, causal pressure (lace soaks up apology, translates it) +1.0, closure linkage (flutters, shimmers violet) +1.2, irreplaceability (woven instructions are unique) +0.6. Net: 3.0 +4.3 = 7.3; minor swappability (another encoded object could work) −0.4 → 6.9, but the lace's dual role (instructions + listener) adds specificity +0.5 → 7.4, rounded down to 6.4 after recalibrating against ornamental early mentions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setting present from opening (paragraphs 1–3, "islet…wet stones…leaning pines…highest rock"), developed in grove discovery (paragraph 23, "narrow grove…twisted little pines…clinging to stones"), and present at closure (breakers, mist, horizon). Setup + development + payoff. The islet's grove provides the second lace strip, a key causal turn, and the breakers/mist frame the ghost ships' arrival. Early signal +0.7, two spatial beats (high rock, grove) +0.9, causal pressure (grove constrains search, supplies discovery) +1.0, closure linkage (mist/horizon) +0.8. However, the setting could be another liminal locale (coastal cliff, lakeside) with minor edits; micro-setting (grove, stones) does more work than the islet itself. Swappability −0.5. Net: 3.0 +3.4 −0.5 = 5.9; specificity (bonsai grove's scars mirror theme) +0.3 → 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Timeframe introduced early (paragraph 8, "after the severance"), recurs (paragraph 12, "Since then…"), and frames the ending (seam on water, "channels" that might open). Setup + payoff; middle development is context rather than live clock. The severance shapes the dominant stake (apology cannot travel) but does not tighten decisions within the scene—no urgency tied to time passing. Early signal +0.5, thematic closure linkage (seam, channels) +0.7, but no tactical constraint (tutor does not race a deadline or adjust for time) −0.6, summary-only middle −0.4. Net: 3.0 +1.2 −1.0 = 3.2; strong thematic framing adds +0.8 → 4.0, lyric-resonance allowance (first → last reprise of seam/channels) +1.0 → 5.0, embodied cost (years of waiting) +0.6 → 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation introduced early (paragraph 14, "find the color of unspoken apologies"), drives two beats (studies lace for the color, follows compass to achieve it), and is fulfilled at closure (apology blooms as "sea-stained violet"). Setup + development + payoff. The desire is specific, non-obvious, and shapes all on-page choices. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (motivation = the dominant stake) +1.4, closure linkage (color found, apology released) +1.5, irreplaceability (unique desire) +0.7. Net: 3.0 +5.2 = 8.2. However, friction between wants and costs is muted—he longs for the color and finds it without visible sacrifice or competing desire. Cost is present (releases without guarantee) but not dramatized as a trade-off. Lack of friction −0.8. Final: 8.2 −0.8 = 7.4, rounded down to 6.9 after recalibrating for observational agency.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone signaled early (paragraph 16, "cerulean regret, the sky and sea conspiring to keep everything almost, but not quite, forgiven"), sustained (blue-gray color search, "soft, sea-stained violet edged with salt"), and charges the final image (violet light, mist, ghost ships). Setup + development + payoff. Tone is coherent, modulates subtly (wistful → tentatively hopeful), and the color motif (cerulean → violet) directly serves closure. Early signal +0.7, pervasive presence across beats +1.0, closure linkage (violet as resolution of cerulean) +1.4, specificity (color-as-tone is unique) +0.7. Net: 3.0 +3.8 = 6.8; strong thematic-tonal integration adds +0.5 → 7.3.</comment>
