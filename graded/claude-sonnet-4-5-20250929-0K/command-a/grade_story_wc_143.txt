<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's dedication to preservation is clear, but her interior life defaults to generic melancholy rather than embodied contradiction. The mentor's posthumous message provides motivation, yet her response feels more dutiful than conflicted—no real choice between preservation and self-preservation materializes on the page. The "lump formed in her throat" and similar emotional labels substitute for specific sensory pressure. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, scanning, documenting) but none foreclose a live path with visible cost scaled to this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when by the opening). The chemical message provides a timed reversal, and the closure image—photographing the site at dawn—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: she outlasts the dawn as commanded, honoring legacy against erasure). Cost is felt but oblique: the heavy heart and clutched grain signal loss, yet no concrete tactical forfeiture or relational price lands on the page. One meaningful deepening (message discovery) tightens the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lunar setting is vivid and specific: regolith crunch, metallic dulling, the horizon's first light. The nightwatch's hourglass sand grain functions as micro-setting, clutched and referenced across beats. The summit's "eerie stillness" and "dawning hush" filter through Elara's professional lens. The environment does not constrain a choice (she completes her task unhindered by terrain or clock), capping the score below 9, but sensory detail anchors mood and the final photograph's golden light charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: document the site before terraforming erases it. The chemical message raises urgency ("outlast the dawn"), but no live opposition forces a trade-off—mission control's beeping is ignored without consequence. Elara's choice to stay until dawn is stated, not tested; the cost (turning away with "heavy heart") is declared rather than dramatized through forfeited safety, stamina, or professional penalty. One meaningful tightening occurs (message discovery), but escalation under the Accumulative lens needed a visible price that alters tactics or forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus progress emerges through the mentor's message and the impending terraforming. The nightwatch grain and final photograph offer non-literal recurrence, and the "dawning hush" motif brackets the piece. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("testament to humanity's reach") rather than letting the image speak. The tension between documentation and loss is felt but never sharpened by an ambiguous cost or counter-reading; Elara's victory is tidy, reducing complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and professional ("lunar regolith," "chemical composition"), fitting Elara's role. Perceptual signature (headlamp, scanner, camera drone) is consistent. Internal voice defaults to stock phrases ("heart quickened," "lump formed") under pressure rather than idiosyncratic perception. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent; narrative certainty matches Elara's knowledge without omniscient leaps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean and legible, with varied sentence structure and no significant loops. However, several lines carry template cadence: "Her heart quickened," "A lump formed in her throat," "With a heavy heart" recur as emotional shorthand without embodied specificity. The phrase "dawning hush" and "dawnlit melancholy" are repeated for motif effect, acceptable here. Information density is moderate; some beats (adjusting helmet, ignoring communicator) add atmosphere but minimal pressure. Figurative language ("shadows danced," "universe whispered") is competent but familiar, not fresh.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lunar preservation and the timed chemical message offer a moderately fresh synthesis. The mentor's posthumous defiance adds specificity, yet the emotional arc (melancholy guardian honors legacy) follows a predictable template. The closure photograph at dawn is thematically apt but not conceptually surprising. Risk-taking is minimal: no structural experiment, no moral ambiguity, no counter-pressure that complicates Elara's stance. The piece executes competently within its premise but does not transform familiar preservation-versus-progress material into an unexpected inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara (crater inspector) is present throughout and makes one key choice: to stay until dawn despite mission control's urging. This decision drives the ending but is not tested by visible cost (no stamina loss, safety trade-off, or professional penalty dramatized). She observes, documents, and reflects more than she decides under pressure. Two beats: discovering the message, photographing at dawn. Mid-band: causal role in one major beat with lyric reprise, but swappable with "preservation specialist" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The nightwatch's hourglass sand grain appears in three beats: initial mention at her belt, resting in her palm during work, clutched at departure. However, it remains a passive memento; no choice hinges on it, and its meaning does not shift. The grain is described but never handled in a way that alters tactics or charges the closure beyond sentimental reminder. Functional but replaceable with any mentor keepsake. Missing middle development that constrains choice; cameo in closure does not count as active participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" appears as atmospheric descriptor (opening, closing) but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. The summit's stillness and the approach of dawn set mood, yet no choice is tightened by the concept—Elara completes her task regardless of the "hush." Theme echo only; swappable with "lunar silence" or "quiet expanse" without altering plot. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is mentioned once ("her purposefully curious nature drove her forward") but functions as label-only trait. No on-page action demonstrates cost or constraint tied to curiosity versus caution, method, or risk aversion. The trait could be replaced with "dedication" or "determination" without edits. Missing setup in first third (appears mid-story as abstract claim) and missing middle development where curiosity enables or costs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Outlast" appears in the chemical message ("Outlast the dawn") and drives Elara's final choice to remain until sunrise despite mission control. The action is signaled early (message discovery ~midpoint), tested in one beat (staying through dawn), and present in closure (dawn photograph). Causal role in the ending, but the challenge is resolved without visible cost—no stamina drain, safety trade-off, or professional penalty dramatized. Strong setup and closure linkage; missing felt price lowers to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Chemical reactions for timed messages are signaled at discovery ("chemical reaction... timed to activate"), analyzed on the page (scanner, "complex mix"), and credited to the mentor's teaching. The method shapes one key turn (message reveal) and frames closure context (posthumous defiance). However, its mechanics do not constrain Elara's tactics or complicate the task; it delivers information, then recedes. Functional in one major beat with thematic payoff, but swappable with hologram or encrypted file. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; missing middle development where method pressures choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Moonlit summit is anchored early and sustained: regolith crunch, metallic dulling, horizon light. The setting provides vivid atmosphere and the final image's golden dawn. However, the summit does not constrain choice—Elara moves freely, and no environmental obstacle (temperature, stamina clock, terrain hazard) alters her tactics. Postcard-level description elevated by specificity and closure linkage (dawn light charges the photograph), but lacks the tactical pressure required for high scores. Two gates (setup, payoff); missing middle development where setting pressures a choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"During the space age" and "Apollo landing site" anchor the timeframe. The impending terraforming (slated "within days") provides urgency, but no live clock tightens Elara's decisions on the page—mission control beeps, she ignores it without consequence. The "hours passed" summary abstracts elapsed time rather than dramatizing a countdown that forces trade-offs. Present as context; does not constrain tactics. Missing middle development where the timeframe narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To photograph the last of something precious" is the stated mission, repeated in the opening and closure. Elara's desire is clear and sustained across beats: approach, document, final photograph. However, the motivation is not conflicted—no friction between preservation and self-preservation, speed versus thoroughness, or competing loyalties dramatized. The "heavy heart" declares cost but does not show a choice where the desire clashes with another want. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; missing middle friction where precious-ness competes with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Dawnlit melancholy" is named in the penultimate paragraph and signaled through "heavy heart," "bittersweet," and the mentor's absence. Tone is coherent but static: melancholy pervades without modulating under pressure. At discovery (message), curiosity and determination could spike; at dawn, triumph or defiant satisfaction could layer over loss. Instead, mood remains uniform sadness. The tone charges the final image (photograph of endings and beginnings) with lyric weight. Two gates (middle label, payoff); late naming and lack of tonal shift under pressure lower to mid-5s.</comment>
