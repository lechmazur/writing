<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's "cautiously hopeful" stance is named rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Her technical competence reads cleanly, but internal conflict remains thin—decoding the signal and activating the counter-frequency proceed without meaningful hesitation or competing desires. The ending asserts "grit" and "peace" rather than dramatizing a visible cost or foreclosed path; her decision to stay vigilant restates her opening posture without transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early and tracks a causal chain: signal → decode → counter-frequency → distortion. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Elara's "victory" is immediately undercut by external protest, then she smiles and returns to work, a soft reset rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The "battle far from over" frame diffuses pressure instead of crystallizing stakes. Inferred lens: Causal with Situational elements; the ending does not hold pressure under either.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The radio station is vividly anchored—vintage microphones, tangled wires, concrete floor—and the spectrograph/subwoofer function as tools. The station provides resources (equipment) that enable Elara's counter-move, crossing the 6.0 threshold. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; the "ethereal glow" at sunset reads ornamental rather than purposeful, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode and neutralize the signal—is signaled early and tightens when Hank pressures her. Elara's activation of the counter-frequency is a clear on-page reversal. Yet the escalation plateaus: the signal distorts, protests erupt off-stage, and Elara resumes work without visible cost or trade-off. Coincidence (protests outside) complicates but does not force a harder choice, and the ending asserts readiness rather than foreclosing a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cosmic-trickster frame and power-play theme are stated ("entities that thrived on chaos," "game of power plays") rather than emerging from particulars. The counter-frequency gambit embodies the theme momentarily, but the final paragraph moralizes—"grit," "human ingenuity against the vast, unknowable cosmos"—instead of leaving resonance implicit. The signal's subsonic method is a concrete detail, yet the piece does not use it to reweight prior material at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and Elara's perceptual filter—astronomical charts, spectrograph—reads distinct. Dialogue with Hank is functional and goal-driven. However, narrative distance flattens under pressure: "Her years of studying celestial patterns had taught her" tells expertise rather than showing perception shaped by it. Diction remains steady, though phrases like "small bastion of human ingenuity" drift into elevated register at the ending without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Minor loops appear: "a message, a power play" and "chaos and deception" repeat the trickster concept without added pressure. The final paragraph stacks reassertions—"grit," "peace," "mysteries," "ready"—in place of a charged image. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but propulsion slows in the last third as scaffold phrases accumulate ("far from over," "just one player").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The celestial-signal premise is familiar (SETI/Contact template); the radio-station setting and subsonic counter-frequency add specificity, but the trickster frame and community-divide remain generic. Elara's ingenuity—calibrating a subwoofer to emit a counter-frequency—is the freshest beat, yet her decision to "stay vigilant" and the "game of power plays" conclusion retreat to stock phrasing. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the arc follows a median template without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara (celestial signal interpreter) is present throughout and makes two key decisions: to decode the signal and to activate the counter-frequency. Her second choice distorts the signal, driving the middle turn. However, the ending does not hinge on a fresh decision—she watches protests and resumes work—so closure participation is partial. Early setup, two-beat involvement, and causal pressure in the middle elevate the score, but the lack of a decisive final choice caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear in the opening (Elara "pored over a stack," "fingers tracing constellations") and return in the final paragraph ("hands clutching the astronomical charts," "fingers brushing the charts once more"). The reprise reweights her commitment but does not alter tactics or carry new cost; the charts function as a visual anchor rather than a constraint. Two touches, lyric frame, but no causal middle use or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Power plays" is named twice ("power play from something … beyond," "universe was a game of power plays") but remains thematic assertion rather than on-page tactic. Elara's counter-frequency is a move, but the text does not frame it as a power gambit with visible cost or strategic friction. The concept does not shape her choices in a way that another framing (e.g., "deception," "defense") could not replace with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is named in the opening and again when "her cautious hope growing into something more solid" after the signal distorts. The trait is told rather than embodied in contradictory action—no visible hesitation or trade-off between caution and hope. Label-only use with no constraint on choice; the score remains low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Interfere" drives the middle turn: Elara decides not to block the signal but to "interfere … by using their own method against them," activating the counter-frequency. This choice distorts the signal and shifts the situation. The action is signaled ("she had to interfere"), executed on-page, and shapes the middle beat. However, the ending does not extend or reprice the interference—protests erupt and she resumes work—so closure linkage is weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are signaled early ("embedded with subsonic frequencies, too low for human ears") and enable Elara's tactic: she calibrates a subwoofer to emit a counter-frequency. The method is specific and causal in the middle beat. Yet it does not return at closure or carry visible cost; once the signal distorts, the subsonic mechanism disappears from the text. Two beats (discovery, deployment), causal pressure, but no closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The university radio station is anchored early with vivid detail (vintage microphones, tangled wires, concrete floor) and provides the subwoofer Elara uses. Hank's intrusion adds pressure tied to the station's sponsor concerns. The setting enables her counter-move but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; the "ethereal glow" at sunset is ornamental. Present across beats, shapes one turn, but closure participation is decorative.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"As the community divides" frames the timeframe and is dramatized when protests erupt after Elara's counter-move. However, the division does not tighten her decisions—she watches from the window and resumes work without a deadline or escalating cost. The element complicates the situation but does not alter her tactics or charge the closure. Functional presence, weak causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To outwit cosmic tricksters" is stated as Elara's goal ("she was determined to outwit them") and achieved when she distorts the signal ("she had outmaneuvered the cosmic tricksters"). The motivation is told and resolved in summary rather than dramatized through friction or cost. No internal conflict between competing desires; the text asserts the motive but does not test it under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is gestured through contrasts: "dimly lit confines" and "vintage microphones" (grit) paired with "whisper secrets," "ethereal glow," and "strange kind of peace" (ethereal). The tone is present in description but does not modulate with pressure—Elara's emotional arc remains steady, and the final paragraph leans ethereal ("ethereal glow," "peace") without sharpening the grit. Coherent but static; does not charge the closure image.</comment>
