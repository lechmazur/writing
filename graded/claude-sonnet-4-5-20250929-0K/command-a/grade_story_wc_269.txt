<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority leans heavily on reflection and abstract wondering ("why some paths disappear") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her tapping habit is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates friction. The final realization feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle—she assembles information and arrives at insight without visible cost or a decision that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is largely absent; we get "curiosity grew" and "her mind drifted" instead of physical contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The piece follows a reflective accumulative design: Elara notices the torn page, researches, and reaches a thematic conclusion. However, closure reads as conceptual summary ("Some paths disappear...") without on-page cost or a decisive image that reweights prior material—no choice is made, no path foreclosed, no felt price paid. The ending explains rather than enacts, violating the Closure requirement for visible or undeniable cost. Under an Accumulative lens, a cadence shift or charged final image is needed; here we receive exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The monitoring station is anchored with functional detail (weathered metal, automated systems, daily data upload ritual). The torn atlas page is handled multiple times and its physical state (frayed edges, watermark) matters. Sensory economy is solid—no tourism—but the station itself never constrains a tactical choice or charges the closure image; it remains backdrop. The page's micro-setting role lifts the score, but missing the 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice or charge closure) caps the upper range.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the torn page's significance—is signaled early. However, escalation is minimal: Elara notices, wonders, researches, concludes. No reversal tightens options; no on-page choice narrows a path. The alarm and data upload create a beat but don't escalate pressure. Closure is a realized explanation, not a decision with cost. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights stakes is required; the story offers thematic summary instead.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme (vanished paths, choices, sustainability) emerges from the atlas page and Elara's history as a coral bleaching witness. The final paragraph states the theme overtly: "Some paths disappear...because we never fully understood where they led." This is Thematic Echo—prompt-like articulation in the closing lines—triggering a −0.6 deduction. The conceptual work is present but delivered as authorial thesis rather than earned through a resonant image or non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV interiority is controlled and lexicon stays consistent (marine biologist register). The reflective mode is sustained without head-hopping. However, psychic distance flattens under what should be peak curiosity—"her curiosity grew, a quiet insistence" tells rather than enacts perception. Elara's voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; her noticing feels generic rather than character-specific. No dialogue present to judge. Clean mechanics and stable tense.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied syntax and no major loops. Information density is moderate—many lines do double work (e.g., tapping rhythms anchor both character habit and theme). However, the final paragraph drifts into exposition: "The coastline...had been a site of early fossil fuel extraction" reads as Wikipedia summary rather than dramatized discovery. The closing thesis ("Some paths disappear...") is scaffolding that tells theme instead of showing cost. Template stems appear occasionally ("She tapped...a habit," "She turned it over, searching") but remain under threshold. Figurative language (sentinel, fragments of puzzle) is spare and controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—climate scientist + mysterious atlas page + fossil fuel history—follows a familiar discovery-and-insight template. The torn page device is well-worn (secret knowledge, symbolic fragment). Elara's tapping habit and "periodically eternal" phrasing gesture toward freshness but neither transforms the arc. The final revelation (coastline was extraction site, symbol was a warning) is logical but predictable. No bold structural risk; the reflective frame plays it safe. Execution is competent but the premise needs a sharper, non-obvious angle to break from template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as coral bleaching witness is mentioned twice (intro, final synthesis) and frames her expertise, but it does not create a key turn or decision. Her past observation informs context; it does not constrain a present choice with cost. Present by setup, returns at closure thematically, but missing middle development and causal pressure keeps it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The torn atlas page appears in four beats: inbox discovery, desk examination, evening study, and final revelation. It drives Elara's research action and the ending hinges on decoding its watermark and contours. However, the page is examined rather than used—it does not constrain a choice with felt cost, only enables intellectual conclusion. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but missing the decisive causal pressure and visible tradeoff needed for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Delayed revelation" shapes the entire arc: the torn page's meaning is withheld until Elara's evening research. The concept is embodied in structure (mystery → research → insight) and ties to theme. However, the revelation itself is told as exposition in the final paragraph rather than dramatized with on-page consequence. It reweights understanding but not tactics or cost. Present across all three gates with thematic integration, but lacking the decisive turn or price that would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears once as a descriptor of the oceans ("their changes slow yet irreversible, their rhythms constant yet unpredictable"). It is label-only—a thematic claim without causal work. The phrase does not constrain an action, enable a tactic, or return with reweighted meaning. Ornamental use caps the score in the low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Assemble" appears twice: Elara assembles equipment for data upload (routine action) and assembles fragments of research in the evening (the story's central move). The second use drives the investigation and leads to closure insight. However, the assembly is summarized ("slowly, a picture began to emerge") rather than shown beat-by-beat with choices and costs. Present in setup and closure, with thematic link, but the mechanics remain vague and the turn is intellectual rather than stake-altering.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Tapping rhythms appear in three beats: desk (steadying thoughts), floor (organizing chaos into patterns), and mentioned as a years-old practice. The method is characterized but never shown affecting an outcome—it accompanies thought without constraining it. The tapping does not shape an attempt or solve a problem; it is atmospheric. Functional presence without causal necessity keeps it replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The sea level monitoring station frames the setting and supplies the data upload ritual, but it does not pressure a choice or alter tactics. Elara works there; the station's automated systems hum; the alarm chimes for routine upload. The environment is anchored and consistent, yet it remains backdrop—no resource or constraint from the station itself drives the plot. Functional setup and closure mention, but missing the micro-setting pressure needed for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the fossil fuel ban" is mentioned in the opening and returns in the final revelation (the coastline was an extraction site). The timeframe supplies world context but does not tighten a decision or create urgency—no clock, no deadline. It informs theme (reassembled priorities, fragility of progress) without altering on-page tactics. Present in setup and closure thematically, but missing the live temporal pressure that would make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's question "why some paths disappear" is stated explicitly and drives her curiosity about the torn page. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized—she wonders, researches, concludes, but faces no friction between want and cost. The motivation frames the investigation and returns at closure as thesis, but it is not tested or conflicted in choices. Solid thematic presence across beats, but lacking the dramatic pressure needed for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" is apt for the reflective, meditative tone—Elara is tethered to the station yet her mind drifts through memory and questions. The tone is coherent and modulates gently (morning observation → evening research), but it remains static rather than charging the final image with new pressure. The ending maintains the same contemplative register without a tonal shift that reweights stakes. Functional fit, but missing the intensification or cadence break that would elevate closure.</comment>
