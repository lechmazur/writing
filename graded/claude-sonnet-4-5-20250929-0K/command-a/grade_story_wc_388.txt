<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—excavating truth—is stated but not dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her interiority relies on label-speak ("sharply observant," "intuition told her") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to reinforce the seal feels convenient rather than earned by prior micro-choices under pressure. No visible cost forecloses a path; she simply sits back exhausted with the diamond "now just a stone."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn "Elara Voss, a conspiracy debunker" mid-paragraph one, and the inciting premise (orchard investigation) competes with backstory ("after the liquidation") for opening clarity. The closure—diamond pressed into earth, stillpoint stabilized—lands as a physical act, but the cost is asserted ("fragile balance") rather than shown through a forfeited option or altered relationship. The lens reads Causal with convenience plotting: the chant and diamond conveniently solve the threat without prior setup of this method's mechanics or price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is vivid ("cracked earth," "radioactive dust storms") and the stillpoint hum is embodied. Spatial choreography is coherent across the camp scene. However, the orchard does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it remains backdrop. The diamond's glow and the shadows' movement are described but do not alter Elara's tactics in the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (contain the stillpoint threat) is signaled late, only emerging after the diamond's hidden message. No meaningful tightening occurs; Elara discovers, then immediately solves. The climax (chant, press diamond) lacks escalation—no failed attempt, no visible trade-off. Coincidence resolves: the shredded letters "seemed to shift" into a guide without prior setup of her ability to use them this way.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. comfortable lies) is stated in paragraph one and again at the end ("excavate truth, no matter the cost") but never tested through a choice where Elara must weigh revelation against safety. The flawed diamond as both beacon and seal reads allegorical but remains surface-level. The final image—diamond now inert, orchard still bearing fruit—offers mood but no non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is stable third-limited with consistent past tense. Diction is elevated ("convergence of energy," "testament to human ingenuity") and sometimes clashes with urgency ("sharply observant nature kicked into overdrive"). No dialogue appears. Filter verbs cluster in key beats ("felt a faint hum," "told her," "knew the stillpoint"), dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "sharply observant eye" (para 1), "sharply observant mind" (para 3), "sharply observant nature" (para 7). Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens five sentences in the climax sequence. Stock metaphor: "her chant becoming a scream" without specificity. The final paragraph recycles the opening's "excavate truth" phrasing verbatim. Information density is low; beats often repeat the same content.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise (post-apocalyptic orchard sustained by mysterious energy, investigator uncovers a sealed threat) is familiar and not transformed by specific world logic or moral calculus. The flawed diamond and stillpoint function as generic MacGuffins. The debunker-investigates-curse setup follows a template arc. No bold risk or synthesis elevates the material beyond its genre baseline.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes few choices—she discovers passively (diamond hums, letters shift) and solves via a chant introduced in the climax. Her debunker trait does not constrain or enable key turns; she accepts the myth rather than debunking it.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The diamond appears in paragraph two, returns in paragraphs four and five (warm touch, hidden message), and is used in the climax (pressed into earth). It shapes two beats (message revelation, sealing) and charges the ending (now dull). Swappability is moderate; another artifact could serve similarly with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The stillpoint is named in paragraph one and discussed in paragraphs four, five, seven, and eight. It frames the problem but does not constrain tactics—Elara's method (chant) is unrelated to its mechanics. It participates in closure (stabilized) but remains abstract rather than altering on-page options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is a repeated label (three times) but never demonstrated through a specific perceptual insight that enables a choice. Elara notices "faint movement of shadows" but does not act differently because of this observation. The trait is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears as a label ("Her sharply observant mind began to piece together"; "Elara's intuition told her") but the connections are told rather than shown. The major turn (diamond as seal, not curse) is delivered via shifted letters, not Elara's reasoning process. The action is swappable with "deduce" or "realize."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Shredded letters are mentioned in paragraph two (satchel), spread out in paragraph four, and used as a guide in the climax. The mechanics of reassembly are not shown; they "seemed to shift" passively. The method shapes one beat (message emergence) but does not constrain earlier attempts or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is anchored early (paragraph one) and returns throughout. It supplies the stillpoint's location and the fruit, but does not pressure Elara's choices—she could conduct the same investigation elsewhere. The orchard is present in the ending (trees still bearing fruit) and the dust storms' return reweights the frame. Two-gate presence with modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the liquidation" appears in paragraph one as backstory context but does not tighten decisions or tactics. No clock or temporal pressure shapes the plot. The timeframe is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation (excavate truth from comfortable lies) is stated in paragraph one and restated in the final line. It frames the investigation but is never conflicted—Elara never weighs the cost of revelation against safety. No on-page friction between this want and another cost. Told rather than dramatized.</comment>
