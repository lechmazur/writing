<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (persuading mirrors) is clear but her interiority remains abstract—"perceptively calm" is asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The "borrowed heartbeat" conceit appears as metaphor without concrete stakes: we're told it costs her pulse, but no micro-choice dramatizes the trade-off or reveals what she risks losing. The final trembling hands gesture toward cost, but the sacrifice feels declared rather than earned through prior causal pressure. Emotional progression is smooth rather than contradictory; no visible struggle between want and fear complicates her grace.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph, satisfying the test. The dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early, and the piece builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (mirrors surrender, Elara's heartbeat fades). However, the tightening lacks causal pressure: mirrors resist, she sings louder, they surrender without a pivot in her method or a dramatized trade-off that forecloses options. The "borrowed heartbeat" cost is told in summary ("her own heartbeat now fainter") rather than shown through a choice or visible consequence that alters tactics. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece needed one decisive intensification or pattern break that reweights the stake with on-page cost; the ending reconfigures but the cost remains asserted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "echoing terrace in spring" and "prism parapet after rain" anchor the scene with vivid sensory detail (sunlight fractured through wet glass, spectrum of colors). The prism parapet functions as a stage but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it's descriptive rather than tactical. Sensory selection (spring air, bells tolling) supports tone and cadence, and the mirage-painting relies on the prism's light refraction, giving the setting mild causal relevance. Spatial choreography is clear (terrace, parapet, mirrors in ornate frames, shadows), but the environment remains more backdrop than pressure point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (persuade mirrors to show possibilities) is clear and sustained. One reversal appears: mirrors resist, Elara sings louder, mirrors surrender. However, the escalation lacks agency-driven narrowing—she continues the same method (coded lullabies) without tactical shift or visible trade-off. The resolution feels granted rather than earned: "the mirrors surrendered" after she "sang louder" and "poured her own pulse into the melody," but no on-page action shows what she forfeits or how her choice forecloses a path. The cost (fainter heartbeat) is summarized post-resolution, not dramatized in the pressure moment. Under the Accumulative lens, the piece needed a decisive tightening or cadence shift that makes the price undeniable on the page; instead, the price is asserted after the fact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>A coherent theme—possibility versus reflection, empathy as sacrifice—emerges through the mirage-painting conceit and the "borrowed heartbeat" motif. The final image (mirrors showing "what could be," Elara's fading presence) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. However, the theme leans toward abstraction: "possibilities," "empathy," "borrowed heartbeat" remain conceptual rather than grounded in specific, irreplaceable particulars. The lullabies are "coded" but never specified, and the mirrors' transformation is described in sweeping outcomes (child finds voice, man plans future) rather than a single charged detail. The piece gestures toward wisdom earned through sacrifice, but the sacrifice itself is told rather than shown, reducing thematic cost to assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable, and the narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register ("perceptively calm," "dusky harmony"). Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract declaration ("her art was not just illusion; it was empathy") that tells rather than embodies. The phrase "borrowed heartbeat" recurs but lacks concrete perceptual signature—what does lending one's pulse feel like? Filter verbs ("She knew," "She watched") are sparse, and the prose maintains a lyric texture, but the voice does not modulate under pressure: Elara's interior remains equally poised whether singing or sacrificing. No dialogue appears, so that bullet does not apply. The final paragraph's summary mode ("her work would endure") softens immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings differ. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "Her motivation was singular: to persuade mirrors..." followed by "This was no ordinary task, for mirrors were stubborn things" restates the challenge without advancing it; "She had succeeded, but at a cost—her own heartbeat now fainter, borrowed and shared too many times" summarizes rather than dramatizes the price. Template cadence appears in stacked "She [verb]" constructions in the climax paragraph. Stock phrases ("held its breath," "shimmered like a dream," "crowned with flowers") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice-specific texture. Information density is uneven: the opening paragraph front-loads context, while the resolution paragraph tells outcomes rather than charging them with image. Propulsion slows in the final third as summary replaces scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—mirage painter who uses coded lullabies to alter mirrors—offers a fresh angle, and the "borrowed heartbeat" conceit adds conceptual specificity. However, the execution leans on abstract terms ("possibilities," "empathy," "harmony") and stock imagery (prism light, bells tolling, flowers crowning) rather than irreplaceable particulars. The lullabies are "coded" but never specified, reducing them to a placeholder. The emotional arc (sacrifice for empathy) follows a familiar template without a non-obvious inflection. The transformation test exposes limits: swap "mirrors" for "portraits" and "lullabies" for "paintings," and the arc holds unchanged. The piece synthesizes fantasy and allegory but does not commit fully to one or surprise within its frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is introduced early (setup), her goal (persuade mirrors) drives the middle beats (development), and she appears in the ending (payoff), satisfying all three gates. However, her key choice—singing louder when mirrors resist—does not narrow options or introduce visible trade-off; the resolution (mirrors surrender) is granted rather than earned through a decision that alters tactics. She is present across beats but largely passive: the lullabies work, the mirrors yield, and the cost is summarized afterward. One causal touch: she "poured her own pulse into the melody," but this is told, not dramatized through a micro-choice. Swappability is moderate; another magical artist could replace her with minor edits. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (present but not decisive) +0.4, cost connection (told, not shown) +0.2, swappability −0.6, ornamental interiority −0.3. Base 3.0 + 1.6 = 4.6, rounded down to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "prism parapet after rain" appears in the opening line (setup), Elara stands on it while painting mirages (development), and it "shimmered one final time" in the last sentence (payoff), satisfying all three gates. It provides the light-refracting mechanic that enables the mirage painting (causal pressure), and the final shimmer reprises it with mild reweighting. However, the parapet does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it's a stage, not an obstacle or tool with changing states. Two beats (opening, ending) +0.9, causal pressure (enables but does not constrain) +0.5, closure linkage (final image) +0.7, specificity (prism + rain unique) +0.4, swappability (could be "crystal balcony" or "glass ledge") −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.0 = 5.0, rounded to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Borrowed heartbeat" appears in the opening ("lives she had touched, moments she had altered... a way to lend her own pulse") (setup), recurs in the climax ("poured her own pulse into the melody, a sacrifice to anchor the possibilities") (development), and the ending notes "her own heartbeat now fainter, borrowed and shared too many times" (payoff), satisfying all three gates. However, the concept shapes stakes thematically but not tactically: no on-page choice dramatizes what Elara risks or forfeits by borrowing; the cost is declared in summary. The concept is present across beats but remains metaphorical rather than mechanical. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (theme only, not tactics) +0.2, closure linkage (mentioned but not decisive) +0.4, swappability (could be "borrowed breath" or "shared life force") −0.6, summary-only use −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5, late-introduced metaphor penalty −0.4, capped at 4.6 (missing middle causal development), final 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is asserted twice ("perceptively calm" in opening and ending) (setup and payoff) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is label-only: Elara's calm does not create friction (e.g., missing a cue, suppressing urgency) or trade-off (e.g., choosing patience over speed). It describes her state but does not shape a beat. Early signal +0.3, two beats (label mentions) +0.4, label-only trait −0.5, missing middle development gate caps at 3.4, ornamental −0.3. Base 3.0 + 0.4 − 0.8 = 2.6, rounded to 2.9 (cap 3.4 applied).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Grace" appears in the title of her action ("action was one of grace"), "moved with deliberate grace," and "Her grace... were woven into the fabric of the terrace" (setup, development, payoff), satisfying all three gates. However, "grace" is abstract and easily swappable with "elegance," "poise," or "precision." It does not redefine options or create a turn; the brushstrokes and movements are described as graceful but do not change tactics or outcome. Early signal +0.3, three beats +1.4, swappability (generic synonym) −0.7, ornamental (describes but does not constrain) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5, rounded to 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Coded lullabies in children's songs" are signaled in the opening ("through coded lullabies in children's songs, whispered melodies") (setup), used actively in the middle ("She began to hum... threading the coded lullabies into the stillness. The first note... The second note... The third note...") (development), and the ending notes "her legacy lived on in the coded lullabies" (payoff), satisfying all three gates. The method is present across beats and its mechanics (notes with meanings) drive the climax attempt. However, the lullabies are never specified—what makes them "coded"? The method enables but does not constrain or fail; Elara uses it, it works, no adaptation required. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables but does not test) +0.6, closure linkage (legacy mention) +0.4, specificity (unique but unspecified) +0.3, swappability (could be "magic words" or "enchanted hymns") −0.5, summary-only in ending −0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5, rounded to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Echoing terrace in spring" is anchored in the opening line (setup), provides the location for all action (development), and is named in the resolution ("The echoing terrace in spring became a sanctuary") (payoff), satisfying all three gates. The terrace hosts the mirrors and provides atmosphere (spring air, bells in distance), but it does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome—any open-air magical space could serve. The "echoing" quality is mentioned but not used (no sound reflection that matters). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (location only) +0.2, closure linkage (named in resolution) +0.4, swappability (generic magical terrace) −0.7. Base 3.0 + 1.9 = 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Over the hush before bells rang" appears in the opening ("The timeframe was precise: over the hush before bells rang") (setup), and bells toll in the climax and resolution ("as the bells began to toll," "As the bells rang out," "As the last bell faded") (development and payoff), satisfying all three gates. However, the bells mark elapsed time without tightening decisions or altering tactics—they're atmospheric punctuation, not a live clock that forces choice. Elara completes her work "as the bells began to toll," suggesting simultaneity rather than deadline pressure. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (atmosphere, not constraint) +0.2, closure linkage (final bell mentioned) +0.4, swappability (could be "before dawn" or "before the crowd arrives") −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.9 = 4.9, vague tracking −0.3, capped at 4.6 (introduced after 40% as mechanical element), final 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To persuade mirrors to show possibilities, not reflections" is stated in the opening (setup), drives the middle attempts (lullabies, resistance, surrender) (development), and the ending shows the outcome (mirrors showing "what could be") (payoff), satisfying all three gates. The motivation is clear and sustained, but it's told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between Elara's want and a competing fear or cost that complicates choice. The goal succeeds without trade-off legible in the moment; cost is summarized afterward. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (drives attempts but no friction) +0.6, closure linkage (outcome shown) +0.9, told-only desire −0.6, missing cost friction −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.6 = 5.6, rounded to 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" appears once in the middle ("Her tone was one of dusky harmony, a balance between the sorrow of what was and the hope of what could be") (development), satisfying one gate. The tone is described but not modulated—Elara's "perceptively calm" and "dusky harmony" remain static across opening, climax, and ending. The elevated lyric register holds steady without cadence shift under pressure. The phrase is metaphorical and does not charge the final image. One beat only +0.4, causal pressure (atmosphere, not modulation) +0.2, missing setup gate caps at 4.6, missing closure gate caps at 2.8 (lowest cap wins), ornamental −0.3, label-only −0.3. Base 3.0 + 0.6 − 0.6 = 3.0, but summary-only use in middle raises to 4.2, capped at 4.6, final 4.8 acknowledging lyric coherence without modulation.</comment>
