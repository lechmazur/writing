<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias remains a static vessel for the theme rather than a character whose contradictory impulses drive the action. The six-month diagnosis is declared but never constrains a choice or creates visible struggle—he works "gently systematic" with "brazen calm" throughout, qualities that function as labels rather than embodied traits under pressure. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values; the orchard transformation proceeds frictionlessly. The final "smile" and closing eyes read as sentimental shorthand rather than earned endurance with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (orchard transformation + discovery sequence), but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs—each paragraph adds detail without narrowing options or raising cost. The ending offers Earned Stasis (Elias completes his work and dies), yet the cost remains abstract: we see no forfeited relationship, no tactical sacrifice, no path foreclosed by his choices on the page. Orientation anchors (temple orchard, Elias, terminal diagnosis) arrive early, preventing the Orientation Test penalty. Causality is functional but lacks pressure—discoveries about carvings and civilization simply accumulate without altering his tactics or forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The temple orchard, living stone pillars, and copper wire are vividly described and recur across beats, but they remain postcard elements—none constrains a choice or alters a tactic. The hollow pillars with carvings are discovered but do not force Elias to adjust his remodel plan. Spatial choreography is clear (central oak, surrounding pillars, branches forming arches), yet the setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible. The final golden-light image is purposeful but the environment itself exerts no pressure on the protagonist's decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—foster interspecies respect before death—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elias wraps branches, discovers carvings, and documents changes in a frictionless sequence. The orchard "approves," the pillars "glow," and the wind "whispers gratitude"—convenience plotting that rewards without cost. Agency is absent: the transformation succeeds without sacrifice, adaptation, or a trade-off that forecloses a live option. The ending offers no visible price paid; Elias smiles and dies, satisfied, with no dramatized consequence of his choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme—harmony between nature and design, interspecies respect—is declared repeatedly rather than emerging from concrete events: "a living symbol of unity," "respect we owe to every living thing." The botanical diary and copper wire recur, but their presence is ornamental; they do not constrain choice or accumulate new meaning at closure. The final entry moralizes the premise instead of offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. The orchard "whispers its gratitude," replacing earned complexity with sentimental validation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to Elias throughout. However, the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature—diction and rhythm stay uniform across calm and discovery beats without modulating under pressure. Filter verbs ("he noticed," "he felt," "he knew") appear frequently but read functional rather than voice-contaminant. The prose tilts toward elevated register ("testament to harmony," "chorus of voices") that feels imported rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "The orchard was alive, not just in its leaves and roots, but in its spirit" / "The orchard stood as a living symbol of unity." Template cadence appears in adjacent beats: "He began with… He worked… He noticed… He discovered… He realized…" (five consecutive stems). Stock metaphors recur without fresh angle: "ancient sentinels," "bridge between worlds," "chorus of voices." Figurative language clusters without payoff: "brazen calm," "living testament," "whispered its gratitude." Apply −1.0 for loops + template runs + stock strings. Information density is moderate; many lines restate theme rather than advance situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—dying caretaker revives ancient garden to foster unity—follows a familiar redemption-arc template without transformation. The copper-wire method and architectural secrets are specific details, but the emotional arc and resolution (peaceful acceptance, grateful nature, legacy fulfilled) could transfer to any similar story with minor edits. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the narrative proceeds in chronological comfort. The orchard's approval and the golden-light closure offer sentimental satisfaction rather than a non-obvious synthesis or complicating pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or creates a turn. He wraps branches, documents changes, and writes a final entry—actions that flow from his role rather than from conflicting motives or stakes. The six-month clock does not force a trade-off. His choices are procedural, not transformative. Functional but replaceable: another caretaker with the same goal would act identically.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears in the opening (marked page with copper wire), reappears when Elias documents changes mid-story, and returns in the final beat when he writes his last entry. Three touches across setup, middle, and closure meet the gate model's all-three threshold, eligible for ≥6.1. However, the diary's role is passive recording—it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure. The "map to architectural secrets" premise is declared but never dramatized: Elias does not consult it to solve a problem or navigate a decision. At closure, writing the entry is ceremonial rather than causal. Present across beats but static in function. Cap at 4.6 for lack of causal pressure or cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Architectural secrets (hollow pillars with carvings, orchard design mirroring temple structure) are seeded early, developed when Elias discovers the carvings mid-story, and invoked at closure ("no longer hidden"). All three gates present. However, the concept shapes understanding rather than altering stakes or forcing a tactical choice—Elias continues wrapping branches regardless of the discoveries. The secrets are theme-adjacent: they enrich setting and backstory but do not constrain an on-page decision or impose cost. Functional across beats but lacks causal pressure. Swappable test: "ancient wisdom" or "forgotten harmony" could replace "architectural secrets" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is mentioned twice ("gently systematic in his approach," "reflection of his gently systematic nature") but remains a label. No on-page moment shows the trait constraining an action or enabling a tactic—Elias's methodical wire-wrapping could occur without this descriptor. The trait does not create friction, force a trade-off, or differentiate his choices from a more impulsive caretaker's. Ornamental use without visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Remodel" is signaled early, drives the wire-wrapping sequence across multiple beats (oak branches, arches, canopies), and the transformed orchard stands at closure as the culmination of his work. All three gates present. The action creates the story's visible change (before: twisted branches; after: labyrinth of arches) and organizes Elias's tactics throughout. However, the remodel proceeds without obstacles or trade-offs—no failed attempt, no competing need that forces him to adjust. The action is central but lacks the friction or cost that would push it into the 8+ band. Strong beat involvement + closure linkage, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Copper wire appears early (diary marker, historical use on oak branches), is used actively in the central remodel beats ("Using copper wire, he carefully wrapped the branches"), and the "copper-wrapped branches" are visible in the final image ("copper wire glinted in the sunlight"). All three gates present. The method is specific and irreplaceable—removing "copper wire" in favor of rope or stakes would alter the historical continuity and the visual payoff. However, the mechanics are simple and do not impose constraint: the wire "seemed to hum with energy" (approval, not resistance). No moment where the wire's properties force Elias to adapt his approach or accept a cost. Functional across beats with closure presence, but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The temple orchard with living stone pillars is established in the opening, anchors all action (Elias works at the central oak, among the pillars), and the transformed orchard stands as the closure image. All three gates present. The setting is vivid and specific—hollow pillars with carvings, stone-and-tree interplay—and provides the stage for the remodel. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics: Elias's plan succeeds without spatial friction. The pillars "seemed to stand taller" at the end, an atmospheric shift rather than a mechanical one. Strong presence across beats and closure, but no demonstrated causal pressure. Lyric resonance (early seed → charged final image) is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The six-month diagnosis is declared in the opening and invoked at closure ("As the six months drew to a close"). Setup and payoff gates present; middle development absent—no beat shows Elias racing the clock or making a trade-off because time is short. The timeframe motivates his shift in purpose (told) but does not tighten a decision on the page. Missing middle development caps the element at 3.4. The deadline is functional context but replaceable: "after his retirement" or "before the new curator arrives" would work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Foster interspecies respect" is stated in the opening, restated mid-story ("wasn't just between humans and plants—it was between all living beings"), and echoed in the final diary entry ("the respect we owe to every living thing"). All three gates present in declaration. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicting choices: no moment shows Elias weighing respect for one species against another, sacrificing personal comfort for the orchard's needs, or facing friction between his goal and another want. The motivation organizes the plot but remains abstract. Functional setup and closure presence, but lacks friction or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Brazen calm" is introduced early and repeated at closure ("his brazen calm unbroken"). The tone is asserted rather than embodied—syntax and rhythm remain steady throughout, with no modulation under the discovery beats or at the terminal moment. The diction stays elevated and declarative regardless of pressure: "The orchard whispered its gratitude" matches the same register as the opening's "living stone pillars rose like ancient sentinels." No tonal shift charges the final image. The phrase functions as a character label rather than a lived atmospheric effect. Present at setup and closure but static, missing middle modulation.</comment>
