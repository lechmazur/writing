<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's actions follow a clear goal, but her "calmly inventive" nature is told more than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The mentor backstory and her knowledge of the cradle arrive via exposition rather than earned discovery. The final choice to activate the cradle feels undermotivated—Thorne's hesitation provides no genuine obstacle, and Elara's risk calculus remains abstract. Internal conflict is largely absent; she proceeds without visible doubt or cost to her certainty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows a causal chain: blackout → investigation → key discovery → confrontation → activation. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Elara "slips back into the shadows" with her revolution begun, but no on-page consequence alters her options or stance. Thorne's silence and the inhabitants stirring constitute a promising shift, yet the final image of Elara's quill holder "glinting in the light" offers symbolic recurrence without decisively reweighting her situation or foreclosing a path. The cradle's activation resolves the blackout conveniently, and no visible price is paid within the text.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The fort at twilight, dying torches, and half-painted sundial provide vivid anchors and the sundial's angles constrain Elara's investigative moves. Spatial choreography remains clear when Elara presses against the wall and Thorne emerges. Yet setting details lean descriptive rather than tactical—the blackout creates atmosphere but doesn't force resource trade-offs, and the inhabitants' darkened windows remain backdrop. The bronze quill holder functions as a tool in one beat, meeting the micro-setting criterion modestly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sparking a silent revolution—is signaled early. The sequence tightens from blackout to discovery to confrontation, but Thorne's arrival generates minimal opposition; his hesitation and loosening grip offer no real escalation. Elara activates the key without sacrifice or tactical adjustment, and the cradle's success is immediate and unqualified. The "silent revolution" rhetoric promises moral weight, yet no on-page cost or trade-off charges the final act. One meaningful pressure point (the confrontation) exists, but it deflates rather than deepens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of awakening versus enslavement emerges through the cradle and the "wake-up call" line, but that final phrase borders on thematic summary. The half-painted sundial and bronze quill holder recur, yet their symbolic charge is asserted more than earned—removing them would not break the thematic arc. The piece gestures toward revolution without bloodshed, but Elara's "winking hush" stance and quick success undercut the moral complexity promised by the setup. Subtext operates in Thorne's silence, a stronger moment than the declarative ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual signature is present in Elara's "calmly inventive mind" framing. Diction stays consistent, though phrases like "vigilant lock sentinel" and "cradle of sparks" tilt toward elevated register without clear voice motivation. Dialogue carries goal-driven subtext in Thorne's warning and Elara's reply, distinguishing the two speakers adequately. Psychic distance is controlled, but the final paragraph's "symbol of the knowledge and hope she carried" edges into explicative summary rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Sentences vary in structure and the opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. However, several template constructions appear: "Her attention turned to," "With a steady hand," "Elara's heart quickened," and the repeated "she knew" formulations across paragraphs create mild cadence repetition (−0.4). The phrase "winking hush" in the penultimate paragraph is vivid but arrives late and feels ornamental. Paraphrase loops are minor (e.g., "no ordinary intruder; their presence was tied to the blackout, to the cradle" restates connection without added detail). Information density is moderate; most sentences advance situation or thought, though the final image summarizes rather than charges.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The silent-revolution-via-hidden-mechanism premise is a familiar chosen-one/secret-keeper template without meaningful transformation. Elara's role as lock sentinel, the coded sundial, and the mentor's whispered secret follow well-trodden paths, and the resolution—activation brings immediate success—lacks irony or surprise. The blackout as veil and the bronze quill holder as inherited key are functional but replaceable. Emotional specificity is low; the inhabitants' enslavement is declared but not dramatized, and Elara's righteousness is untroubled by doubt. Premise penalty of −0.8 applied for derivative template without sufficient lived-in detail or non-obvious calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (tracing the sundial, inserting the key, activating the cradle) create the central turns. She appears by name in the opening and drives the investigation and confrontation beats, satisfying setup, development, and closure participation. However, her vigilance is more label than lived constraint—she observes and acts efficiently without tactical adjustment or visible cost tied to her sentinel role. Her decision to activate the cradle is stated as moral ("It's about them") but not dramatized through conflicting duties or sacrifice of her post. Swappability is moderate; another investigator archetype could replace her with minor edits. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7, but label-only vigilance −0.3, low specificity −0.5, minimal cost −0.4, and mid-story causal work caps the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder appears in three beats: Elara brushes it at her belt (paragraph 1), pulls it and traces the sundial's lines (paragraph 3), and it glints in the final image (paragraph 7). It is described as a gift from her mentor and its design matches the key's symbols, creating thematic linkage. However, its mechanical role is limited—tracing the sundial with it reveals the compartment, but the text does not clarify whether the holder's specific properties (shape, markings) enable this discovery or if any tool would suffice. The final glint is ornamental recurrence without reweighted meaning or cost. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, moderate causal involvement (one functional beat) +0.6, closure cameo (not active) +0.3, but swappability −0.6 (a generic tool could trace lines), ornamental final use −0.5. The holder shapes one key turn and reprises, placing it in mid-band; higher scores require irreplaceable mechanics or charged closure transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "cradle of sparks" is introduced via Elara's memory (paragraph 2), sought throughout her investigation (paragraphs 2–5), and activated in the climax (paragraph 6), providing the story's central stake and resolution. Its mechanics—a hidden mechanism tied to the sundial's coded angles—shape Elara's tactics (deciphering, finding the key, confronting Thorne). The activation produces immediate, visible consequences: the blackout ends, the light changes quality, and the inhabitants stir. However, the cradle's nature is abstract ("beacon," "wake-up call") and its revolutionary function is told rather than shown through inhabitant response or social friction. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, strong causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage (drives the climax) +1.4, but abstraction/told revolution −0.8, swappability (another hidden device could serve) −0.5, and summary-only inhabitant awakening −0.3. The concept is essential to plot structure and drives multiple beats, entering the 7.0+ zone, but abstraction and lack of on-page social cost prevent higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is introduced as a mental attribute (paragraph 2) and referenced once more when Elara's "calmly inventive spirit flared" (paragraph 5). The trait is asserted but not demonstrated through contradictory problem-solving under stress or visible trade-offs between calm and urgency. Elara proceeds methodically—tracing the sundial, hiding from Thorne, activating the key—but no on-page moment shows invention constrained by calmness or calm disrupted by need for speed. The phrase functions as a character label rather than a dramatized capability that alters tactics or incurs cost. Setup present (paragraph 2) +0.4, mentioned in crisis beat (paragraph 5) +0.4, but label-only treatment −0.7, no visible cost or constraint −0.6, swappability (another investigator trait would work) −0.5. The attribute is present and noted twice but does not demonstrably enable or constrain choices on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Intrigue" is framed as Elara's forte (paragraph 2) and manifests in her investigation: piecing together the blackout's strangeness, deciphering the sundial, uncovering the hidden key, and activating the cradle. However, "intrigue" as labeled action is broad—the specific moves (observation, deduction, confrontation) could be reframed as investigation, puzzle-solving, or rebellion without structural change. The story's turns trace to these investigative beats, but the action itself is not irreplaceable; another investigative method (following a map, interrogating an informant) could drive the same structure. Early signal +0.5, two distinct beats (discovery, activation) +0.9, causal pressure (drives middle and climax) +1.0, but swappability −0.8 (investigation/puzzle-solving would work), label-only in paragraph 2 −0.3. Intrigue shapes key turns and is present across beats, but its replaceability and abstract labeling keep it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "coded angles in a half-painted sundial" are introduced early (paragraph 2) as the cipher Elara must read, examined in detail when she traces its lines (paragraph 3), and the sundial base contains the hidden key compartment. The mechanism is signaled in setup, consulted in the middle investigation beat, and its solution (inserting the key into the panel) drives the climax. The half-painted state and coded angles are specific, but the text does not clarify how the incompleteness or angle code constrain Elara's method—she traces with the quill holder and the compartment reveals itself without puzzle friction. Early signal +0.6, two beats (examination, activation) +0.9, causal enablement (key's location) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, but lack of on-page puzzle mechanics (how angles encode location) −0.6, swappability (another hidden-mechanism riddle could substitute) −0.5. The sundial is essential to plot structure and present across beats, entering mid-to-upper range, but mechanical specificity is summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "luminous fort at twilight" is established in the opening sentence and recurs via dying torches, courtyard, and darkened windows. The fort's spatial layout (courtyard, walls, sundial, surrounding buildings) is clear and Elara uses the wall for cover when Thorne approaches (paragraph 4). The twilight and blackout create atmosphere, but neither directly constrains Elara's choices—she investigates freely, and the inhabitants remain passive. The fort functions as stage rather than active pressure; no environmental resource (locked doors, patrolling guards, time-limited darkness) forces tactical adjustment. Early signal +0.7, spatial coherence across beats +0.6, moderate closure presence (inhabitants' windows in final paragraph) +0.4, but postcard-level description (luminous/twilight/eerie) −0.5, no constraint on tactics −0.7. The setting is vivid and stable but does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome, placing it in mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "unexplained blackout" is introduced in paragraph 1 as the inciting condition and remains live until the cradle activates in paragraph 6, when "the blackout ended as abruptly as it had begun." It creates urgency (Elara's duties feel heavier, the fort is in darkness) and motivates the investigation. However, the blackout is not a ticking clock—no patrol schedule, dawn approach, or countdown limits Elara's investigation time. Thorne's arrival is simultaneous with discovery, not time-driven. The blackout's end is immediate upon activation, with no cost or complication. Early signal +0.7, present across investigation beats +0.9, causal linkage (motivates search) +0.6, closure participation (resolved) +0.5, but no on-page time pressure or countdown −0.8, convenient resolution (instant success) −0.6, vague duration −0.3. The blackout frames stakes and is present throughout, but it does not tighten decisions or force tempo trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "spark a silent revolution" is stated explicitly in paragraph 2 via mentor's whisper and reaffirmed in her confrontation with Thorne (paragraphs 5–6: "It's about them," "a wake-up call"). The revolution is framed as a moral imperative (awakening the oppressed populace without bloodshed) and drives her decision to activate the cradle. However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through internal friction—Elara shows no doubt, fear of failure, or cost calculation. Her righteousness is untroubled, and the inhabitants' enslavement is backdrop, not lived conflict. Early signal +0.6, two beats (investigation, activation) +0.9, causal pressure (drives climax choice) +0.9, but told-only oppression/enslavement −0.7, no on-page friction between want and fear −0.6, abstract stakes (revolution as concept, not scene consequence) −0.6. The motivation is clear and central but lacks embodied conflict or visible cost tied to Elara's personal risk.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Winking hush" appears once, explicitly labeled in paragraph 6: "Elara turned to Thorne, her expression a winking hush." The phrase suggests playful secrecy or knowing restraint, but the tone across the story is earnest and declarative rather than sly or sotto voce. The opening is gothic-atmospheric ("eerie stillness," "dying torches"), the investigation methodical, and the climax straightforward triumph ("This isn't a rebellion…it's a wake-up call"). Thorne's silence and Elara's final slip into shadows hint at subtlety, but the cradle's roar, cascade of light, and inhabitants stirring are overt rather than hushed. Late explicit mention (paragraph 6, ~85% through) −0.8, single static invocation (not modulated across beats) −0.5, tonal mismatch (earnest/declarative body vs. playful label) −0.6, ornamental use (label without craft support) −0.5. The tone label is present but not woven into voice, pacing, or imagery, and it contradicts the story's prevailing register.</comment>
