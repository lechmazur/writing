<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to cultivate lightness in grief") is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her whittling and internal monologue remain mechanical and abstract—"The knife cuts, the wood yields, and yet, nothing changes"—without embodied emotional specificity or a visible trade-off between contradictory wants. The brother's loss is summary-only backstory that primes the ending but does not create on-page micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final resolve ("a quiet resolve hardened") is asserted rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is adequate (farmhouse, turbines, Elara at table by ~100 words). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the whittled heart and final juxtaposition attempt a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("unyielding") rather than legible in a concrete action or forfeiture. The brother's fade and Elara's private ritual are recounted, not dramatized, so the closure image does not reweight prior on-page pressure. No meaningful escalation tightens options; the piece loops through description and reflection without a turn that narrows tactics or changes knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The farmhouse and turbines anchor locale early and recur at the window beat and closure. The whittled wood and dried bouquet function as micro-setting objects that constrain attention, but neither alters a tactical choice on the page. Sensory detail is selective (pale light, humming turbines, worn table) and filtered through Elara's priorities, yet the environment remains atmospheric rather than an active pressure that shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's need to honor grief within the mandate—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page decision with cost. The whittling is a private ritual, not a choice that forecloses an alternative or risks discovery. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the story loops through summary (brother's fade, mandate's grip) without a beat where Elara's action changes her situation or knowledge. The ending asserts resolve without demonstrating the price paid or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (grief under enforced happiness) emerges from the premise and objects but is stated rather than enacted: "she found a way to honor her grief, to cultivate lightness." The whittled heart and dried bouquet are symbolic but do not constrain a choice or shift meaning through on-page action. The final paragraph moralizes ("remain, in her own way, unyielding") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image. Subtext is minimal; interiority explains rather than implies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a consistent formal register ("as if the structure itself resisted," "a microcosm of her inner world"). Internal monologue is concrete at the whittling beat ("The knife cuts, the wood yields") but drifts into abstract philosophizing ("a metaphor for her own existence"). No dialogue. Perceptual signature is present (blank face, "remade hush") but flattens under emotional pressure into stock phrasing ("quiet rebellion stirred," "quiet resolve hardened"). Filter verbs ("seemed to echo," "felt like a taunt") dilute immediacy in multiple lines.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies with paragraph length, but sentence stems repeat ("She had," "The turbines," "Elara's"). Paraphrase loops appear: "emotional void" recurs four times; "quiet rebellion" and "quiet resolve" are near-duplicates. Abstract constructions dilute clarity: "the remade hush that enveloped the world" tells rather than shows. Peak beats (whittling, window press, final placement) lack propulsion and rely on "seemed," "as if," and passive voice. No major coherence breaks, but density is low and momentum lags through reflective summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The happiness-mandate premise is a recognizable dystopian template (emotion policing). Elara's blank-faced performance and private whittling are competent genre execution but lack a non-obvious twist or lived specificity that transforms the frame. The brother's off-page fade and the whittled heart as rebellion are familiar beats. The farmhouse/turbine contrast and "remade hush" phrasing add texture but do not synthesize into an inevitable, risk-taking final image. The story hedges toward safe median choices without bold perspectival or structural invention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her whittling and window gesture are described, not chosen under competing pressures. The "blank-faced performer" trait appears in exposition but does not constrain an action with visible cost. She observes and reflects; the final "quiet resolve" is asserted, not dramatized. Functional but largely passive; swappable with "grieving artist" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dried flower bouquet is introduced early (first paragraph), tied to the brother's memory (middle), and placed beside the whittled heart at closure. It recurs across three beats but remains a static emblem; Elara does not handle or use it in a way that changes her options. The final juxtaposition attempts thematic charge but does not reweight meaning through action. Two-gate coverage (setup, payoff) with lyric reprise lifts the score into mid-band, but lack of causal pressure or closure transformation caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Remade hush" appears twice as abstract description ("the remade hush that enveloped the world," "in the remade hush") but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. It functions as thematic backdrop rather than a rule or constraint that alters Elara's choices. Present and logically consistent with the mandate setting, but swappable with "enforced silence" or similar. No causal role; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Morally ambiguous" is claimed in exposition ("reduced to a morally ambiguous figure, performing scripted happiness while secretly yearning") but not dramatized through a choice with competing goods or harms. Elara's private whittling carries no on-page risk or trade-off. The label is told, not enacted. Present but ornamental; does not constrain or enable an action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Whittling appears in three beats: initial carving, resumed purpose after brother reflection, and final placement of the heart. The act frames the narrative and produces the closure object (whittled heart beside bouquet). It does not, however, drive a turn or decision that narrows options; the whittling is contemplative ritual rather than causal pivot. Early setup, middle involvement, and closure presence meet all three gates, but lack of causal pressure and swappability (any craft act could serve) limit the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Dramatically narrating mundane tasks" is described once in exposition ("her thoughts drifting as she dramatically narrated the mundane task in her mind") and enacted briefly in the whittling monologue ("The knife cuts, the wood yields"). The method does not recur, shape tactics, or charge the ending. It is a label-only trait mentioned but not developed. Present but ornamental; easily cut without impact.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The farmhouse and turbines anchor locale in the opening, window beat, and closure. The shadow imagery ("shadow of the giant wind turbines," "overshadowed by the turbines") recurs and attempts atmospheric weight, but the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Spatial detail is present (table, window, glass) but postcard-level; the turbines are symbolic pressure, not tactical obstacles. Early setup and closure participation without middle development or causal role places it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the happiness mandate" anchors backstory and motivates Elara's private ritual, but time is static within the scene—no clock or deadline tightens decisions. The mandate's enactment "years ago" and the brother's fade are summary. The timeframe provides context but does not shape on-page tactics or escalate pressure. Functional backdrop; vague and untracked within the scene window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To cultivate lightness in grief" is stated twice in exposition and motivates the whittling ritual, but the desire is not dramatized through conflicting on-page choices. The brother's loss primes the ending, yet Elara does not face a friction between cultivating lightness and another cost or want within the scene. The motivation is told and guides her action, but lacks the on-page trade-off or visible price that would elevate integration. Setup and thematic link to closure without middle friction or causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Emotional void is signaled early ("blank face," "devoid of expression," "emotional void") and sustained through the narrative with consistent formal diction and muted sensory focus. Tone modulates slightly at the window beat ("quiet rebellion stirred") and ending ("quiet resolve hardened") but remains largely static. The final image attempts to charge the void with the whittled heart's faint pulse, yet the effect is asserted rather than felt. Coherent and stable, with modest closure modulation.</comment>
