<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is characterized solely through summary labels ("infinitely patient," "enigmatic") rather than contradictory impulses shown in action. His motivation to restore balance remains abstract and unexplored; no micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values or internal conflict. The protagonist's actions are repetitive routines lacking genuine struggle or cost—he walks, listens, and the town passively responds without forcing difficult trade-offs. No embodied emotion or character-particular interiority; the piece reads as allegory with a placeholder figure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors are present early, so no penalty applies. However, no on-page closure unit exists—the story summarizes weeks of routine without a decisive change, choice, or moment where Elias forecloses a path with visible cost. The bell chiming at the end is a passive validation rather than a reconfiguration driven by Elias's agency; the "balance restored" is asserted, not dramatized. Lens ambiguity: the piece oscillates between causal promise (tuning fork, rhythm) and lyric accumulation without teaching a pattern or landing either cleanly. Cost is absent; the town awakens through described summary, not pressured action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setting details (archway, cobblestones, pine scent, bell tower) are vivid and consistent, filtered through a consistent atmospheric lens. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elias moves through it without friction. The archway and cobblestones are described but do not shape the outcome; they remain postcard backdrops. Spatial choreography is clear across the ghost town, and sensory hierarchy (sound, scent) remains stable, which prevents a lower score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the town's balance—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or choice narrows Elias's options; he walks daily and the town passively improves without opposition or cost. The ending bell is coincidental validation, not a consequence of protagonist agency under pressure. No visible price paid, no trade-off forced, no tactic altered by constraint. Escalation is replaced by iterative summary ("days turned into weeks") that flattens momentum.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of restoration through ritual and patience emerges from the events, but is stated overtly in the final paragraph ("power of patience, rhythm, and the wild hush") rather than earned through image. The tuning fork recurs but as token symbol without reweighting prior material—it functions identically each time. No non-literal answer to a central question; the ending explains rather than resonates. The piece gestures toward harmony and shared balance but remains abstract, lacking the particulars that would anchor universals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable without head-hopping, and narrative distance is consistent. However, the voice lacks perceptual signature—diction and syntax are generic ("faint scent of pine," "enigmatic," "wild hush") without character-specific filtering. Psychic distance never modulates; the narration maintains uniform elevation throughout, neither tightening under pressure nor reflecting Elias's particular way of noticing. No dialogue present to evaluate. Prose reads as competent but undistinguished, with recurring template openings ("His presence was," "It was as if").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "deliberate steps"/"measured"/"deliberate movements" recur across adjacent beats without adding pressure; "the town was awakening, step by step, note by note" restates what has been shown. Template cadence: "His X was Y" constructions repeat throughout. Stock metaphors ("heartbeat," "symphony," "ghosts") cluster without fresh specificity. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "as if," "as though") dull immediacy in high-frequency passages. The closure paragraph over-explains rather than landing on image. Density is low; many sentences restate prior content. Apply −1.2 for loops, template cadence, and stock metaphor strings across the piece; −0.3 additional for artifacts touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—rebuilding a ghost town through sound and footsteps—offers a lyric angle, but the execution follows a familiar allegorical template (patient mystic, symbolic object, gradual restoration) without transformation. No specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; the town's revival is asserted through summary rather than earned through particular struggle. The ending's "power of patience" moral reads as platitude rather than synthesis. Elias's actions are interchangeable across the weeks; no fresh inflection or turn reweights prior material. Derivative Premise Guardrail: −0.8 for close match to mystic-restoration templates without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout but his choices do not create key turns—he walks, listens, and repeats without a decision that alters tactics or options. The ending bell is a passive event, not a consequence of his agency. His role is observer and ritual performer, not active decision-maker under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The ebony tuning fork appears in the opening beat (placed against archway) and is held aloft in the final beat, but its use is static—it listens/hums identically each time without evolving function or reweighted meaning. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress; it remains a token symbol.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the core concept and shapes the framing stakes throughout. However, it is summarized across weeks rather than dramatized in on-page choices; the town's changes (vines retreating, cracks mending) are described outcomes, not pressured tactics. It echoes as theme more than it changes options in scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" is a label mentioned twice but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. Patience is asserted in summary ("his infinitely patient nature had paid off") rather than shown through a trade-off or choice under pressure. No scene demonstrates what he foregoes or endures because of this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is signaled early and frames the mission, but major turns do not trace to this action—Elias walks daily and the town passively improves. The rebuild is iterative summary rather than a decisive act with cost. It could be swapped for "restore" or "revive" with minor edits; the specificity of construction/rebuilding does not matter on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones is signaled in paragraph one, recurs in multiple beats (archway walk, daily routine), and is invoked at closure ("rhythm of his footsteps had become a symphony"). Its mechanics are described (steady cadence, each step a note) and it shapes attempts across the middle. However, it does not narrow options or face a test; Elias's method succeeds without friction or cost, reducing causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The ancient archway is introduced early as the symbolic gateway and Elias begins his work there; it recurs as a spatial anchor and appears in the final beat. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elias could perform the ritual anywhere. It remains postcard setting rather than micro-setting that pressures tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Before the collapse" is mentioned once in paragraph one to establish backstory but never tightens present decisions or tactics. No live clock or temporal pressure shapes Elias's moves; "days turned into weeks" compresses time without consequence. The timeframe is exposition, not a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To restore shared balance" is stated as Elias's motivation early and invoked at closure, but it remains abstract—no on-page friction between this desire and a competing cost or want. His commitment is told rather than tested; no scene dramatizes what he sacrifices or risks for balance. The motivation is label-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Wild hush" is named in paragraph one and the final paragraph, framing the tone as "quiet intensity." The descriptor modulates slightly (giving way to subtle vibrancy mid-piece) but remains a static mood overlay rather than charging the final image through rhythmic or tonal shift. It is asserted more than embodied in cadence or syntax.</comment>
