<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and stated ("to map empathy onto action"), but her interiority reads generic and abstracted. The "shadow-laced peacekeeper" trait is mentioned but never embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final act of placing the crystal ball feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; we see her processing reflections but no visible cost or foreclosed path that would validate the change. Embodiment is thin—"weighted breath" is the sole physical marker in a story that spans significant emotional terrain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (lighthouse orchard, ice floes below, vintage store). The drive lens reads as Accumulative—mirrors reveal fragments that accrue toward reconstitution—but the closure lacks visible cost: the fragments simply "rise from their corners" by "unseen force," resolving the problem without Elara's sacrifice or trade-off. The final image (crystal ball glowing, light spreading) asserts unity but does not reweight prior material with felt pressure. One transition (orchard to store) is clean, but the reconstitution beat is coincidental rather than agency-driven, undercutting closure validity under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard and vintage store are vividly anchored with sensory specifics: "crisp scent of salt and apple blossoms," "aged wood and dust," shifting mirror frames. The ice floes provide atmospheric grounding but do not constrain a choice. The crystal ball fragment is handled across multiple beats and returns at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography inside the store is clear (largest mirror, smaller mirror, pedestal at center). The setting serves mood and motif well, reaching the mid-6s, but does not force a tactical decision that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear: reconstitute the crystal ball to restore balance. The vintage store mirrors provide a meaningful tightening—each reflection narrows understanding and builds resolve—but the resolution is handed to Elara by the "unseen force" that assembles the fragments. No on-page reversal or trade-off forces her to sacrifice or choose between competing goods; the fragments float together without her agency driving the final act. Pressure accumulates through the mirror sequence but deflates when the climax arrives unbidden, capping the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (empathy mapped onto action, mending fractures) emerges from the mirror visions and reconstitution arc. The crystal ball functions as more than ornament, recurring with shifted meaning. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "a reminder that empathy, when mapped onto action, could mend even the deepest fractures" states the thesis rather than trusting the image to resonate. The "courageous anomaly" motif is abstracted (warrior, mediator) without grounding in Elara's own contradictory impulses. Subtext is present in the mirror visions but the ending explains rather than earns resonance, limiting the score to upper-5s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Narration stays within Elara's knowledge. Psychic distance is controlled, though elevated diction ("shadow-laced peacekeeper," "courageous anomaly") occasionally drifts into abstract register that feels more prompt-derived than character-specific. Sentence rhythm varies adequately. Elision at the reconstitution beat ("drawn by an unseen force") reads as purposeful compression but lacks embodied perception of how Elara experiences the assembly. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose carries a distinct, slightly formal texture that supports the mythic tone, earning low-6s for clean execution with minor register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is generally good; sentence openings vary. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "a time long past, a time when courage was not just an act but a way of being" restates itself without adding pressure. "She saw not her own reflection but a glimpse" is clean, but "this was not just a story; it was a blueprint" summarizes rather than shows. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "shadow-laced," "weighted breath," "pulse of the world," "rippled like water" cluster without cumulative payoff. The reconstitution sequence ("rose from their corners, drawn by an unseen force, fitting together with a soft chime") reads passive and abstract where embodied detail would sharpen impact. Minor scaffold and mixed register cumulatively lower to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—vintage store mirrors revealing fragments of a past self to guide reconstitution—offers a serviceable frame but closely matches template quest structures (gather fragments, restore artifact, unity restored). The "courageous anomaly" and "shadow-laced peacekeeper" labels read as worldbuilding tokens rather than lived transformations. The emotional arc (doubt to resolve) is generic; the final image of light spreading "across the world" overreaches without earned scope. No single turn feels inevitable in hindsight; swapping mirrors for another divination method would leave the arc largely unchanged. Occupies the serviceable-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara (shadow-laced peacekeeper) is present throughout and her motivation drives the search. She makes two key decisions: to enter the vintage store and to place the fragment on the pedestal. However, the reconstitution itself is enacted by "unseen force" rather than her tactical choice, limiting agency at closure. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but the final beat is done *to* her rather than *by* her. Functional but the climax undercuts full integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken crystal ball fragment is handled in the opening, held up to each mirror (three distinct beats), and placed on the pedestal to trigger reconstitution. It is essential to the plot: without it, the story has no anchor or goal. It appears in the ending ("the crystal ball was whole once more") and charges the final image (placed in the lighthouse tower). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, and visible cost (Elara's journey is defined by mending it) push this into the 7–8 range. Minor cap because the final assembly is coincidental rather than earned by her action with the fragment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" appears as a repeated label in the mirror visions (warrior, mediator) but remains abstract. It does not constrain Elara's tactics or force a trade-off; she observes examples of courage without enacting a specific courageous choice under pressure on the page. Present in setup and middle as thematic echo, absent from closure where her action is passive (fragments assemble themselves). Functional description, replaceable with "compassionate guide" or similar without structural loss. Caps at mid-3s for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is mentioned once ("Her calmly intuitive nature guided her") and describes her approach to the mirrors, but it does not enable a specific tactic or impose a visible cost. The trait is told rather than shown through micro-choices. Present in the middle but not setup or closure. Logically consistent but easily swapped for "perceptive" or "patient" without altering beats. Functional, replaceable, mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is the story's dominant goal and the ending hinges on it. Elara moves through the store to gather understanding, places the fragment on the pedestal, and the ball reforms. However, the reconstitution is triggered by external magic ("unseen force") rather than her direct action, diluting agency. Early signal (stated in paragraph 4), middle development (mirror sequence primes it), and closure participation (the ball reforms and is placed in the tower) satisfy all three gates. Causal role in the ending but with reduced protagonist control. Strong presence across beats but coincidental resolution caps it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vintage store mirrors are signaled early (paragraph 2), shape the entire middle sequence (three mirror visions that build Elara's resolve), and the final mirror reveals the solution. The method is specific and irreplaceable: without the mirrors, the reconstitution has no mechanism. Early setup, middle constraint (each mirror teaches a piece), and closure linkage (final mirror shows the whole orchard). The mirrors drive at least three beats and are causally essential. Solid integration across all gates, earning low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard is vividly described (salt, apple blossoms, ice floes) and bookends the story (opening and ending), but it does not constrain a choice. Elara stands in the orchard, moves to the store, then returns to place the crystal ball in the lighthouse. The ice floes are atmospheric but passive. Early setup, absent from middle development (action occurs in the store), brief closure reprise (lighthouse tower). The setting frames but does not pressure; postcard function with lyric reprise lifts it to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"The weighted breath before reply" is mentioned once in paragraph 5 ("Elara's breath caught in her throat—the weighted breath before reply") but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. No ticking timeframe constrains her choices in the store; she moves at her own pace. The phrase reads as ornamental metaphor rather than a functional timer. Absent from setup, token mention in middle, absent from closure. Decorative use, caps at low-2s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To map empathy onto action" is explicitly stated as Elara's motivation (paragraph 2) and echoed in the final paragraph's moral. It drives her search through the mirrors (understanding the anomaly's empathic approach) and her choice to reconstitute the crystal ball. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page moment where empathy conflicts with another want or costs her something visible. Early signal, middle relevance (mirror visions model empathy), closure mention (thematic statement). Functional but lacks embodied friction, mid-5s.</comment>
