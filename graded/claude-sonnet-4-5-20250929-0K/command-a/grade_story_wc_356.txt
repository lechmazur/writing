<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is established (cultivation of serenity), but her interior life remains generic and label-driven. The "undercurrent of wisdom" revelation arrives as an unearned epiphany—"a profound understanding of the interconnectedness of all things"—without embodied contradiction or prior struggle that would make the shift credible. Her actions (planting, watering, journaling) never force a trade-off with visible cost; the renunciation of pure ambition is told rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. The olfactory sensitivity is claimed but never constrains a decision or creates friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a final Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via acceptance of present over ambition). Orientation anchors who and where early; the "turning of the tide's thought" timeframe remains abstract and never tightens decisions. The closure—Elara's shift to "lighter heart" guided by wisdom—lands thematically but the cost is asserted rather than shown; no specific path is foreclosed on the page, and the journal entries "changing" is summary. The seed's aroma triggers insight, but the mechanism bypasses agency; the flower acts upon her rather than her wrestling with a choice the flower complicates.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The treetop village is vivid and purposeful—"homes built into sprawling canopies," "bridges of woven vines"—and the "wildflower hush" creates a coherent atmosphere. The garden's height ("edge of the highest bough") and the moon's glow anchor the pivotal evening scene. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains scenic rather than functional. The corpse flower sprout emits scent that drives the insight, meeting the micro-setting allowance, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the seed's growth and Elara's vivid dreams, but escalation is textural rather than dramatic; no choice narrows options or forces a trade-off. The "undercurrent of wisdom" surge is a passive revelation, not earned through Elara's agency. The story offers a deepening (recognition that ambition kept her from the present) but the cost is abstract; no live option is foreclosed on the page, only a stance adjustment told in summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—harmony of motion and rest, striving and surrendering—emerges organically from the corpse flower's gift and Elara's journey. The final paragraph avoids overt moralizing, letting the "lighter heart" and "newfound clarity" carry resonance. However, the thematic turn relies on a told epiphany ("she realized") rather than a scene-specific image or action that reweights prior material without explanation. The journal and doodles recur but remain decorative; they do not constrain a choice or charge the ending with non-literal meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a faint lyric quality—"wildflower hush," "dappled sunlight"—but register occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("interconnectedness of all things," "phenomenon the villagers believed synchronized"). The perceptual signature (olfactory) is claimed but underused; Elara's nose detects "hints of something ancient" without specificity. Diction remains consistent within the narrator's lexicon, and the closing image of intricate doodles and lighter heart maintains tonal coherence without forced resolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is clean and grammatically sound with purposeful sensory detail. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "the air shifted" immediately followed by "emitted a faint, earthy aroma"; "her ambition...had kept her from truly embracing the present" restates the serenity-versus-motion tension without added pressure. Template cadence: "She decided to journalize... She watered it... She closed her eyes" chains subject-verb stems across the middle. No filter-verb stacks or metaphor muddles; information density is moderate. Apply paraphrase-loop check (−0.2) and template-cadence penalty (−0.4), totaling −0.6 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise—ambitious herbalist cultivates rare flower and gains wisdom—follows a familiar template (striving → passive insight → acceptance). The treetop village and "turning of the tide's thought" offer fresh vocabulary, but the emotional arc (ambition yielding to serenity via epiphany) does not transform the template through specific lived cost or a non-obvious moral calculus. The corpse flower's role is symbolic convenience; it arrives as a gift and solves Elara's emptiness without her wrestling with a trade-off. Derivative premise guardrail applies: −0.8 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara plants, waters, journals, and receives the insight; her choices are preparatory rather than turning. The decision to journalize does not alter tactics or stakes. The final acceptance of a "lighter heart" is told in summary rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses ambition with visible cost. Present across beats but does not create key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed is planted early, watered with rainwater during the tide's turning, and emits the pivotal aroma that triggers insight. It shapes two beats (planting, evening scent) and contributes to closure. However, its role is passive catalyst; Elara does not handle it in a way that constrains a choice or imposes cost. The seed is essential to the premise but somewhat replaceable by any rare, symbolic plant.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"The undercurrent of wisdom" is named in the opening and returns at the pivotal moment as "a profound understanding." It is framed as the flower's gift but remains abstract—"interconnectedness of all things"—without shaping on-page stakes or altering tactics. It functions as theme rather than a constraint or choice-driver. Swappable with "ancient knowledge" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Olfactory sensitivity is introduced early ("most sought-after healer") and mentioned twice (detecting faint nuances, scents no one else could). Yet it never constrains or enables an action with cost; it remains label-only. The pivotal evening scent is available to any observer; her trait does not create a trade-off or inform a choice. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Journalizing is introduced in paragraph two and returns at the pivotal evening ("journal open on her lap") and in the closing summary ("journal entries changed"). It anchors two beats but does not drive a turn; Elara could reach the same insight without writing. The doodles become "more intricate" as summary rather than on-page demonstration. Functional but swappable with meditation or reflection.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The family custom of doodling on wrapping paper interiors is mentioned once as origin for her journaling practice but never shown or mechanically relevant. The journal doodles at the pivotal moment ("doodled absently") do not constrain the insight; the scent does. The method is present as backstory but does not shape attempts or outcomes. Ornamental setup without development or closure payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The treetop village is established early with vivid detail (canopies, woven bridges) and the garden's height provides spatial anchor for the pivotal evening scene. The "wildflower hush" carries atmospheric weight. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it frames rather than constrains. The micro-setting (garden perch) enables the scent moment, meeting lyric-resonance threshold for mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"The turning of the tide's thought" is introduced early and motivates Elara's collection of rainwater for the seed. It recurs as marker of when Elara experiences the veil thinning. However, it never functions as a clock that tightens decisions; the passage of days is vague, and the timeframe remains metaphorical rather than tactical. Present and consistent but does not alter moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to cultivate serenity within motion" is signaled early ("her sanctuary, a place to cultivate serenity within motion") and drives her garden work and journaling. The closure reweights it—she learns serenity is "not found in stillness alone but in the harmony of motion and rest." However, the friction between ambition and serenity is told rather than dramatized in a choice with cost. The motivation shapes the arc but without visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Wildflower hush" is introduced in paragraph three as "a silence so profound it seemed to hum" and returns in the final line as "constant reminder of the beauty in silence." It establishes a coherent quiet, contemplative tone that modulates with the evening revelation. The tone charges the final image and supports the accumulative design. However, it is somewhat interchangeable with "sacred stillness" or similar; specificity is moderate.</comment>
