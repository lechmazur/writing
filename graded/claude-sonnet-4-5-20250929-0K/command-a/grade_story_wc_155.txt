<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's interior is delivered through reflection and summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The motivation (rediscovering lost joy) is told in paragraphs 1 and 2, then confirmed by tears and realization in paragraph 6, but no on-page choice forces her to trade off competing values. The final "work complete" moment lacks visible cost—what did she forfeit or endure to paint the fog?</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive by ~80 words (Lira, ruined orchard, fog), so no penalty. Closure reads as Decisive Change (joy returns) but cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "her steps lighter" tells the shift without showing what path she foreclosed. The daydream framing ("within the fold of a daydream," "folded back into reality") is mentioned twice but never constrains a choice or shapes the ending image, leaving lens ambiguity—Causal or Accumulative?—unresolved at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The fog and ruins supply vivid atmosphere and the clearing/chamber provide spatial anchors. The fog becomes Lira's canvas in paragraph 7, which charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate partially. However, the "knowledge network" of mirrors and prisms is introduced late (paragraph 5) and operates off-page; its mechanics never constrain her choices on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (rediscovering lost joy) is clear. The piece offers a tightening when Lira finds the film and decides to use the network, but that choice arrives without opposition or trade-off. No reversal narrows her options; the fog "seemed to guide her" and the system activates smoothly. Cost is told ("her work complete") rather than shown through a forfeited path or visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (art as preservation of moments, not pigments) emerges through the projected images and Lira's realization in paragraph 6. The fresco fragment and film function as recurring motifs that reweight meaning at closure. However, the insight "her art had never truly been about the pigments" is stated directly rather than earned through a non-literal final image, and the closing paragraph summarizes theme ("painted with light and etched in memory") instead of trusting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV narration is clean with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in visual and light-focused description ("luminescent pigments," "glowing creation"). The prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction during reflection ("pensive mirth," "fluid within the fold of a daydream") that feels slightly above Lira's embodied state. Purposeful compression in the time passage ("Hours passed, or perhaps only moments") fits the daydream frame but is not paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and clarity is generally high. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph 2 cycles "gift/burden/unused" and paragraph 6 restates the epiphany across three sentences without added pressure. Template cadence in paragraph 5 ("she set out," "she reached," "she carefully loaded," "she activated") stacks four identical subject-verb stems without pattern-teaching. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, so apply −0.6 for loops and stems per Q7 penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "artist rediscovers passion in ruins" premise is familiar; the combination of light-painting and fog-as-canvas offers a fresh angle, but the execution is safe. The knowledge network and daydream frame are mentioned but not transformed through lived cost or risk. Lira's emotional arc follows a predictable template (loss → search → epiphany → restoration) without a non-obvious turn or calculus that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her choice to paint on the fog is the story's final action. However, her decisions (examine fragment, follow path, load film, paint) are not contested or forced by competing costs. She observes and acts without a meaningful trade-off visible on the page. Two gates met (setup, payoff in final image) but middle development lacks causal pressure. Swappability moderate; another artist archetype could perform similar beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The fresco fragment appears in paragraph 2 (setup gate met) and "stirred something within her," prompting the search. It is mentioned again in the final paragraph as part of the solved puzzle. Two touches across distinct beats, but neither constrains a choice or imposes cost. The fragment seeds curiosity but does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; it is listed rather than charged.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Exposed film is discovered in paragraph 3, loaded in paragraph 5, and drives the projection that illuminates the fog—three distinct beats (setup, development, payoff gates all met). The film's "warmth" and its images shape Lira's epiphany and enable her final painting. Causal pressure is moderate; the film unlocks the network rather than narrowing her options under stress. Specificity is high (film properties matter) but cost tied to the film itself is absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is mentioned in paragraph 2 (vials of luminescent pigments, unused for months) and enacted in paragraph 7 when she paints on the fog. Two beats, setup and payoff gates met. However, the trait does not constrain her—she opens the vials and paints fluidly without friction or trade-off visible on the page. The attribute is more thematic label than tactical lever; no cost is tied to using light versus another medium.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Display" (activating the knowledge network to project images) occurs in paragraph 5 and is the hinge that enables the final painting in paragraph 7. Two beats, setup and payoff. The action drives the story's major turn (projected images lead to epiphany) and is causally essential to closure. However, the display itself is executed without cost or complication—she loads film and the system "hummed," then "swirled," with no resistance. Removing display would break closure, but the action lacks on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "knowledge network" is introduced in paragraph 4 ("she knew of a knowledge network… she had studied its principles"), signaled mid-story (no setup gate). She reaches it in paragraph 5 and activates it to project the film. Two beats (development, payoff gates). The network enables the climactic display, but its mechanics are told ("mirrors and prisms") rather than shown constraining her choices. Late arrival (paragraph 4, past 40% mark) caps at 4.6; causal role in two beats and closure linkage lift within band to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district with thick fog is established in paragraph 1 (setup gate met) and recurs as atmosphere throughout. The fog becomes Lira's canvas in paragraph 7 (payoff gate met), charging the final image. The setting pressures mood and supplies the medium for closure. However, the ruins do not constrain Lira's choices—the fog "seemed to guide her" and paths reveal themselves conveniently. Three beats (opening, middle atmosphere, ending canvas) with closure linkage, but tactical constraint is soft.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" is mentioned in paragraph 5 and again in paragraph 8 ("as the daydream folded back into reality"). Two mentions, but both are narrative commentary rather than on-page pressure. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—"Hours passed, or perhaps only moments" acknowledges fluidity but imposes no urgency or cost. The daydream frame is ornamental; removing it would not break story logic or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to rediscover lost joy is stated in paragraph 1 ("seeking something elusive, a spark of the lost joy") and confirmed in paragraph 8 ("she felt the lost joy return"). Setup and payoff gates met. The desire drives the search and is referenced in the epiphany (paragraph 6: "tears streaming down her face"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page friction between rediscovering joy and a competing cost. The joy "returns" without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Pensive mirth" appears once in paragraph 7 ("guided by the pensive mirth that now filled her heart") during the climactic painting. The tone elsewhere is atmospheric and earnest without mirth; pensiveness is present in reflection, but the playful or joyful dimension does not modulate across turns. Single explicit mention, late arrival (final third), no setup or development gates. The tone label does not charge the final image or cohere across pressure points.</comment>
