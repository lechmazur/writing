<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to capture the density of presence") but never tested by contradictory impulses or genuine internal friction. The supposed "scientifically romantic pursuit" reads as label-only; no on-page micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Kael exists as a convenient audience, supplying trust and curiosity without applying opposition or forcing a trade-off. The final "transformation" is asserted ("they had done more than capture a moment—they had transformed it") without dramatized cost or a path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing closure via the nautilus shell glow and "revalue" language, but the cost remains abstract—no concrete action is foreclosed, no relationship altered, no visible price paid. The "by returning differently" method is explained in dialogue yet never demonstrated through linked tactical beats; the shell glows, they touch it, and the world feels "richer" without causal tightening. Under an inferred Accumulative lens, the closure image does not reconfigure prior stakes with legible pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ember nexus is vividly evoked ("burnt orange and deep violet," "pulsing with a rhythm") but functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint. The nautilus shell is handled twice (held, then touched), yet its physical properties do not alter tactics or enable a meaningful choice. Spatial choreography is clean, and the twilight modulates with the ritual, but no environmental element narrows Elara's options or charges the final image with causal weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("capture the density of presence") is signaled early but remains conceptually abstract throughout. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; the shell glows, Kael touches it, and success is declared without visible cost or tactical shift. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency—Elara hums, the nexus "bends," and the transformation is asserted rather than earned. The final "revalue" language does not dramatize what was risked or lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme ("capture the density of presence," "scientifically romantic," "by returning differently") is announced rather than dramatized through concrete choice. The nautilus shell recurs but does not accumulate new meaning; it glows at the climax without reweighting prior material. The ending offers no resonant, non-literal answer—only a summary statement ("we've found a way to carry this with us, forever") that abstracts the experience. Subtext is minimal; gesture and silence do not carry implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping. Diction elevates into abstraction ("scientifically romantic pursuit," "palette of resolve," "directed spontaneity") that clashes with the concrete action layer, creating register drift in peak beats. Dialogue serves exposition ("I've been working on something—a way to revalue what we think we know") rather than pursuit or evasion. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara's way of noticing does not feel character-specific. Sentence openings vary, but rhythmic control does not modulate with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "The object was more than a relic; it was a key" restates without added pressure; "This isn't just a shell. It's a palette of resolve, a tool to anchor moments" cycles through synonyms. Template cadence runs: "Elara's motivation was clear... Elara explained her method... Elara smiled." Stock metaphors ("fragment of a forgotten star," "promise") in the closure beat dull immediacy. Filter verbs ("felt it," "felt the weight," "knowing that") stack in the final third. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 for loops and template stems touching the ending; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise (alchemist captures ephemeral moment via mystical shell ritual) follows a well-worn template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "scientifically romantic" label and "ember nexus" setting read as ornamental rather than integral to character logic. Emotional arc (shared secret → glowing ritual → declared success) could transfer unchanged to different names and objects. No fresh inflection emerges; the turn is asserted rather than earned in hindsight. Applying Derivative Premise Guardrail: −1.0 adjustment for template reliance without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and speaks, but her choices do not create key turns. She explains her plan, hums, and chants; Kael's participation is passive assent. The "transformation" is declared rather than earned by her tactical decisions. Setup present, but no middle choice under constraint, and closure participation is declarative ("This is it"). Missing development gate caps at 3.4; ornamental use (description without pressure) −0.5; summary-only mention of her "genius" −0.3. Final: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The nautilus shell columella curl appears in the opening (setup), is held and explained in dialogue (beat one), then touched and glows at the climax (beat two, closure). Early signal +0.6; two beats +0.9; closure linkage +1.0; specificity (spiral grooves, columella curl) +0.4. However, the shell's unique properties do not constrain choice or enable tactics under stress—it is a prop that glows on cue. Swappability (any mystical artifact could replace it with minor edits) −0.6. Final: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"A palette of resolve" is mentioned once in Elara's dialogue as a metaphor for the shell, but it does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. The phrase is thematic decoration rather than a force that alters options or costs. No setup, no middle development, no closure participation beyond a single label. Missing all three gates; ornamental use −0.8; label-only −0.3. Final: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Scientifically romantic" appears as a character label in narration ("her scientifically romantic pursuit," "her scientifically romantic heart") but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with visible cost. The attribute is told, not shown through a tradeoff between empirical rigor and emotional intuition. Setup present (mentioned early), but no middle choice, no closure cost. Missing development and payoff gates; label-only −0.6; ornamental use −0.5. Final: 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Revalue" is stated in dialogue ("a way to revalue what we think we know") and echoed at the end ("the world had been revalued"), but the action itself is abstract and occurs off-stage. No major turn traces causally to a concrete act of revaluation; the shell glows and the characters feel different. Setup present, closure mention, but no middle beat where revaluation alters tactics. Missing development gate caps at 3.4; swappability (any mystical verb—"transform," "recalibrate"—would work) −0.6; summary-only use −0.4. Final: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"By returning differently" is explained in Elara's dialogue ("Not in the sense of revisiting the past, but in reshaping how the present is perceived") and echoed at the end ("By returning differently... we've found a way to carry this"), but the method is never demonstrated through causal mechanics or tactical choices. Setup present, closure mention, but no middle beat where the method shapes an attempt. Missing development gate caps at 3.4; summary-only use −0.5; swappability −0.4. Final: 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The ember nexus at twilight is vividly described in the opening (setup) and modulates at the climax ("the ember nexus pulsing with a rhythm," "returned to its twilight calm"). Early signal +0.6; two beats +0.9; closure linkage +0.8. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome—it is atmospheric backdrop. Swappability (any liminal nature site would serve) −0.7; ornamental use −0.6. Final: 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"In the moment a secret is whispered between friends" anchors the opening ("In the moment a secret is whispered... Elara knew this was the time to act") and the secret is named ("The secret they shared was no longer just words"). Setup present, closure mention, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions—the ritual unfolds without time pressure or a live clock. Missing development gate caps at 3.4; late closure mention without tactical constraint −0.4; swappability (any twilight gathering would work) −0.5. However, the framing does charge the final bond image slightly, lifting within the cap. Final: 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To capture the density of presence" is declared early ("Elara's motivation was clear: to capture the density of presence") and echoed at the climax ("This is what it means to capture the density of presence"). Setup present, closure mention, but the desire is never dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs. Missing development gate caps at 3.4; told-only (no friction) −0.8; summary-only use −0.4. The motivation frames the action, lifting slightly within the cap. Final: 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Directed spontaneity" is mentioned once in narration ("a directed spontaneity, as though the moment were unfolding exactly as it should") but does not function as a coherent tonal through-line. The tone is elevated and mystical throughout without modulation or tension. No setup, single mention in the middle, no closure charge. Missing setup and payoff gates; ornamental use −0.7; label-only −0.4. Final: 3.6.</comment>
