<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The crawl space dweller remains a charitable abstraction rather than a contradictory individual. Motivation is stated ("to become visible") but never tested by a concrete on-page choice with visible cost—the character works methodically, finds fragments, and smiles at the end without foreclosing any path or paying a price. Interiority relies on therapy-adjacent phrasing ("their own cached memories," "letting the words wash over them") that labels rather than embodies. The final "smile" and sense of connection arrive unearned, with no prior struggle or competing impulse dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening but "dawn" never tightens into a clock that alters tactics. The piece strings together discovery beats (finds fragment, follows pipes, finds more fragments, hears recording) in and-then fashion without because/therefore pressure or a meaningful narrowing of options. The ending declares fulfillment ("uncovered a way to connect") but no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or visible cost occurs—the dweller returns to the crawl space with fragments "ready to share" in a future the text does not dramatize. Lens reads as intended-Causal but executes as summary-Accumulative without density increase or cadence shift at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush," pipe chases, and the alcove are vivid and consistent. The library's spatial layout (aisles, corners, alcove descent) guides the search sequence and the cold air marks depth, meeting micro-setting utility. However, no environmental constraint forces a choice or charges the final image—the dweller moves freely, and the setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to become visible"—is declared but never tested by opposition, scarcity, or trade-off. Discovery proceeds without setback: each step yields another fragment, the process is "slow, methodical" but unobstructed, and the tape reel "hums to life" without failure or cost. No reversal, deepening, or tightening choice narrows options; coincidence (finding exactly what is needed) drives all turns. The resolution ("they had uncovered a way to connect") is asserted rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory preservation and connection emerges through the tape reel fragments and the dweller's parallel caching of their own memories. The final line ("ready to share their story with those who needed it most") states the thematic answer rather than letting a resonant image do the work. The piece avoids overt moralizing in the body but the penultimate paragraph's summary ("To become visible was not just to be seen—it was to be heard, to be remembered, to matter") functions as explicit thematic declaration. Recurrence of "cache" and "fragments" is purposeful but does not reweight under pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is mostly consistent, favoring elevated register ("sapphire hush," "ferromagnetic," "methodical soul") that reads voice-motivated for a lyric frame. However, perceptual signature is generic—sensory details (cold air, faint hum, dim light) could belong to any careful observer. The dweller's interior texture does not shift under the emotional arc; phrases like "their kindly heart full" feel externally imposed rather than emerging from the character's particular way of thinking.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is maintained and grammar is clean, but paraphrase loops and template cadence reduce propulsion. "Their motivation was clear" / "Their motivation burned brighter" / "their motivation had been right" recycles the same stem. "They thought of… they thought of…" and "Each fragment revealed… a snippet… a fragment…" are synonym churn. Figurative language ("sapphire hush," "metallic veins," "thread woven through time") appears densely without pattern-teaching or closure payoff, trending toward purple without muddle. The final paragraph stacks summary sentences that restate fulfillment rather than advancing image or action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Core premise—hidden helper discovers artifacts in a library—follows familiar "secret guardian" and "memory preservation" templates without a non-obvious transformation. The crawl space dweller's kindly methodical nature, the ferromagnetic tape fragments, and the dawn setting are specific in vocabulary but generic in function: any reclusive archivist finding any lost recordings would yield the same emotional arc. No fresh inflection or bold risk distinguishes this from other "helper seeks visibility through preserved voices" narratives; the piece hedges toward median safety rather than committing to a transformative angle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Crawl space dweller is present throughout and makes micro-decisions (emerges, searches, works, smiles, returns) but none narrow options or foreclose a path with cost. The character observes, discovers, and reflects without agency-driven turns. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is ornamental (returns to crawl space with fragments) rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ferromagnetic tape reel fragment appears early (paragraph 2), is examined and felt for sense memory (paragraph 2), accumulated through the search (paragraphs 4–6), and hums to life in paragraph 7. It shapes two beats (discovery, restoration) and ties to the dominant stake (connection through preserved voices). However, it does not constrain a choice or create visible cost—the dweller finds and restores fragments without obstacle. Closure linkage is present (tape reel hums, message plays) but the element enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Sense memory is mentioned once ("felt a flicker of sense memory: the warmth of a voice…") in paragraph 2 and echoed thematically ("their own cached memories") but does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page. The concept is ornamental: removing it would not break the search-and-restoration arc. Setup gate is met; development and closure gates are absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is labeled in paragraph 1 ("kindly methodical soul, their movements deliberate") and paragraph 5 ("Their kindly nature urged them") and paragraph 6 ("The process… was slow, methodical") but never constrains a choice or exacts a visible cost. The trait describes behavior (careful, purposeful) without friction—no moment where methodical caution conflicts with urgency or kindness costs the dweller safety. Setup gate is met; development shows repetition without pressure; closure ("their kindly heart full") is label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Cache" appears in paragraph 3 (fragment is "a piece of a cache"), paragraph 4 ("the tape reel fragments and the cache"), and throughout as the search goal. The action of uncovering the cache drives the middle sequence and is completed at closure ("they had uncovered more than a cache of memories"). All three gates are met. However, the action is mostly summary ("worked tirelessly," "process… was slow") rather than dramatized beats, and any similar discovery (uncovering letters, recordings, diaries) would function identically. Causal role is present but specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Pipe chases" are introduced in paragraph 2 ("library's pipes chased along the walls"), used as navigation in paragraph 4 ("followed the pipe chases deeper"), and spatial guides in paragraph 5. The method shapes the search path (setup and development gates met) but does not constrain tactics or create friction—the dweller follows pipes without difficulty. Closure participation is absent; the final scene mentions fragments but not the pipe chases. Functional but replaceable: any structural guide (shelves, stairs, tunnels) would serve equivalently.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Shadowed library at dawn" is anchored in the opening sentence and sustained ("sapphire hush," "forgotten corners," "hidden alcove"). The setting provides atmosphere and spatial structure (aisles, alcove, descent) but does not pressure choices—the dweller moves freely without access constraints, light/dark timing issues, or resource scarcity. Dawn's temporal pressure is unused (see 9 H). Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is weak (setting mentioned but not causal). Micro-setting use (alcove, cold air) is present but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"While the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" is mentioned in paragraph 1 and resolved in paragraph 7 ("the city's lights flickered back to life, but the crawl space dweller barely noticed"). The outage provides context but does not tighten decisions—no race against restoration, no dependence on darkness, no tactical shift when lights return. The dweller works through the night but elapsed time is vague ("as dawn broke"). Setup gate is met; development and closure gates are absent. Easily removable without altering the arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To become visible to those who need you" is stated in paragraph 1 ("Their motivation was clear: to become visible"), echoed in paragraphs 5 and 7 ("their own desire to become visible"), and resolved in paragraph 8 ("To become visible was not just to be seen—it was to be heard…"). The motivation drives the search (development gate met) and is declared fulfilled at closure. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no moment where becoming visible risks the "safety of their hidden sanctuary" (mentioned once, never tested). Desire is consistent but lacks friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" appears in paragraph 1, paragraph 4 ("sapphire hush deepening"), and paragraph 6 ("sapphire hush lending an air of reverence"), then gives way to "morning's light" in paragraph 9. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (deepening with descent, retreating at dawn) but remains static mood rather than charged pressure. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is ornamental (tone shift mentioned but not causally active in the final image). The phrase recurs but does not reweight the stake or constrain a choice.</comment>
