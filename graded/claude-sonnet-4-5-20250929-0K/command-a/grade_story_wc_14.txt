<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to collect invented histories is stated but never tested by a meaningful choice or contradiction. Her "studious nature" and "earnest" demeanor are label-only traits; no on-page action reveals a trade-off or cost. The climactic moment—charting the hum—proceeds smoothly without internal conflict or a decision that forecloses a path. Interiority remains generic ("heart raced," "hands trembling") with no embodied contradiction or character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens infers as Accumulative/Textural: the hum intensifies and yields a memory-fragment. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. However, no decisive change, renunciation, or felt cost lands on the page; Elara simply "closes her notepad" and descends satisfied. The ending registers as mood completion, not closure with visible price. The story teaches a pattern of listening/charting but does not pay it off with a reconfiguration that alters options or meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth is vivid and specific ("moss-covered ground," "miniature worlds"), and the fluorescent lamp anchors time. The forest setting is described but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—it amplifies atmosphere without tactical pressure. The final image ("trees seemed to whisper their approval") is decorative rather than charged with cost. Spatial choreography (flat stone, paths) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting a new invented history—is signaled early, and the hum intensifies ("stronger, more insistent"). Yet no reversal or tightening narrows options; the discovery arrives without obstacle or trade-off. Elara's agency is passive reception, not decision or renunciation with cost. The resolution ("gift from the forest") is coincidental rather than earned by protagonist action, and no visible price alters tactics or the final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (memory, preservation, connection to place) emerges from imagery and the "invented histories" concept. The final image—Elara descending with the notepad, hum echoing—gestures toward resonance but offers no non-literal answer or reweighting of prior material. "Incandescent restraint" appears as a phrase but is not dramatized through texture or choice. No epiphany is earned; the ending restates the premise ("her life's purpose") without complication or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with consistent narrative distance. Diction is elevated ("gilded-leaf stationer," "fluorescent lamp," "incandescent restraint") and occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("blooming labyrinth," "veil between times") that feels more authorial than character-filtered. Perceptual signature is generic—"heart raced," "mind already turning"—without idiosyncratic texture. No dialogue present to evaluate. Sentence rhythm is uniform, missing modulation under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean with no major loops or artifacts. However, filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("seemed to amplify," "felt different," "knew this story was special"), dulling immediacy (−0.5). Sentence openings repeat stems: "Elara's method," "Elara's heart," "Elara smiled." Information density is low; many lines restate mood without advancing situation. The climactic paragraph ("story that unfolded") summarizes instead of dramatizing the discovery, reducing propulsion at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The core premise—charting a hum to collect invented histories—offers a fresh surface but executes as a generic "artist discovers ancient memory" template without transformation. The bonsai labyrinth and fluorescent lamp are imaginative details, yet the emotional arc (solitary seeker finds fulfillment) follows a well-worn path with no non-obvious turn. No risk-taking heightens stakes; the discovery arrives without complication or moral calculus. Specificity in world-building does not extend to character voice or thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and pursues her goal, but her choices are passive (listening, writing) without altering tactics or facing a trade-off. No key turn results from her decision; the hum intensifies on its own. Present in setup, development, and closure, but without causal pressure or cost tied to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The notepad appears in three beats: early description, charting session, tucked into satchel at end. It is handled and returns at closure, but its meaning does not shift; it remains a static repository. No choice hinges on the notepad's specific properties—swappable with "journal" or "tablet" without structural impact. Present across all three gates but lacks irreplaceability or cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Invented histories" frames the stake and appears in the climactic discovery, but the concept does not constrain tactics or force a choice. It functions as thematic label rather than on-page mechanism. Present in setup and payoff, but ornamental in middle; no decision turns on whether a history is invented versus real. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" is asserted ("earnestly," "studious nature," "meticulous") but never constrains an action with cost. The trait could describe any diligent character. No on-page moment where studiousness enables a discovery or forecloses a path. Label-only, present but ornamental (−0.6 total: label-only −0.3, ornamental −0.3).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Refract" appears twice: once in the opening abstract ("refracting the textures of different times") and once in the charting paragraph ("could refract it, bending its light"). The action is described, not dramatized; no beat shows the mechanics of refraction altering an outcome. Swappable with "decode" or "translate." Present in setup and middle, but missing from closure participation. Late-development, summary-only (cap 4.6).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The method—charting the hum via the fluorescent lamp at dawn—is signaled early, shapes the central beat (Elara sits, charts, the lamp flickers), and brackets the timeframe. The lamp's mechanics (why it emits the hum, how charting extracts histories) remain unexplained, reducing specificity. Present in all three gates and drives one key beat, but the mechanics are told rather than shown, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth is vividly described and frames the action spatially. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource—Elara moves through it without obstacle or tactical adjustment. The forest "amplifies the hum" (told) and "whispers approval" (decorative). Present in setup and closure image, but ornamental in function. Postcard description without micro-setting constraint (−0.5 ornamental, −0.3 swappability).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" anchors the timeframe early and recurs ("town below would soon awaken"). However, time does not tighten decisions—Elara's session proceeds without urgency or deadline. Dawn approaches but imposes no cost or constraint. Present in setup and closure mention, but the clock does not alter tactics. Vague tracking, no live pressure (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation—to collect textures of different times—is stated early, drives the goal (charting the hum), and is reaffirmed at closure ("her life's purpose"). Yet it is never dramatized in conflict; no choice pits this desire against a competing want or cost. Told and consistent, but lacks friction. Present in all three gates, drives one beat, but no visible trade-off (−0.5 for told-only desire).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Incandescent restraint" appears once as a phrase ("With incandescent restraint, she tucked the notepad") but is not sustained as tonal texture. The prose alternates between lyric elevation ("blooming labyrinth," "veil between times") and generic summary ("heart raced," "mind already turning") without modulation under pressure. Tone does not charge the final image or shift with escalation. Single static mood, ornamental mention (−0.6).</comment>
