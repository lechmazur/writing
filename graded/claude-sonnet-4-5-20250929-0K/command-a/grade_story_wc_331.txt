<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reawaken the library's secret is declared but never tested against a meaningful on-page obstacle or cost. Her "sanely eccentric" trait remains a label without constraining a single choice. The climactic doorway moment lacks embodied emotion—no contradictory impulses, no genuine struggle, just smooth passage through escalating wonder. The final return to normalcy resets stakes without visible forfeit or endurance cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is present (who, where, when by ~120 words). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the escalation consists of three sequential book-rearrangement beats without narrowing options or raising felt cost. The doorway appears as a reward rather than a reconfiguration earned by prior pressure. The ending restores order without legible on-page cost—Elara knows a secret, but no path is foreclosed, no visible price paid. Closure form reads as Conceptual Repricing attempt, yet the conceptual cost is asserted ("protect it") rather than dramatized in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The library is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (whispers, groaning shelves, moonlight through dusty window). Books physically constrain her rearrangement choices across three beats, and the scarf returns at closure to charge the final image. However, the patron presence is mentioned but never pressures Elara's actions, and the "infinite expanse" inside the doorway lacks spatial grounding—no distances, no tactile interaction beyond "fingers brushing."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reawaken something lost—is signaled early but remains abstract. Three book-arrangement moves escalate in symbolic complexity (spiral, fractal, Möbius) without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. No reversal: the scarf floats, the doorway appears, she enters without cost. The closing paragraph asserts her guardian role but no on-page action forecloses an alternative path or demonstrates visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus fading emerges through the scarf's frayed-then-whole arc and the "place where stories live" conceit. The hyperbolic-geometry method and analog-memories anchor offer conceptual cohesion. However, the final paragraph delivers a thesis statement ("the library was more than a building; it was a living, breathing entity") rather than trusting the image. The doorway sequence leans toward spectacle without a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-limited POV is stable; Elara's perceptual filter (equations on napkins, scarf as talisman) is consistent. Diction remains controlled, though phrases like "sanely eccentric" and "observed solitude" read slightly external. The final paragraph shifts toward summary narration ("she knew the truth") instead of holding the experiential lens. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is adequate. Minor scaffold appears: "The scarf was her talisman" and "She believed the library held more than words" are expository tells that could be shown through action. The phrase "sanely eccentric" recurs without dramatization. The final beat compresses causality ("When she returned…the patrons were gone") without tracking elapsed time or her passage back through the doorway, creating a small sequence gap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The hyperbolic-geometry method and analog-memories frame offer a fresh angle on librarian-guardian tropes. The scarf's tactile presence and Möbius-strip arrangement show specificity. However, the "place where stories live" conceit and the guardian-who-protects-secrets resolution echo familiar fantasy templates without transforming them through unexpected moral calculus or lived cost. The proximity to "secret library portal" narratives is close.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her rearrangement actions drive the three middle beats. However, her "odd-hour librarian" designation does not constrain or enable a single on-page choice—day-shift or night-shift would not alter tactics. She observes, arranges, and enters without decision friction. Present in closure (returns to the library, vows to guard), but her role there is summary rather than active choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scarf appears in beat one (dusty window, faded emerald threads), functions as courage-cloak in beat two, slips and floats midair in beat four, glows and guides in beat five, and wraps whole in beat six. Handled across five beats with evolving states (frayed → vibrating → floating → glowing → whole). The final wholeness reweights its earlier fraying, signaling the library's restoration. However, the scarf does not constrain a choice or block a path—its changes are effects, not causes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Analog memories" is named early ("a relic from a time when analog memories were still tangible") and echoed in the doorway vision ("preserved in analog perfection"). It frames Elara's motivation but does not alter her tactics on the page—she could pursue "lost stories" or "forgotten magic" with identical moves. Present as thematic claim, not as a mechanic that changes options or costs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" appears twice as a label ("her sanely eccentric habits a rhythm known only to the books" and "her sanely eccentric nature guiding her with precision") but never constrains or enables an action. We are told she is eccentric; we do not see a specific eccentricity force a trade-off or enable a tactic unavailable to others. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is the stated mission in beat one and the verb recurs ("the library was awakening"). The three book-arrangement steps are framed as reawakening methods. The doorway and the library's secret are the objects reawakened. Present across setup, middle, and closure. However, "reawaken" is swappable with "unlock," "reveal," or "restore" without altering story logic—moderate specificity, no unique cost tied to the reawakening verb itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is introduced in beat two ("The concept had obsessed her for months"), sketched on napkins (summary), and governs the three arrangement patterns (spiral mimicking scarf edges, fractal network, Möbius strip). It is named at the climax ("the hyperbolic geometry unlocked the library's secret"). Present across setup, middle, and closure. However, the mechanics remain decorative—any mystical-math system could serve the same function. The geometry does not impose a specific constraint or choice cost, and no failed attempt tests its limits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is anchored early (whispers, shelves, dusty window), and its three sections (poetry, science, children's) provide the spatial structure for the three arrangement beats. The library's physical layout enables Elara's spiral, fractal, and Möbius moves. At closure, the library is the entity she vows to guard. Present in setup, middle (spatial resources), and closure (the guardian claim). The setting supplies the arena and the tools; removing "scientific poetry library" for a generic archive would flatten the hybridity that justifies hyperbolic geometry and the scarf's aesthetic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"While patrons browse" is established in beat one ("Tonight, while patrons browsed with hushed reverence") and recurs once ("Patrons glanced up… Elara ignored them" and "The patrons had long since stopped browsing, now standing in silent awe"). The patrons witness but do not pressure Elara's actions or impose a time limit. When she returns, "the patrons were gone" with no tracking of elapsed time or consequence for her absence. Present but does not tighten decisions or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To find the place where stories live" is stated in beat two and drives the arrangement sequence. At closure, she finds it, sees it fading, and decides to protect it. Present in setup (desire declared), middle (pursuit through geometry), and closure (found and vow made). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—no on-page friction between wanting to find versus fearing what she'll lose, no visible cost for the finding itself. The shift from "find" to "protect" occurs off-page ("Elara realized") rather than through a choice beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is embodied early (Elara moves "like a shadow," patrons maintain "hushed reverence," her focus is "observed solitude"). The tone holds through the middle beats (patrons watch in "silent awe"). At closure, solitude is reaffirmed ("the patrons were gone"). Coherent across the arc. The tone supports the reflective mood but does not modulate with pressure—wonder replaces solitude in the doorway sequence without cost or tension, then solitude returns unchanged. Static rather than charged at the final image.</comment>
