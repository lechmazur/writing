<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity is asserted repeatedly but her micro-choices under pressure are thin—she follows a beam of light without genuine internal conflict or cost. The phrase "diligently curious" and "sociable isolation" are label-only descriptors never embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Captain Thorne's disappearance is told backstory that doesn't tilt present stakes through an on-page micro-choice. The final smile and realization arrive without visible cost; she ascends with the map as if the discovery were frictionless.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear causal lens (decode symbols → follow beam → discover chamber → obtain map) and orientation anchors arrive early (airship, navigation chamber, Elara at work). However, the closure effect is a discovery without visible cost or foreclosed path—Elara gains the map and her journey "is just beginning," which defers the decisive change off the page. The beam appearing and the hatch opening feel coincidental rather than earned by protagonist agency. One meaningful tightening occurs (symbols → glow → beam → hatch), but the ending supplies triumph without a felt price, weakening the closure's resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The airship interior is anchored with purposeful detail (brass hull, navigation chamber, hopscotch board, stern hatch) and the starling murmurations outside create atmospheric texture. The hopscotch board constrains Elara's method and the hidden hatch at the stern shapes the discovery. Sensory selection remains visual-heavy; other senses are underused in the crystalline chamber. The setting provides resources (the board, the hatch) but does not pressure a choice with cost—Elara follows the beam without environmental resistance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (chart the next great discovery) is signaled early and remains coherent. The story delivers one tightening: symbols → glow → beam → hatch → chamber, but this progression feels mechanically sequential rather than escalatory. Elara's agency is observation and following rather than a decision that narrows options or imposes trade-off. The ending grants the map without visible cost—no sacrifice, renunciation, or foreclosed path—leaving pressure unfelt at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of perseverance and discovery is stated overtly through the phrasebook's "Persevera" and Captain Thorne's quoted epiphany in Elara's mind. The hopscotch board and stranded luminance function as symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest thematic points rather than emerging from prior particulars. The final paragraph moralizes ("The greatest discoveries are made not by those who seek the light, but by those who dare to follow it") and the closing image of the compass rose formed by starlings is overt rather than resonant. Subtext is minimal; the story tells its theme rather than earning it through choices with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries period-appropriate diction ("*Lumen via, lux perennis*"). Psychic distance is controlled with no head-hopping. However, interiority leans toward scaffold phrasing ("her heart racing," "her breath catching," "her fingers tracing") and the single line of dialogue is a whispered epiphany rather than goal-driven exchange. The perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices what the plot requires without character-particular bias. Under pressure, the voice remains even rather than modulating with urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean and generally clear, but carries noticeable template cadence: "her fingers tracing," "her quill hovered," "her hand moving," "her notebook clutched" across multiple beats. Figurative language is sparse but the stock phrase "sociable isolation" appears twice without dramatization. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance multiple jobs (e.g., the phrasebook introduction) but others loop conceptually (the hopscotch board is "peculiar" then "said to hold the key" in adjacent lines). No major loops or artifacts obscure causality, but rhythmic variety and propulsion are limited. The opening and closing images are competent but not charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The antique airship and hopscotch-board-as-compass premise offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc (curious apprentice decodes mystery, finds hidden chamber, claims prize) follows a familiar treasure-hunt template without transformation. The stranded luminance and polyglot phrasebook are ornamental rather than integral to character conflict. Captain Thorne's disappearance and the mentor's voice echo stock beats. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis; the story opts for median choices that avoid stakes. The final image of starlings forming a compass rose is a tidy symbolic flourish rather than an earned reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her observation drives the sequence, but her choices are minimal—she follows a beam rather than deciding between options with cost. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is passive (she ascends with the map). Functional but replaceable; another curious character could occupy the same role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in the opening (Elara traces its dog-ear), returns when it slips from her lap to reveal a constellation map, and the word "Persevera" echoes at closure. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure—it supplies information but does not shape cost. Two beats, setup and closure reprise, but swappable with any mentor's artifact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stranded luminance is introduced as the hopscotch board's secret, discovered in the crystalline chamber, and declared unlocked at closure. It shapes the dominant stake (find the light) and appears in the final image ("no longer trapped"). All three gates met and it drives two beats (board glow, chamber discovery). However, it does not narrow options or impose visible cost; Elara gains it without sacrifice. Causal role present but lacks felt cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is label-only, appearing twice in narration without constraining an on-page action or enabling a choice with cost. Elara's curiosity is asserted but not dramatized through a tradeoff. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Noting drives the sequence: Elara notes symbols, notes the recurring motifs, notes the dot sequence, and her notebook is clutched at closure. Setup, development (she decodes the board by noting patterns), and payoff (notebook tucked under arm as she prepares to chart) all present. The action is specific to her role and enables the discovery. However, easily swappable with "decipher" or "record" and does not impose cost. Strong beat involvement but mid-band irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hopscotch board is introduced early, its symbols correspond to the phrasebook, the glow emanates from it in the middle beat, and it forms the beam that leads to the hatch. The method is signaled, demonstrated, and paid off; its mechanics (symbol-to-word decoding, light-beam compass) matter to the discovery. All three gates met, two beats of causal pressure, closure linkage via the map's matching symbols. Could score higher with visible cost tied to the method, but it drives the plot and is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The airship is present throughout and supplies the navigation chamber, stern hatch, and hidden lower chamber as resources. Setup and development gates met; the setting enables discovery. However, it does not pressure a choice or impose cost—Elara moves freely through its spaces without constraint. Functional but largely a backdrop; swappable with any exploration vessel.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Starling murmurations are mentioned in the opening, their flight patterns mirror the hopscotch board, and they form a compass rose at closure. Present in setup and payoff, but absent from development. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or shape tactics; the murmurations are atmospheric ornament. No causal pressure or cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elara's desire to chart the next great discovery is stated early and frames the quest. It appears at closure ("her journey was just beginning"). Setup and payoff met, but the motivation is never tested or conflicted—she pursues discovery without cost or competing want. Functional stake but lacks friction; swappable with any explorer's drive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is named twice but not coherent through the narrative. Elara is described as alone yet surrounded by artifacts, but the tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image—she ends celebratory and anticipatory. The phrase is ornamental rather than structuring; the story's mood is steady wonder without the isolation's cost dramatized.</comment>
