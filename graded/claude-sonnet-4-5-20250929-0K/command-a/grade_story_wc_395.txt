<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—finding deleted files—is stated but never dramatized through internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her "brightly attentive" attribute is label-only; no scene shows the cost or tradeoff of this trait. The decision to "lie" and continue investigating offline appears abruptly without prior internal conflict, and the final choice to "expose the truth" lacks visible cost on the page—it reads as declaration rather than earned renunciation or stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—"who" (Elara) and "where" (archive) emerge quickly, but the inciting event (the patch discovery) and its connection to her current task remain vague past 120 words, warranting −0.4. The closure unit—Elara stepping out with coordinates memorized—reads as a setup for future action rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; no visible cost forecloses a path here. The causal lens is claimed (numbers → coordinates → decision) but key links are told in summary: "She realized the Echo-7 crew hadn't crashed—they'd been taken" offers insight without dramatized discovery or tactical shift on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The archive setting is functional but mostly abstract: "vast digital expanse" and "old terminal" lack sensory specificity or spatial choreography. The patch—frayed fabric with faded gold emblem—is described twice but never handled or used to constrain a choice. The song plays in the background without altering Elara's perception or tactics. Micro-setting opportunity (body, tool) is missed; the final image does not charge the setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving the cold case—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The recurring numbers provide a pattern but no meaningful tightening: each discovery (timestamps, user IDs, song rhythm, coordinates) adds information without narrowing options or forcing a tradeoff. The system lockout and bypass sequence is told in summary ("she bypassed the archive's security protocols") rather than dramatized with tactical cost. The final decision to "expose the truth" lacks on-page consequence or visible price; the story ends on intent rather than action with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of absence and buried truth is declared overtly: "The sensed absence in the archive was a mirror of the void left by the missing crew" is direct statement rather than resonance from image or action. The song title "The Echo of Forgotten Songs" and the final line "Across the echo of forgotten songs, the truth would finally be heard" are on-the-nose thematic bookends. No epiphany is earned through specific struggle on the page; Elara's insight arrives via audio file exposition. The recurring numbers motif is introduced but never reweighted at closure—they remain a code, not a changed meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent third-limited with appropriate filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt"). However, the perceptual signature is generic: Elara's professional lens as "memory keeper" does not shape what she notices or values in character-specific ways. Diction remains neutral and unvaried under pressure—"Her heart raced" and "her mind racing" are stock embodiments. The Dr. Mara audio-file exposition ("The numbers are coordinates...") carries plot efficiently but lacks subtext or indirection; it tells what the story needs rather than what the character would say mid-crisis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops: "the recurring numbers began appearing everywhere" is restated as "They showed up in timestamps, user IDs, even the archive's metadata"; "sensed absence, a void in the data" is echoed as "The sensed absence wasn't just in the data—it was in the company's silence." Template cadence in the middle section: "She pulled up the song... She dug further... She decided to lie... She replayed the file." Information density is moderate but momentum stalls in the exposition-heavy final third. No figurative muddle, but no rhythmic control under pressure either; syntax remains uniform throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Core premise—corporate archivist uncovers space-mission conspiracy via recurring numbers—is familiar and not transformed through specific world logic or character tradeoffs. The recurring-numbers-as-coordinates conceit is resolved via exposition (audio file) rather than earned discovery. The patch, song, and numbers feel like prompt-fulfillment tokens rather than inevitable story elements; the story could function with alternate clues (e.g., timestamps only, or a different artifact). No bold structural risk or fresh angle on the "lone investigator uncovers hidden truth" template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as "corporate memory keeper" frames her access to the archive but does not constrain a choice or create tradeoff. Her professional skill (noticing patterns) is mentioned but never tested under pressure—she finds every clue without struggle or cost. The lie to her supervisor is mentioned in passing but does not alter tactics or create friction. Present but replaceable: another role with archive access would serve equally well.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The patch appears in the opening ("frayed piece of fabric with the mission emblem") and returns in the final line ("With the patch in hand"). It is described but never handled or used within beats—Elara does not examine it, compare it to records, or use it to unlock information. The two-mention reprise reweights the patch symbolically (relic → talisman of action) but without causal pressure or middle development. Functional but ornamental; caps at ~4.6 for missing middle gate, reduced slightly for no on-page handling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "missing persons cold case" drives the investigation premise and shapes Elara's goal throughout. It appears early and connects to the closure decision (to expose the truth). However, the case itself is abstract—no victim names, no personal stakes for Elara, no trade-off between solving the case and other duties. The concept shapes one key turn (the decision to investigate further) but does not narrow options or create friction. Present across setup, development, and payoff with moderate causal pressure, but lacks specificity and cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" is mentioned in the opening ("served her well in this role, allowing her to notice patterns others overlooked") but never demonstrated on the page with cost or tradeoff. Elara finds every clue without missing or misinterpreting anything; no scene shows the attribute constraining her or creating blind spots. Label-only use without scene pressure; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The lie to her supervisor ("telling her supervisor she was working on routine maintenance while she continued her investigation offline") is mentioned once in summary and does not create a turn or consequence. No scene dramatizes the deception, no follow-up shows risk or fallout. The investigation continues without friction from this choice. Present but does not redefine options; swappable with "worked after hours" or similar low-friction alternatives.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Recurring numbers (7, 14, 21, 28) appear in multiple beats: timestamps, user IDs, metadata, song rhythm, and finally as coordinates. Signaled early and developed across the middle, shaping Elara's search pattern. However, the mechanics are passive—she observes the pattern rather than testing or using it to narrow choices. The coordinates payoff is told via audio file rather than earned through on-page puzzle-solving. Two gates met (setup, development) with moderate causal role but weak closure participation; trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "social network archive" setting provides access to deleted files and metadata but does not constrain Elara's choices—she bypasses security "using an old terminal" without spatial or procedural friction. The archive is described in abstract terms ("vast digital expanse," "forgotten corners") without sensory grounding or micro-setting detail. It enables the investigation but does not pressure tactics or charge the final image. Functional but replaceable with any secure database setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears only in the final line as a lyric flourish. It is not a dramatized timeframe—no clock, deadline, or temporal constraint shapes Elara's decisions. The phrase echoes the song title but does not reweight prior material with cost. Ornamental; absent from setup and development, minimal closure participation without causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To find where deleted files go" is Elara's stated motivation and drives her investigation across beats: searching the archive, bypassing security, accessing hidden folders. However, the desire is never conflicted on the page—no trade-off between this goal and other duties, relationships, or values. The final decision to "expose the truth" shifts the goal slightly (from finding files to publicizing findings) without dramatized friction. Shapes multiple beats but lacks visible cost; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Sensed absence" is named explicitly ("She felt a sensed absence, a void in the data"; "The sensed absence in the archive was a mirror of the void left by the missing crew") but not embodied through perception or action. Tone remains declarative and explanatory throughout, with no modulation under pressure. The final image does not charge the absence with new meaning—it restates the theme. Present but told rather than shown; label-only tone that does not cohere through turns.</comment>
