<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final acceptance feels asserted ("felt a sense of peace") without visible cost or dramatized struggle—no foreclosed path appears on the page. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("richly perceptive mind sifting through layers") instead of embodied, character-particular perception. The seashell and figure are props rather than pressures that force micro-choices with consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "where the universe hums its secret song" and "serpentine nexus" remain abstract metaphors past 120 words without spatial or temporal grounding (−0.4). The closure—Elara gazes into a pool, sees memories, receives an explanation, then walks away singing—delivers exposition rather than a decisive change with felt cost. The vision sequence tells the reader the answer ("echoes were not random but deliberate") instead of dramatizing a choice that forecloses options. No single inferred lens dominates by midpoint; causal momentum stalls in the chamber.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The nexus remains generic dreamscape description ("labyrinth of shadows and light," "liquid starlight") without physical constraint or tactical pressure. Spatial choreography is vague—Elara "wanders," "approaches," "steps through"—without legible distances or obstacles. The seashell grows warmer but does not alter her next action. The environment never narrows a choice or charges the final image; it functions as backdrop only.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"why some people echo"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. Elara's journey involves no reversals or tightening; she seeks, finds a figure, looks into a pool, and receives the answer without sacrifice or competing pressures. The figure's test ("ensure you are ready") is passed by declaration ("I am") with no visible price. Escalation is absent; the structure is quest-and-exposition rather than pressure accumulation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through direct statement rather than scene particulars: "the echoes were not random but deliberate" and "some people echoed because their lives touched others" are told conclusions. The final paragraph moralizes ("her melody a part of its eternal symphony") instead of offering a resonant image. The seashell and pool function as symbolic convenience rather than earned motifs that reweight prior material. No non-literal answer to the central question appears; the piece explains rather than resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("richly perceptive," "reed-blown melancholy," "serpentine nexus") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. The figure's dialogue blends "countless others" yet remains generic ("born of memory," "forged in fires of desire"). Perceptual signature is weak—Elara's way of noticing does not distinguish her from a generic quester. Distance is consistent but lacks purposeful modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "richly perceptive mind sifting through layers of sound and shadow" and "webs of intrigue began to unravel" stack metaphors without clarity (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "The air was thick with... ancient secrets" / "ground... pulsed with the rhythm of the cosmos" restate mood without advancing action. Scaffold phrases recur: "her voice rising," "her hand tightening," "she stood firm." Template cadence in the final paragraph ("The universe hummed... Elara sang along... her melody") flattens propulsion (−0.6 cumulative in Q7; artifacts touch closure, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The quest-for-mystical-truth frame with a guide figure and vision pool follows template fantasy-journey structure without fresh inflection. "Why some people echo" remains abstract; no specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus transforms the premise. The ending's cosmic-unity resolution ("her melody a part of its eternal symphony") echoes countless mystical-journey conclusions. Risk-taking is absent; the piece occupies the safety middle with generic symbolism.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara appears in every paragraph but her choices do not create turns. She wanders, approaches, steps through, kneels, gazes—observation and compliance rather than decision. The figure directs; she follows. No on-page choice alters tactics or narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The seashell appears in three beats (paragraph 1 carried, paragraph 3 grows warmer, paragraph 7 glows), but its function is static talisman. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it signals mood only. The glow at the end is ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Webs of intrigue" is mentioned twice as atmospheric metaphor ("webs of intrigue that lay ahead," "webs began to unravel") but never dramatized. No on-page intrigue—schemes, competing factions, or hidden agendas—appears. The concept is label-only, not enacted.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive" appears as repeated label ("richly perceptive canyon echo singer," "richly perceptive mind," "richly perceptive nature") without constraining or enabling action. The trait does not create a tradeoff or cost; it is asserted decoration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Ensure" appears in the figure's dialogue ("ensure you are ready") but does not drive a turn. Elara's reply ("I am") is declaration, not action. The word could be replaced ("confirm," "verify") without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Progressive disclosure" is mentioned in paragraph 2 ("through progressive disclosure, each revelation building upon the last") but the method is told, not demonstrated. The pool vision delivers one batch of images; no multi-stage revelation shapes Elara's tactics or forces intermediate choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The "serpentine nexus under starlight" frames the story (paragraph 1, final paragraph reprise) but never constrains a choice. Elara moves through archways and chambers without spatial obstacles or resources that alter her approach. Setting is postcard metaphor rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"While the universe hums its secret song" bookends the piece (paragraph 1, final paragraph) as lyric refrain but no narrative clock tightens decisions. Time is untracked; Elara's journey duration and any deadline are absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To learn why some people echo" is stated (paragraph 1 "question that had long troubled her") and the pool vision answers it (paragraph 5–6). The motivation drives the quest structure but is never dramatized through conflicting wants or on-page cost. The answer is delivered without sacrifice or friction between desire and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"Reed-blown melancholy" is mentioned twice (paragraph 2, paragraph 6 "giving way to quiet resolve") as mood label. The tone does not modulate with scene pressure—elevated lyricism remains constant. The shift from melancholy to resolve is told rather than charged through rhythm or image.</comment>
