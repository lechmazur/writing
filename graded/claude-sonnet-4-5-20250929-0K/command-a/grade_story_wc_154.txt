<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is present but the internal contradiction necessary for tension is absent—she moves through decryption without meaningful doubt or cost until the ending. The "lotus-hearted ache" and "shrewdly innocent" labels replace embodied emotion; we're told she's conflicted but shown smooth execution. The anesthetic mention is ornamental, never constraining a choice. Backstory about her translator work exceeds 25% without anchoring in present micro-choices that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (atrium, Elara, twilight). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the coral fragment glows, notes unknot in stages, mist swirls, and the ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration ("the ocean still sings" as Charged Poise). However, the cost at closure is asserted rather than demonstrated—stepping into the night with "quiet determination" does not foreclose a visible option or show a felt price. One meaningful deepening occurs (child's plea → map → promise), meeting the minimum for this length, but the closure image lacks the undeniable pressure required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is vividly rendered with scent (jasmine, damp earth) and tactile detail (condensation on glass). The coral fragment's glow and the cast's surface provide micro-setting anchors. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Elara's decryption proceeds unimpeded by spatial or material limits. The final image references the atrium as "threshold" but the shift is metaphorical rather than a function of setting pressure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decrypting the child's notes to protect a memory and promise—is signaled early and tightens once (fragmented phrases → map → plea). However, no reversal or live obstacle complicates the work; the coral "pulses in rhythm" as encouragement rather than resistance. The ending reconfigures Elara's stance (determination, voice for the voiceless) but the cost is told ("lotus-hearted but no longer aching alone") rather than shown through a foreclosed option or tactical sacrifice. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening is present but without visible price at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory, resilience, and translation emerges organically from the coral, cast, and Elara's role. The child's phrase "The coral remembers what we forget" and "Tell them the ocean still sings" avoid overt moralizing and offer resonant images. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("unknot the past and graft meaning onto the future") rather than letting the image stand alone. The prompt-concept labels ("shared anxieties," "lotus-hearted") echo too cleanly in narration, reducing subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("mist-clad," "lotus-hearted ache," "threshold") and maintains internal consistency. However, perceptual signature is generic—word choice (jasmine, condensation, marble) could belong to any contemplative narrator. The metaphor density ("shield too thin," "threads of language," "beacon of hope") approaches ornamental in high-pressure beats without a taught pattern. Elision of the decryption mechanics is purposeful compression, acceptable under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied syntax and strong imagery. However, several passages loop: "unknot" appears four times with similar constructions; "lotus-hearted ache" recurs identically; "shared anxieties" and "pulse/pulsed" repeat without adding pressure. The anesthetic mention ("necessary numbness") is scaffolding that never returns. Metaphor density in the middle third (coral glowing, mist swirling, air holding breath) stacks figurative language without clear payoff at closure. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the transformation, triggering −0.4 for paraphrase loop and −0.3 for stock metaphor strings.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The coral-as-relic and translator-decrypting-child's-cast frame is specific and non-generic. However, the emotional arc (isolation → purpose through discovery) follows a familiar template without transformation. The "ocean still sings" phrase offers lyric resonance but the plot mechanics—decryption succeeds smoothly, no obstacles—reduce surprise. The mist-clad atrium and war-zone setting provide atmosphere but don't generate a fresh moral calculus or non-obvious synthesis. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: transformation is partial, triggering −0.7 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as translator frames the decryption. However, she makes no difficult choice—the work proceeds without internal conflict or external obstacle. Her decision to "step into the night" is a continuation, not a turn. Present in setup and development, absent from a causal choice at closure: two gates met, cap ~6.0; swappability (any empathetic professional would serve) and lack of cost-tied action lower the score to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The brain coral fragment appears in three beats: marble table, pulsing with revelations, and placed back as "beacon of hope." It returns with reweighted meaning (resilience symbol → steady glow) at closure. However, it is never handled or used to constrain a choice—it sits as backdrop. Setup, development (thematic), and closure reprise earn two gates; lyric resonance lifts above 5.5, but lack of causal pressure and high swappability (any relic could serve) cap below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Shared anxieties" is named twice but never dramatized in a choice. The mist "carries whispers of those who had suffered" but this remains atmospheric rather than tactical. The concept is thematic overlay without on-page pressure that alters Elara's options. Present in setup as label, ornamental in middle, absent from closure mechanics: one gate (setup) met weakly, cap 4.6; ornamental use and label-only treatment trigger −0.3 each.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is mentioned once in the opening paragraph and never returns. No action demonstrates the contradiction between shrewdness and innocence; no cost is tied to the trait. Absent from development and closure: zero gates beyond label-only setup, cap 2.8; label-only use and summary-only mention trigger −0.4 combined.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unknot" appears four times, driving the decryption of smudged notes across multiple beats (first phrase, tangled threads, last phrase, and thematic echo in final paragraph). It shapes the middle work and reappears in closure framing. However, the action itself is smooth—no failed attempt or complication. Setup strong (+0.6), beat involvement across three moments (+1.2), closure linkage via theme (+0.5), but swappability (decode, decipher, parse would work) and lack of friction lower from 8+ to low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Decrypting the cast is the structural spine: introduced early (marble table, "smudged notes scribbled on a child's cast"), executed mid-story (unknotting phrases, revealing map), and referenced at closure ("decrypted notes in hand"). The method appears in all three gates (setup, development, payoff). However, the mechanics are elided—no false reading, no friction from smudging. Causal presence across beats and closure participation earn ~6.0; lack of on-page difficulty and high genericity (any decryption method would work) prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly established (jasmine, damp earth, glass doors, marble table) and bookends the piece ("threshold" at end). However, it never constrains a choice—Elara's work would proceed identically in any quiet room. Present in setup and final image reprise (two gates), but ornamental throughout, no tactical impact: cap ~6.0 for lyric reprise; postcard use and swappability drop score to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the anesthetic kicks in" is mentioned once ("kicked in an hour ago") to explain wrist numbness, then abandoned. It does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the work proceeds at contemplative pace. Timeframe is vague (twilight, "tonight," unspecified duration). Absent from development and closure: zero gates beyond weak setup mention, cap 2.8; ornamental use and no clock pressure trigger −0.5 combined.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To graft new meaning onto old wounds" is stated early as motivation, recurs in mid-story reflection ("chance to bridge those silences"), and echoes in the final paragraph. However, it remains abstract—no on-page moment shows Elara choosing to accept a cost in service of this goal. Present in setup and thematic closure echo (two gates); lyric reprise could reach ~6.3, but told-only treatment and lack of friction (want vs. obstacle) lower to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" appears three times with identical phrasing and modulates only slightly (opening conflict → "bloomed into purpose" → "no longer aching alone"). The tone is coherent and charges the final image with bittersweet resolve. However, the label is decorative rather than embodied—no on-page moment dramatizes the lotus metaphor's cost. Setup, development (thematic), payoff via reprise: three gates met weakly. Lyric consistency and closure presence earn ~5.5; static repetition and lack of embodied pressure prevent higher score.</comment>
