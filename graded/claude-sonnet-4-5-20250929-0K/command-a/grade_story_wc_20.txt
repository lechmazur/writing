<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("understand the weight of names") is abstract and never translates into contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her internal journey is told through summary ("she realized," "she understood") rather than embodied decisions that foreclose options. The coin visions sequence offers stock epiphanies—king, mother, wanderer—without showing how these fragments conflict or compel a costly choice on the page. No meaningful change or renunciation with felt cost; the ending grants resolve without struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is present early (foundry, Elara, coin). The piece gestures toward an Accumulative lens but never tightens meaningfully; the furnace vision is a passive reception rather than a choice-driven turn. Closure claims redemption and understanding but offers no on-page decisive change or visible cost—Elara simply leaves with "quiet resolve" and "luminous regret softened," neither of which is earned by prior causality. The Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what was paid or forfeited at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry anchors space and returns at the ending with the walls "no longer glistening," offering a modest lyric reprise. The cracked kintsugi flask is vivid but remains decorative; it never constrains a choice or resurfaces to alter tactics. Spatial choreography is clear (workshop, furnace mouth, inside furnace, stepping out), and the setting modulates with the vision sequence, but no environmental detail drives the final image or forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—redeeming the coin—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; the furnace sequence is a passive vision rather than a choice-driven tightening. The ending claims balance and understanding without demonstrating what Elara risked or forfeited. Coincidence (the coin glows, visions appear) complicates without agency, and resolution is granted by insight rather than earned by protagonist decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of names as choices and balance as repair is stated overtly ("the weight of names was not in their sound, but in the choices they represented") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The kintsugi flask and zodiac symbols are introduced as metaphors but never constrain a beat or charge the closure image through accumulated pressure. The final paragraph ("her own name—not as a label, but as a story still being written") delivers a thesis statement instead of a resonant reweighting, and "luminous regret now softened" is label-only emotion without embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in alchemical diction ("factually mystical blend," "luminous regret") but remains consistent rather than modulating under pressure. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew," "she realized") cluster in the vision sequence and dull immediacy. The narrative voice leans toward elevated register ("redemption, she believed, came by exploring limits") that reads more like thesis than lived thought, though it stays consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is high, but information density is low: adjacent sentences paraphrase without adding pressure ("The coin was not just an object but a vessel" / "carrying the weight of these names"). Template cadence appears in the vision beat ("a king who had… a mother who had… a wanderer who had…") spanning three parallel constructions. Stock metaphors recur without fresh angle: "thread waiting to be pulled," "fragments of a greater whole." The final paragraph stacks summary: "explored her limits, redeemed the coin, and in doing so, had begun to understand her own name."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—alchemist uses zodiac coin to explore limits and redeem intentions—is a composite of familiar mystical-quest elements without a non-obvious synthesis. Kintsugi as metaphor is stated rather than dramatized through causal choices. The vision sequence (king, mother, wanderer) offers generic archetypes without specificity that would make them irreplaceable. The transformation test fails: swapping "zodiac coin" for "ancient talisman" and "kintsugi" for "scars as strength" would leave the arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and initiates the furnace entry, but her choices do not create key turns. The coin's glow and visions happen to her; she observes and interprets without a decision that narrows options or alters tactics. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development is passive reception.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in the opening, is held during the furnace sequence, and resides in her pocket at the end—three touches across setup, middle, and closure. Its symbols rearrange during the vision and fix to her sign at the end, offering modest reweighting. However, it is never handled as a constraint or tool that alters her choices; it acts upon her rather than being used by her.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kintsugi intentions are mentioned via the cracked flask metaphor and the claim that redemption comes by "honoring" cracks. The concept shapes the thematic layer but never constrains an on-page choice or tactic. Elara does not mend anything literally, nor does she face a decision between hiding and highlighting a fracture. Setup is present, but middle and closure participation are ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" appears once as a descriptor for the workshop smell and is never shown constraining or enabling an action. No on-page cost or tradeoff tied to this trait; it functions as label-only atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Redemption is stated as Elara's task and claimed at the end ("redeemed the coin"), but the mechanism remains abstract. The furnace vision is passive; no major turn traces causally to an act of redeeming. The element is introduced early and referenced at closure, but its involvement is summary-only rather than dramatized through choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Exploring limits" is stated as her method and echoed at the end ("explored her limits"), but the mechanics are never signaled. The furnace entry reads as crossing a threshold rather than testing a boundary with cost. The element shapes the thematic claim but does not alter on-page tactics or narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry is introduced in the opening line, provides the furnace as a spatial focal point, and returns in the final paragraph with a state change ("no longer glistening"). The cold iron furnace mouth and the transition from rain-washed to aflame modulate atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it stages the vision rather than pressuring tactics. Setup, middle presence, and closure reprise all meet the gate tests.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the search party disbanded" anchors backstory but does not tighten on-page decisions. No clock or urgency derived from this anchor shapes tactics; the story unfolds in an untimed present. Introduced early but never developed or paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the weight of names" is stated in the opening and reiterated at the end. It frames Elara's goal but is never dramatized through conflicting wants or a choice that costs her something tangible. The furnace visions illustrate the concept without forcing Elara to weigh one interpretation against another. Setup and closure mention are present, but middle friction is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is named early, flares during the furnace approach, and is "softened" at the end—a modest emotional arc. The tone modulates from hesitation to resolve and charges the final image of stars as "fragments of a greater whole." However, the regret itself remains abstract; no on-page event concretizes what was lost or how the softening was earned, limiting the tone's causal grip.</comment>
