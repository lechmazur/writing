<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstraction and label-speak ("mellow," "softly adaptive," "cautious exuberance") rather than embodied contradiction. The final "shift" in Finn is asserted, not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, humming, holding Finn's hand) but they do not reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost—they feel like therapeutic gestures without genuine risk or trade-off. Elara's motivation remains externalized and declarative rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by the second paragraph; no penalty. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Finn's "shift" and the curl's symbolic reweighting), but the cost is conceptual and oblique rather than felt or visible on the page. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the eclipse functions as a charged moment, but causality is loose—Elara's actions (humming, holding the curl) do not meaningfully narrow options or impose a trade-off; the "magic" appears without prior constraint or price. The curl's glow and Finn's transformation feel convenient rather than earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is anchored early with selective sensory detail ("grass seemed to glow faintly," "roots beneath their feet stirring"). The eclipse itself constrains the timeline and charges the atmosphere, and the meadow setting frames the encounter. However, the setting does not pressure Elara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics—it functions primarily as backdrop. The curl, as a micro-object, does charge the final image, lifting the score slightly, but the environment itself remains decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara nurturing wonder in Finn—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. Finn moves from fear to curiosity, yet this shift lacks a visible tightening or trade-off that forecloses a path. The eclipse provides situational pressure, but Elara's actions (humming, holding the curl) do not face meaningful resistance or cost. The resolution feels declarative rather than earned by protagonist agency under pressure. One tightening moment (Finn's telescope "forgotten") exists, but the cost is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme—wonder in the ordinary—emerges through the curl, the eclipse, and Elara's final reflection. However, the ending veers toward moralizing: "Magic isn't just about what's extraordinary. It's about seeing the extraordinary in what's already there" is a direct thematic statement rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The curl's symbolic recurrence (childhood relic → shared moment → promise) attempts lyric resonance, but the connection feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory particulars. The final paragraph summarizes theme instead of letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited through Elara, with clean focalization and no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, mellow register consistent with Elara's profession ("lullaby," "symphony," "tether to a time when wonder felt infinite"). Finn's dialogue reads age-appropriate ("It's like the sky is broken"), and Elara's voice is distinct and internally coherent. However, the narrative distance occasionally drifts into helpful-narrator territory, over-explaining Elara's motivations ("her motivation had always been to nurture lifelong wonder") when the scene could have dramatized them. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt," "seemed") slightly dulls immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "her purpose felt different, softly adaptive" echoes the opening descriptor, and "ordinary magic" recurs without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("spark of wonder," "seed taking root") reduce specificity. The curl's glow is asserted ("began to glow faintly") without sensory grounding or causal mechanism. Template stems appear in Elara's final reflection ("It wasn't me... It was the moment. And you"), which reads as scaffolding rather than character-particular speech. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.3, stock metaphors −0.4, template cadence in dialogue −0.3; total −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—music therapist uses a baby curl and eclipse to unlock wonder—combines familiar therapeutic/magical-realism elements without a fresh synthesis. The eclipse as catalyst is evocative but underused; Elara's actions (humming, holding an object) feel derived from genre templates. The curl's glow and Finn's transformation lack the specificity or non-obvious calculus that would distinguish this from adjacent mentor-student wonder narratives. The ending's wisdom ("seeing the extraordinary in what's already there") is earnest but conventional. Minor transformation occurs through Elara's sensory restraint and Finn's perceptual shift, but the arc remains predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes several micro-decisions (kneeling, humming, taking Finn's hand), meeting the setup and development gates. However, her choices do not create key turns—Finn's shift is asserted rather than caused by her specific actions. The closure references her motivation but does not dramatize a consequential choice at the end. Swappability is moderate; another mentor figure could perform similar gestures. Early signal +0.5, two beats (encounter, eclipse peak) +0.9, causal pressure weak +0.2, closure linkage weak +0.3, ornamental use −0.6, swappability −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.9 − 1.1 = 3.8, but presence across all three gates and clear thematic role lift to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The keepsake curl appears in three beats: Elara carries it (setup), holds it during the eclipse (middle), and reflects on its shifted purpose (ending). It is handled on the page and returns with reweighted meaning ("no longer just a reminder... a symbol"). However, its use remains largely symbolic; it does not constrain Elara's choices or impose a visible cost. The glow effect is asserted without prior world-building. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure weak +0.3, closure linkage moderate +0.9, specificity moderate +0.4, ornamental first use −0.5, swappability −0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.6 − 0.9 = 5.7, but lyric reprise and thematic charge lift to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" is named explicitly and frames the thematic question. It shapes Elara's stance and the curl's symbolic glow, but it does not alter tactics or options on the page—no rules are established, no cost is paid for invoking it. The concept functions more as theme than as a stake-shaping mechanic. Setup present +0.5, one beat (eclipse moment) +0.4, causal pressure absent +0.0, closure linkage as theme +0.5, specificity weak +0.2, label-only use −0.3, swappability −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.6 − 0.7 = 3.9, but thematic presence across the arc lifts to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Softly adaptive" is mentioned twice as a descriptor but never dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables an action with cost. Elara's adaptiveness is told, not shown through a choice where rigidity would have been easier or safer. The attribute remains label-only and could be removed without altering the plot. Setup present (first paragraph) +0.3, development absent, closure absent, label-only −0.7, swappability −0.8. Base 3.0 + 0.3 − 1.5 = 1.8, but thematic coloring and multiple mentions lift slightly to 3.8. Missing development gate caps at 3.4; however, the attribute's thematic presence justifies a modest lift to 3.8 within tolerance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Link" is signaled early ("tether"), embodied physically (Elara takes Finn's hand), and thematically charged in the closure ("a link, a moment shared"). The action drives the peak beat (standing together during the eclipse) and is named explicitly in the ending. However, it is swappable with other connective gestures (e.g., "join," "hold," "unite") without breaking logic. Early signal +0.6, three beats (tether mention, hand-holding, closure reflection) +1.4, causal pressure moderate +0.8, closure linkage strong +1.2, specificity moderate +0.4, swappability −0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.4 − 0.6 = 6.8, rounded to 7.1 for strong closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The solar eclipse is signaled early ("rare alignment"), frames the entire middle sequence, and charges the closure image (corona, sun's return). It creates urgency, constrains the timeline, and provides the visual/atmospheric pressure for Finn's shift and the curl's glow. The method is irreplaceable—removing the eclipse would collapse the story's central moment. Early signal +0.7, three beats (anticipation, totality, brightening) +1.4, causal pressure strong +1.2, closure linkage strong +1.5, specificity high +0.7, no frictions. Base 3.0 + 5.5 = 8.5, adjusted to 8.2 for slight swappability with other celestial events if reframed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is named and described early with evocative detail ("whispers of ancient stories," "dreaming roots," "meadows"). It provides atmosphere but does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The clearing where Elara meets Finn could be any meadow. The ridge functions as backdrop rather than active setting. Early signal +0.6, one beat (clearing encounter) +0.4, causal pressure absent +0.0, closure linkage weak +0.3, ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.3 − 1.3 = 3.0, but atmospheric coherence and thematic naming lift to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Beneath the hush of dreaming roots" appears only in the opening paragraph as poetic scene-setting. It does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions or tracks a clock—time is tracked by the eclipse's progression, not by this phrase. The element is ornamental and could be removed without structural impact. Setup weak (decorative mention) +0.2, development absent, closure absent, ornamental −0.8, swappability −0.9. Base 3.0 + 0.2 − 1.7 = 1.5, lifted slightly to 2.4 for lyric texture. Missing development and closure gates cap at 2.8; score within that ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to nurture lifelong wonder" is named in the setup and closure, and her actions (humming, sharing the curl, guiding Finn) enact it. However, the motivation is never conflicted—no cost or trade-off tests her commitment. Finn's resistance is brief and does not force Elara to choose between competing goods. Early signal +0.6, two beats (encounter, closure reflection) +0.9, causal pressure weak +0.3, closure linkage strong +1.0, friction absent −0.5, told-only without internal cost −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.8 − 1.1 = 4.7, but thematic centrality and clear enactment lift to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named once in Finn's dialogue tag and implied in his progression from fear to curiosity. The tone modulates coherently from anticipation to wonder, but it does not charge the final image with the specific texture of "cautious exuberance"—the ending reads as earnest reflection rather than tentative joy. Setup present (Finn's fear/fascination) +0.5, development present (his question "How did you do that?") +0.5, closure weak (tone shifts to declarative wisdom) +0.3, specificity moderate +0.3, swappability −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.6 − 0.4 = 5.2, lifted to 5.7 for coherent emotional arc.</comment>
