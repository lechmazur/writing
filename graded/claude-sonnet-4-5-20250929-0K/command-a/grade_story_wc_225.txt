<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to forgive herself is declared but remains abstract; her interiority relies on stock formulations ("fierce repose," "desperate need") rather than contradictory impulses embodied in scene. The chess-tutor identity and fidgeting gesture are mentioned but never constrain a choice or reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The labyrinth sequence offers a handed epiphany ("Forgiveness is not a destination but a journey") rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is thin; the tears and "weight lifting" at the climax read as asserted outcomes rather than dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is adequate—who, where, when anchor early—but the drive lens wavers between Accumulative/Textural (tapestry decoding, platinum thread) and a late Causal turn (pulling the thread reveals a message). The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the glowing thread and quoted message, but cost is asserted ("weight of her guilt began to lift") rather than shown through forfeited options or altered stance. The Orientation Test passes, yet causality from tapestry-decoding to labyrinth-entry to thread-pull feels loose; the labyrinth "invites her in" by coincidence, and the platinum thread's revelation arrives without prior setup or earned linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The time-frozen village, cobblestone streets, platinum labyrinth, and tapestry are visually sketched but remain postcard elements; spatial choreography inside the labyrinth is vague ("walls a maze of reflections"), and no environmental detail constrains Elara's choices. The chess piece recurs across beats and charges the final image as a talisman, which qualifies as micro-setting; this lifts the score modestly. Sensory selection is generic (pale light, cool air, faint shimmer) and does not reflect urgency or professional bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early but never tested by a live on-page dilemma; Elara encounters no opposition, and the labyrinth offers answers rather than complications. The tapestry-decoding sequence ("hours passed, or perhaps only minutes") lacks a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The climactic thread-pull is handed to her without prior cost or trade-off; coincidence (the labyrinth parts, the thread glows) resolves rather than complicates, violating lens coherence under any mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme of self-forgiveness emerges through the king-and-pawn tapestry parallel, but the final message states the theme overtly ("Forgiveness is not a destination but a journey") instead of letting image and action carry it. The chess piece and platinum thread recur, yet their symbolic charge feels imposed rather than earned by specifics that reweight prior material. The ending offers a thesis rather than a resonant, non-literal answer; the story retreats into explanation at the moment it should deepen into ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and perceptual signature is present in Elara's chess-tutor lens (tracing grooves, "move on a chessboard"), though under-exploited. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("fierce repose," "woven hush") that feels more authorial than character-specific. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") cluster in several beats without voice motivation, and the final paragraph's tense of resolved calm lacks the syntactic compression that pressure would demand.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean and grammatical but exhibits paraphrase loops ("her fidgeting now purposeful," "her hands moving with the precision") and template cadence in the labyrinth sequence ("Each step felt like…," "The thread unraveled, revealing…"). Stock metaphors recur (shadows clung, weight lifted, storm within) without fresh inflection. Information density is low; many sentences restate emotional state rather than advancing action or knowledge. No egregious artifacts touch the closure beat, so non-closure accumulation cap applies: −0.8 for loops and scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—exiled chess tutor enters magical labyrinth to decode guilt—combines familiar quest and self-discovery tropes without transformation. The tapestry-decoding method and platinum thread are ornamental rather than mechanically integrated; the chess piece, though recurring, never constrains a tactical choice. The king-and-pawn parallel is telegraphed, and the final epiphany arrives as a convenient inscription rather than an earned synthesis of prior particulars. Proximity to template quest-for-redemption arcs triggers derivative-premise adjustment: −1.0 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara (exiled chess tutor) is present throughout and her background is mentioned, but her choices are passive: she "wandered," "approached," "hesitated," then "entered" when the labyrinth parts for her. The tapestry-decoding is described as purposeful action, but no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. She appears in the closure beat (emerges, hands steady), but the change is asserted rather than caused by her agency. Setup and middle beats are functional; closure participation is ornamental. Two gates present, swappable role, no causal pressure at closure: mid-band functional.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth is introduced early (edge of village), becomes the site of the climactic sequence (she enters, finds the thread), and frames the resolution (she emerges). It appears in three distinct beats with escalating involvement: introduction, entry decision, and thread discovery. However, its mechanics are vague—walls "part slightly," the thread glows—and it does not constrain Elara's choices; it hands her the answer. All three gates present, strong closure linkage, but low causal pressure and high swappability (any magical threshold could serve). Specificity is cosmetic (platinum) rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Woven hush" appears as atmospheric descriptor in paragraphs 1, 4, and 6 ("the village still lay in its time-frozen state") but does not shape stakes or tactics. It functions as setting mood rather than a constraint or force Elara must navigate. The concept is present and thematically consistent but ornamental; removing it would not alter plot logic or closure. Setup present, no middle development, no closure participation beyond reprise: missing two gates, ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" is introduced early ("fingers fidgeted productively, tracing the grooves") and recurs in the tapestry-decoding beat ("her fidgeting now purposeful") and at closure ("Her fidgeting had ceased, her hands now steady"). The trait signals character but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost; it is label-only in all three mentions. Setup, middle label, closure reprise present (all three gates), but no causal pressure or tradeoff. Lyric reprise reweights slightly at closure, lifting into mid-band functional: three gates + closure reprise but label-only use caps below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Winnow" appears twice: decoding the tapestry ("winnow through the chaos") and the labyrinth's effect on her soul ("winnowed her soul, stripping away layers"). Both are metaphorical rather than literal action that changes options. The first is functional (she sorts threads), the second is thematic summary. The action is signaled and returns with reweighted meaning at closure, but it is easily swappable (analyze, decode, sift). Setup and closure participation present, middle beat functional, but high swappability and summary use in closure: two strong gates, lyric reprise, but mid-band due to metaphorical rather than tactical use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border" is introduced early (paragraph 2), executed in paragraph 3 ("winnow through the chaos," "hands moving with precision"), and its result (understanding the king-and-pawn story) primes her entry into the labyrinth. The method shapes the middle beat and its outcome (realization of parallel guilt) enables the next move. However, the mechanics are vague—no specific code or pattern is shown—and the method does not reappear at closure; the platinum thread is a different mechanism. Setup, middle causal involvement, no closure participation: two gates, functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "time-frozen village" anchors location throughout and is reprised at closure ("The village still lay in its time-frozen state, but Elara felt different"). It provides atmospheric pressure (stillness, unspoken histories) but does not constrain choices or supply resources that affect outcome; Elara moves freely. The labyrinth at the village edge is the functional setting, not the village itself. Setup, closure reprise, but no middle development or causal pressure: two gates via lyric frame, but ornamental use caps score in functional band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" appears in paragraph 1 (opening), paragraph 3 (rumbles faintly), and closure (thunder passed, serene sky). Time is atmospheric rather than a live constraint; no decision is tightened by the storm's approach or passage. The element marks emotional weather but does not alter tactics or create urgency. Setup, middle mention, closure reprise present (three gates), but purely symbolic and swappable with any weather metaphor: ornamental across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to forgive herself for past mistakes" is introduced early (paragraph 1: "come here to forgive herself"), drives her approach to the labyrinth (paragraph 2: "her only hope"), and is addressed at closure (paragraph 6: "weight of her guilt began to lift," "begin forgiving herself"). The desire is declared in all three acts but never tested by a conflicting want or cost that forces a trade-off; it remains a thesis rather than a dramatized friction. Setup, middle presence, closure participation all clear (three gates), but told-only with no on-page conflict between wants and costs: functional across structure but low dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is named in paragraphs 1 ("moved with a fierce repose") and 6 ("each element shaping her path with fierce repose") as a descriptor of Elara's demeanor. Tone is consistent—contemplative, restrained—but the phrase itself is label-only and does not modulate under pressure; the labyrinth sequence maintains the same measured cadence. The concept charges the final image thematically but is asserted rather than embodied in syntax or rhythm. Setup, closure label, no middle modulation: two gates, ornamental use, static mood rather than pressure-responsive tone.</comment>
