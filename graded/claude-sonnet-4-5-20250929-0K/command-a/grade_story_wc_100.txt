<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is given baseline motivation (burying the unburyable, stubbornness) and a quest structure, but his interior life reads as label-only. The lens-repair montage summarizes discovery rather than dramatizing micro-choices under pressure. "Inadvertently stubborn" appears once as a character claim but never constrains a specific on-page decision with visible cost. The final smile and "weariness lifting" asserts transformation without embodied contradiction or the friction needed to earn it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal with light Accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The closure unit—lens assembled, signal sent, water parts—lands on the page but the cost is conceptual only; Elias's personal forfeit or trade-off is not legible. The central reversal (lens is incomplete → fragments found → signal sent) proceeds in and-then sequencing with minimal because/therefore linkage. The mysterious package inciting incident and the climactic assembly feel like checklist beats rather than motivated pressure points.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The underwater library is vivid (seaweed aisles, coral statue, reinforced windows) and supplies multiple fragment-hiding locations that enable the quest. Spatial choreography is clear across moves. The lens itself—fractured prisms, humming urgency, glowing at the end—constrains the quest structure and charges the final image, qualifying as micro-setting. However, the environment does not force a trade-off or complicate tactics; it is traversed without friction. One point of genuine constraint (finding fragments in impossible spaces) lifts the score above ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore the lens and send the signal. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes the lens is incomplete, narrowing his goal to a scavenger hunt. The fragments are found via summary montage ("he dove," "each discovery") rather than on-page choices that test commitment. No reversal or setback; success is linear. The final signal reaches a ship's radar, but no visible price is paid—no stamina cost, no social trade-off, no path foreclosed. Agency is present (Elias acts) but pressure does not escalate under the lens; the quest unfolds as intended from the midpoint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme: giving rest to the restless, letting voices be heard. The lens as conduit for the city's soul works metaphorically and the final image (water parting, stars revealed) offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, the thematic question is stated rather than embodied in conflicted choice. "Chased stillness" and "impossible spaces" recur but function as mood labels rather than accumulating meaning through dramatized cost. The ending leans toward tidy satisfaction ("he had found what he was searching for") that diffuses ambiguity. One genuine strength: the shift from burial to signal-sending reweights the undertaker's vocation with fresh particularity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Elias's perceptual filter (lantern, touch, professional lens on rest) is consistent. Diction stays within register with minor slips ("ethereal light," "testament to resilience" edge toward elevated abstraction under pressure). Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the fragment search. No dialogue on the page to assess. One recurring syntactic pattern: "The [noun], [appositive], [verb]" appears in multiple beats, creating light template cadence. Voice is competent but not highly distinctive; the undertaker's idiom feels generic rather than singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no ambiguous pronouns or tense breaks. Information density is moderate—beats advance but many sentences do single jobs. Minor loops: "rest to the restless" and "impossible spaces" recur without evolving meaning; "chased stillness" appears twice as a label. Template cadence in the opening (lean, press, lay, choke, warp) and closing (lifted, become, knew, realized) paragraphs. Filter verbs ("felt compelled," "felt both haunting and comforting," "felt a strange connection") stack in early paragraphs, dulling immediacy. No figurative muddle. Proofreading is clean. Deduct for loops and filter stacks (−0.6 in band) but the closure beat itself remains legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core synthesis—undertaker in underwater library repairing a lighthouse lens to send a distress signal—reads fresh on paper but proceeds via familiar quest mechanics (mysterious package, fragmented artifact, montage assembly, cosmic payoff). Emotional specificity is thin; the connection to the city and its people is asserted ("all of it resonated") rather than shown through lived friction. The transformation test fails: swap "undertaker" for "archivist" or "diver" and the arc holds with minimal edits. No bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus. The lens-as-soul metaphor is purposeful but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias makes two mid-level choices: to investigate the library (setup) and to search for fragments (middle). His final act—holding the lens aloft—is passive reception rather than a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The "weary undertaker" frame seeds expectation and the ending references his weariness lifting, but no specific cost or trade-off is tied to his occupation. Swappable with "weary scholar" or similar. Present across beats but replaceable; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The broken lens appears in setup (mysterious package), middle (Elias realizes it is incomplete), and closure (assembled, glowing, sends signal). It constrains the quest structure and charges the final image. Handled across multiple beats: inspected, fragmented, reassembled, held aloft. Irreplaceability is strong—the story's logic pivots on this exact object. Cost connection is weak; the lens does not exact a visible price from Elias. Strong setup, development, and payoff lift the score; missing felt cost and slight ornamental glow in the ending prevent entry to the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Distress signals frame the backstory (the city's unanswered night) and thematic aim (letting voices be heard). The lens functions as a signal conduit at closure. However, the concept shapes the metaphor more than the tactics; Elias does not face a choice between competing signals or wrestle with the ethics of distress. Present in setup (book title "Distress Signals of the Lost") and payoff (signal sent, ship's radar picks it up), but middle development is thin. Functional role in one beat (backstory revelation) and thematic echo at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is named once in the opening third ("a trait that had served him well… but often led him down paths others would avoid") but never constrains or enables a specific on-page action. No scene shows Elias persisting past a setback or ignoring advice due to stubbornness. The lens quest proceeds without friction; he encounters no obstacle that stubbornness helps overcome or worsens. Label-only mention with no causal work or visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Revitalize" appears explicitly ("Revitalizing the lens meant finding these pieces") and structures the middle quest. The act of piecing the lens together is the story's major causal turn, enabling the signal. Present in setup (lens arrives broken), middle (fragment search), and closure (lens glows, sends signal). However, the mechanics are summarized montage rather than dramatized beat-by-beat; the act could be swapped for "repair," "restore," or "reforge" with minor edits. Strong causal role and closure linkage, moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Occupying impossible spaces" is named twice: once in the opening ("even if it meant occupying impossible spaces like this drowned library") and once listing fragment locations ("hidden in impossible spaces"). The method signals Elias's willingness to enter hard-to-reach places but does not constrain tactics; the library is difficult to access in backstory but traversed without on-page friction. No mechanics are shown—how does one "occupy" the impossible?—and the phrase functions as thematic flavor rather than a constraint. Present in setup and middle, absent at closure. Ornamental use, swappable with "difficult" or "forgotten."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater city library is present in setup (orientation), middle (supplies fragment locations: algae waterfall, coral statue, collapsed beam), and closure (where the lens is held aloft and the signal originates). It enables the quest by hiding the fragments and charges the final image (library illuminated, water parts). Spatial choreography is clean. However, the setting does not pressure Elias with a choice or cost—he moves through it without trade-offs. Strong setup, clear involvement across beats, and closure participation. Missing: a decision forced by the environment's constraints.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the mysterious package arrives" anchors the story's start and drives the inciting question. The package's arrival is referenced in the opening and motivates Elias's journey to the library. However, elapsed time is not tracked and no clock tightens tactics; the fragment search could take hours or days with no on-page consequence. Present in setup (package backstory) and implicit at closure (signal sent post-quest), but middle development is vague. Functional role in one beat (inciting incident), absent pressure on pacing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to give rest a permanent address" is named explicitly in the opening and closing, framing his professional identity and thematic aim. It motivates his quest (compelled to uncover the lens's secret) and is echoed at closure ("not just for the dead, but for himself"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no scene shows Elias torn between rest and restlessness or choosing this goal over an alternative. Purposeful early-to-final reprise that reweights the stake, but friction between wants and costs is thin. Lyric resonance with moderate causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" appears twice: once describing the library's atmosphere ("a chased stillness that Elias found both haunting and comforting") and once at closure ("The chased stillness of the library had become a sanctuary"). The phrase sets mood but does not modulate with pressure; the tone remains contemplative and hushed throughout without tensioning or sharpening at climax. No tonal shift at the fragment-discovery beats or signal-sending climax. Present in setup and payoff, but static rather than evolving. Ornamental reprise without causal charge.</comment>
