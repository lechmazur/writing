<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract statements ("felt the weight of her mission") and therapeutic self-awareness ("a reckoning with her own carefully woven lies") rather than embodied contradiction. The backwards-aging premise remains ornamental; no on-page micro-choice demonstrates how living in reverse pressures her present actions. Her final decision to reveal the truth arrives without visible cost—colleagues are mentioned in reflection but never appear to challenge her, so the forfeiture remains asserted rather than dramatized. The motivation "to teach vanishing to appear" functions as a thematic label recycled across beats without showing what specific trade-off Elara accepts by speaking.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (unburdening through revelation), but cost remains abstract: "heart heavy but unburdened" tells the shift without showing a foreclosed path or immediate consequence. Orientation is delayed—"backwards aging researcher" and "floating rock meditation platform" are named but not anchored spatially or temporally until well past the opening, though the disorientation does not pay off at closure (apply −0.3). Under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative reflection → Causal revelation), the story teaches its pattern but the final spoken confession is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening closure legibility. The ripple-vision trance deepens texture but does not narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating obsidian platform and magnetic grotto supply vivid anchors ("shimmering faintly under the starlight," "grotto's hum"), and the thrown stones return as concrete actions that charge two beats. However, spatial choreography is vague—Elara's position relative to the water's edge shifts without clear blocking. The "sycamore hush" appears twice as atmosphere but never as a physical element that constrains choice. At this length, the grotto's magnetic amplification of thoughts is asserted in exposition rather than shown altering tactics, keeping setting functional but not indispensable to the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—revealing withheld truth—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The trance sequence deepens via ripple-vision images, yet no on-page reversal forecloses a live option: Elara decides to speak, but the story summarizes her words rather than dramatizing resistance or immediate consequence. No secondary character appears to test her resolve, so escalation operates solely in reflection. Under the Hybrid lens, the accumulative pressure (years of silence, colleagues' frustration glimpsed in visions) builds texture, but the final act lacks a visible price—colleagues are absent, and the "unburdened" state replaces cost with relief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of revelation versus withholding emerges through the stone-ripple motif and "absence is as powerful as presence," but these ideas are stated rather than dramatized in the climactic beat. The older-Elara teaching scene offers a purposeful frame, yet the final paragraph edges toward sermonizing: "through the courage to reveal what had been withheld" and "the balance she had finally achieved" articulate the thesis instead of letting the image resonate. The backwards-aging concept remains ornamental to theme—time's reverse flow is mentioned but never reweights the moral calculus of disclosure. No counter-reading complicates Elara's choice; the story treats revelation as unambiguous virtue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable, and the reflective narration maintains a consistent elevated register ("the sycamore hush of the grotto," "the timeframe of her meditation stretching beyond the present"). However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract academic phrasing ("a confrontation, a reckoning with her own carefully woven lies") that flattens urgency in peak beats. The older-Elara dialogue ("To teach vanishing to appear…is to understand that absence is as powerful as presence") reads polished and thematic rather than spoken under pressure. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices ripple patterns and starlight—but her way of seeing does not shift under stress, and no micro-compression reflects trance intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "The trance was not just a meditation; it was a confrontation, a reckoning…" restates the same idea in adjacent clauses without added pressure (−0.2). Metaphoric phrasing is dense but occasionally muddles: "sycamore hush" as a sound quality for a grotto lacks clear vehicle logic, and "carefully woven truth" recurs three times without variation. Sentence stems repeat: "She [verb]" opens multiple beats mechanically. Information density is moderate—most lines advance atmosphere or reflection—but the climactic revelation is summarized in a single sentence ("She told of her discovery…of how she had used it") rather than dramatized, dulling closure propulsion. No filter-verb stacks or severe artifacts touch the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The backwards-aging researcher premise is fresh, but the story does not transform it—Elara's reverse chronology functions as backstory color rather than a tactical constraint or thematic lever. The "teach vanishing to appear" motif and stone-ripple method feel crafted to prompt requirements rather than organically necessary. The trance-revelation structure is familiar (meditator confronts hidden truth and chooses disclosure), and no inflection surprises: the ending affirms that courage to reveal is virtuous without complication. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: the meditation-platform epiphany matches widely used templates, and specific transformation is limited (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setup present (first paragraph); Development: reflection on backwards aging shapes her understanding but does not constrain a middle choice; Payoff: her age is mentioned in the final reflection but does not appear in or shape the closure image. Two gates met → eligible to ~6.0, but the character's backwards aging is ornamental—removing it would not break the decision to reveal. No causal pressure or cost tied to living in reverse. Late penalty does not apply (early signal +0.3), but swappability (−0.6) and ornamental use (−0.7) lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph two); Development: stones thrown twice, creating ripples that trigger trance-vision; Payoff: second stone is etched with symbols and its ripples frame her spoken revelation. All three gates met → eligible ≥6.1. Beat involvement: two distinct beats (+0.9). However, the grotto's magnetic amplification is asserted in exposition rather than shown altering tactics, and the object does not impose a visible cost. Specificity (+0.5 for the etched symbols and obsidian platform) and early signal (+0.5) partially offset swappability (−0.4): a similar reflective surface could function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Setup implicit (Elara withholds truth from the start); Development: the concept appears in reflection and labels ("delayed revelation," "withheld for years") but does not narrow options in a middle beat; Payoff: the final act is a revelation. Two gates met → eligible to ~6.0. The concept structures the plot but remains thematic—removing "delayed" and making the revelation immediate would require only timing edits, not a logic rewrite. Ornamental use (−0.7) and label-only treatment (−0.3) prevent higher placement. Early signal (+0.3) partially offsets.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph one: "weaving of truth"); Development: the trait is asserted in reflection ("carefully woven lies," "fragments with her colleagues") but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost; Payoff: mentioned in the final paragraph ("carefully woven") but not causally active in the ending image. Two gates met → eligible to ~6.0, but the attribute functions as a label without dramatized trade-off. No on-page moment shows Elara choosing careful phrasing over blunt honesty with a consequence. Ornamental use (−0.7) and label-only treatment (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph one: Elara has withheld for years); Development: withholding shapes her past but does not create a middle reversal; Payoff: the ending reverses withholding into disclosure. All three gates met → eligible ≥6.1. The action drives the arc's before/after, but the final revelation is summarized rather than dramatized in beats, weakening causal grip. Swappability test: changing "withhold" to "delay" or "obscure" would require only minor lexical edits. Summary-only use at closure (−0.6) and modest specificity (withholding is common) prevent higher placement. Beat involvement: one distinct turn (+0.4).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph two: stone thrown, ripples spread); Development: ripples create trance-vision images in paragraph four; Payoff: second stone's ripples are "sharper, more defined" and frame the revelation. All three gates met → eligible ≥6.1. The method appears in two distinct beats (+0.9) and ties to the closure image (+0.9). However, the mechanics of "through the patterns" do not constrain Elara's tactics—she observes ripples but does not adjust her approach based on what they show. Specificity (+0.5 for "rings of a pond") offsets swappability (−0.4): a mirror or flame could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph one); Development: Elara sits and later walks to the edge, but the platform does not supply a resource or constraint that alters her choice; Payoff: the platform's shadow is mentioned in the final paragraph but does not charge the ending. All three gates met → eligible ≥6.1, but the setting remains postcard description. Removing "floating" and "magnetic" would not break story logic. Ornamental use (−0.7) and swappability (−0.6): a ground-level terrace could function identically. Early signal (+0.5) partially offsets.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Setup implicit (trance begins paragraph two); Development: "trance deepened" marks progression, and vision-beats occur during the trance; Payoff: trance concludes when Elara opens her eyes and speaks. All three gates met → eligible ≥6.1. However, the timeframe is vague—no clock or internal marker tightens decisions. The trance functions as a narrative container rather than a pressure device; Elara could reflect for minutes or hours without altering stakes. Swappability (−0.6): "during meditation" would work identically. Ornamental framing (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph one); Development: the motivation is restated in the older-Elara teaching scene and in paragraph five but does not create friction between want and cost; Payoff: the final paragraph asserts that she "taught vanishing to appear…through presence." All three gates met → eligible ≥6.1, but the desire is told rather than dramatized in choices—no on-page moment shows Elara sacrificing clarity for mystery or vice versa with immediate consequence. Label-only treatment (−0.7) and lack of friction (want vs. cost absent) prevent higher placement. Closure linkage (+0.7) partially offsets.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup present (paragraph four: "sycamore hush of the grotto"); Development: tone remains contemplative and elevated throughout without modulation under pressure; Payoff: "sycamore hush" reappears in the final paragraph, charging the closure image with quiet. Lyric early–final reprise that reweights the stake qualifies for ~6.3 eligibility. However, the tone is static—no shift in cadence or diction reflects the trance's intensity or the revelation's cost. The phrase "sycamore hush" itself is metaphorically unclear (sycamores are trees; grottos are stone). Charged reprise (+0.9) and closure linkage (+0.7) offset static mood (−0.6) and vehicle confusion (−0.4).</comment>
