<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("trace honest origins") is declared but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or trade-offs. Her interiority relies on label-only phrasing ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") rather than embodied contradiction. The stamp's significance is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The final chamber discovery lacks visible cost—she simply reads text with no foreclosed path or felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but the blackout's causal role and the library's spatial layout remain vague throughout (−0.4). The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing (truth revealed) but the mechanism is convenience (stamp activates hidden chambers) without prior constraint or cost. Evaluator infers Causal lens, but the and-then sequencing (notices patterns → finds map → presses stamp → chambers open) lacks because/therefore pressure. The "record of origins" appears via plot service, not protagonist agency with on-page price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sunken city frame and bioluminescent algae anchor atmosphere early. The stamp returns at closure, charging the final image modestly. However, spatial choreography is unclear (shelf positions, chamber locations), and the library functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no access, proximity, or environmental pressure alters Elara's choices. Meets micro-setting allowance via the stamp as object-setting, but the broader environment remains postcard-descriptive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (uncover truth) is signaled but never tested by a live trade-off or narrowing choice. The blackout is declared a catalyst but imposes no tactical constraint on Elara's movements. The map-alignment and stamp-press "open" hidden passages via authorial fiat, not protagonist agency with visible cost. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—she moves linearly through discovery without renunciation or foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The theme of honest origins emerges from premise but remains abstract; the final "truth" is asserted without specific content that reweights prior particulars. The stamp and library symbols are mentioned repeatedly without accumulating pressure or charged irony. The ending's "profound sense of purpose" is told, not dramatized through a non-literal image or renunciation with cost. Thematic Echo penalty: "the power of honesty and the courage to seek it" sermonizes in the final paragraph (−0.6).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds; no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("tranquilly perceptive," "reclaimed stillness," "dappled resolve") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic ("her mind racing with possibilities"). No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("she sensed," "she realized," "she felt") stack without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Template cadence runs throughout: "Her X was Y" and "She [verb], her [noun] [participle]" structures repeat across 8+ sentences without taught pattern (−0.6). Paraphrase loops: "trace honest origins" / "uncover truths" / "validate her findings" recycle the same concept (−0.3). Figurative overwriting in peak beats: "whispers of the library," "hum with potential," "echo the library's stillness" cluster without payoff (−0.4). Clarity holds, but density is low—many lines restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The forgotten-library-plus-magical-artifact premise is familiar; the story does not transform it through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8 Derivative Premise adjustment). The stamp's glowing activation and wall-shifting echo genre conventions without fresh angle. Elara's linear success—no misstep, no price—plays it safe. The alternative hypothesis method is mentioned but not dramatized as a distinct investigative tactic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara observes and catalogs but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or stakes. Her final action (pressing the stamp) is the plot's only decision, and it succeeds without trade-off. Label-only trait with no causal pressure. Late first meaningful use (final chamber). Ornamental throughout middle. Cap 4.6 (introduced after 40%); swappability and summary-only use push lower.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stamp appears in beat one (established early, +0.5), returns in the map-alignment beat (+0.4 second touch), and is pressed in the final chamber to activate the mechanism (+0.9 closure linkage). However, its mechanics are told rather than shown, and it solves a problem it did not help create (−0.7). Swappability moderate: any "key" object could serve the same function with minor edits (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is theme-claimed in paragraph two but never shapes on-page tactics or narrows options. It reappears as mood in the final line without reweighting prior choices. Label-only use (−0.3). Missing middle development entirely. Cap 3.4; ornamental use and late reprise without cost push lower.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is a label applied twice without constraining or enabling action. No visible trade-off or cost tied to this trait. It does not alter Elara's investigative method or final choice. Missing all three gates (setup mentions only, no middle use, no closure tie). Ornamental (−0.5). Cap 2.8 (no closure participation).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Readjust" appears twice: Elara readjusts a leaning volume (beat one) and the map's position (beat four). Neither action drives a turn or alters stakes—both are preparatory gestures. Swappable with "shift" or "align" (−0.6). Functional but not causal. Present in closure scene but not decisively shaping it. Cap 3.8; summary-only use in key beats pushes lower.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" is declared in paragraph two as Elara's method (secrets in margins, not books) but never demonstrated through distinct investigative tactics. It does not shape her route through the library or create friction. Mentioned once, no middle beats, no closure tie. Missing development and payoff gates. Cap 3.4; ornamental mention (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The sunken city library is anchored early (+0.5) and frames all action. Bioluminescent algae, collapsed archway, and cracked glass dome provide atmospheric texture. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices—passages open for her, and the blackout imposes no navigational cost. Postcard-descriptive rather than tactically pressuring. Functional but replaceable; any isolated archive would serve.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The blackout is declared in paragraph two ("three days prior") and mentioned as ending in the final paragraph, but it imposes no tactical constraint on Elara's movements or decisions. No ticking clock, no waning light that alters her route. Declared important ("catalyst") but functionally inert. Present but ornamental. Missing middle development gate; no closure tie beyond mention. Cap 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Trace honest origins" is stated as Elara's motivation in paragraph one and recurs in paragraph five ("felt urgent"). However, it is never tested by conflicting desire or cost—she pursues it linearly without friction. Told-only; no on-page moment where she weighs this goal against another value. Present at closure (she finds the record) but without dramatized trade-off. Functional but not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears as a label in paragraph two and echoed as "deepened resolve" in paragraph four, but the tone itself does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. The prose maintains one register (elevated, meditative) throughout without tracking Elara's emotional shifts. Static mood rather than dynamic tonal arc. Label-only (−0.3). Missing closure charge.</comment>
