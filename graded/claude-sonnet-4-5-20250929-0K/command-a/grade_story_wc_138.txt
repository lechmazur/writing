<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elyr's motivation ("to discover what happens after goodbye") is clear and drives his choices, but his internal experience remains abstract throughout—labels like "endless, aching void" and "hunger he hadn't felt in millennia" replace embodied contradiction. The peak moment (fragment shattering) delivers generic catalog emotions ("fear, exhilaration, wonder") rather than character-specific reaction. The final "spark of purpose" reads as summary rather than earned transformation through on-page micro-choices; no visible cost forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (who, where, when). The story follows a causal arc: boredom → discovery → experiment → shatter → transformation. However, the closure unit—"the void within him had not been filled, but it had changed, transformed into something else—a spark of purpose"—is told rather than shown, and no on-page cost is legible in the final image. The drive lens reads as Causal, but the ending summarizes rather than dramatizes the reconfiguration, weakening closure proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is vivid and consistently rendered ("kaleidoscope of dimensions," "colors twisted into chaotic patterns"), and the solar storm applies temporal pressure. However, the setting remains largely descriptive; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The fragment and magnetic fields are handled, but the escondite itself functions as backdrop rather than pressure point, missing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (breaking monotony through discovery) is signaled early and escalates through Elyr's experiment. The solar storm and fragment manipulation create coherent pressure, and the shatter moment narrows options. However, the final cost is abstract ("the void...had changed") rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. One meaningful tightening is present, but the price remains declarative, limiting high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme (the cost of transcending stagnation) emerges from action and image rather than statement. The fragment, storm, and mutiny function as particulars that build pressure. However, the ending ("for the first time in eons, Elyr felt alive, and that was enough") tips into platitude without a resonant, non-literal answer. The final image asserts change rather than reweighting prior material through concrete cost or irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is stable, third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a controlled register ("hushed thunder," "watercolors on wet paper"). Diction remains within the POV's plausible lexicon throughout. Minor slip: "Its surface pulsed with a faint, magnetic hum, drawing his gaze like a moth to flame" leans on stock metaphor. Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific; under peak stress, diction compresses appropriately without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentences advance efficiently; no major loops or scaffold. However, several lines display figurative density without payoff: "shadows danced like ancient whispers," "each moment blending into the next like watercolors on wet paper," "drawing his gaze like a moth to flame" cluster stock metaphors in early beats. Template cadence appears in the climax: "The air crackled...the whispers...grew louder...He was on the brink..." stacks parallel constructions. Deduct −0.6 for figurative muddle and template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (immortal boredom + cursed artifact) is recognizable but executed with commitment. "Prismatic escondite," "spatial mutiny," and "dimensionally aware" add specificity, yet the emotional arc (void → discovery → purpose) follows a familiar template without transformation. The ending—feeling alive after eons—resolves into a generic epiphany. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material; the piece reads competent but median.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elyr (bored immortal) is present throughout; his choices (picking up fragment, manipulating energy, pressing on despite chaos) drive three distinct beats. Boredom frames setup, experimentation occupies the middle, and the shatter moment concludes with his altered state. However, the final "spark of purpose" is told rather than shown as a decision that alters tactics, slightly weakening closure participation. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.9, minus late summary −0.4, ornamental final beat −0.5 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cursed amulet fragment appears early (setup), is handled and manipulated across multiple beats (middle experimentation), and shatters at the climax (payoff), releasing energy that transforms Elyr. Three gates met; three distinct beats +1.4, causal pressure (narrows options by unleashing mutiny) +1.2, closure linkage (its power becomes part of him) +1.0, specificity (pulsing, magnetic hum) +0.5. Minor friction: the fragment's "power now a part of him" is stated rather than shown as a constraint or cost in the final image, −0.3. Total ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny (core concept) is named and described ("rebellion against the very fabric of existence," "dimensions...tearing at the seams") but functions primarily as thematic backdrop. It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page; Elyr's actions remain straightforward manipulation despite the mutiny's chaos. Setup present +0.6, middle involvement +0.4, closure mention +0.3, but ornamental use (description without action pressure) −1.0, swappability (could be "dimensional collapse" or similar) −0.6 = ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Dimensionally aware (attribute) is mentioned early ("able to perceive the subtle ripples in reality") and enables Elyr to sense the fragment's power. However, it does not constrain or enable a later action with visible cost; once stated, it remains label-only. Setup +0.5, one beat involvement +0.4, but label-only trait without trade-off −0.8, swappability (could be "magically sensitive") −0.5 = ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Intrigue (action) is declared by the fragment ("Intrigue awaits") and motivates Elyr's curiosity. It sets up the experiment but does not create a major turn on its own; curiosity and boredom are the driving forces. Setup +0.5, one beat involvement +0.4, but swappability (could be "mystery" or "discovery") −0.7, summary-only (intrigue is promised, not enacted as distinct action) −0.6 = ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Through magnetic fields (method) is signaled early ("Using his knowledge of magnetic fields") and shapes the middle experimentation beats (manipulating energy, channeling storm energy as conduit). However, the mechanics remain vague; "magnetic fields" functions as label rather than constraint with specific cost. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, but ornamental mechanics (no unique property matters) −0.7, swappability (could be "energy manipulation") −0.6 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite (setting) is vividly described throughout and reacts to Elyr's actions (shudders, colors flicker, erupts in light). It is present in setup, middle, and closure. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it remains atmospheric. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure participation +0.7, but postcard description without tactical pressure −1.2 = ~5.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>During a solar storm (timeframe) is signaled early, intensifies during the middle ("storm outside intensified"), and reaches peak at the climax ("As the storm reached its peak"). The storm's energy is channeled by Elyr, providing causal pressure. However, elapsed time is untracked; no clock tightens decisions. Setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.8, but no live clock −0.6, summary-only in final beats −0.4 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>To discover what happens after goodbye (motivation) is stated explicitly ("His motivation was simple: to discover what happens after goodbye") and frames Elyr's actions. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no on-page friction between this desire and a competing cost. Setup +0.6, closure mention +0.4, but told-only without friction −1.0, ornamental (does not narrow options) −0.7 = ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Hushed thunder (tone) is declared explicitly ("its voice a hushed thunder") and is sustained through diction choices ("whispers," "crackled," "drone"). Tone is coherent across beats and modulates with pressure (quiet curiosity → chaotic eruption → uneasy calm). However, the explicit naming of the tone reads as shortcut rather than embodied effect. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure participation +0.7, tone modulation +0.8, but explicit statement in text (meta) −0.5, static mood in final paragraph −0.4 = ~6.1.</comment>
