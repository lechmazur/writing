<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is declared but her choices feel predetermined rather than earned through contradictory impulses. The kneeling gesture and whispered word are micro-choices, but the pagoda's response feels like a reward for patience rather than consequence of a risky decision. Internal experience remains abstract—"anguished joy," "atoms of nostalgia"—without embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The final realization that "the past was not a burden to bear, but a gift to cherish" reads as a tidy epiphany rather than one forced by visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where by paragraph one. The closure unit—Elara's realization that the pagoda is a mirror—qualifies as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains diffuse: no specific path is foreclosed on the page, and the "unlocking something far greater" feels awarded rather than earned through prior pressure. The archive's "steadily unpredictable" layout is mentioned but never constrains a choice. One tightening occurs when she recognizes the erased pattern on the floor, but this reversal doesn't narrow options or raise stakes—it simply triggers the pagoda's automatic response.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archive setting is vivid—shadows, stone tablets, bronze surface—and the worn tiles function as micro-setting that prompts Elara's key insight. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her historian's lens. However, the environment never constrains choice; the "labyrinth of secrets" and shifting layout are told rather than demonstrated through navigation that alters tactics. The pagoda's light charges the final image but doesn't press back against her goal, keeping the band solidly mid-range.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unlocking forbidden knowledge—is signaled early but remains abstract. The one tightening (recognizing the erased pattern) doesn't foreclose a live option or force a trade-off; it simply delivers the solution. The pagoda responds without resistance, and Elara's "journey was far from over" ending defers cost rather than paying it on the page. No visible price alters tactics, and the protagonist's agency is observation rather than a decision with consequence. Escalation under Accumulative lens requires a deepening that reweights the stake with cost; here the reweighting feels declarative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as gift rather than burden—emerges from the pagoda encounter, but the final paragraph states it directly: "the past was not a burden to bear, but a gift to cherish." The "atoms of nostalgia" recur but function as ornamental metaphor rather than accumulating pressure that charges the closure. The erased-pattern insight is a purposeful image, yet the pagoda's automatic purification bypasses earned struggle. No counter-reading is invited; the resolution is symmetrically satisfying without ambiguity or cost that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent elevated register—"atoms of nostalgia," "fragile threads of her own sanity"—that fits a historian's voice. Psychic distance remains controlled. However, the diction leans ornate throughout ("tantalizingly out of reach," "gateway to a future") without modulating under pressure, and some phrases ("the very atoms of nostalgia were alive") drift toward abstraction. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific; the filter feels authorial rather than Elara's lived idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "Its surface shimmered with hues of amber and indigo, casting fragmented light across the chamber, as if the very atoms of nostalgia were alive within its metallic lattice" stacks metaphor without clear image. Template cadence in paragraph four: "She had learned to navigate its whims, to trust her instincts, to let the archive guide her" runs parallel infinitives. Paraphrase loop: "The pagoda was not a key to knowledge, but a mirror" is restated as "she had unlocked something far greater." Several stock metaphors ("fragile threads," "hollow places within her soul") dull specificity. Cumulative penalty −0.8 for density and loop issues; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The frame—historian unlocking an ancient artifact—is a familiar template without a fresh angle. The "atoms of nostalgia" concept is intriguing but remains ornamental rather than transforming the plot through lived mechanics. The twist that the pagoda is a mirror rather than a key is signaled late and resolves without friction. Transformation test fails: swap "historian" for "archaeologist" and "pagoda" for "obelisk" and the emotional arc is unchanged. The ending's "journey was far from over" is a stock opening rather than a specific, inevitable synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (tracing the bronze, kneeling, whispering the word) advance the plot. However, her decisions feel reactive—prompted by the pagoda's shimmer and the floor pattern—rather than creating key turns through agency. The final realization is delivered to her rather than earned through a risky choice with cost. Setup and payoff gates met, but middle development is observation-driven. Swappability moderate; another scholar would function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda appears in setup (paragraph one), is handled mid-scene (Elara traces it, kneels before it), and its fracturing light shapes the closure image. It constrains her approach—she must solve its riddle—and its prismatic response "purifies" her. However, its mechanics are passive: it reacts rather than resisting or complicating her choice. Causal pressure is present but limited to one key beat (the whispered word triggers the response). Irreplaceability moderate; any mystical artifact could serve a similar function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Atoms of nostalgia" is invoked as metaphor in paragraph one and again when the pagoda releases "a living mist" of memory fragments. It frames expectation but doesn't constrain on-page choices—Elara's tactics (tracing, kneeling, whispering) are unaffected by the concept's mechanics. The concept functions thematically rather than operationally; removing it would require rewording but not restructure the plot. Setup and payoff gates met, middle development absent. Ornamental use penalty −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" is attributed to both Elara's finger movements (paragraph one) and the archive's layout (paragraph four). However, the trait is told rather than demonstrated: no on-page action shows Elara making an unpredictable choice, and the archive's shifts don't alter her path. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff. Late middle mention, no closure participation. Cap at 3.4 for missing development; label-only deduction −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Purify" is signaled in paragraph two ("to purify them, to unlock their essence") and enacted when Elara whispers "a word that meant both 'purify' and 'remember'" at the climax. The pagoda's light then "purifies" her, filling "the hollow places within her soul." Setup and payoff gates met. The action drives the major turn and is irreplaceable—removing "purify" would require reworking the word-magic and the pagoda's function. However, the mechanics are passive (she speaks, it responds) rather than forcing a risky choice with visible cost. Causal pressure +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, but low cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"By avoiding patterns" is mentioned in paragraph two ("she knew she must avoid patterns") and becomes operational in paragraph four when Elara recognizes the erased pattern on the floor—"avoiding patterns meant not just shunning repetition, but recognizing where patterns had been deliberately erased." This insight triggers the climax. Setup and middle development gates met; the method shapes one key attempt and the closure follows from it. However, the mechanics are abstract—how does recognizing absence differ from recognizing presence in practice?—and the method could be swapped for another puzzle-solving approach with minor edits. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is established in paragraph one and remains the sole location. It supplies the pagoda, the scrolls, and the worn floor tiles that enable Elara's discovery. The setting's "labyrinth of secrets" and shifting layout are mentioned but never constrain navigation on the page. Micro-setting (the erased tiles) alters tactics by cueing the key insight. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure moderate (+0.5); the archive's resources enable the climax but don't press back. Removing the archive would require relocating the pagoda but wouldn't fundamentally alter the plot structure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Across the end of innocence" is mentioned in paragraph one ("she had sworn to pursue forbidden knowledge, even if it meant unraveling the fragile threads of her own sanity") and returns in the final paragraph ("The end of innocence was not an ending, but a beginning"). However, the timeframe remains metaphorical rather than operational—no clock tightens decisions, and "end of innocence" doesn't constrain when she must act or what she loses by waiting. Lyric reprise without middle development or causal pressure. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation as a time constraint; present only as theme.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To pursue forbidden knowledge" is stated in paragraph one and labeled as her motivation in paragraph two ("Her motivation burned within her like a flame, both anguished and joyful"). The pursuit drives her presence in the archive and her engagement with the pagoda. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page moment shows her weighing the cost of forbidden knowledge against safety or sanity. The resolution awards her ("unlocked something far greater") rather than forcing a trade-off. Setup and development gates met, but friction between want and cost is declared, not shown. Told-only penalty −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Anguished joy" is declared in paragraph two and echoed in the final paragraph ("her heart alight with anguished joy"). The tone attempts to hold contradictory emotions—anguish from "the erosion of her own innocence," joy from revelation—but the juxtaposition is stated rather than modulated through scene pressure. At the climax, the tone tilts fully positive (warmth, purification, gift) without sustained anguish. Static mood declared at setup and payoff; middle development modulates away from the duality rather than deepening it. Lyric reprise without pressure shaping tone across turns.</comment>
