<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is defined by label-only traits ("synesthetically blessed," "encore-seeking") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The duplicate character (the young woman who is "a version of herself") creates confusion rather than pressure—her despair is asserted through stock descriptors ("eyes hollow as if she'd seen the end of all things") rather than particular choice under constraint. The transformation happens through prop magic (the coin's color shift) rather than earned internal reversal. Therapy-speak intrudes at the peak: "intertwine the past and the future, create something new" reads as diagnostic self-awareness no one has mid-crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is adequate by ~120 words (moon, hedge maze, orchard, ghost), so no penalty applied. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—atmospheric intensification through synesthetic currents and garden imagery—but the closure lacks visible cost: the woman walks away "steady," the coin glows "softly," and Mara feels "warmth" with "bittersweet" nostalgia, all of which deflate pressure rather than reconfigure it with felt price. The fractured timeline is mentioned three times but never dramatized as a constraint that narrows options; it functions as backdrop. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early but does not pay it off with undeniable cost at closure, so the RR form is incomplete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The hedge maze, orchard, fountain, and night flowers are vividly described with sensory detail (blooming petals, moss-covered basin, silver moonlight). However, the setting remains ornamental: no spatial choice is constrained by the maze's layout, the dry fountain does not alter tactics, and the hedge walls serve only as theatrical backdrop. The "mystic orchard garden concealed within a hedge maze" is named but not leveraged—Mara and the woman could conduct this encounter in any atmospheric locale without structural change. Micro-setting (the tarot coin as object-in-hand) appears but does not constrain action beyond serving as prop for color-shift magic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("lure possibility from the brink of despair") is signaled early but never tested: the woman accepts the coin without resistance, experiences an immediate mood shift via its magical colors, and departs "steady" with no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. No meaningful tightening occurs; the garden "responds" and "shifts" through atmospheric adjectives rather than Mara's agency or cost. Coincidence (the coin's autonomous color-morphing) resolves the problem it did not help create. The "fractured timeline beginning to mend" is told as summary in the final paragraphs rather than demonstrated through a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of renewal and hope through "producing echoes" emerges from images (coin colors, garden blooming, dawn light) rather than overt statement, which is positive. However, the final paragraphs lapse into direct thematic summary: "We're not bound by what's been done. We can intertwine the past and the future, create something new" and "The performance would go on" function as meta-commentary rather than resonant reconfiguration. The synesthetic senses "painted the dawn in hues of hope and renewal" is near-allegory, with the prompt concept ("fractured timeline," "synesthetically blessed") functioning as labels rather than lived particulars that complicate the moral calculus. No counter-reading is invited; the ending grants symmetric satisfaction without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Mara's perceptual signature ("synesthetic currents," colors as emotion) is consistently foregrounded, and the narration filters setting through her theatrical lens. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats: "the threads of possibility that hung by a thread" (redundant metaphor), "intertwine the past and the future," and "rising nostalgia wash over her" read as thematic placeholders rather than character-specific idiom. Dialogue between Mara and the woman ("You're not alone," "How…?" "By producing echoes") lacks subtext or resistance; lines advance exposition rather than pursuit of conflicting goals. The final paragraph's "bittersweet smile" and "rising nostalgia" are label-only emotional closures.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across the piece with some strong images ("petals unfurling like secrets," "air shimmering like heat over a flame"). Paraphrase loops appear: "the garden responded—the whispers grew louder, the shadows deeper" is immediately followed by "the air grew warmer, the shadows softer, and the whispers turned to harmonies," restating the garden's atmospheric shift without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in multiple paragraphs: "She closed her eyes… She stepped forward… She reached the center… She drew the tarot coin" and later "She looked at Mara… She nodded… She smiled… She turned" (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("the moon hung low," "secrets," "symphony") cluster without fresh synthesis. Figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats ("swirling like paint in water," "shimmering like heat over a flame," "storm of blues and grays") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.3). Total artifact deductions: −0.9 in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—ghost counselor uses magical tarot coin to heal alternate-timeline self in a mystical garden—closely follows urban-fantasy templates (magical object, fractured-self motif, atmospheric setting as stage) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (Derivative Premise: −0.8). The resolution (coin's color-shift magic instantly cures despair) is a stock payoff. Specificity is limited to prompt fulfillment: "synesthetically blessed," "fractured timeline," "hand-painted tarot coin" function as required checkboxes rather than inevitable synthesis. The Transformation Test fails: swap "ghost" for "witch," "coin" for "crystal," "orchard" for "grove," and the arc remains unchanged. No bold structural risk; the piece follows a safe, linear template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara (encore-seeking stage ghost) is present throughout and makes one choice: to summon the woman and offer the coin. However, this choice does not create a key turn—the woman's acceptance and transformation happen via the coin's autonomous magic rather than Mara's tactical adaptation under pressure. Mara observes and facilitates but does not face a decision that alters her own options or costs. Her "purpose fulfilled—for now" is summary-only closure without visible trade-off. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is weak (the choice does not narrow options or raise stakes). Swappable with a generic mentor figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hand-painted tarot coin appears in three distinct beats: Mara touches it early (setup), holds it aloft at the fountain to summon the woman (middle use), and the woman clutches it as she departs while Mara returns it to her neck (payoff). Its "colors shifting" and "pulsing faintly" create atmospheric texture, and the woman's grasp triggers her mood shift, giving it causal involvement. However, the coin's mechanics are vague—its color-morphing happens autonomously rather than through Mara's effort or cost—so the element does not constrain Mara's tactics or impose a visible price. Removing it would require a different magical mechanism, but any synesthetic prop could substitute. Specific to the prompt but not irreplaceable in story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The fractured timeline is mentioned three times ("bound to this place," "the timeline fractured most visibly," "the fractured timeline beginning to mend") but never dramatized as a constraint that shapes on-page choices. No character navigates temporal disjunction, weighs costs of altering the timeline, or confronts a timeline-imposed limit. It functions as atmospheric label and thematic backdrop rather than a stake or mechanic. The woman is "a version of herself from another fragment of time," but this detail does not create friction or enable tactics—she could be any despairing stranger. Setup is present as description; middle and closure participation are absent as causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Synesthetically blessed is mentioned four times: intro label, "synesthetic currents guide her," "Mara's synesthetic senses flared," and "synesthetic senses painted the dawn." Each mention is descriptive summary rather than a constrained action with cost. The trait does not enable a specific tactic (e.g., perceiving a hidden clue others miss) or impose a visible trade-off (e.g., sensory overload that hinders her). The currents "guide her" and "painted the world in hues of sound and emotion," but these remain metaphorical atmosphere rather than mechanics that alter her choices. Label-only integration; no demonstrated friction or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Intertwine appears twice in dialogue: "We can intertwine the past and the future" and "the woman's despair intertwining with her own hope." The action is thematic rather than causal—no on-page mechanics show how intertwining is achieved beyond the coin's color-shift magic. The major turn (woman's transformation) traces to the coin's autonomous effect rather than an intertwining tactic Mara employs under constraint. Swappable with "mend," "fuse," or "harmonize" without structural change. Present in setup (implicit in Mara's power) and payoff (dialogue explanation), but absent as a distinct method in the middle beat where the woman is healed.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>By producing echoes is named once in Mara's dialogue: "By producing echoes… we can intertwine the past and the future." The phrase is explanatory rather than mechanical—no scene shows Mara producing an echo or the cost/constraint of doing so. The woman is "a version of herself from another fragment," which could be an echo, but this is not leveraged as a method Mara actively deploys. The garden's "whispers" and "echoes of her actions reverberating" are atmospheric metaphor rather than a signaled means that shapes attempts. Late first mention (dialogue near end), summary-only, and easily replaceable with any magical verb.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The mystic orchard garden concealed within a hedge maze is established early (setup) and provides vivid sensory anchors (moon, hedge walls, trees, fountain, night flowers). The fountain's cracked basin is the site of the summoning (middle beat), and the maze's exit frames the woman's departure (payoff). However, the setting does not pressure choices: the maze's concealment is mentioned but never navigated, the orchard's "mystic" properties are atmospheric rather than mechanical, and spatial layout does not constrain or enable tactics. Removing the hedge maze or substituting a forest clearing would not alter the story's logic. Functional as backdrop; replaceable as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>After the business closes is mentioned once in the opening line and again implicitly with "the first light of dawn crept over the hedge maze" at closure. The timeframe brackets the scene but does not tighten decisions—no clock pressures Mara, and the transition from night to dawn is gradual summary rather than a live constraint that alters tactics. The phrasing "after the business closes" is vague (what business?) and treated as scene-setting rather than a mechanic. Setup present; middle and closure participation as pressure are absent. Swappable with "at midnight" or "during the night" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>To lure possibility from the brink of despair is named once early ("she had a purpose: to lure possibility from the brink of despair") and fulfilled when the woman departs "steady" with "a spark in her gaze." The motivation is signaled in setup and achieved at payoff. However, it is not dramatized as conflicted choice—Mara's only action is offering the coin, which works immediately without friction, cost, or tactical adjustment. The desire does not compete with a fear or opposing want; no moment tests whether luring this woman might cost Mara something. Functional stake but told rather than embodied in choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Rising nostalgia appears explicitly in the final line ("let the rising nostalgia wash over her") and implicitly in earlier beats through Mara's connection to "a life she once lived" and the coin as "remnant of a life." The tone modulates from theatrical mystery (opening) to synesthetic intensity (middle) to bittersweet warmth (closure), coherent across beats. However, "rising nostalgia" at the end is label-only rather than embodied in image or syntax, and the emotional charge is diffuse rather than focused on a specific lost object or choice. The tone supports the concept but does not decisively reweight the final image. Setup present, coherent through turns, payoff weakened by abstraction.</comment>
