<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to decode the crystal is clear and sustained, but his interiority leans heavily on abstract reflection ("weathered innocence," "respect for the power of language") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to walk away with the spent crystal feels more like graceful acceptance than a decision that costs him something specific on the page. Micro-choices under pressure are minimal; he hums, scribbles, and observes without internal friction or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who, where, and when by the opening paragraph, satisfying orientation. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the crystal's echoes coalesce into a pattern through layered detail rather than because/therefore linkage. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias stands with the spent crystal, a seed for the future, and the final echo lingers. The cost—crystal spent, quest complete—is felt but somewhat abstract; the "bittersweet victory" is told more than shown in a concrete forfeiture or narrowed path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shadowed library, dawn light, and worn oak desk anchor setting vividly and filter through Elias's scholarly perspective. The crystal is handled across multiple beats (tracing, humming into it, cradling) and its properties—sonically reflective, vibrating—constrain his method. The final image is charged by the crystal's spent state and the lifted hush, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting or object shape the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: decode the pattern to restore lost language. Pressure accumulates as fractured sequences coalesce, and the crystal drains—a tightening that narrows Elias's window. However, escalation is gradual accretion rather than a live decision point that forces a trade-off. The cost (crystal spent, purpose fulfilled) arrives as inevitable consequence rather than a protagonist choice that forecloses an alternative path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present but agency feels passive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—language as fragile human expression, salvage versus loss—emerges organically from the crystal's mechanics and the post-dictionary world. The final image ("seed for the future," faint whisper of hope) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "weathered innocence," "beauty and fragility of human expression," and "power of language" veer toward abstract thematic statements. The piece resists overt sermon but hovers close to telling the theme rather than letting the crystal's spent state fully embody it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and distance is controlled. Diction is elevated and consistent with a scholarly focalizer, though some phrases ("suspended hush," "mausoleum of forgotten texts") read slightly generic-literary. No head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates purposefully as dawn light enters. Perceptual signature is present but could be more character-specific; phrases like "the weight of unspoken words" feel stock rather than idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, several loops and near-paraphrases appear: "the crystal was sonically reflective, capturing whispers" is immediately followed by "a phenomenon he had spent years studying" (scaffolding); "he had witnessed the decline" / "the erosion of stories" restates the same idea; "triumph and sorrow, a bittersweet victory" is redundant. Template cadence: "He adjusted... leaned... began to testify... scribbled" runs through sequential actions without momentum gain. These artifacts dull the closure's charge slightly (−0.6 baseline, touching final third adds −0.2).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—sonically reflective crystal encoding a pattern to restore language in a post-dictionary world—offers a fresh synthesis of object, method, and stakes. However, the "forgotten knowledge" + "lone scholar" + "bittersweet discovery" frame is a common template, and execution does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or lived detail. The crystal's mechanics and the dawn-library atmosphere are specific, lifting the piece above purely generic, but the emotional arc and final image feel familiar rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's reticence is mentioned ("reticent scholar," "grown accustomed to silence") but does not constrain a key choice. He studies, hums, and walks away; his personality is present but does not create a turn. Present in setup and closure, but no middle beat where reticence blocks or enables a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal is handled across at least three beats: Elias traces its contours (opening), hums into it and feels it vibrate (middle), and cradles it as it drains (closure). Its sonically reflective property enables the decoding method and its spent state shapes the bittersweet ending. The crystal drives escalation (pattern coalesces, energy drains) and charges the final image. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Suspended hush" is mentioned in the opening and closing ("the suspended hush... seemed to lift"), but it remains atmospheric rather than shaping stakes or altering tactics. It does not constrain a choice or change options; it is thematic echo only. Lyric reprise without middle development trends mid-low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sonically reflective" is established early and enables Elias's humming method (middle beat: "he would hum melodies into the crystal, hoping to provoke a response"). It constrains his approach—he cannot use visual or written cues—and the crystal's response (vibration, silence) affects his patience and progress. The trait shapes one key turn (pattern coalesces) and is present at closure (final echo). One causal role in a major beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Testify" appears once: "he began to testify to what he heard, his voice barely above a whisper." It describes his act of vocalizing the echoes but does not drive a major turn. The decoding and final walk-away do not trace back to "testify" as the pivotal action; he could "record," "transcribe," or "speak" with similar effect. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Fractured sequences" is signaled early ("echoes came in disjointed fragments") and its mechanics matter: Elias scribbles notes, tries to make sense of chaos, and the sequences "coalesce into something resembling a pattern." The method shapes his middle attempts (humming to provoke clearer echoes) and is present at closure (final echo). Shapes one key turn and contributes to ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is vividly described and anchors the piece. The tall windows allow dawn light to creep in, cueing Elias's work timing. The setting provides solitude and "atmosphere, which mirrored the weathered innocence he carried," but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. It is present at closure (hush lifts, door) but mostly as backdrop. Purposeful early-final reprise without middle constraint trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the last dictionary was printed" frames the world's linguistic decline and motivates Elias's quest. It is present at setup and closure ("the world was waking, but... would never be the same"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a deadline. No live clock that alters moves; it is context rather than tactical pressure. Functional but does not escalate stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To decode the pattern of growth" is stated early ("his motivation was singular") and is dramatized through Elias's study actions (humming, scribbling, realizing the blueprint). The motivation drives the middle beat (pattern coalesces, heart quickens) and shapes the closure (pattern uncovered as "seed for the future"). Desire is acted upon across beats, though internal conflict between wanting the discovery and fearing the cost is told more than shown in contradictory impulses. Shapes one key turn and is present at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Weathered innocence" is mentioned once ("the atmosphere... mirrored the weathered innocence he carried") and echoed in the final paragraph's "hope." The tone reads as wistful throughout but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image distinctly. It is coherent but static, a single mood rather than a tonal shift that reweights the stake. Present at setup and closure without middle evolution trends mid-low.</comment>
