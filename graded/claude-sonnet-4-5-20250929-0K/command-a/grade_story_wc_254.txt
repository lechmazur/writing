<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The poet remains an abstraction throughout—"aesthetically driven" and "cloud-shadow" are labels without grounding action or contradictory impulse. No micro-choices dramatize values under pressure; the protagonist simply absorbs sensations and recites without internal conflict or embodied cost. The final "breathless" and "heart full" are asserted emotional states rather than earned through struggle. The piece lacks the character-particular interiority and flawed agency required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when emerge slowly across the first third with no clear dramatic present anchored by ~120 words (−0.4). The dominant stake—transcending the ordinary through art—is declared but never tested by a reversal or tightening; the ice cracks and the poem flows without opposition or cost. The ending offers atmospheric assertion ("had done what they came to do") rather than a legible change in options or knowledge. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost is on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and frozen lake are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("lantern-moth hush," "humming quartz colonnade"). However, the environment remains a passive backdrop; no spatial detail constrains a choice or alters the poet's tactics. The ice shards floating and the atrium "bowing" are decorative rather than functional pressures, keeping the score below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake is signaled early but never tested. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the poet steps in, touches the quartz, recites, and succeeds without friction or trade-off. The "courage to dismantle the walls" is told rather than dramatized through a forced choice with visible cost. Escalation and agency are absent, capping the score well below mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring images (boundaries, dissolving, paraphrase) but the ending states the moral overtly: "the sacred was not in the walls we build, but in the spaces we dare to cross." The poet's arc—courage to transcend—is asserted rather than earned through specific struggle. The final paragraph meta-commentary ("a note in its endless melody") replaces scene pressure with thematic summary (−0.6).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. However, diction drifts into elevated literary register ("lantern-moth hush," "cobalt atrium," "tremor of certainty") that feels authorial rather than emerging from a distinct character consciousness. The poet's perceptual signature is generic—no idiosyncratic filtering or bias shapes what is noticed. Voice lacks specificity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow poet," "humming quartz colonnade," "second shadow") without teaching a pattern or paying off at closure (−0.5 density penalty). Paraphrase loops appear: "dissolving boundaries" recurs three times with minimal variation; "tremor of certainty" is repeated without reweighting (−0.3). Template cadence: "The poet stepped… their boots crunching… They reached out… their fingers brushing…" runs across multiple sentences (−0.5). Scaffolding and synonym churn dull momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("a note in its endless melody"), triggering the escalated penalty (−1.7 total in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—artist seeks transcendence through boundary-crossing—is a widely used template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−1.0 derivative premise adjustment). The frozen lake and cobalt atrium are vivid but the emotional arc and turns (step in, recite, succeed) could transpose to any mystical-journey frame with minor edits. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece retreats into atmospheric safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet is present throughout and speaks the poem at the climax, but makes no decision that alters tactics or narrows options. The character observes, feels, and recites without friction or trade-off—pure agency through aesthetic experience rather than choice under pressure. Setup and closure participation are present but no middle development choice exists.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The humming quartz colonnade appears in the opening, is touched mid-story ("fingers brushing against the smooth surface"), and returns in the farewell beat. However, its role is atmospheric; the quartz does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Two beats of mention without causal pressure or charged reprise keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"A tremor of certainty" is mentioned twice as an internal sensation but does not shape stakes or tactics. It functions as a thematic label rather than a force that changes options on the page. No middle development or closure linkage with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Aesthetically driven" is stated twice but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The trait remains a label; no visible tradeoff emerges from the poet's aesthetic priority. Ornamental presence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase is mentioned in the text ("gentle art of paraphrase," "had not just paraphrased the world") and the poet's recitation could be read as paraphrasing the essence of the quartz and lake. It appears in the climax and closure but the mechanics are vague—what exactly is being paraphrased and how does it dissolve boundaries? Setup and payoff are present but swappable with "translate" or "channel" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Through dissolving boundaries" is the method stated in the text; it appears when the poet touches the quartz ("the world shifted. Through dissolving boundaries…") and again near the end. However, the mechanics are abstract—no on-page demonstration of *how* boundaries dissolve or what specific cost that dissolution imposes. Setup and payoff without middle development or tactical shaping.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium by a frozen lake is established early, frames the entire scene, and returns in the farewell image. The setting provides vivid atmosphere and the ice cracks during the poem, but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the poet's tactics. All three gates (setup, middle presence, payoff) are met but causal pressure is absent, capping the score near 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the ban lifts" is mentioned in the opening line and shapes the permission to enter, but the timeframe never tightens decisions or creates urgency. No clock or deadline alters tactics. Ornamental setup without development or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"To stride through boundaries once thought sacred" is the poet's stated motivation in the opening paragraph. It is told rather than dramatized—no on-page friction between this desire and a competing want or cost. The poet simply enacts the desire without conflict or sacrifice. Setup is present but no middle or closure linkage with dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Lantern-moth hush" appears in the opening and closing lines, framing the piece with a consistent quiet, reverent tone. The tone does not modulate with pressure—no shift during the climactic recitation—but the return in the final paragraph does reweight the opening image with gentle closure. Lyric reprise without causal pressure or charge lands in mid-band.</comment>
