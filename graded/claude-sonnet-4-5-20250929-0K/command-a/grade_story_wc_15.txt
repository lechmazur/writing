<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains abstract throughout—her "poetic wharf weaver" role is label-only and never dramatized through actual weaving choices or trade-offs. Internal experience is filtered through elevated diction ("hauntingly optimistic aura," "orchid solace") rather than embodied contradiction. The sleepwalking method removes agency; she follows "an unseen force" rather than making pressured micro-choices. No visible cost attends her final rest; the task completes without foreclosing any live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "poetic wharf weaver" and "storybook illustration plate" appear immediately but remain opaque past 120 words; the labyrinth's purpose and the tide-pool desolation are asserted rather than dramatized. The drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught—leaving the reader unable to trace how one beat enables the next. Closure registers as summary ("her task complete") without a visible, on-page cost or a decisive shift in options. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) applies; Q3 is capped at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The labyrinth's red canyon walls anchor place early, but spatial choreography remains vague—Elara "moves deeper" without mapped turns or distances. The storybook plate's shifting illustrations are described but never constrain a tactical choice or force a detour. "Orchid solace" and "hauntingly optimistic aura" repeat as atmospheric labels without sensory grounding or perceptual filter. The final glow is asserted, not shown altering any on-page action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"carve a path from ruin to reverence"—is declared but never tested by an on-page obstacle or live alternative. Elara's sleepwalking removes agency; her movements are guided rather than chosen under pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs; each paragraph restates the transformation ("desolate to gallery," "ruin to reverence") without a turn that narrows options. The ending reports completion without a visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme ("broken precedents transformed into enduring art") is stated outright in the final paragraph rather than earned through image or choice. "Orchid solace" and "hauntingly optimistic" recur as prompt labels without fresh inflection. The storybook plate's illustrations are described but never pose a question or dilemma that the ending resolves. Closure lacks a resonant, non-literal answer; instead it summarizes the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains stable distance, but diction drifts into elevated register ("perpetual cycle of creation and reverence," "timeless narrative") that exceeds the scene's immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices "whispers," "remnants," "relics" without character-specific bias. No dialogue appears. Elision is purposeful (the mechanics of sewing are compressed), but the prose never anchors perception in her body or tool-handling to create a distinct texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "carve a path from ruin to reverence" appears three times, "hauntingly optimistic" twice, "orchid solace" three times, each without added detail. Template cadence runs through paragraphs two and three ("Each step was deliberate, each movement a stitch"; "not obstacles but inspirations, each one a thread"). Stock metaphor strings ("threads," "weaving," "tapestry," "stitch") lack fresh embodiment. Figurative density in high-pressure moments (final paragraph) blurs rather than sharpens the closure image. Accumulated artifacts warrant −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "artist mending ruin through craft" premise is familiar; transformation relies on prompt elements (wharf weaver, illustration plate, sleepwalking) rather than specific, non-obvious character stakes. "Broken precedents" and "orchid solace" remain abstract labels without grounded world logic. The sleepwalking method and shifting illustrations hint at ingenuity but are never dramatized as choices that risk failure. Emotional arc—sorrow to hope—follows a predictable template without friction or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation is named early, but she makes no on-page choice that alters tactics. Sleepwalking removes decision pressure; she "follows" rather than directs. Setup and development gates are met (first and middle thirds), but closure participation is passive—she "allows herself a moment of rest" without a visible cost or stance shift tied to her role as weaver.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The plate appears in paragraph one, returns in paragraph four ("became her compass"), and is cradled at closure. However, it functions as a static guide—its "scenes shifting" are told, not shown constraining a choice. No cost or trade-off is tied to its use; Elara never risks losing it, misreading it, or choosing between its images. Meets setup and payoff gates but lacks middle development with pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Broken precedents" is mentioned twice (paragraphs one and three) as a thematic label but never defines a specific on-page problem or decision. The text does not dramatize what precedent was broken, by whom, or how mending it constrains Elara's methods. Ornamental use; swappable with "past mistakes" or "old wounds" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" appears twice as a mood label (paragraphs one and six) but does not enable or constrain an action. No scene shows Elara choosing optimism over caution, or optimism costing her time or safety. The trait could be removed and the plot would proceed identically. Late payoff mention at closure is decorative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sewing is named early ("her action was to sew") and returns in paragraphs two, four, and six. It shapes the method—Elara weaves stories into walls—but the act itself is summarized rather than shown with tool, thread, or physical cost. One causal role: the overlapping paths create patterns, which transforms the labyrinth. Meets all three gates but the specificity of sewing (versus "weaving" or "inscribing") does not drive a unique turn. Mid-band; not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Overlapping sleepwalking paths" is introduced in paragraph two and mentioned again in paragraph five ("began to overlap more frequently"). The method is told but never shown creating a problem or enabling a breakthrough—no moment where overlap reveals a hidden door, traps her, or forces a choice. Functional but replaceable with "wandering" or "repeated walks." Meets setup and development gates; missing strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The labyrinth and red canyon walls are named in the opening line and recur throughout. Spatial details remain vague—no turn, chamber, or dead-end constrains Elara's movement. The walls receive her work but never pressure her (no crumbling stone, no choice between paths). Setup and development gates met; closure shows the walls glowing, but this is reported rather than shown altering an action. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the tide pools emptied" is mentioned once in paragraph one but does not function as an on-page clock or resource limit. No scene shows time pressure, seasonal change, or a deadline that alters Elara's tactics. The timeframe is backstory context, not a live constraint. Ornamental; removable without plot change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early and repeatedly ("carve a path from ruin to reverence"). It frames the task but never faces an on-page test—no moment where reverence conflicts with safety, speed, or accuracy. Paragraph five notes "determination fueling her through moments of doubt and fatigue," but those moments are summarized, not dramatized. Meets setup and development gates; drives general direction but lacks a specific, costly choice tied to this exact phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" appears three times (paragraphs two and six). The tone is consistent—lyrical, elevated, hopeful—but static; it does not modulate with pressure or shift at closure. The final paragraph's "light with hope" echoes the opening's "hauntingly optimistic" without deepening. Functional mood-setting but replaceable with "quiet hope" or "gentle peace." Meets setup and payoff gates; lacks middle pressure or a charged reprise.</comment>
