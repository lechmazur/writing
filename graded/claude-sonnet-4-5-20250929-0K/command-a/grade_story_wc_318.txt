<comment>Eli's motivation is clear—restore lost laughter—but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("mournfully eager," "desperate attempt") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The character never faces a meaningful internal conflict or makes a micro-choice under pressure that reveals hierarchy of values; he simply executes his plan until laughter returns. Emotional progression reads as performed determination rather than degrading thought under stress. The final smile is asserted rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Orientation is delayed: who Eli is, where the tunnel is located, and what "after the final grain slips through the hourglass" concretely means remain vague past 120 words, triggering a −0.4 penalty. The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (laughter begins to return), but the cost is conceptual and off-page rather than visible in Eli's choices or losses; the "weary smile" and "glimmer of hope" are told, not dramatized through forfeited options. The drive lens wavers between Accumulative (building sound/emotion) and Causal (restore laughter) without teaching a stable pattern early. The closure lands softly but lacks the felt price required for higher bands.</comment>

<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>The echo chamber tunnel is vividly rendered with sensory detail ("walls whispering secrets," "shadows danced like old memories"), and the pull cord handle returns with tactile presence across beats. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining Eli's choices or supplying resources that alter outcome; the tunnel's transformation (echoes softening, walls exhaling) is passive response, not active pressure. Spatial choreography is minimal—Eli's movements are vague ("moved with purpose," "steps deliberate")—and the world outside at the end is generic ("brighter," "lighter"). The setting charges the mood but does not reach the micro-setting threshold where environment shapes tactics at closure.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—restore lost laughter—is signaled early, but pressure remains static throughout; Eli's leaf blower symphony proceeds without reversal, complication, or visible cost that narrows options. No live trade-off or foreclosed path appears on the page: exhaustion is mentioned but does not alter tactics, and the laughter's return is convenient rather than earned through protagonist agency under the inferred lens. The task is declared "impossible," yet the resolution arrives without on-page struggle that changes knowledge or stakes. Escalation is asserted through intensifiers ("louder, more insistent," "crescendo") rather than dramatized through choice or constraint.</comment>

<comment>Theme—tending to the unspoken, restoring lost joy—emerges through image (leaf blower as conductor's baton, off-key wind carrying laughter) rather than statement, and the pull cord handle recurs with symbolic weight. However, the ending offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; instead, it delivers a tidy moral (effort can restore hope) through the soft laugh and Eli's weary smile. The phrase "tended to the unspoken" in the final line risks thematic echo by naming the concept directly. Motifs (hourglass, lullabies, echoes) are present but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure that charges the closure image; they decorate rather than complicate.</comment>

<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable, and diction carries a lyric, fable-like register consistent with the haunting tone. However, the voice leans into elevated abstraction ("mournfully eager," "plea to the silence," "stitched together what had been lost") that distances the reader from Eli's immediate perception; filter verbs and summary constructions ("He knew," "seemed to") dull immediacy in peak beats. Psychic distance remains constant rather than modulating with emotional intensity. The prose is legible but the perceptual signature is not character-particular—Eli's way of noticing reads as narrator's poetic stance rather than his own idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>Repetitive phrasing pervades: "mournfully eager" appears three times, "pull cord handle" recurs in identical noun phrases across beats, and synonym loops ("plea, a prayer, a desperate attempt"; "louder, more insistent") bloat without advancing pressure. Template cadence is evident in stacked "He [verb]" and "Eli [verb]" sentence openings across multiple paragraphs. Metaphors strain coherence: "macerate the stillness" (literal grinding applied to abstract silence) and "off-key wind" (wind cannot be off-key; the lullaby is off-key, wind carries it) muddle the vehicle. These artifacts cluster in high-pressure beats (the symphony crescendo) and touch the closure paragraph ("tended to the unspoken" is label-speak), triggering cumulative deductions and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>4.4</grade>
<comment>The premise—conductor with leaf blower restores laughter in surreal tunnel—combines whimsical elements but does not transform them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; the frame reads as quirky ornament rather than earned necessity. The core conflict (restore lost laughter) and resolution (laughter returns after sustained effort) follow a template inspirational arc without fresh inflection or hindsight inevitability. Emotional truth is generic: the "weary smile" and "glimmer of hope" could apply to any restorative fable. No bold risk-taking heightens stakes; the safe middle—magical realism with soft uplift—hedges against deeper cost or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>Eli is present throughout and makes the decision to conduct the symphony, but his choices do not create key turns—pressure remains static and the laughter's return is not contingent on a pivot he makes mid-scene. Observation and execution dominate; renunciation or trade-off does not appear. Setup is immediate, middle beats involve him working, and he is present at closure, satisfying two gates. However, swappability is high: another determined restorer could replace Eli with minor edits, and his specific traits beyond motivation do not constrain tactics. Score: Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure cameo +0.4, minus swappability −0.6 and ornamental use −0.8, landing ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>The pull cord handle is mentioned in the opening ("hands clutching"), returns in the middle ("grew warm," "invested in the task"), and is released at closure ("letting it dangle loosely, its purpose fulfilled"; "cool in his hand" in the final line), satisfying all three gates. It is handled physically across three beats and gains symbolic weight (lifeline, reminder). However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress—Eli pulls the cord once and it remains passive thereafter. The closure reprise reweights it thematically but not causally. Score: Setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure reprise +1.0, specificity +0.4, minus ornamental middle use −0.7 and symbolic-only payoff −0.4, landing ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>2.6</grade>
<comment>"Tending to the unspoken" appears as thematic label in the final line but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. Eli's goal is to restore laughter (a spoken, declared aim), and his method—loud leaf blower and sung lullabies—contradicts "unspoken" overtly. The concept is ornamental, invoked for thematic resonance without constraining how Eli works or what he risks. No middle beat turns on this idea. Score: Closure mention +0.3, thematic echo only, minus late label use −0.6 and contradiction with action −0.5, landing ~2.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>3.1</grade>
<comment>"Mournfully eager" is label-applied three times but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Eli's behavior reads as determined and weary; the "mournful eagerness" does not create a visible trade-off (e.g., pushing too hard, missing a cue, or sacrificing rest). Setup occurs in the opening, it is repeated in the middle, and the final "weary smile" may echo it, satisfying two gates loosely. However, the trait is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. Score: Setup +0.5, two mentions +0.4, minus label-only −0.8 and no cost −0.6, landing ~3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>4.7</grade>
<comment>"Macerate" appears once in the middle: "The leaf blower's force began to macerate the stillness, breaking it into fragments." The verb is vivid but metaphorically strained (grinding applied to abstract stillness) and does not drive a major turn—laughter begins to return regardless of this specific action. Easily swappable with "shatter," "dissolve," or "disperse." No setup, no closure callback. Score: One beat +0.4, specificity (unique verb) +0.3, minus late first use −0.4, ornamental −0.6, swappable −0.7, summary-only (effect described, not choice dramatized) −0.5, landing ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Half-sung lullabies on off-key wind are introduced early ("He began with a half-sung lullaby, his voice carried on an off-key wind"), recur in the middle ("lullabies grew louder"), and fade at closure ("Eli's lullabies faded into silence"), satisfying all three gates. The method shapes Eli's attempts—singing plus leaf blower creates the symphony—and its mechanics (off-key, imperfect) matter thematically. However, the wind "carries" the song without clear causal agency, and removing this exact phrasing would not break the story if replaced with "he sang while operating the leaf blower." Score: Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure +0.8, causal enabler +0.8, minus partial swappability −0.5, landing ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The echo chamber tunnel is introduced in the opening line, its walls and echoes recur throughout, and Eli steps out of it at closure, satisfying all three gates. The setting supplies the acoustic environment that amplifies Eli's symphony and its transformation (echoes softening) mirrors his success. However, it does not constrain a choice—Eli could perform this symphony elsewhere—and the spatial details are vague (no dimensions, entries, or obstacles). The tunnel is atmospheric scaffold rather than micro-setting that alters tactics. Score: Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure +0.9, causal pressure (amplifies sound) +0.6, minus swappability (any resonant space) −0.8, landing ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>2.3</grade>
<comment>"After the final grain slips through the hourglass" is mentioned once in the opening and never tracked or referenced again. Time does not tighten decisions—Eli works until the task is complete, with "hours blurred into minutes, or perhaps it was the other way around" explicitly avoiding a live clock. No setup of what the hourglass marks, no middle pressure from time running out, no closure callback. Score: Mention +0.1, vague metaphor without causal work, minus late-only ornamental use −0.6 and no tightening −0.5, landing ~2.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Restoring lost laughter is stated early ("Eli's motivation was clear: to restore lost laughter to a household that had forgotten how to smile"), drives every beat as Eli works toward it, and the ending delivers it ("a soft, tentative laugh"). All three gates satisfied. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—Eli never weighs cost, doubts the mission, or sacrifices something else. No friction between want and obstacle; the task proceeds linearly. Score: Setup +0.7, drives all beats +1.4, closure +1.2, minus told-only motivation −1.0 and no trade-off −0.9, landing ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Haunting tone is established early ("whispering secrets," "mournfully eager," "haunting truth") and sustained through imagery (shadows, echoes, silence) to the closure where warmth emerges but the weary smile and faint laugh preserve an undertone of fragility. Tone modulates from eerie determination to tentative hope without breaking coherence. However, the final image leans toward uplift ("brighter," "lighter," "glimmer of hope") that softens the haunt rather than charging it with cost. Score: Setup +0.7, coherent through turns +1.0, closure modulation +0.9, charges final image partially +0.5, minus static mood in middle −0.3, landing ~6.3.</comment>
