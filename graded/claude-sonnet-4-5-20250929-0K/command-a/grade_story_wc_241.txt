<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear (seeking answers about her father) but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction and label-speak ("clover melancholy," "theoretically rebellious yet deeply pragmatic"). The subway-scrawl method is told rather than dramatized—we never see her actually interpret one in real time with micro-choices that reveal character under pressure. The final realization feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; she simply decides contradictions are guides without visible cost or forfeiture that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly within the opening paragraph. The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure ("lucid contradictions were not obstacles but guides"), but the cost remains abstract—no specific action, relationship, or tactical option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural (memory, scrawls, lantern refraction building to an insight), yet the final reweighting lacks the felt price or cadence shift required for a strong RR under that lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rainwashed library, mica-pane lantern, and midsummer setting are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (damp stone, old books, rain rhythm). The lantern's refracted light charges the final image and the library aisles function as a spatial metaphor for "corridors of possibilities." Micro-setting (candle, glass pane) constrains perception and primes the closure moment, lifting the score into the 7-band despite the lack of a causal choice driven by environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding her father's legacy) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; she walks the aisles, reads scrawls, and arrives at an insight without visible cost or a trade-off that forecloses an alternative path. The story gestures toward internal escalation (her "resolve") but the pressure never crystallizes into a decision with stakes legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (contradictions as guides, gambles vs. certainty) emerges organically from the father's backstory and the scrawls rather than via assertion. The lantern's fragility mirroring complexity is apt, and "bridges we burn to find ourselves" resonates without moralizing. However, the ending offers thematic statement ("lucid contradictions were not obstacles but guides") rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material, keeping it shy of the higher band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; Elara's perceptual signature (focus on patterns, light, fragility) is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sanctuary of quiet contemplation," "clover melancholy") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs, but the prose lacks the rhythmic modulation under pressure that would elevate to 7+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentences are grammatically clean with varied structure and strong imagery ("lantern's light flickering like a heartbeat," "river breaking through a dam"). However, paraphrase loops appear: the lantern's mica pane is described almost identically in three separate beats without new detail or pressure. Template cadence runs ("She stood... She paused... She smiled") and phrase repetition ("theoretically rebellious," "widen perspectives responsibly") accumulate to −0.6, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise (daughter interpreting strangers' scrawls to understand her gambler-professor father) offers a fresh angle, but the execution remains abstract—scrawls are quoted, not actively interpreted with visible method or friction. The library-at-midsummer and mica-lantern details are specific, yet the emotional arc (confusion → resolve) follows a familiar template. The story does not transform its materials through bold risk or non-obvious synthesis that would charge the closure with inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara (daughter of compulsive gambler probability professor) is present throughout and her identity frames the quest, but she makes no key on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her theorizing and resolve are told rather than dramatized through choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The candle lantern with mica pane appears in the opening, mid-scene (refracted patterns on the wall), and the final image (glowing softly as she begins). It is handled and its fragility parallels theme, but it does not constrain a choice or shift tactics—its use remains symbolic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" is quoted from a scrawl, reflected upon, and declared as the lesson in the final paragraph. It shapes theme but does not change Elara's options or tactics on the page; it remains a conceptual echo rather than a narrative engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is asserted twice as a character label but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. It functions as summary rather than dramatized trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Traverse" appears as Elara traverses the library aisles and is mentioned in her goal to "traverse the labyrinth of his life." It is present but remains metaphorical; swapping it for "explore" or "walk" would not alter structure or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Interpreting cryptic subway scrawls is mentioned as Elara's method and two scrawls are quoted, but we never see her interpret one in real time with mechanics or friction. The method is told, not used to shape attempts or choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rainwashed library at midsummer provides sensory anchor (rain, damp stone, book smell) and spatial structure (aisles as metaphor). It appears in opening, middle (window pause), and ending (silence as canvas). The setting charges atmosphere and primes the final image but does not directly constrain a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the heart attack" is stated as context (father bedridden) and frames Elara's urgency, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page—no clock pressure or deadline alters her moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To widen perspectives responsibly" is declared as Elara's goal and repeated as a phrase, but the motivation is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction. It remains a told ambition rather than a pressure that forces trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" is named once and the tone (wistful, reflective, tinged with loss) is sustained throughout via rain imagery, soft lantern light, and Elara's quiet resolve. The tone supports the ending but does not modulate with scene pressure or charge the final image with a felt shift.</comment>
