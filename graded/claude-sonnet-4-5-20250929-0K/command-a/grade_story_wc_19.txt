<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia and yearning are established early, but the character relies heavily on abstract motivations ("collect the flavors of different silences") rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The doll functions more as talisman than as choice driver; Elara's climb is resolved through atmospheric description rather than micro-choices with visible cost. The ending shift ("she would never be the same") is asserted rather than earned through on-page renunciation or altered capability.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal lens (training → inversion → climb → transformation) with clear anchoring by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the doll slips and Elara must retrieve it, but the closure ("tasted true silence, and it had set her free") lacks visible cost—no clear foreclosure or trade-off appears on the page. The inversion event itself functions more as backdrop than pressure that narrows options at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The xenial trellis and bunker are vividly sketched with sensory specificity (thin air, narrow windows, swaying vines). However, the trellis does not constrain a key choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome; Elara's climb proceeds smoothly without environmental friction. Spatial choreography is coherent, but the setting remains postcard-like rather than pressure-exerting, capping the score below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's escape from claustrophobia to experience true silence—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The climb provides one tightening moment (doll slips), but escalation is atmospheric rather than choice-driven; the inversion enables rather than forces a trade-off. The resolution lacks a visible price: Elara returns changed, but no foreclosed path or felt cost appears on the page at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the bunker/sky opposition and the "flavors of silence" motif. The doll's seeming "sprout" during inversion offers a resonant image, and the ending reconfigures silence from oppressive to liberating. However, the final lines drift toward abstract statement ("it had set her free") rather than a non-literal image; the thematic question is answered more through assertion than earned particulars at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance and a perceptual signature rooted in Elara's claustrophobia and longing. Diction is largely character-appropriate, though phrases like "intangibly tangible freedom" and "gilded hush" occasionally drift into elevated register. No dialogue appears; interior voice is clear and purposeful, with acceptable filter verbs ("she imagined," "she knew") that fit the reflective tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across paragraphs, and sentence openings are mostly diverse. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "her chest tightening" / "her heart pounding" recur without new pressure. The closure paragraph stacks abstractions ("pure," "hug," "melting away," "set her free") that dilute concrete imagery. "Tone stretching contracted" (paragraph 4) reads as opaque phrase-craft without clear referent, applying a −0.3 penalty for register drift at a key beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The bunker-builder's-child premise and gravity-inversion hook are specific, but the emotional arc (claustrophobic child escapes to sky) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "collect flavors of silence" motivation is imaginative yet remains abstract; the doll and trellis function symbolically rather than as irreplaceable causal engines. No bold structural risk heightens stakes; the piece executes competently within known patterns.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout and her desire drives the climb, satisfying setup and development. At closure she reaches the trellis and "tastes true silence," but this is reactive experience rather than a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. The middle beat (doll retrieval) involves observation and retrieval without a high-stakes choice. Two gates met; causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The doll is introduced early (setup), handled during training (development), and reappears at the trellis where it slips and is retrieved (payoff). It functions as talisman and symbol; the "sprout" moment charges the image but does not constrain a choice with cost. Three gates met, two distinct beats, closure linkage present, but the element is swappable with another keepsake without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Gilded hush" appears once in paragraph 2 and once in the final paragraph as thematic echo. It labels the bunker's oppressive silence but does not shape an on-page tactic or narrow options. Setup is present; development and payoff are ornamental mentions. The concept could be replaced with "oppressive silence" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible freedom" appears in paragraph 1 as description of Elara's longing. It does not recur or constrain an action; no on-page cost is tied to this trait. The element is ornamental, swappable with "elusive" or "just-out-of-reach" freedom. Only setup gate is met.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sprout" appears twice: Elara's dream to "sprout into the person she was meant to be" (paragraph 2) and the doll seeming to "sprout" during inversion (paragraph 6). Setup and payoff gates met via lyric reprise. The action reweights growth metaphorically but does not drive a key turn; the story would function with "become" or "grow" with minor tonal loss. Early signal and closure linkage lift the score into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Limiting exposure" is explicitly named in paragraph 3 ("driven by the method of limiting exposure") and shapes Elara's training (brief, secret climbs). Setup and development gates met. However, the method does not visibly constrain the inversion climb itself—Elara moves smoothly without exposure-driven friction or cost at closure. Functional but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The trellis is introduced as remote goal (setup), described during the climb (development), and serves as the location for closure (payoff). Its vines are "fragile," "swaying gently," but do not force a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Three gates met; spatial presence at closure; swappable with "sky platform" or "cloud bridge" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The one-hour inversion is predicted (setup), arrives on schedule (development), and ends as Elara completes her journey (payoff). The timeframe creates urgency ("she knew she had to return") and tightens the window, shaping her decision to practice in advance. Three gates met; causal pressure moderate; cost is implicit (limited window) but not dramatized as a live countdown during the climb.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Collect the flavors of different silences" is stated in paragraph 2 (setup), drives her training and climb (development), and is fulfilled at the trellis where she experiences "the flavors of silence" and "a silence so pure" (payoff). Three gates met; the motivation is present across beats but remains abstract and told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Stretching contracted" appears once in paragraph 4 ("her tone stretching contracted") as an opaque descriptor without clear referent or tonal modulation visible elsewhere. The phrase does not recur or shape the story's tonal arc. Only one ornamental mention; setup gate is weakly met; development and payoff gates are absent. The element is forced and swappable.</comment>
