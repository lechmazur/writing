<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's "carefully resourceful" trait exists only as label; we never see her make a trade-off or struggle with limited means. Her decisions (plucking the flower, bargaining with the guardian) arrive without visible cost or internal contradiction. Kael is a prop who delivers urgency then vanishes. The "unheard symphony" that "only she could hear" is asserted twice but never shown to constrain a choice or reveal character under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph, meeting the test. The causal chain breaks: Elara finds the diary instantly, solves its riddles off-page ("she spent hours"), and the chrono-blossom simply unlocks the door without complication. The guardian's "renegotiation" is summarized in one sentence with no on-page cost or stakes; closure is asserted ("deal struck") rather than dramatized. No visible price forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore and mountain setting supply vivid images (moss-covered leather, shifting walls, temporal energy shimmer) but remain decorative. The environment threatens ("books that snapped like jaws") yet Elara bypasses each obstacle off-page via unspecified resourcefulness. The chrono-blossom's clockwork petals are specific, but spatial choreography (how far she moves, where Kael stands) is vague throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—find the library before time collapses—is declared but never tightens on-page. Elara encounters traps, yet "her resourcefulness allowed her to bypass each obstacle" without showing cost or narrowed options. The guardian's demand for renegotiation is resolved in summary ("offering a bargain") with no dramatized trade-off. Coincidence (the diary is exactly where she looks; the flower unlocks the door) drives resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Theme of "unlearned lessons" and knowledge's price is stated but not dramatized. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the weight of unlearned wisdom, a symphony of secrets that only she could hear." No particular choice or image reweights prior material; the ending asserts thematic significance rather than earning it through specifics. The "unheard symphony" recurs as label without functional shift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, focalized through Elara. Register occasionally drifts ("arcane linguist with a reputation for being carefully resourceful" reads like prompt exposition rather than lived perception). Dialogue is minimal; Kael's single line carries urgency but no subtext. Perceptual signature is generic (fingers brushing spines, mind racing) without character-specific bias. "Carefully resourceful nature" is told three times without distinct syntactic embodiment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops: "the library's whispers" / "unheard symphony" / "symphony of secrets" recur without evolving meaning. Template cadence: "She paused… She knew… She spent… She approached… She felt…" runs through the middle third. "The mountain whispered its approval" is a mixed metaphor (mountains don't sigh and whisper approval simultaneously). Stock phrasing: "her mind already racing," "the weight of her discovery." Filter-verb stack in paragraph six ("felt," "knew," "carried") dulls immediacy at a key beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise (magical library hidden in mountain bookstore, time-traveler quest-giver, linguistic puzzles) assembles familiar quest-fantasy elements without transformation. The "unheard symphony" and chrono-blossom offer specific texture, but the plot could run unchanged with generic "ancient map" and "magic key." Elara's linguistic skill is asserted yet we never see her decipher a line of text on-page. No risk-taking or synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and performs actions (finds diary, plucks flower, bargains with guardian), but her linguistic expertise—the defining trait of "arcane linguist"—is never shown deciphering text on-page. Her decisions don't create reversals; obstacles vanish via summary resourcefulness.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears in paragraph two, Elara studies it ("spent hours"), and it guides her to the chrono-blossom. Two beats: discovery and use as puzzle-key. However, we never see her decode a riddle on-page; the work happens off-stage, reducing causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Rescue mission" is mentioned once in the final third ("their rescue mission complete") as a label. The story reads as quest/retrieval, not rescue; no one is in danger requiring extraction. The concept does not shape on-page tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is asserted three times but never shown through trade-offs or constrained choices. Elara bypasses traps via unspecified resourcefulness; no visible cost or scarcity pressures her decisions. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Renegotiate" appears in paragraph three (Elara's task) and paragraph seven (guardian renegotiation), framing two beats. The climactic negotiation is summarized in one sentence without dramatized terms or cost, making it swappable with "bargain" or "persuade."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Researching gaps" is stated as method in paragraph three and enacted in paragraph four ("spent hours poring over the pages… connect seemingly unrelated details"). However, the actual gap-finding is summarized off-page; we don't see her notice a missing piece or test a hypothesis.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying a mountain is established in paragraph one, provides obstacles (shifting walls, snapping books) in paragraph five, and houses the final chamber. Three beats with spatial pressure. The maze resists progress and "sighed in relief" at the end, charging the closure image, though choreography remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After the time traveler arrives" sets the inciting event but does not function as live timeframe. Kael's warning ("time is collapsing") is declared once with no on-page clock or countdown tightening Elara's choices. Time pressure is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To find the library of unlearned lessons" is stated as Elara's mission in paragraph one, drives her navigation through the maze, and is fulfilled in paragraph seven. Present across setup, middle, and payoff. However, motivation is told rather than shown through conflicted choices; no competing desire or fear tests her commitment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" appears in paragraph one ("unheard symphony of the library's whispers") and recurs in the final line ("its unheard symphony echoing in her soul"). A lyric seed-and-reprise pattern, but tone remains static—mystical and lofty throughout—without modulating under pressure or charging the closure with new weight.</comment>
