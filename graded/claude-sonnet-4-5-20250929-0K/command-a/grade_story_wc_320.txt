<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara reads as a cipher for theme rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her interiority is stock ("her heart steady," "strange sense of peace") and her epiphanies arrive unearned—she simply realizes assumptions are wrong without dramatized cost or resistant thought. The moment she "discarded that assumption, too" (paragraph 5) is told summary, not embodied struggle. No micro-choice forecloses a path; she moves frictionlessly through insight to insight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when anchors coalesce only after ~150 words, harming immediate comprehension (−0.4). The closure unit—"she had found herself"—asserts change without visible cost; the shard's power "flows freely" as convenience rather than sacrifice. Linkage is declarative: "she realized her mistake" twice in summary. The piece gestures toward Accumulative design (melody threading towers) but the final image ("reborn, a testament") is abstract thesis rather than a charged particular that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The gorge, towers, and lunar perigee supply vivid images ("skeletal fingers," "shimmer") but remain postcard backdrop. Spatial choreography is vague: Elara stands atop the tallest tower, yet "the city below began to stir" and towers "lean closer" without clear mechanics or distance. The shard's glow affects atmosphere but does not constrain a tactic or alter a choice. The body, console, and moon are present but ornamental—no micro-setting pressure on the ending decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the beginning in every ending"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. Elara's only reversal is recognizing the shard is "a mirror, not a tool," but this realization costs nothing and is rewarded immediately with brighter glow. No live option is foreclosed; the melody falters and returns as convenience. Agency is observation ("she realized") rather than renunciation or trade-off. The resolution is passive: she "let the shard's power flow freely" without visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme is over-articulated: "silence was not the absence of sound but the space where all possibilities began" states the thesis rather than dramatizing it. The shard/hush/silence cluster recurs but as label, not charged image that constrains choice. The final line ("she had found herself") is tidy self-actualization without cost or irony. The piece names its central question ("the beginning in every ending") repeatedly without letting particulars answer it non-literally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third limited, but distance is inconsistent: "It was said to be" (distant legend) sits beside "her heart steady" (close). Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("enigmatic," "grand symphony," "infinite potential") that does not read as Elara's interior lexicon under pressure. No distinct perceptual signature: her noticing is generic ("eerie silver light," "faint melody"). Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") cluster without voice motivation, flattening immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops: paragraphs 2 and 3 restate "discard assumptions" and "silence is not empty" without added pressure (−0.3). Template cadence: "She smiled faintly... She took a deep breath... She twisted a dial..." runs across paragraph 3–4 (−0.5). Stock metaphors: "skeletal fingers," "thread of light," "heart of the universe" are unearned and muddy the final image. The ending stacks thesis statements instead of propelling through concrete action. Information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—mystical artifact tuned during celestial event to unlock cosmic wisdom—is familiar template fantasy without transformation. The "discard assumptions" method and "beginning in every ending" theme are told abstractions rather than specific tactical choices. Elara's profession ("celestial signal interpreter") and the Hollywood star fragment gesture at originality but remain ornamental labels. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; the shard's malfunction and recovery are convenience moves. The city's "rebirth" is asserted grandeur without grounded cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara (celestial signal interpreter) is present throughout but her decisions are told ("she realized," "she discarded") rather than dramatized with cost. She tunes dials in paragraphs 3–4 and "let the shard's power flow" in the final paragraph, but these are summary actions without visible trade-offs. Her role frames the setup but does not create a key turn that narrows options; the shard's behavior drives events more than her choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The Hollywood star fragment (shard of hush) appears in paragraphs 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7. It pulses, glows, dims, and returns brighter, but these changes are effects, not causes—Elara's realizations prompt the changes, not the shard's properties. It is handled across beats but its specific "serenely electric" quality does not constrain a choice. The shard is present at closure ("cradled in her hands") but does not visibly reweight prior material; it simply succeeds.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" is named in paragraph 1 and echoed thematically ("silence was not empty," "space where all possibilities began") but does not shape on-page tactics. The concept is atmospheric metaphor rather than a rule that alters Elara's options. It recurs as theme claim, not as a constraint that forces a trade-off or enables a specific action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" describes the shard's surface in paragraph 1 and is mentioned once more ("serenely electric light") in paragraph 6. It is label-only; the attribute does not enable or constrain an action with visible cost. Swappable with "pulsing" or "glowing" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Tune" appears in paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7. Elara tunes the shard to the moon's frequency and aligns dials, but the mechanics are vague ("guided by intuition") and success arrives without visible cost. The action frames the middle but is not the decisive turn at closure—"let the shard's power flow freely" is the final move, which replaces tuning with release. Functional but replaceable with "activate" or "channel."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"By discarding assumptions" is stated in paragraph 1, enacted in paragraph 3 ("she discarded was that silence was empty") and paragraph 5 ("she discarded that assumption, too"). The method is told rather than dramatized—each discard is announced in summary and rewarded immediately with no friction. It shapes two beats but the mechanics are abstract; we do not see what specific tactic or cost the discarding entails.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "abandoned radio tower city suspended over a gorge" is anchored in paragraph 1 and recurs in paragraphs 4, 6, and 7. The towers "lean closer" and "hum with energy," but these are atmospheric effects, not constraints on Elara's choices. The gorge "shimmer[s]" at the end but does not alter tactics. The setting is vivid but does not pressure the outcome; the console on the tower is the only micro-setting element, and it is handled generically.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"During lunar perigee" is named in paragraphs 1, 4, and 6. The moon's proximity makes the shard hum and Elara aligns the shard to "the lunar perigee's peak," but there is no ticking clock or visible deadline pressure. Time is mentioned but not tracked; we do not know how long the window lasts or what cost delay would impose. It frames the setup but does not tighten tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To find the beginning in every ending" is stated in paragraph 1, echoed in paragraph 4 ("a song of beginnings, of cycles"), paragraph 6 ("the beginning in every ending was not a destination but a process"), and the final line. The motivation is abstract and never dramatized as a want that conflicts with a cost. Elara seeks it and achieves it without friction or trade-off. Present throughout but told-only, not embodied in a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" should blend mystical elements with grounded problem-solving. The piece leans heavily into elevated fantasy ("grand symphony," "infinite potential," "heart of the universe") without practical constraint—Elara's tuning involves dials and intuition but no tool limits, stamina costs, or mechanical trade-offs. Tone remains one-register mystical; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through practical detail.</comment>
