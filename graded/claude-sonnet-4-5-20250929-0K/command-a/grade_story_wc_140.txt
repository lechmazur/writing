<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The wanderer's interior reads as abstract template rather than embodied experience: "filtered reality differently, seeing patterns where others saw chaos" is told-only without specific sensory demonstration. Motivation ("discover the texture of memories") remains a label throughout; no on-page micro-choice reveals competing impulses or cost. The letter moment ("their own nameless identity echoing in the boy's desperation") gestures toward internal conflict but stays at summary level. The final stance crystallization lacks visible trade-off—continuation of the quest feels inevitable rather than chosen against something.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early, but "weeks ago" and the tidal rhythm create temporal vagueness that persists past 120 words without paying off at closure (−0.3). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments layer toward a thematic realization. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the insight "the texture of memories was not just in the fragments they collected but in the act of remembering itself," but this reweighting is asserted rather than demonstrated through a visible cost or altered tactic on the page. The container discovery (archive of erased histories) introduces new information but doesn't narrow options or force a sacrifice; the wanderer simply continues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (rusted frames, salt-laden air, mudflats revealing relics). The environment supplies the poison-bottle label and the archive container, shaping two beats. However, spatial choreography within the maze remains abstract—no use of proximity, access restriction, or navigational cost that alters a choice. The tidal rhythm is atmospheric but doesn't constrain a decision at closure. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) doesn't charge the final image beyond symbolic mention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("uncover erased histories") is signaled early. One meaningful turn occurs when the wanderer finds the archive container and realizes it's a repository, not random collection—but this discovery doesn't narrow options or force a trade-off; they pocket the letter and continue as before. The label "for the forgotten" reappears as thematic commentary ("a warning—a reminder of how easily lives could be poisoned by neglect") without altering tactics. No visible price paid; the wanderer's quest simply deepens in stated purpose. Under Accumulative lens, escalation requires a density shift or cadence break that reweights the stake—here the shift is told rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (erasure, reclaiming the forgotten) is overt and repeatedly stated: "a voice for the silenced," "guardian of the forgotten," "humanity stripped from those deemed insignificant." The poison-label's shift from clue to warning is explained rather than emerging from image. The final paragraph's "the texture of memories was not just in the fragments they collected but in the act of remembering itself" articulates the thesis directly, replacing scene pressure with thematic summary (−0.6). No counter-reading or ambiguity; the piece instructs rather than invites.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("their breath mingling with the salt-laden air," "a symphony of lives intertwined"), fitting a textural/accumulative design. However, perceptual signature is generic: the wanderer notices via stock poetic phrasing rather than character-specific bias. Elision of the wanderer's backstory (how they became a death-certificate error survivor, what memories they've lost) is purposeful but never dramatized as a cost affecting present action. Voice modulates little under the container discovery's ostensible pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence across adjacent lines: "They were a death certificate error survivor... their existence a glitch in the system. This nameless wanderer filtered reality differently..." (scaffold restating identity); "Each fragment was a thread, woven into a tapestry... Each object was a piece of someone's story" (synonym churn across paragraphs). Stock metaphor strings in peak beats ("a symphony of lives intertwined," "texture of memories") without fresh vehicle (−0.8 cumulative in Q7). Filter-verb stack in paragraph six: "they realized," "they understood" across two sentences. Pronoun "they" overused without sentence-level variation. Information density is low; many lines do one job only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise (death-certificate survivor as archivist of the forgotten in a container labyrinth) is recognizable from literary-fiction templates combining bureaucratic erasure with scavenger-protagonist motifs. The tidal rhythm, poison-bottle label, and "texture of memories" phrase feel assembled rather than inevitably synthesized. The letter from Elara's son provides a human anchor but arrives late and is summarized rather than quoted or used to alter the wanderer's method. Emotional specificity is sacrificed for atmosphere. Transformation test: plot and arc work unchanged with a different marginalized collector in a different discarded-object setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The death-certificate error survivor attribute is present from the opening and frames the wanderer's outsider status. However, it functions as backstory label only; no on-page choice traces causally to this specific legal/bureaucratic predicament. The wanderer observes and collects but makes no decision that would break if they were simply a voluntary hermit or anonymous drifter. The identity "echoes" in the boy's letter (told connection, not dramatized), but this recognition doesn't alter tactics or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The poison-bottle label appears in paragraph two (early setup), is described with faded ink and message "For the forgotten," and returns in paragraph six as thematic commentary ("a warning—a reminder of how easily lives could be poisoned by neglect"). Two touches across the story, but both are reflective rather than action-driving. The label doesn't constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it's a symbolic tether. Swappable with any cryptic artifact. No closure participation beyond carried symbolism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Erased histories shape the dominant stake from the opening and are concretized in the archive container discovery (middle beat). The wanderer's goal is explicitly to "piece together the fragments of lives others had discarded" and the container's rows of crates cataloging vanished people provide on-page evidence. The concept narrows the wanderer's method (collecting fragments, layering discoveries) and reweights at closure via the insight about remembering. However, the concept doesn't impose a visible cost or force a trade-off; it remains thematic driver rather than tactical constraint. Present in setup, development, and ending; causal role in one major beat (archive discovery).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently, seeing patterns where others saw chaos, hearing echoes where others heard silence" is introduced early but remains a told-only label. No on-page demonstration of this perceptual difference altering a choice or imposing a trade-off. The wanderer's actions (moving through the labyrinth, collecting objects, reading a letter) could be performed by any attentive observer. The attribute is ornamental, a claim without embodied cost or mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Layering is the story's structural method: the wanderer layers understanding by collecting fragments (paragraph two), layers discoveries in a hidden alcove (paragraph three), and the ending describes "whispers of the past layered with the sounds of the present." The action appears in setup, middle, and closure. However, it's more narrative description than plot-driving choice. Major turns (finding the label, discovering the archive, pocketing the letter) don't depend on layering as a unique tactic; near-synonyms like "gathering," "compiling," or "accumulating" would fit with minor edits. The action supports the Accumulative lens but doesn't constrain options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories is signaled in paragraph two ("a dockworker's lament, a smuggler's boast, a child's lullaby") and mentioned again as part of the layering process. However, these fragments never return or shape a later beat; the story pivots to physical objects (relics in mudflats, the archive container, the letter). The method's mechanics (how overhearing informs the quest) are not demonstrated. Present in setup, absent from development and closure. Swappable with any collection method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is established in the opening line and provides the archive container (middle beat) and the hidden alcove sanctuary. The setting is vividly described and supplies key objects. However, the maze's properties (rusted frames, shadows, proximity to water) don't constrain movement or force a navigational choice with cost. The wanderer moves "silently" through it without obstacle. Spatial pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical. Present in setup, development, and ending, but postcard-level integration in terms of altering protagonist options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Tides are introduced in paragraph one ("rhythmic crash of tides") and detailed in paragraph three: high tide brings water closer and murmurs, low tide reveals mudflats and relics. This rhythm organizes the wanderer's scavenging method. However, no on-page scene is time-pressured by the tide cycle; the wanderer pauses and reflects without urgency. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than a live clock narrowing decisions. Present in setup and middle description, absent from closure. Functional but replaceable with any cyclical environmental pattern.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to discover the texture of memories" is stated in paragraph one and restated at closure ("the texture of memories was not just in the fragments they collected but in the act of remembering itself"). However, this desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or visible cost. The wanderer never faces friction between this want and another need (safety, resources, time). The letter moment offers potential internal conflict ("their own nameless identity echoing in the boy's desperation") but this is summary, not enacted trade-off. Motivation frames the quest but doesn't create on-page tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Nameless identity is woven throughout: "nameless wanderer" (paragraph one), "their own nameless identity" (paragraph five), "nameless but not invisible" (final paragraph). Tone of erasure and liminality is coherent and modulates from detached observation (opening) to emotional recognition (letter beat) to quiet resolve (ending). The tone charges the final image's refusal of invisibility. However, a single static mood (melancholic guardianship) dominates; no tonal shift under pressure when the archive is discovered. Present in setup and ending with thematic reprise, but static in middle development.</comment>
