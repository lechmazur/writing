<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to help the ghost is asserted but not dramatized through conflicting impulses or meaningful internal friction. The kinship she feels ("for she too had often felt like a ghost") is told rather than shown through contradictory choices under pressure. Her actions follow a smooth, unobstructed path from discovery to resolution with no visible cost or foreclosed option. The ending grants her completion without any embodied price or renunciation that would demonstrate character change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story establishes who and where by the opening, satisfying orientation. However, closure arrives as a convenience: the ghost simply dissolves "with a soft smile" after Elara completes her encoding, offering no visible cost or decisive change in her situation. The final paragraph's promise of "other ghosts" resets stakes rather than reconfiguring them. Under a Causal lens (the dominant reading given the because/therefore setup), the resolution lacks the earned constraint or price required for Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The misty courtyard and storm imagery provide atmospheric grounding, and the flower press bolt plate is handled twice (found, then used). However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain Elara's choices—she works unimpeded in the courtyard, and the storm functions as ambient décor rather than tactical pressure. The bolt plate's function is asserted ("it was a key") but its mechanics remain vague, reducing specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the ghost—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Elara encounters no obstacle, cost, or reversal; her encoding simply works as intended. The "timeframe was crucial: between lightning and thunder" is declared but never dramatized as a constraint that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The resolution grants both protagonist and ghost what they want without visible price, undercutting escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of giving voice to the voiceless emerges through Elara's work with the ghost and her self-identification as "seldom heard." The final image—the ghost dissolving and Elara composing her next ballad—offers a lyric answer to the central question. However, the lack of on-page cost or complication reduces thematic weight; the story tells us the power of her gift rather than dramatizing its friction or price.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elara's perceptual signature ("driftingly alert") anchors the voice. Diction is elevated and consistent ("luminous figure, both ethereal and solid"). However, several lines tip into over-written register: "tinkersong wonder," "stardust on the wind," and "a tapestry of symbols and sigils" feel decorative rather than voice-specific. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") appear at key moments, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear but carries ornamental density without corresponding pressure. Phrases like "a song for the unseen, the unheard, and the yet to be" and "its essence scattered like stardust on the wind" layer figurative language in the final beats without adding causal information. Minor template cadence: "It was a phantom… It was an odd relic…" opens consecutive expository blocks. No major loops or artifacts touch closure, capping deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The ghost-in-code premise combined with a cryptographer-balladeer offers a fresh synthesis, and the flower press bolt plate is an unusual object choice. However, the execution follows a comfort-zone arc: protagonist discovers problem, acquires tool, solves problem without friction. The turn—bolt plate as conduit—arrives without groundwork in earlier choice or cost. Emotional beats (gratitude, connection, dissolution) follow predictable templates rather than offering a non-obvious inflection.</comment>
