<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's shift from methodical restoration to intuitive "conducting" is present but undermotivated—her hesitation is noted, then dissolved by a warm coin pulse rather than dramatized internal conflict. The obsidian-eyed woman's instruction arrives as external permission rather than emerging from Elara's own contradictory impulses. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority reads as declarative summary ("her heart raced, her mind a whirlwind") rather than sensory particulars under pressure. The final change lacks visible cost: certainty is exchanged for curiosity via declaration, not forfeiture of a concrete option or relationship.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly by the second paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: coin discovery → mural brightening → figures emerge → exchange offered → humming transformation. However, the closure hinges on an instructed epiphany rather than protagonist-driven reversal; Elara's choice to hum is prompted externally, weakening agency at the decisive moment. Cost is asserted ("by exchanging it for curiosity, she had unlocked something far greater") but the on-page price—what concrete path or belief she foreclosed—remains abstract. One meaningful tightening is present (the offer to "exchange certainty for curiosity"), but it arrives via dialogue rather than situational pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and metallic flowers provide vivid, memorable anchors. The hobo nickel's etched surface and the obsidian eyes are sharply rendered. The garden's resonant hum subtly enables the mural's awakening, meeting the micro-setting test: the environment participates in the transformation. However, spatial choreography blurs when translucent figures "step out" and "interact"—specific blocking (distance, movement paths) is missing. The final image relies on abstract "stories" and "tapestry" rather than concrete sensory payoff from the now-awake garden.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—awakening the garden/restoring the mural—is signaled early and narrows once (the exchange offer). Escalation is visible: static mural → subtle stirring → figures emerge → Elara must choose a new method. Yet the climactic turn is externally guided ("Let the garden guide you") rather than arising from Elara's contradiction or prior failure, diluting protagonist agency. The cost of exchanging certainty is declared but not dramatized as a tangible forfeiture—no prior attachment to method or outcome is shown fracturing under pressure. One tightening is sufficient for this length, but the price remains conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme (certainty as cage, curiosity as key) emerges through action rather than overt moralizing, a strength. The hobo nickel and mural recur with shifted meaning, and the garden's "nested awakenings" concept threads through the closure. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement: "by exchanging it for curiosity, she had unlocked something far greater" reads as articulated wisdom rather than dramatized revelation. The central question is answered, but the answer is told rather than shown through a resonant image that reweights prior material without explication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV narration remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on color, vibration, and movement, fitting a restorer's professional lens. Dialogue from the coin-figure and obsidian-eyed woman carries subtext ("what if the lost seeks to restore you?") and distinct idiom (harmonics-inflected phrasing). However, interiority occasionally slips into generic intensity markers ("her breath catching," "heart raced") without character-specific texture. The prose modulates appropriately from methodical opening to lyric climax ("conducting, as if she were shaping the air itself"), maintaining voice coherence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language (winking coin, polished obsidian eyes) is vivid and controlled. Clarity is high, and information density is good—most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "not ghosts but echoes" / "not painting but conducting" uses parallel negation twice in quick succession, and "transformed… exploding into life" then "stepped out… fully realized" restates the awakening across adjacent beats. Stock metaphors ("whirlwind of confusion," "cage") slightly weaken peak moments. No severe artifacts, but density could tighten by ~5%.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The sound wave garden with metallic flowers and the nested-awakening concept offer fresh synthesis. The hobo nickel as animate guide avoids pure ornament, and the restorer protagonist grounds fantasy in craft. However, the "exchange certainty for curiosity" arc follows a recognizable template (rigidity → openness via mystical encounter), and the instructional voice ("restore it not with your hands, but with your heart") edges toward familiar wisdom-giver tropes. Emotional specificity (the restorer's particular attachment to method) is underdeveloped, so the transformation feels more conceptual than inevitable. Risk-taking in the lyric climax elevates slightly within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Present early (kneeling restorer, paragraph 1). Shapes two beats: restoration attempt (paragraph 2) and the humming climax (paragraph 5–6). However, key turns are externally prompted—the obsidian woman instructs, the coin urges—rather than arising from Elara's internal contradiction. Her "methodically playful" trait and craft focus seed expectation but do not constrain the final choice in a visible trade-off. Functional but agency is diluted at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 1), returns with glow (paragraph 2), pulses warmly (paragraph 4), intensifies and steps out (paragraph 6). Three distinct beats. However, its properties shift conveniently (etched figure becomes animate being) without established cost or limitation. The coin enables rather than constrains, and its mechanics are not rigorously grounded. Strong recurrence and closure participation, but swappable with any mystical token. Mid-6s for beat count and reprise; capped below 7.0 for limited causal friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Labeled once (paragraph 3: "nested awakenings") and echoed in the final image ("garden is awake, and so are you"). Does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options; it functions as thematic gloss rather than mechanical constraint. The concept could be replaced with "layered transformations" or similar abstraction without altering events. Present but ornamental; scores in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mentioned in paragraph 1 ("methodically playful… tools laid out in precise rows, yet… fluid, almost dance-like"). The trait is described but never dramatically tested—no moment where method clashes with intuition in a choice with visible cost. At the climax Elara abandons tools for humming, but the playful side does not enable or complicate that shift on the page. Label-only use; functional description but no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The garden's sound waves "bewitch" implicitly (harmonize, awaken the mural, guide Elara's humming). Present across three beats: initial hum (paragraph 2), harmonizing during restoration (paragraph 2), and Elara's climactic humming (paragraph 5). However, "bewitch" as a term never appears on the page, and the mechanism is soft: the garden "guides" rather than imposing a cost or friction. The action shapes the transformation but could be reframed as "resonate" or "enchant" with minor edits. One clear turn (humming unlocks the mural), earning mid-5s for causal presence without high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Sound waves are foregrounded throughout (metallic flowers hum, garden harmonizes, Elara hums along). "Reflected sound" as a specific method is gestured at in the coin-figure's line ("voice a whisper carried through reflected sound") but not mechanically dramatized—no on-page demonstration of how reflection (vs. direct sound) matters to the outcome. The general method (sound) is integral; the specified twist (reflected) is ornamental. Functional sound-based magic, but the reflection detail is not load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Introduced in the opening line and present in every major beat. The garden's sound waves enable the mural's awakening (paragraph 2), the figures emerge from it (paragraph 3), and the climax requires Elara to harmonize with it (paragraph 5). The metallic flowers and resonant hum are specific, recurring details that constrain Elara's method (she must attune to the garden's frequency, not impose her own). Closure directly involves the setting ("garden is awake"). Strong setup, beat involvement, and closure linkage; scores in the essential range. Spatial choreography slip (translucent figures' exact positions) prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The phrase appears once (paragraph 2: "the garden itself seemed to hold its breath in the pause between question and reply") as lyric description, not a functional constraint. No on-page clock, no tactical pressure tied to brevity, no live ticking that alters Elara's choices. The timeframe is metaphorical rather than mechanical. Present as image but ornamental; does not shape escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Seeded early (paragraph 1: "methodically playful" implies tension; her tools vs. fluid movement). Crystallized in the exchange offer (paragraph 4) and dramatized in Elara's hesitation then choice to hum (paragraph 5). The motivation drives the climactic turn and is named in the ending reflection. However, Elara's attachment to certainty is asserted rather than shown fracturing under prior pressure—no scene where method fails her before the offer. Two beats (hesitation, choice) and closure presence, but the friction is lightly embodied. Mid-6s for involvement with modest causal cost.</comment>
