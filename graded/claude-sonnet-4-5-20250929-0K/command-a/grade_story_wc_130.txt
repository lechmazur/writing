<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is established but remains abstract—"understanding the mathematics of emotion" never translates into concrete contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her discovery of the journal triggers no visible internal conflict; she moves from caution to "renewed determination" without dramatized cost. The final breakthrough ("not about control but about harmony") reads as an unearned epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart raced," "mind racing") without embodied specificity under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative design layered in; the glass eyes → mosaic patterns → hidden journal sequence provides because/therefore linkage. However, closure lacks on-page cost: Elara's "final breakthrough" is told rather than shown, and the orchard glowing "brighter" offers visual assertion without a visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The mentor's warning of danger is set up but never pressures her final choice. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph, avoiding penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cavern orchard with dripping stalactites is vividly established and returns at closure when "the orchard seemed to glow brighter." The mosaic stepping stones constrain Elara's investigative tactics (she must decode patterns to locate the tree). Sensory detail is present (faint light, warmth of the unmarked stone) but remains largely visual; micro-setting (the glass eyes as lens, the hidden compartment) functionally charges the investigation. Spatial choreography is clean across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding ambiguous loss and her mentor's fate—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers the mentor's warning, raising the cost of proceeding. However, that danger never materializes on the page; her "final breakthrough" arrives without visible trade-off or a choice that narrows options. The resolution is declared ("balance that could heal") rather than earned through a decision under pressure. Agency is present in her decoding work but does not foreclose a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (ambiguous loss, emotion as pattern) emerges from the orchard's otherworldly fruit and the mentor's disappearance. The glass eyes function as a purposeful motif, shifting from tool to symbol of peril. However, the ending moralizes the theme directly: "not about control but about harmony" is a thesis statement rather than a resonant image. The final paragraph's "promise of understanding" tells rather than reweights prior material through scene pressure. Subtext operates in the mosaic code and mentor's journal, but the closure abandons implication for assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in Elara's focus on patterns and magic, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("dovetailed into a theory," "fabric of emotion itself") that feels more authorial than character-specific. Psychic distance remains consistent. The mentor's journal entries provide a brief shift in voice, clearly marked. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "realized") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful momentum through the investigation sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "her mind racing with possibilities" / "her thoughts dovetailed into a theory" restate mental engagement without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the decoding sequence ("She sketched... then compared... To her astonishment"). The phrase "dovetail" recurs as both thought process and literal action, muddying its specificity. Stock metaphors ("heart raced," "calling to her") appear in peak beats without fresh embodiment. No clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cavern orchard and "mathematics of emotion" premise offer fresh surface detail, but the core arc—investigator decodes mentor's legacy and overcomes danger through insight—follows a familiar template. The taxidermist's glass eyes as magical tool and the mosaic code provide specific texture, yet the emotional progression (caution → determination → breakthrough) is linear and predictable. The mentor's warning of danger is set up but never transforms tactics or stakes. Transformation test: the plot and arc would function unchanged with different names and objects.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara (secretive conjurer) is present throughout and her choices (pocketing the eyes, decoding the mosaic, using the eyes as a lens) create multiple turns. However, her "secretive" trait is mentioned only in the opening and does not constrain or enable later choices; "conjurer" functions as a synonym for "magic user" without specificity. Her final breakthrough is told rather than shown as a decision that alters tactics. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is summary-only. Introduced early +0.7, two distinct beats +0.9, causal pressure moderate +0.8, closure linkage weak (summary-only) +0.2, swappability moderate −0.5, label-only "secretive" −0.3. Base 3.0 + 1.8 = 4.8, round down to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glass eye pair is discovered early, used as a magical lens in the workshop, and reappears in the final paragraph on her workbench. The eyes drive two key beats (revealing mosaic shadows, unlocking the hidden compartment) and are framed as "remnants of his experiments" with symbolic weight (peril of tampering). However, their presence in the final image is passive ("glowing softly") rather than reweighted. Introduced early +0.7, three distinct beats +1.4, causal pressure strong +1.2, closure linkage moderate +0.5, specificity high +0.6, cost connection moderate +0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.8 = 7.8, ornamental final mention −0.3, cameo in ending −0.2. 7.3, round down to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Ambiguous loss (the mentor's disappearance) frames the investigation and is named explicitly multiple times. It shapes Elara's motivation and provides thematic resonance, but does not constrain on-page choices with visible cost—her pursuit continues without trade-offs or conflicting impulses tied to the concept. The resolution declares she has found "balance that could heal the wounds of ambiguous loss" without dramatizing how the concept altered tactics. Setup clear +0.6, one beat (journal discovery) +0.4, causal pressure weak (theme-only) +0.3, closure linkage (thematic assertion) +0.3, swappability high (could be any mysterious loss) −0.6, summary-only payoff −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.6 – 1.1 = 3.5, concept echoed but not dramatized remains mid-band 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Gently inventive" is applied to her magic once in the opening ("gently inventive ideas that had always defined her magic") but does not constrain or enable any on-page action. Her investigation is methodical rather than inventive; the mosaic decoding follows logical steps without creative friction or cost. The attribute is label-only and swappable with "curious" or "persistent" without structural change. Setup (label) +0.3, no beat involvement 0.0, no causal pressure 0.0, no closure linkage 0.0, label-only −0.3, swappability high −0.6. Base 3.0 + 0.3 – 0.9 = 2.4, thematic echo without action raises to 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Dovetail" appears twice: once as Elara's thoughts "dovetailed into a theory" and again when she "began to dovetail her mentor's research with her own." Both instances describe synthesis but do not create major turns—the theory is immediately tested, and the research combination is summarized rather than dramatized. The action is present and functionally relevant but easily swappable with "merge" or "integrate." Setup (first use mid-story) −0.3, two beats +0.9, moderate causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage weak (research work is told) +0.2, swappability high −0.7. Base 3.0 + 1.2 – 1.0 = 3.2, functional presence in two beats with moderate pressure raises to 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The chipped mosaic stepping stone is introduced early near the orchard entrance, dismissed as decoration, then reweighted when the glass eyes' shadows align with its patterns to reveal a code. A second unmarked mosaic at the tree's base unlocks the hidden compartment. The method is signaled, drives two beats, and directly enables the climax. Introduced early +0.7, two distinct beats +0.9, strong causal pressure (enables discovery) +1.3, closure linkage (leads to journal) +0.9, specificity moderate +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3, second mosaic introduction mid-story (slight late element) −0.2, ornamental first mention (dismissed) −0.3. 6.8, functional mechanics across beats hold at 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is established early and returns at closure ("the orchard seemed to glow brighter"). Dripping stalactites nourish the trees but do not constrain choices—Elara works in the workshop, not the cavern itself. The setting provides atmosphere and frames the investigation spatially, but does not supply resources or pressure that alter tactics. Introduced early +0.8, present at closure +0.9, weak causal pressure (spatial frame only) +0.3, closure linkage (final image) +0.7, postcard description in places −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.7 – 0.6 = 5.1, atmospheric charge at ending raises to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the orchard grows silent beneath the moon" anchors the opening scene, and several nights pass during decoding work. However, time does not tighten decisions—there is no urgency or clock pressure. "One moonlit night" marks the breakthrough but the pacing is leisurely. Time is tracked loosely but does not constrain tactics. Setup (opening anchor) +0.5, no beat involvement 0.0, no causal pressure 0.0, weak closure linkage (moonlit night mentioned) +0.2, vague tracking −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.7 – 0.5 = 3.2, atmospheric mention without pressure caps at 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To understand the mathematics of emotion" motivates Elara's project and frames her investigation. The journal reveals her mentor pursued the same goal, creating thematic doubling. However, the motivation is told repeatedly without dramatized friction—no scene shows her desire conflicting with other wants or costs. The final breakthrough declares understanding achieved but does not show her wrestling with competing impulses. Setup early +0.7, one beat (journal confirmation) +0.4, weak causal pressure (drives investigation) +0.5, closure linkage (breakthrough asserted) +0.4, told-only motivation −0.8, no friction between wants −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.0 – 1.3 = 3.7, thematic presence across arc raises to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Buried optimism" is named once ("she felt a buried optimism") and surfaces at closure when the orchard glows "with the promise of understanding." Tone modulates from mystery to determination to hopeful resolution, coherent across beats. However, the optimism is declared rather than embodied in contradictory choices or pressured restraint. The final image asserts promise without tension. Setup (mid-story label) +0.4, closure linkage (final image) +0.9, tone coherence moderate +0.6, single static mood in ending −0.4, label-only assertion −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.9 – 0.8 = 4.1, tonal charge at ending raises to 4.7.</comment>
