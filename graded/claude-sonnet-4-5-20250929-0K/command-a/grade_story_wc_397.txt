<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's core motivation—witnessing endings—is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The conversation with the man about "the sound of it coming" offers a reflective beat, but her internal conflict remains abstract rather than embodied. The parasol functions as a symbolic anchor rather than a choice-shaping object. The final "weight lift" and "grip tightening" read as asserted resolution without prior on-page struggle that would make renunciation or acceptance feel earned with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the marina setting and survivor stories layer atmosphere and thematic echoes toward a final reweighting. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's realization that "the sound of approaching endings...was a reminder to live"—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page. No causal tightening or tactical narrowing occurs; the ending delivers thematic summary instead of image-driven repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with sensory specifics: "jagged shards," "broken teeth," "creaking piers," northern lights. Spatial choreography remains clear across dock, shelter, and return to dock. The parasol appears in multiple beats but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image beyond symbolic presence. The setting pressures atmosphere more than tactics; survivors and the ice whisper thematically but do not alter Elara's options in a legible way.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's quest to understand endings—is signaled early but never tightened or tested by reversal. She arrives, listens, reflects, and departs with affirmed insight; no on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path. The man's question momentarily raises pressure, but Elara's answer is philosophical rather than costly. Coincidence (the ice storm, Mara's appearance) complicates setting but does not force agency or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—impermanence, beauty in fleeting moments—emerges through ice imagery and the parasol motif. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "a reminder to live, to feel, to cherish the beauty in the fleeting," replacing scene pressure with stated thesis. Mara's line "You've found what you were looking for" functions as thematic echo rather than earned discovery. The parasol's lace tip recurs but does not reweight prior material with new meaning; it remains a static symbol.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and literary: "fold in patience," "windborne solace," "gripping reality loosely." Dialogue between Elara and the man carries subtext about mortality, and Mara's closing line feels purposeful. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("testament to resilience," "eerie glow of the northern lights") that flattens urgency. Internal voice is consistent but leans toward reflective summary over embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically varied with strong imagery: "broken teeth," "skeletons in a graveyard," "ice seemed to pulse." However, thematic phrases recur without functional pressure: "fold in patience" appears twice, "windborne solace" twice, "gripping reality loosely" twice, "sound of approaching endings" three times. The final paragraph loops concepts already stated, reducing information density. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks, but the closure beat summarizes rather than propelling through image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Euthanasia tourist" as framing premise is fresh, but the execution defaults to a familiar volunteer-finds-meaning arc without transformation. The parasol and drift-ice marina offer atmospheric specificity, yet the emotional trajectory—arrival, observation, epiphany, departure—follows a predictable template. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis; the piece prioritizes tone over ingenuity. Removing Elara's name and the marina, the arc remains generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as "euthanasia tourist" is stated, but her choices do not create key turns. She observes, listens, and reflects; the pivot to understanding occurs internally without a dramatized decision that alters tactics or forecloses options. Her presence is functional but largely passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The parasol appears in four beats: carried in the bag (paragraph 1), held while walking (paragraph 2), mentioned in thought (paragraph 4), held aloft under northern lights (paragraph 6). It returns with symbolic reweighting in the final image ("her hand brushing the lace tip"), but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The object is purposefully recurring but ornamental in causal terms.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Fold in patience" appears twice as atmospheric phrase: once describing the marina, once describing survivors' resilience. It never shapes stakes or alters options on the page; it functions as thematic echo rather than operative concept. Swappable with other metaphors for endurance without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is stated in paragraph 1 and inverted in the final line ("her grip on reality tightening"). It colors Elara's mindset but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. The trait is label-only, never dramatized through perception or choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Trawl" appears once in paragraph 1 as backstory method ("trawled through disaster relief volunteering"). It does not drive an on-page turn or redefine options; the marina visit could proceed identically without the verb. Easily swappable with "worked in" or "pursued."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is signaled in paragraph 1 and enacted in paragraph 3 (shelter, listening to survivors). It enables the scene but its mechanics are generic: sitting, listening, offering comfort. The method does not shape a middle choice or return with charged meaning at closure. Functional setup without beat involvement or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina anchors all action and provides vivid sensory detail across multiple beats: dock, fog, shelter, northern lights. It supplies atmosphere and frames the quest thematically (ice as impermanence). However, it does not pressure a choice or alter tactics; Elara's journey would function similarly in any disaster zone. The setting is essential to tone and present in closure but does not constrain options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" is mentioned in paragraph 1 as backstory framing but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The timeframe is vague (how long since waking? how long at the marina?), and no clock pressures tactics. The opening phrase sets mood but does not shape the arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation—"to learn the sound of approaching endings"—is stated early and recurs in dialogue and thought. It drives Elara's presence at the marina and her conversation with the man. However, it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or trade-off; she articulates her quest but does not face friction between wanting to understand endings and any competing cost. The motivation is present and functional but not tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" appears twice (paragraph 2, paragraph 6) and the tone—contemplative, elegiac, lyrically somber—is coherent across beats. The prose modulates between harsh imagery (broken teeth, frozen debris) and soft resolution (lullaby, promise of peace). The final image attempts to charge the tone, but the shift to "peace in the midst of uncertainty" is asserted rather than earned through pressure. Tone is consistent and purposeful but does not tighten under escalation.</comment>
