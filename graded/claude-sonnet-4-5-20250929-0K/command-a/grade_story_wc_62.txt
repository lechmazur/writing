<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "discover the shape of collective grief" remains abstract; her journey is contemplative but lacks on-page internal contradiction or meaningful resistance. The mentor's spectral guidance operates as backdrop wisdom rather than a force creating genuine friction. The final realization—"not something to be solved but something to be carried"—reads as unearned epiphany, delivered through reflection rather than dramatized struggle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images (butterflies, ribbon, greenhouse) and arrives at a quiet realization, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara simply "feels Tomas's presence fade" and walks away "lighter." The ribbon-as-migration insight appears suddenly without prior groundwork that would make it inevitable. Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene window holds, but the ending reconfigures meaning through assertion rather than image-charged pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly rendered ("glass panes humming with the weight of centuries") and the butterflies provide atmospheric texture, but the setting remains postcard rather than tactical. The workbench, chisel, and marble are mentioned but do not constrain Elara's choices or evolve causally. The final image of the greenhouse "reflecting the stars" is decorative rather than meaningfully charged by prior action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding collective grief—is signaled early but never faces a concrete test or tightening. Elara's work proceeds without setback, and the "renewed purpose" arrives via internal epiphany rather than pressure. The ribbon insight is a cognitive leap, not a choice that forecloses options or costs her something on the page. No reversal narrows her path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ribbon-migration metaphor and Tomas's teaching, and the piece resists tidy moralizing in favor of "not something to be solved but something to be carried." However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("honor not just the dead but the living") and the ribbon pattern is introduced late as a symbolic convenience. The migration conceit is fresh but not fully earned by prior scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly and the narrative voice is controlled, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fiercely meditative presence," "thundering calm") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Elara's perceptual signature is more generic literary than carved by her gravestone-carving trade. No dialogue to assess. The prose remains legible but lacks a distinct textural identity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple template cadences and paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "to the stone, to the stories it held, and to the silence between words" and "their stories, and the thundering calm" read as syntactic filler. "Thundering calm" and "spectral mentorship" are oxymoronic phrases repeated without payoff. The final paragraph stacks abstract summaries ("her heart lighter, her purpose clearer") instead of trusting the image. Figurative density ("flight of the butterflies," "migration of memory") in reflective beats blurs propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The gravestone-carver premise and spectral mentor are familiar tropes executed competently but without fresh inflection. The ribbon-as-migration metaphor arrives suddenly rather than being seeded and transformed. The greenhouse-at-dusk setting and butterfly migration feel selected for atmospheric effect rather than integrated causally. The piece plays it safe, avoiding bold structural or emotional risks.</comment>
