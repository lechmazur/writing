<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is declared but never embodied through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle—she moves through beats without internal friction or visible cost to her choices. The "orderly intuitive mind" remains a label rather than a trait that constrains action. Vorin is a one-dimensional obstacle whose dismissal ("Progress is coming, whether you like it or not") reads like placeholder antagonism. The festival resolution arrives without Lira foreclosing any live option or paying a dramatized price on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story presents a Causal lens but the closure unit lacks on-page cost: Lira places the stone, the festival becomes "a rallying cry," and the community's resolve is "sealed" through summary rather than a decisive action or renunciation that forecloses a path. The Cost Proof Test fails—no sentence in the ending beat makes a felt price legible. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph, so no penalty applies there, but the climax is told rather than dramatized, and the final paragraph ("their fight was far from over… something brighter") offers aspirational summary instead of a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The raft city, Cerulean Sea, and "perpetual carnival" are vividly named but remain postcard backdrops—no piece of the setting constrains a choice or charges the final image. The foundation stone chip is handled twice (discovery, placement) but its physical properties never alter Lira's tactics. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment does not pressure decisions, so the micro-setting test for 9+ fails and the score stays mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving Luminara's identity against gentrification) is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or dilemma that Lira must navigate with visible cost. Vorin's opposition is declared, not dramatized in a beat that forces Lira to adapt tactics. The festival "rallying cry" is a summary payoff for a conflict the text never put on the page as a reversible choice. No on-page price is paid; the ending asserts success without foreclosing a path or showing what Lira sacrificed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of community resilience versus erasure is stated overtly ("gentrification wasn't just about new buildings; it was about erasing history") rather than emerging from image and choice. The foundation stone chip recurs but its meaning shift is asserted ("a reminder of strength") rather than dramatized through a non-literal final image. The closing paragraph moralizes ("a beacon of possibility") instead of trusting scene pressure to carry resonance. Modest mid-band fit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and diction remains consistent within Lira's register. However, interiority leans on summary ("she felt a pull," "her motivation burned brighter") rather than specific perceptual signature, and the ending shifts into collective "they" without a clean focalization handoff. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are waived. Voice is serviceable but lacks rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "a swirling pattern of symbols, unlike anything she'd seen before" followed immediately by "a small, jagged stone… unmistakably significant" restates discovery without adding pressure (−0.2). The phrase "hopeful desperation" is used twice, once as abstract label and once as tonal claim in the final paragraph, constituting template cadence (−0.4). Stock metaphor "ignited the hearts" and "beacon of possibility" in the ending beats dull specificity (−0.3). Cumulative artifact debt totals −0.9, pulling the score from functional ~6.3 down to 5.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—community organizing against gentrification via graffiti art—matches widely used template plots (grassroots resistance, symbolic artifact, festival climax). The transformation test fails: swap "raft city" for "neighborhood," "stone chip" for "mural fragment," and the arc remains unchanged. No fresh inflection distinguishes this telling; the middle-ground hedging (Vorin as stock antagonist, festival as predictable rallying mechanism) avoids bold choices. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her role is named, but "culture shock absorber" functions as job title rather than constraint—no choice in the text turns on her mediation skill or forces a trade-off between communities. She observes, deciphers, and organizes, but these actions do not narrow live options with cost. Functional but replaceable; cap at 3.8 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in two beats (discovery at graffiti, placement at festival) and is handled on the page. Early signal is present (~20% mark). However, its function is symbolic decoration—it does not constrain a tactical choice or enable a reversal. The festival placement is ornamental; removing the chip would not break the rally's logic. Functional role in one key turn (discovery triggers the quest), so mid-band ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Dual allegiance ("to the sea that carried them and to the community that sustained them") is mentioned once in expository summary and echoed thematically at the festival, but it does not create on-page friction or alter Lira's tactics. No choice forces her to choose between allegiances. Present as theme claim, not as stake-shaping concept. Functional but ornamental; 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive mind" is a label applied twice (opening, midpoint) but never dramatized as a constraint or enabler. Lira deciphers graffiti, but the text does not show how this trait forces a trade-off or costs her something another approach would not. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff; 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Reorganize" appears once ("Lira began to reorganize her usual rounds") and motivates the graffiti quest, but the action itself is summary—no on-page beat shows her choosing what to prioritize or sacrificing a prior commitment. The quest could be triggered by "followed" or "investigated" with no loss. Present in setup, weak causal role; 4.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Graffiti as encoded messages is signaled early, drives two beats (discovery, decoding trail), and returns at the festival display. The mechanics matter: only Lira's "orderly mind" can decipher them, though this is told rather than shown. Closure participation is weak—the festival display is collective, not a graffiti-specific tactical move. Two beats and setup present but modest closure linkage; 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The raft city and "perpetual carnival" are vividly described in the opening and closing paragraphs, but the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics. The "central marketplace" and Vorin's "sleek barge" are spatial anchors without pressure. Postcard description across multiple beats; functional but does not shape outcome. 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Before privatization" is named in the opening line and frames the threat, but no ticking clock tightens decisions—Lira's quest unfolds at her own pace without urgency imposed by the timeframe. The threat is static backdrop. Setup present, but no development or closure linkage; cap at 4.6 for missing middle work, then adjust down for vague tracking: 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Gentrification is the named threat and Lira's motivation is declared multiple times ("her motivation burned brighter than ever"). It drives the quest structure and is present at closure (festival as counter to gentrification). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—no beat shows Lira weighing personal cost against community need. Setup, development (graffiti quest), and payoff present; modest causal pressure. 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is named twice (as descriptor and tonal claim in final paragraph) but the prose does not modulate—Lira's beats maintain steady resolve without oscillation between hope and despair. The tone is asserted rather than embodied in rhythm or image. Present as label across beats, but static mood without pressure charge at closure. 4.3.</comment>
