<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to fuse insight with empathy") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "affectionate detachment" and "professional thoroughness" remain labels without visible cost or internal friction in the peak beat. The transformation she performs lacks agency—she executes a commission without meaningful resistance or moral calculus. Kael exists only in summary; no on-page relationship pressure tests her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The closure unit—Elara completing the emotion craft and walking away—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she accepts the half-truth currency of her trade), but the cost is asserted ("quiet satisfaction") rather than dramatized through a forfeited path or visible consequence. The petal's dissolution shifts the grotto's energy, yet no on-page choice by Elara alters her options or stance in a legible way.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The amber grotto supplies vivid sensory anchors (molten light, damp earth, metallic minerals) and the petal functions as a micro-object. Spatial choreography is clean. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elara's process unfolds without environmental friction. The setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure source, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—crafting an emotion for Kael—is signaled early but never tested. Elara faces no reversal, dilemma, or trade-off; the petal dissolves on cue, the transformation completes without complication. Static electricity "crackles" in response to her concentration, but no external or internal pressure forces a difficult choice. One tightening or deepening is required at this length; none appears on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The half-truth concept and the transience of joy are stated ("half truths were her currency") rather than enacted through scene pressure. The final paragraph moralizes the premise ("another story left untold") instead of letting the image resonate. The petal's dissolution offers a visual metaphor, but the thematic question—whether insight without entanglement is sustainable—receives no on-page test or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV holds stable and the prose carries a consistent elevated register ("molten gold," "affectionate detachment"). However, diction drifts into abstraction during peak beats ("fuse insight with empathy," "tapestry of feeling") where embodied perception would serve better. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Elara's way of noticing does not feel character-particular under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean. The prose favors abstract nouns and weak constructions ("was near," "felt a shift," "seemed softer") over strong verbs and concrete action, especially in the transformation beat. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs four and five restate the petal's essence and Elara's process without adding pressure. Template cadence in the final two paragraphs ("She tucked... and turned... She hoped... she knew...") flattens momentum. Deduction: −0.6 for loops and template stems in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The counterfeit-emotion-dealer premise offers surface novelty, but the execution defaults to a mission-complete arc without transformation or risk. The grotto, petal, and static-electricity method function as genre set-dressing; none drives a turn. The half-truth concept is told rather than explored through competing goods or moral friction. Derivative Premise Guardrail: the commission-and-completion frame is a stock plot; no transformation through lived detail or non-obvious calculus appears. Deduction: −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role (emotion dealer) frames the action. However, her choices do not create key turns—she executes a plan without reversal or dilemma. She observes, reflects, and completes the task; no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Caps: lacks middle development (no choice under pressure) → cap 3.4; lacks closure participation (walks away satisfied, no reweighted stance) → cap 2.8. Lyric allowance: her satisfaction and detachment reprise the opening thoroughness, lifting slightly. Score: 2.8 + 0.5 (reprise) + 0.9 (two-beat involvement: opening check, final departure) = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The petal is signaled early (setup), handled in the transformation beat (development), and its dissolution completes the emotion craft (payoff). All three gates met. Beat involvement: two distinct beats (nestled in pouch, then dissolved). Causal pressure: enables the emotion craft. Closure linkage: the empty pouch is tucked away post-transformation, but the petal itself does not charge the final image or alter Elara's stance. Swappability: any memory-infused object could serve; the petal's fragrance-chemist origin does not matter to the plot. Score: 5.0 (two beats, setup/payoff) +0.9 (two beats) +0.5 (causal enable) +0.4 (early signal) −0.5 (swappable) = 6.3, round to 6.8 with closure adjacency.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Half-truth is named repeatedly ("a key to a half truth," "half truths were her currency") but remains thematic assertion rather than on-page constraint. It does not shape tactics or narrow options; Elara accepts the concept without friction. Setup: present early (first paragraph). Development: absent—no choice hinges on partial versus full truth. Payoff: echoed in the final paragraph as summary. Caps: lacks middle development → cap 3.4; lacks closure participation → cap 2.8. Lyric allowance: early mention and final reprise lift slightly. Score: 2.8 + 0.5 (reprise) + 0.3 (label presence) + 0.2 = 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Professionally thorough" is labeled in the opening ("a trait that had kept her alive") and reprised in the penultimate paragraph ("her professional thoroughness validated once more"). Setup and payoff gates met, but development is missing—no on-page action demonstrates thoroughness under pressure with a cost. The satchel check and petal handling could be performed by any careful character. Caps: lacks middle development → cap 3.4. Score: 3.0 (baseline) +0.3 (label early) +0.3 (reprise) −0.5 (ornamental) = 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Subsume" appears in the central transformation beat: "to subsume its essence into the emotion she'd crafted." Setup: implicit (the task requires incorporation). Development: the action occurs mid-story as she dissolves the petal. Payoff: the emotion is complete. All three gates met. However, the action is not a decision point—Elara proceeds without obstacle or trade-off. Swappability: "merge," "integrate," or "absorb" could replace "subsume" without altering logic. Score: 5.0 (gates) +0.4 (one beat) +0.5 (enables closure) −0.0 (no cost tied to this verb specifically) = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Static electricity is mentioned in the opening ("a trick she'd honed over years") and again in the transformation beat ("The static electricity in the air crackled"). Setup present, but development and payoff are absent—it signals presence but does not shape attempts, constrain choices, or enable a key move that another method could not. The petal dissolves through Elara's concentration; the static is atmospheric. Caps: lacks middle development → cap 3.4; lacks closure participation → cap 2.8. Score: 2.8 (max with two-gate deficit) −0.5 (ornamental) = 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The amber grotto is anchored early with vivid detail (stalactites, molten light, minerals). Setup gate met. The grotto supplies the location for the transformation and its atmosphere ("stones were holding their breath") supports tone. However, it does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome; any isolated chamber would serve. Development and payoff gates: absent—no choice hinges on the grotto's properties. Caps: lacks middle development → cap 3.4; lacks closure participation → cap 2.8. Lyric allowance: the "softer" light in the penultimate paragraph reprises the opening amber glow. Score: 2.8 +0.8 (vivid setup) +0.5 (tone support) +0.3 (reprise) +0.4 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"As the transformation completes" frames the central beat and recurs in "The transformation was complete." Setup and payoff present; the phrase signals progression. However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Elara proceeds at her own pace without a live clock or deadline. Development gate: absent—no choice is forced by time pressure. Caps: lacks middle development → cap 3.4. Score: 3.0 +0.3 (early frame) +0.3 (payoff mention) = 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to fuse insight with empathy" is stated in the opening and guides Elara's process. Setup gate met. However, it is told rather than dramatized—no on-page choice enacts the fusion under pressure, and no friction arises between insight and empathy. Development and payoff: the final paragraph asserts she achieved this ("balanced insight with empathy"), but the achievement is summary, not scene. Caps: lacks middle development → cap 3.4; lacks closure participation → cap 2.8. Lyric allowance: early statement and final reprise. Score: 2.8 +0.5 (reprise) +0.8 (frames premise) +0.8 (label coherence) = 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is named in the transformation beat ("Elara's heart ached faintly, an affectionate detachment") and reprised in her "slight smile" as she walks away. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly—calm observation in the opening, faint ache during dissolution, quiet satisfaction at closure. Setup: implicit (professional distance). Development: present (the ache moment). Payoff: the smile charges the final image. All three gates met. However, the tone does not create friction or cost; it remains a stable mood rather than a contested stance. Score: 5.0 (gates) +0.4 (one beat) +0.7 (closure linkage) −0.7 (no conflict or trade-off tied to tone) = 5.4.</comment>
