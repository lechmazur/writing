<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—to capture an ineffable dream—but her interiority defaults to stock phrasing ("quiet drive," "heart full") without embodied contradiction. The journey to the cathedral constitutes a decision under pressure, yet the resolution feels declarative rather than earned through on-page struggle; the final realization arrives as assertion, not dramatized cost. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, so relationship bullets do not apply. Backstory (grandmother's moonflower, dream fragments) remains well under 20% and anchors present choices, satisfying BRR without penalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece operates as a two-shard sequence (studio → cathedral → studio) within one contiguous window, meeting the mosaic allowance. Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph one, so no penalty applies. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the mural complete, the question answered in the final image), but the cost remains asserted rather than visibly paid—no foreclosed path or visible sacrifice appears on the page. One meaningful deepening (cathedral visit reweights the project) is present, satisfying escalation for accumulative mode, but the conceptual cost at closure is oblique, capping the band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The amber pavilion and cathedral are anchored with sensory specificity (latticework, weathered stone, shards of color), and the stained glass windows constrain Elara's observation, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography is coherent across locations. However, the autumn-to-spring timeframe and the pavilion's physical layout do not alter tactics or choices in a legible way; setting functions more as backdrop than active constraint, limiting the score despite vivid description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the dream's essence—is signaled early and remains coherent. The cathedral visit constitutes one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens, and the question "why do flowers bloom at night?" threads through. Yet no on-page reversal or visible trade-off narrows options; Elara's journey proceeds without complication or loss. The final image asserts resolution ("a truth") without dramatizing the cost or a path foreclosed, leaving escalation functional but not charged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The moonflower/night-bloom motif recurs across beats and the ending image attempts resonance, but the final paragraph delivers an explicit moral ("even in darkness, there is beauty waiting to be seen") instead of letting the image speak. Thematic echo penalties apply: the closing line states the thesis in prompt-like language, triggering −0.6. The question "why do flowers bloom at night?" is answered declaratively rather than through scene pressure, reducing subtext to assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and perceptual signature (artist's attention to light, color, texture) is consistent. Diction is controlled but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("umbral tenderness," "dawning hush") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears; internal voice is coherent but leans on stock intensifiers ("heart full," "quiet drive"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully between reflection and observation, maintaining clarity without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is adequate, but multiple paraphrase loops appear: "quiet drive" recurs across beats without added pressure, "dawning hush" appears six times with minimal variation, and the final paragraph restates the central question mechanically. Template cadence is present in the studio-return sequence ("She worked through the night, driven by..."). Stock metaphors ("heart full," "whispered secrets") and figurative density in non-peak beats (the opening and closing paragraphs) accumulate to −0.8 in Q7. No artifacts touch the closure image directly, limiting the penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—artist recreates a dream via historical research and site visit—follows a familiar creative-quest template without a non-obvious inflection. The moonflower/night-bloom motif and the stained-glass layer device are present but do not transform the arc; the journey and resolution proceed predictably. Emotional specificity is present in the grandmother's garden memory, lifting the score slightly above generic, but the arc could function unchanged with different objects and setting details, indicating insufficient transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The vivid mural artist is present throughout and her choice to visit the cathedral drives the middle beat. She observes and paints at closure, but the final image is declarative rather than a hard choice. Two beats (departure, painting) involve her agency, meeting the two-gate minimum, but causality is soft and no visible cost appears, capping at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The postcards appear in three beats (worktable, journey, studio return) but remain static description—traced, carried, scattered—without constraining a choice or altering tactics. They are mentioned at closure ("scattered around her") but do not charge the final image or reweight prior material. Functional but replaceable with any bridge-object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" appears as a repeated phrase across six mentions but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page; it functions as atmospheric label rather than a force that changes options. The concept is echoed thematically without constraining the cathedral visit or painting act, leaving it ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is asserted four times ("quietly driven," "quiet drive," "quietly driven artist") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The trait remains a label without visible tradeoff or tactical consequence, scoring as present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears twice ("how could she reckon," "reckoning with the weight") and the cathedral visit constitutes an extended act of reckoning that drives the middle beat. However, the action is easily swappable with "understand" or "confront" without structural change; its specificity does not constrain the closure, placing it at functional-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The etched glass windows are seeded early (postcard), constrain the cathedral visit (Elara observes "hidden layers," "emotions woven into the light"), and appear at closure ("their etched glass revealing stories"). The method shapes two beats and participates in the final image, meeting all three gates, but the mechanics remain vague—"hidden layers" is asserted without showing how observation yields the mural's content, capping causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The amber pavilion brackets the story (opening and closing) with sensory anchors (golden light, latticework, rustle of leaves), meeting setup and payoff gates. However, the space does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as postcard description. The autumn-to-spring arc is mentioned but not tracked in a way that pressures decisions, leaving the setting functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the melting of winter's last snow" is mentioned twice but not tracked as a live clock. The passage from autumn to winter to spring provides atmospheric color without tightening decisions or altering tactics. Time remains vague and ornamental, failing the development gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand why flowers bloom at night" is seeded in childhood backstory, drives the cathedral visit ("that moment had planted a seed"), and is answered at closure. It appears in three beats and participates in the ending, meeting all gates. However, the friction between want and cost is told rather than dramatized—no on-page conflict tests the question under pressure—limiting causal strength to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" appears twice (cathedral air, final reflection) and the tone of quiet reverence modulates across beats without breaking. The phrase charges the cathedral scene and recurs at closure, meeting setup and payoff gates. However, it remains a static mood rather than a tone that shifts with pressure or meaningfully reweights the final image, placing it at functional-consistent but not indispensable.</comment>
