<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared early ("to reflect light into dark corners") but remains largely metaphorical label rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The lockmaster arrives with matching lantern carvings—convenient symmetry that flattens agency; she passively receives validation rather than making a costly choice that forecloses a path. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "wistfully pragmatic," "protected vulnerability" function as labels without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final exchange offers mutual recognition but no visible cost or renunciation on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Elara on fire escape, harbor setting). Drive lens reads Situational: the encounter itself is the pressure, and the "quivering hush" frames expectation. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (kindred spirit found), but the cost is asserted ("found a piece of me") rather than dramatized through forfeited option or visible trade-off. The lockmaster's arrival and the tooth's return feel coincidentally symmetric rather than causally earned by Elara's prior tactics. One tightening occurs (descent to dock, meeting), but the final image lacks the undeniable felt price required for solid RR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Moonlit harbor, fire escape, docked boat, and lantern light provide vivid sensory anchors. The lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth catches moonlight in two beats, and the lantern's carved handle mirrors it—object detail constrains the final exchange and charges recognition. Spatial choreography (third floor to dock, boat arrival) tracks cleanly. However, the harbor functions more as postcard backdrop than environment that alters tactics; the tooth's material specificity (edges, intricate design) is mentioned but does not force a micro-choice with visible consequence during the encounter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elara's desire to "reflect light into dark corners," signaled early and reprised at closure. One tightening: curiosity pulls her to the dock, and the tooth exchange crystallizes connection. However, the lockmaster's arrival is pure coincidence—she makes no prior choice that summons him or risks anything to descend. The final bestowal of the tooth and his acceptance feel like mutual gift rather than a trade-off that forecloses another path. Pressure remains atmospheric ("quivering hush") rather than escalating through protagonist agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of nurturing beauty in unlikely places and finding kindred spirits emerges from particulars (fire escape plants, harbor meeting). The lockmaster's line about "instilling life" and searching "when the world holds its breath" edges toward thematic echo but stays rooted in scene. The tooth as connector and the lantern's matching design offer concrete resonance. However, the final paragraph borders on summary ("she had not only reflected light…but also found a kindred spirit") rather than letting the image stand without guide. The closure offers warm symmetry but lacks the conceptual friction or non-literal answer that would elevate thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV anchors to Elara throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature reflects her gardener's attention (leaves swaying, petals, soil) and the lockmaster's maritime approach. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt") appear but remain voice-legible. Dialogue carries subtext (his observation about instilling life, her question "after the final petal drops") and distinguishes the two speakers by idiom and rhythm. Brief elision of the lockmaster's backstory is acceptable at this length. Minor slips: "wistfully pragmatic" and "protected vulnerability" are asserted traits rather than enacted through syntax or diction under pressure, and the final paragraph shifts toward summary distance ("she knew") instead of maintaining immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean with varied syntax and vivid imagery ("luminous harbor by moonlight," "rhythm of oars in water"). Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (the tooth's moonlight catch anchors both object and atmosphere). Template-cadence risk in paragraph openers: "She believed…," "She paused…," "Curiosity tugged…," "He hesitated…" form a mild pattern but do not loop within single beats. Stock phrases appear: "the world held its breath" (twice), "edges sharp yet strangely comforting," "as if their paths had been destined." The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image, and "quivering hush wrapping around them like a blanket" mixes metaphor (hush wraps? blanket?). Deduct baseline −0.6 for template stems and stock metaphor strings; no closure-beat contamination.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—fire escape gardener meets lockmaster at moonlit harbor—offers specific sensory detail but follows a Romantic meet-cute template: isolated artist, mysterious stranger, symbolic object that proves connection, mutual recognition as kindred spirits. The "quivering hush" and "rhythm of oars" provide atmospheric texture, but the core arc (lonely person finds soulmate who validates their worldview without friction) is well-trodden. The lockmaster's lantern handle matching the found tooth reads as symbolic convenience rather than earned surprise. Transformation test: swap names and setting (rooftop chef meets clockmaker) and the emotional beats remain unchanged. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis that makes this collision feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara appears in all beats: tending plants, finding the tooth, descending the fire escape, meeting the lockmaster, offering the tooth. Her occupation (fire escape gardener) anchors setting and motivation. However, her choices lack causal pressure: she descends out of curiosity (passive pull), and the tooth exchange is a gift rather than a decision that narrows options or incurs cost. Observation and receptivity dominate; no turn hinges on a choice she makes under friction. Present across all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but functionally replaceable with "rooftop artist" or similar without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth appears in three beats: Elara finds it and fingers it (paragraph 1 & 2), she closes her hand around it when the lockmaster speaks (paragraph 3), and she holds it out at closure where its edges catch lantern glow and he identifies it as "a piece of me" (paragraphs 5–6). It enables the connection and charges the final exchange. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as symbolic token rather than tool whose properties matter. Setup and closure gates met; middle use is static (she holds it in her pocket). Specific design (intricate, sharp edges) is noted but does not force visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"A quivering hush" is mentioned three times: after the petal drops (paragraph 1), when Elara notices the boat (paragraph 2), and at closure when it "wraps around them" (final paragraph). It frames atmosphere and expectation but does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page. The concept remains ornamental mood-setting; no choice hinges on the hush's presence or absence. Setup and closure gates met via repetition, but middle development is absent—characters act without reference to it. Swappable with "charged stillness" or similar without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is attributed to Elara in paragraph 1 ("she was wistfully pragmatic, knowing that beauty could thrive…") and echoed by the lockmaster in paragraph 4 ("they echoed her own thoughts, her own wistfully pragmatic approach"). The trait is asserted as label rather than enacted through micro-choice with visible cost. No on-page moment demonstrates a tradeoff where pragmatism constrains wistfulness or vice versa. Setup present, closure participation via echo, but middle development absent. Label-only use caps score; swappable with "quietly hopeful" or similar descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Instill" appears once when the lockmaster observes Elara: "it's like you're instilling life into something that's forgotten how to grow" (paragraph 4). The verb describes her gardening ethos but does not drive a turn; she does not perform an instilling action on the page that changes options. The word reprises her motivation ("to reflect light") thematically but remains dialogue commentary rather than enacted choice. Setup absent (not mentioned in first third), middle development absent, closure participation weak (observation only). Ornamental thematic mention; easily replaced with "breathing life" or "restoring."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"The rhythm of oars in water" appears twice: Elara notices it in paragraph 2 ("seemed to sync with her heartbeat") and it "fades into the night" in the final paragraph. The method signals the lockmaster's arrival and provides auditory texture but does not shape attempts or tactics. No mechanics of rowing matter; the phrase functions as atmospheric marker. Setup and closure gates met via bookend mentions, but middle development absent—characters do not reference or use the rhythm. Swappable with "sound of footsteps on the dock" or similar arrival cue without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Luminous harbor by moonlight" is established in the opening line and sustained throughout: lanterns, docks, moonlight catching the tooth, boat docking, pier. The setting provides spatial choreography (fire escape to dock descent) and sensory anchors (water, moon, lanterns). The harbor enables the meeting and the moonlight charges the tooth's visibility in two beats. However, the environment does not constrain choice—Elara could meet the lockmaster in any liminal space. Setup, middle (descent uses fire escape and dock), and closure (standing on dock) gates all met. Micro-setting (lantern, tooth in moonlight) contributes but does not force tactical adaptation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the final petal drops from the old rosebush" anchors the opening timeframe and triggers "a peculiar stillness." The phrase appears once and is not referenced again; no clock tightens decisions or tracks elapsed time. The petal drop signals a threshold moment thematically but does not constrain tactics—events could occur at any evening hour without change. Setup present (first paragraph), middle and closure gates absent. Swappable with "at twilight" or "when the last light fades" without structural impact. Ornamental temporal marker with no pressure on pacing or choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to reflect light into dark corners" is declared in paragraph 1 and reprised at closure ("she had not only reflected light into a dark corner but had also found a kindred spirit"). The desire frames her gardening practice and the lockmaster validates it ("you're instilling life…"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No on-page moment shows her choosing between illuminating others and preserving her solitude, or risking exposure to pursue connection. Setup and closure gates met; middle friction absent. Thematic through-line present but lacks choice-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is attributed to the lockmaster once: "his voice filled with a protected vulnerability" (paragraph 6). Tone aims for intimacy and tentative openness across the encounter (soft voices, hesitations, gentle exchanges). However, the single explicit label and the overall mood remain static—no modulation under pressure, no moment where protection cracks to reveal raw exposure with cost. Setup absent (not established early), middle development weak (one mention), closure participation minimal (the label does not charge the final image). The tone is asserted rather than enacted through rhythm or diction shifts. Swappable with "quiet sincerity."</comment>
