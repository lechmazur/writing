<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is labeled "luminous skeptic" and "realistically imaginative" but these traits never constrain choices or create internal contradiction. Her journey from skepticism to wonder occurs through passive discovery rather than conflicted decision-making. The box's testing ("demanding she prove her worth") is told rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices with visible trade-offs. Her transformation at the end—"no longer just a luminous skeptic"—is asserted rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first paragraph, meeting the test. However, the closure operates under an unclear lens: the box mechanics shift from puzzle-solving (causal) to symbolic catalyst without teaching the pattern early. The final transformation—water flowing, memories released—reads as coincidental magic rather than motivated by Elara's prior choices; she assembles shards but the fountain's awakening and city-wide effect lack causal grounding in her actions. Cost at closure is conceptual (liberating memories) but not felt or visible on the page in Elara's options or stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains provides vivid, purposeful atmosphere—dried basins, frozen clock tower, moss-covered stone—that guides Elara's path and mirrors the trapped-memory theme. Spatial choreography across locations (apartment, windowsill, fountain, clock tower, library ruins) remains clear. However, setting remains largely decorative; the fountains do not constrain Elara's choices or supply tactical resources. The final fountain's return to life charges the closure image with symbolic weight, meeting the micro-setting allowance for a recurring object that reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation relies on breadcrumb collection without meaningful narrowing of options or rising cost; each shard discovery feels identical in pressure. The box's glow "testing her, demanding she prove her worth" is told rather than dramatized through on-page choices that foreclose paths. The final assembly reversal (box as catalyst, not prison) shifts understanding but lacks protagonist agency; Elara's action is mechanical insertion, not a decision with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of liberation versus entrapment emerges through concrete images (dried fountains, frozen time, stained glass fragments) rather than statement. The box-as-catalyst reversal offers thematic complexity, reweighting "prison" as "key" through the journey. However, the ending articulates theme too directly: "the box had not been a prison for memories, but a catalyst for their release" explains rather than dramatizes. The final image of awakening fountains resonates symbolically but lacks the ambiguity or cost that would elevate it beyond pleasant resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices formations, inscriptions, glows—but lacks character-specific bias or selectivity. Diction drifts into elevated register ("sidereal patience," "defiant hush") that reads ornamental rather than voice-motivated. The prose uses filter verbs heavily ("she felt," "she noticed," "she understood") in peak beats, dulling immediacy. Psychic distance remains static rather than modulating with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "liquid starlight," "trapped piece of the night sky," "cascade of color" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "the box had not been a prison...but a catalyst" immediately follows demonstration of that fact (−0.2). Template cadence runs through multiple "she had [verb]" and "It was as if" constructions (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("eyes glowed faintly...carried their own moon") and therapy-speak proximity ("prove her worth") in closure vicinity trigger artifacts touching closure (−1.7 range, disallow 9+ globally). Filter-verb stacks in the climax ("she felt," "she understood," "she knew") dull immediacy (−0.5, disallow 9+ globally per the pack).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise—collect magical fragments to restore a city—follows a widely used template (quest-puzzle with symbolic payoff) without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−1.0 derivative penalty). The "memories as trapped thing to be freed" metaphor and the fountain-as-heart-of-city motif read as stock fantasy elements. Elara's arc from skeptic to believer follows a predictable path. The breadcrumb mechanic and stained-glass-box-as-puzzle lack fresh inflection; removing "stained glass" and "geese pause" would leave the emotional and plot arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara ("luminous skeptic") appears throughout but her skepticism does not create key turns—she never doubts, resists, or pays a cost for her belief shift. Her choices are observational (kneel, examine, approach) rather than dilemma-driven. The label is present but swappable; "determined seeker" would fit identically. Middle involvement is present (she follows clues) but without decision pressure. Closure participation is passive (places shard, witnesses result). Present and functional but replaceable: caps at 3.8 for swappability, −0.3 ornamental label use = 3.5, round to 3.8 acknowledging presence across beats with no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stained glass box is handled in multiple beats (attic discovery, study, journey carrying it, final assembly), meeting the two-touch requirement. It shapes the middle quest (breadcrumb collection) and is causally active at closure (assembly triggers fountain). However, its mechanics are vague—why does assembling it free memories? Specificity is weak; the box could be any puzzle container. Cost connection is absent; Elara risks nothing to obtain or use it. Setup strong, development functional, payoff present but mechanically convenient (−0.7 for resolving a problem it did not help create in specific terms). 7.0 base for three gates and beat involvement, −0.6 for late-element resolution convenience = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Sidereal patience" appears twice as descriptive phrase ("sidereal patience" of the box, "beacon of sidereal patience" at end) but never shapes stakes or alters tactics. It is a thematic label, not a dramatized constraint—Elara does not wait, endure delay with cost, or navigate time pressure tied to cosmic cycles. Ornamental use only. Mentioned but does not affect choices: 0.1–2.9 band, lean toward 2.1 for purposeful reprise that reweights tonally without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Realistically imaginative" is a label applied in the opening ("able to dismantle illusions yet weave possibilities") but never enables or constrains an on-page action with cost. Elara's puzzle-solving is straightforward collection; no moment shows her imaginative leap versus skeptical check creating friction or trade-off. The trait is described, not dramatized. Ornamental: 2.3 for presence without action pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unstick" appears in the inscription ("Unstick the past to free the future") and is echoed at closure ("by unsticking the past, she had unlocked...the city's forgotten heart"). It frames the quest conceptually and the final assembly is the physical "unsticking." However, the mechanics are vague—what does unsticking mean as action? Elara places a shard; the metaphorical unsticking happens off-stage via magic. Setup present, middle reference, payoff present but abstracted. One key turn shaped (the conceptual frame), but swappable with "unlock" or "release" with minor edits. Mid-band: 5.8 for purposeful early-final reprise that reweights without specific causal mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Following breadcrumbs is the method signaled in the opening note and executed across the middle (shards at windowsill, fountain, clock tower, library). The mechanics matter: each breadcrumb location advances Elara spatially and reveals inscriptions that guide understanding. The method is present in closure preparation (final breadcrumb at the largest fountain). Setup early, development across multiple beats, payoff implicit (method leads to final location and assembly). 7.2 for essential method across beats with clear payoff linkage, though the method itself is simple collection without tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>City of forgotten fountains is setup early, visited across multiple locations (apartment, fountain, clock tower, library, largest fountain), and restored at closure. However, it supplies atmosphere more than constraint—Elara moves freely without the city pressuring her choices. The final fountain's awakening is symbolic payoff but does not require this specific city; any decayed-magical setting would serve. Setup strong, development as backdrop, payoff symbolic. 5.9 for one purposeful early-final reprise that reweights the dominant stake without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Pause of migrating geese" is mentioned once in the setup ("The box had arrived during the pause") and geese return at closure ("geese returned to their skies"). Time does not tighten decisions—Elara takes "weeks" studying the box with no urgency, then follows breadcrumbs at her own pace. The geese frame the story but do not create a clock. Ornamental temporal bracket: 2.6 for purposeful reprise without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To liberate trapped memories" is stated in the opening note and pursued throughout, with Elara convinced the box "held more than mere trinkets." At closure, liberation succeeds. However, the motivation is told rather than conflicted—Elara never faces a cost or friction in pursuing this goal, and whose memories (hers? the city's?) remains vague until the ending explanation. Functional but replaceable with "solve the mystery" or "restore the city." Setup present, middle functional, payoff present but unexplored for personal cost. 4.9 for functional presence without friction or specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Defiant hush" appears in the opening paragraph and final paragraph ("in the defiant hush of the city"). Tone is coherent—quiet, patient, archaic-elevated—but does not modulate with pressure; climax and discovery carry the same register as exposition. The hush is described rather than embodied in syntax or rhythm. Functional bracket but static mood. 4.1 for coherent presence and purposeful reprise without pressure modulation or rhythmic charge at the final image.</comment>
