<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's "fractally precise" perception is labeled repeatedly but never constrains a choice with visible cost. Her face-blindness is mentioned once and never affects tactics or relationships. The final "discovery of her own limits" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses; she works "with a focus born of obsession" in a single uninterrupted flow without genuine struggle. Backstory dominates the opening third without anchoring in present micro-choices that alter options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by the second paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: Elara enters, finds the book safe, deciphers it, and completes the puzzle as the building collapses. One tightening occurs (the violent shudder), but the cost remains abstract—"the world seemed different" and "stillness remained" offer conceptual repricing without a legible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. The closure reconfigures her understanding but does not foreclose a path or demonstrate visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hollowed oak trunk library is vivid and purposeful, guiding Elara's search through carved patterns and shelves. The coin's indentations and the book safe's constellations supply tactile detail that charges the final image. The condemned building's groans and collapsing walls function as a live constraint that tightens the timeframe, meeting the micro-setting standard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—deciphering the book safe to "mirror the sky inside walls"—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the building shudders violently, but Elara's agency is uncontested; no reversal, trade-off, or visible loss shapes her tactics. The ending asserts that "she had done it" without showing what she risked or gave up to complete the work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of "containing the infinite within the finite" emerges organically from the book safe puzzle and the hollowed tree. The final image—"in limits, there is boundless possibility"—risks stating the moral rather than earning it through particulars, but the constellations and the collapsing structure provide enough concrete anchoring to avoid pure abstraction. The sky-mirroring conceit offers a resonant if slightly on-the-nose conceptual payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable, and Elara's perceptual signature—"fractally precise detail"—is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("testament to her skill and the guild's vision") that feels more authorial than character-bound. The prose modulates appropriately as pressure rises, shortening clauses during the climax, but filter verbs ("she felt," "seemed to") stack in reflective passages without clear voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Paraphrase loops appear: "The building groaned softly, as if sensing its impending demise" echoes the opening's "silence that precedes an ending," and "her hands trembling despite her resolve" / "her heart pounding" recycle interiority without new pressure. Template cadence in the opening ("It was a stillness... Her fingers traced... Her eyes... saw... Her gift... had led her") clusters three "Her [noun] [verb]" stems without taught pattern. The figurative load is managed but occasionally stacks ("living relic amidst the decay," "crafting beauty from chaos") without clear payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist premise is conceptually interesting but functions as a label rather than a dramatized constraint. The tree-trunk library and book safe offer specificity, yet the emotional arc—overcoming limits through craftsmanship—follows a familiar template. The "fractally precise" trait and the coin-as-key method feel ornamental rather than causally indispensable; similar narrative beats could play out with generic puzzle-solving. No bold structural risk or surprising synthesis elevates the execution beyond competent genre work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her search drives the sequence, but her face-blindness does not constrain a choice or create friction. She moves from entry to discovery to completion without a decision that alters tactics. Her role is more observer-solver than agent under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The book safe is introduced at mid-story, handled in two beats (discovery, deciphering), and charged at closure when it "mirrors the sky." Its constellations enable the final image. Late arrival and lack of early setup cap potential, but it participates meaningfully in closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" is named in dialogue-like interiority ("a discovery of her own limits") but not dramatized through failed attempts or visible cost. The concept echoes thematically in the final reflection without shaping on-page tactics or choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears as a perceptual label in the opening and recurs in description of her movements, but it does not constrain or enable a specific action with trade-off. It remains ornamental characterization rather than a trait with mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Crafting—deciphering the code and recreating constellations—occupies the climax and completes the puzzle. The action is present in two beats (opening the safe, working the pages) and necessary to closure, but "craft" as verb could be swapped for "solve" or "decode" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The coin's indentations guide Elara to the safe's location and supply the cipher for the constellations. It is seeded early, used in two beats (locating, decoding), but its mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated. The method matters but remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is introduced early, frames the entire action, and supplies carved patterns that guide Elara's search. The hollowed trunk functions as both spatial anchor and resource, and the hidden compartment mechanism turns on its structure. Integral across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The condemned building's impending demolition is signaled in the opening and returns at closure with the violent shudder. The timeframe creates ambient urgency but does not visibly tighten Elara's decisions; she works for "hours, or perhaps minutes" without tracking or tactical adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The desire "to mirror the sky inside walls" is named early and drives Elara's search and deciphering work. It anchors two beats and the closure image. However, the motivation is told rather than shown in conflict; no competing want or cost tests her commitment on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" is established in the opening, sustained through the quiet library interior, and modulates at closure when "the stillness remained, but it was no longer oppressive." The tone is coherent and charges the final reconfiguration, though it risks stasis in the middle passages.</comment>
