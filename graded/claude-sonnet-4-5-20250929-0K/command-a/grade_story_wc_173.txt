<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to defy the lullaby of conformity") is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page choice with visible cost. Her "bodily poetic grace" and "chaste courtesan" status remain labels without contradiction or consequence—no moment forces her to choose between seduction and defiance, or shows how her role complicates the mission. The untangling sequence offers no genuine struggle or mistake; she succeeds via unearned intuition ("guided by an intuition she couldn't explain"). Interiority is abstract ("weight of their lives, their hopes, their fears") rather than embodied, and the final "small smile" reads as stock rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph; the prism sanctuary functions as a spatial goal. However, causality is soft: Elara's success hinges on unexplained intuition rather than prior skill or cost, and the "harvest of echoes" mechanism is never dramatized—threads untangle because the plot requires it, not because her choices narrow options. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing (the city awakens, fragments scatter in snow), but the cost is abstract and off-page ("forced to confront the truth of its complacency"); no on-page consequence tests Elara or alters her immediate reality. The lens wobbles between Accumulative (mythic imagery, lyric cadence) and Causal (a task sequence), settling inconclusively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The silver courtyard and prism sanctuary anchor space vividly ("crystalline walls catching starlight and refracting it into a kaleidoscope"), and snow recurs to frame the opening and close the piece, reweighting as a carrier of echoes. However, the sanctuary's interior and the threads remain visually vague—no tactile resistance, no spatial constraint that forces a harder choice. The courtyard does not pressure Elara's tactics; she walks in, works, and leaves without environmental friction. The final snow image charges the closure moderately but does not constrain the prior action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unlock the sanctuary to awaken the city) is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: the threads untangle smoothly without reversal or meaningful tightening. No live option is foreclosed; Elara never considers retreat or pays a visible price during the task. The ending gestures at consequence ("the city stirred"), but it occurs off-page and does not test her further. The phrase "she knew her role as a chaste courtesan would never be the same" tells consequence rather than showing cost. One modest pressure point exists—"a reckoning with the cost of defiance"—but it remains abstract and does not narrow her next move.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (individuality versus conformity) is legible through "lullaby of conformity," "harvest of echoes," and the sanctuary motif. The ending offers a non-literal image (snow carrying echo fragments) that reweights prior material, satisfying the closure requirement for theme. However, the piece leans on prompt-like phrasing ("the power of individuality," "act of creation") that borders on thematic echo, and the final paragraph edges toward moral summary ("To defy the lullaby of conformity was not just an act of rebellion—it was an act of creation"). The recurring snow/echo pattern is purposeful but does not transform through a character choice that contradicts or complicates the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance and narrative stance are consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register that clashes with immediacy: "paradox," "eloquent," "reckoning," "unshakable," "conduit," all deployed in high-pressure beats without irony or voice-motivated texture. Elara's perceptual signature is generic; she notices starlight and snow but her internal idiom lacks specificity. The prose reads competent but committee-like, lacking a distinct rhythm or lexical bias tied to her occupation or history. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sentence openings recycle stock patterns: "She approached," "She closed her eyes," "She raised her hands," "She stepped back," "She knew." Figurative language clusters without payoff: "bodily poetic grace," "verse in an unspoken poem," "stillness as eloquent as her dance," "between sigh and smile," all within the opening two paragraphs. Register drift into abstract diction ("paradox," "reckoning," "conduit," "symphony") undermines momentum in the central beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "voices of those who had dared to resist" / "a chorus of voices, each one a testament"; "sealing by threads" / "strands of memory, woven from the lives of those who had come before." Cumulatively, these artifacts dull the closure image and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−1.2 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—unlocking a sanctuary of preserved voices to awaken a conformist city—follows a familiar template (the chosen one performing a ritual task to restore truth/memory/individuality). "Chaste courtesan" and "bodily poetic" offer surface novelty, but neither transforms the arc: swap in "rebel dancer" or "artist-monk" and the beats remain unchanged. The untangling-threads mechanism is decorative rather than specific; no detail about thread properties or Elara's method distinguishes this from generic "solve the puzzle" sequences. The ending's snow-as-carrier image is pleasant but not surprising. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears in every beat and the mission to unlock the sanctuary is attributed to her, satisfying setup and middle involvement. However, her choices are minimal: she decides to approach, then works "guided by an intuition she couldn't explain," then dances to release echoes. No on-page turn forces a trade-off or forecloses a path. The closure ("she allowed herself a small smile") is passive observation rather than a decisive choice. Present across beats but mechanically, not causally.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is introduced early, handled in the central untangling sequence, and referenced in the ending ("now silent but no longer sealed"). It provides spatial focus and the object's crystalline properties visually anchor starlight refraction. However, its mechanics (how threads seal it, why untangling opens it) remain vague, and the sanctuary does not constrain a choice or force a cost—Elara succeeds smoothly. The ending reprise reweights meaning moderately (sealed → open), earning mid-upper band credit but falling short of indispensability due to lack of friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "harvest of echoes" is named early and becomes the object Elara seeks to release. It appears in the middle (voices within the sanctuary) and at the end (fragments carried by snow). However, the concept is ornamental: removing "harvest of echoes" and substituting "imprisoned memories" or "sealed wisdom" would not alter plot or stakes. The echoes do not speak, resist, or demand a price; they are released mechanically. Present across all three gates but functionally swappable, capping score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" appears as a descriptor in the opening ("bodily poetic grace") and again at the climax ("her bodily poetic movements now a conduit"). It does not constrain or enable a specific choice with cost; Elara's dancing releases the echoes without struggle or tradeoff. The attribute is label-only, never tested by physical limitation or tactical friction. Present in setup and closure but ornamental, placing it in the low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unlock" frames the mission from the start, drives the middle sequence (untangling threads to open the door), and completes at the climax ("the door slid open"). The action is causally central and shapes multiple beats. However, the unlocking itself is smooth and uncontested; no failed attempt or pivot alters tactics. The element is essential to structure but lacks the friction or cost that would push it into the high band. All three gates met with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method "untangling threads" is introduced when Elara reaches the sanctuary, occupies the central sequence ("she reached out...began to trace their paths...threads began to loosen"), and concludes when the door opens. The mechanics are described (tracing, loosening vibrations) but remain abstract—no specific knot, misstep, or constraint shapes tactics. The method is present across setup, middle, and ending, but its swappability (could be "singing harmonies" or "solving riddles") and lack of on-page friction limit elevation. Mid-band functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "silver courtyard under snow" anchors the opening, middle (spatial frame for the sanctuary), and ending (snow resumes, carrying fragments). Snow provides visual continuity and the final image reweights it as a carrier of echoes. However, the courtyard does not constrain movement or supply resources that alter Elara's tactics; it is setting-as-backdrop. The lyric reprise (first → last paragraph) reweights meaning enough to lift the score into mid-5s, but lack of spatial friction prevents higher credit.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Between sigh and smile" appears once in the middle of the untangling sequence ("Time seemed to stretch between sigh and smile"). It gestures at subjective duration but is never tracked or used to tighten decisions. No clock pressure, no risk of interruption, no trade-off between speed and care. The phrase is decorative metaphor rather than functional timeframe, appearing too late (mid-story) and absent from closure. Ornamental mention, missing setup and payoff gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To defy the lullaby of conformity" is stated in the opening ("her mind was not on the art of seduction but on a task far more profound") and echoed near the end ("To defy the lullaby of conformity was not just an act of rebellion—it was an act of creation"). The motivation frames the mission and appears in closure, meeting two gates. However, it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—Elara does not hesitate, doubt, or sacrifice anything on-page to pursue it. Told motivation present in setup and ending but not tested in between, placing it in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Alarming serenity" appears once explicitly in the middle ("the alarming serenity of the moment") and is implied by the juxtaposition of "silver courtyard under snow" with the high-stakes mission. The tone does not modulate under pressure—Elara remains calm throughout, and no beat sharpens the alarm. The ending repeats the serene snow image without recharging tension. Present as a declared effect but static across beats, functional but replaceable, capping in the mid-4s.</comment>
