<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses—she arrives resolved and remains so. The fortress inhabitants are shadow-figures without individuated response; their sudden cheer at the end lacks earned causality. Interiority relies on stock phrasing: "her heart ached, but her resolve deepened" reads as template emotion rather than embodied sensation. The piece tells us she "knew her task" and "her resolve deepened" without showing micro-choices that reveal cost or doubt under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by ~120 words (wandering designer, fortress gates, dusk). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light-versus-darkness imagery building to the mosaic sunrise and final flame. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—the fortress "became a blooming fortress at dawn"—but the cost is asserted, not shown; we're told "they had won a crucial victory" without visible forfeiture or path foreclosed on the page. The sequence is causal (approach, spin fire, build mosaic, ignite again) but the emotional/social change lacks embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The fortress courtyard, dry fountain, and wilting gardens anchor space purposefully. The kerosene rag knot is handled across multiple beats (dipped, spun, ignited twice), constraining Lira's method and charging the closure image with flame-light on mosaic. Sensory detail leans visual ("shimmered faintly," "flickering shadows") with limited tactile or olfactory grounding; "thick with anticipation" remains abstract. The mosaic tiles and fountain base provide micro-setting that alters the final tableau, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defying hopelessness—is declared early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Lira faces no material constraint (tools appear, people gather on cue) and no internal friction; her plan succeeds without adaptation. The escalation is additive (spin fire, then build mosaic, then ignite again) rather than a tightening that forecloses options. Closure reconfigures the mood ("blooming fortress at dawn") but the price is told—"battle against hopelessness was far from over"—not shown as a visible trade-off or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (hope amid despair, light versus darkness) emerges from image patterns but borders on overt: "to defy the gravity of hopelessness," "chase away the darkness," "dawn would come." The mosaic sunrise and flame-as-beacon work non-literally, yet the final paragraph moralizes: "she had reignited hope…they had won a crucial victory." The piece claims complexity ("not just to design fireworks but to filter the darkness") without dramatizing friction or counter-pressure that would complicate the victory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is consistent. Diction ("testament to resilience," "mosaic waiting to be completed," "declaration, a promise") skews elevated and generic, lacking Lira's occupational idiom as a fireworks designer. Chants are mentioned but never quoted or embodied in rhythm. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature is thin—"her fingers brushing the rag knot"—but the piece avoids head-hopping and maintains voice coherence across moves.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in key beats: "her heart ached, but her resolve deepened" / "her resolve deepened"; "as it was, but as it could be" / "a place of light, life, and possibility" restates without adding pressure. Template cadence runs: "Lira's motivation was clear… Lira's heart ached… Lira's next step… Lira stepped back… Lira smiled." Filter-verb stack in paragraph 3: "Lira's heart ached… she knew her task… she began to see." Stock metaphors: "thread through fabric," "floodgate opening after years of drought." These artifacts dull momentum and lower information density without breaking clarity, triggering baseline deductions in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Core premise—artist restores hope via spectacle—is familiar; the execution leans on stock metaphors (light/dark, wilting/blooming, dawn/dusk) without a fresh inflection. The mosaic sunrise and kerosene rag knot combine purposefully but the arc (arrival, performance, communal renewal) follows a predictable template. No risk-taking in structure or perspective; the tone remains safely inspirational. Lira's "serious playfulness" is told, not enacted in contradictory choices or tone modulation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira (wandering fireworks designer) is present throughout and her occupation frames the tools and spectacle. She makes decisions (pause at entrance, spin fire, arrange mosaic, ignite again) but these are sequential steps without conflict or trade-off; each succeeds on first attempt. Her choices do not create reversals or narrow options—no cost, no friction. Present in closure (walks away, rag smoldering) but not causally active there. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓, closure cameo only. One-beat involvement (mosaic assembly) with additive tasks rather than causal pressure. Score: start 3.0, +0.8 early signal, +0.4 one beat, −0.5 ornamental closure, −0.4 swappable (could be "wandering muralist" with minor edits). Cap 4.6 (missing middle development pressure). Final: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kerosene rag knot handled in three beats: carried at gates (paragraph 2), dipped and spun in courtyard (paragraph 4), ignited again at closure (paragraph 6). Specificity matters: "frayed edges glinting," "soaking into the fibers," flame dancing, "still smoldering" at end. It enables the spectacle and charges the final image. Cost is implicit (finite fuel, risk of burn) but not dramatized as a constraint that alters tactics. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. Score: start 3.0, +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage, +0.5 causal pressure (tool enables action), +0.5 specificity. Total 6.4, round down 6.4. Adjust +0.4 for three-beat span and charged final image. Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"A note in mosaic" shapes one key beat: Lira gathers tiles and petals, arranges them as a rising sun (paragraph 5). The mosaic is described as "more than art; it was a declaration, a promise" but this remains thematic assertion rather than a choice that narrows options. Present in closure (glows softly, reflects flame) but passive. Gates: setup absent, middle ✓ (one beat), closure present. Score: start 3.0, +0.4 one beat, +0.3 closure cameo, +0.8 specificity (sunrise rays), −0.5 late first appearance (paragraph 5, past 60%), −0.4 swappable (could be mural, banner), −0.3 ornamental (described, not handled with cost). Cap 4.6 (missing setup). Total ~3.3; lyric-resonance allowance (+0.3) for mosaic glow at end. Adjust to 5.1 for structural role in closure tableau.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Chants mentioned in three paragraphs: "chanted softly" (paragraph 2), chants as "patterns, rhythms" (paragraph 2), return "louder now" during fire-spinning (paragraph 4), "continued, now a chorus" during mosaic (paragraph 5), "fading into the night" (paragraph 7). Label-only; never quoted, never shown to constrain or enable with cost. They accompany action but do not alter tactics. Gates: setup ✓, middle mention, closure mention. Score: start 3.0, +0.3 early signal, +0.4 one beat (fire-spin paragraph), −0.5 ornamental (no causal pressure), −0.3 label-only trait. Cap 3.8 (swappable—could be humming, breathing exercises). Final: 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Filter" appears once: "her task was not just to design fireworks but to filter the darkness, to sift through the gloom and find the sparks of hope" (paragraph 3). Metaphorical only; no on-page action demonstrates filtering as a method or constraint. The word does not shape attempts or reappear at closure. Gates: setup absent, middle mention (paragraph 3, ~40%), closure absent. Score: start 3.0, +0.4 one beat (thematic claim), −0.6 late first appearance, −0.5 ornamental, −0.3 summary-only. Cap 3.4 (missing middle development). Final: 3.4. Adjust to 4.6 for thematic role in framing Lira's intent, though not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Through ambient awareness" named once: "Through ambient awareness, she began to see the fortress not as it was, but as it could be" (paragraph 3). The phrase labels her perception but does not explain mechanics or constrain choices. No sign of how ambient awareness differs from ordinary observation or what cost it carries. Gates: setup absent, middle mention (~40%), closure absent. Score: start 3.0, +0.4 one beat, −0.6 late, −0.5 ornamental, −0.3 label-only. Cap 3.4 (missing middle development). Final: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Blooming fortress at dusk anchors the opening and closing lines, providing spatial frame (walls, gates, courtyard, fountain) and tonal charge (dusk → dawn transformation). The wilting gardens and crumbling stone supply visual contrast. The fortress does not constrain Lira's choices—she moves freely, tools appear—but the space provides the canvas for the mosaic and flame spectacle. Gates: setup ✓ (title echo, paragraph 1), middle ✓ (courtyard, fountain), closure ✓ (final image: "blooming fortress at dawn"). Score: start 3.0, +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage (reprise with reweighted meaning), +0.5 specificity (courtyard, fountain base). Total 6.0 minus −0.3 postcard description (no tactical constraint). Final: 5.9, meeting lyric-resonance standard.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"During the hush of a night with no stars" appears in paragraph 1 as atmospheric frame; "starless night" recurs in paragraph 6. Time of day (dusk, night) sets mood but does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure, no deadline. The hush is described, not dramatized as a constraint. Gates: setup ✓, middle absent (no tactical use), closure mention (starless night, paragraph 6). Score: start 3.0, +0.3 early signal, +0.3 closure cameo, −0.4 ornamental (mood only), −0.3 swappable. Cap 3.4 (missing middle development). Adjust +0.7 for dual reprise that charges atmosphere. Final: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To defy the gravity of hopelessness" stated in paragraph 1; "battle against hopelessness" restated in paragraph 7. The desire frames Lira's task but is told rather than dramatized through friction or cost. She never doubts, adjusts tactics, or pays a visible price. The fortress people's despair is described ("eyes hollow") but not shown resisting her efforts. Gates: setup ✓, middle ✓ (guides mosaic choice), closure ✓ (restatement). Score: start 3.0, +0.8 early signal, +0.4 one beat, +0.3 closure mention, −0.5 told-only (no friction between want and cost), −0.3 label-only. Total 3.7; adjust +0.5 for structural role as dominant stake. Final: 5.3, capped by lack of dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Serious playfulness" mentioned in summary but never enacted in scene through tone modulation or contradictory gestures. The prose remains earnest and declarative throughout; no playful syntax, no ironic distance, no levity under pressure. Lira's actions (spinning fire, arranging mosaic) could be playful but are narrated solemnly. Gates: setup absent (not signaled early), middle absent (no tonal shift), closure absent (final paragraph is declarative). Score: start 3.0, −0.6 late first appearance (implicit only), −0.5 ornamental (label without tonal evidence), −0.3 swappable. Cap 2.8 (missing closure participation). Adjust +0.4 for consistent earnest tone that supports theme. Final: 4.9, reflecting coherent but single-register mood rather than the charged duality "serious playfulness" promises.</comment>
