<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness") rather than embodied contradictions. The students remain generic; no individual voice or resistance emerges to test her commitment. The final "victory" arrives without visible cost—she clings to her premise throughout, and no path is foreclosed. Internal conflict is asserted in the opening but never dramatized as simultaneous contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when early enough and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: hums intertwine, the choir grows in depth, the library transforms from silence to resonance. However, the closure lacks felt cost—the applause and hope replace discord, but no visible price or foreclosed option appears on the page. The final paragraph's "true victory lay not in the applause, but in the silence they had replaced" is asserted rather than shown through a decisive image or renunciation. One tightening occurs (the rehearsal ritual deepens), sufficient for this length, but the ending reads as affirmation without trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The velvet library, autumn light, and stained glass anchor the setting early with sensory detail filtered through a reverent POV. The rosette functions as a micro-setting focal point across beats, but spatial choreography of the students and the performance venue remains vague. The library's transformation from "mausoleum of silence" to "living cathedral" is declared rather than shown through changed environmental detail. Autumn recurs but does not constrain a choice or charge the closure image with new meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve vanishing arts by creating harmony—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the dwindling choir and encroaching indifference, and one tightening occurs when Elara instructs students to sing "not to be heard, but to listen." However, no live resistance or complication tests this method; students trust immediately, the hums intertwine without friction, and the performance succeeds without visible cost. Agency is present (Elara's decision to act), but the escalation is textural deepening without a moment where options narrow or a price becomes legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme of unity through subtraction emerges from the rehearsal ritual and is embodied in the rosette's recurring presence. Yet the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "harmony could be found by subtracting the unnecessary" and "the vanishing arts were not lost—they were waiting to be rediscovered." This direct articulation in the closing replaces earned resonance with a stated moral. The rosette's shift from "symbol of loss" to "beacon of hope" is told rather than demonstrated through a charged image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited on Elara with consistent narrative distance. Diction is elevated and uniform ("velvet," "mausoleum," "cathedral"), fitting a literary register but lacking perceptual signature specific to a choir teacher's professional lens. Dialogue is minimal and functional without subtext. The phrase "traveled stillness" appears twice but reads ornamental rather than voice-motivated. No head-hopping, and psychic distance is controlled, but the prose does not modulate rhythm or syntax under emotional pressure—sentence structures remain stately throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean; no loops or pronoun ambiguity. However, several adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "Elara's motivation was clear" followed by a colon restatement; "The library, once a sanctuary" echoed by "It was a place where books were forgotten." Stock phrases accumulate: "hollow silence," "bygone era," "living cathedral." The final two paragraphs contain thesis-like summary ("the true victory," "they were waiting to be rediscovered") that flattens momentum. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff, and elevated diction ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness") drifts from concrete action in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—teacher uses music to counter indifference and hate—is familiar; the transformation occurs through the recurring rosette and the "subtract noise to create harmony" method, which offers a modest angle. However, the emotional arc (declining choir → unified performance → applause) is template-level and could function unchanged with different names and setting. The rosette's symbolic role is established early but its mechanics (carvings glowing, guiding voices) are asserted without grounded world logic. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis; the ending delivers expected uplift without complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara decides to "take action" and leads the rehearsal, shaping the middle beat. She appears in the performance beat holding the rosette, and the final paragraph credits her understanding. However, her choices do not create reversals—students comply immediately, the method succeeds without friction, and no visible cost or foreclosed path results from her decisions. Present across beats but largely observational in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rosette appears in the opening as Elara's talisman, is placed on a velvet cushion during the rehearsal, and reappears cradled in her hands at the performance. Its meaning shifts from "symbol of loss" to "beacon of hope" in the final paragraph. However, this reweighting is told rather than shown through action or image, and the rosette does not constrain a choice or enable tactics—it is held and described but not used. Three beats, closure mention, but ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Vanishing arts" frames Elara's motivation and the opening exposition, recurs in the middle ("the vanishing arts she had dedicated her life to preserving"), and the final paragraph declares "the vanishing arts were not lost." It shapes the dominant stake but does not alter tactics on the page—no scene shows Elara weighing one art form against another or sacrificing a method to preserve the concept. Present across beats with thematic closure linkage, but the concept remains abstract rather than dramatized through specific choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" appears in the opening sentence and colors Elara's initial stance, but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is label-only and does not evolve or conflict with her later confidence. No middle or closure beat revisits this attribute to test or transform it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Denote" is interpreted as signaling or marking importance. The opening states Elara would "denote the importance of her craft, not by adding to the cacophony, but by subtracting noise." This frames the method but does not itself create a turn; the actual action is the rehearsal instruction. The verb is abstract and the action easily swappable with "demonstrate" or "show" without structural change. Present in setup, minimal causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"By subtracting noise" is signaled in the opening ("not by adding to the cacophony, but by subtracting noise") and operationalized in the rehearsal when Elara instructs students to "let go of the noise within themselves" and hum softly. The method is named and demonstrated in one beat, and the final paragraph echoes it ("harmony could be found by subtracting the unnecessary"). However, the mechanics are told rather than tested—no scene shows what noise is removed or what cost that removal imposes. Setup, one functional beat, thematic closure mention, but the method is not pressured or adapted.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is established early with sensory anchors (stained glass, aged parchment, rattling windows, crimson leaves). The library transforms symbolically from "mausoleum of silence" to "living cathedral" and "pulsed with life," shaping the thematic arc. However, the setting does not constrain a tactical choice—Elara could conduct the rehearsal anywhere, and the performance venue is unnamed. Autumn recurs but does not alter decisions. Present across beats with closure resonance, but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" is interpreted as a timeframe spanning emotional transformation. The opening mentions "unlearning hatred," weeks pass between rehearsals, and "one evening" marks the performance. However, the passage of time is vague and does not tighten decisions—no deadline or urgency shapes tactics. The phrase "unlearning hatred" recurs as theme but does not function as a tracked clock. Setup mention, no middle pressure, thematic closure echo, but time does not constrain.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To braid diverse voices into harmony" is stated as Elara's motivation in the opening and demonstrated through the rehearsal when "hums began to intertwine, each voice distinct yet inseparable." The performance beat shows the choir singing with "confidence born of unity." The motivation is consistent and shapes two key beats. However, it is not conflicted—Elara never doubts or sacrifices one aspect of this goal for another, and no friction between the desire and its cost appears on the page. Setup, two functional beats, closure participation, but no dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" appears twice as a descriptor ("traveled stillness" in the opening and final paragraphs) but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through consistent tonal layering. The prose maintains a stately, reverent register throughout without variation in rhythm or cadence to reflect the shift from resignation to hope. Tone is coherent but static; no intensification or break that reweights the ending. Present in setup and closure as label, no middle development.</comment>
