<question>1</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Elara's motivation (preserve small moments) is clearly stated but remains abstract; her "investigation" unfolds through discovery rather than constrained choice. The meeting with Mara provides backstory but no visible tradeoff—Elara listens and documents without internal conflict or cost. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("heart swelling," "profound connection") and the final choice to document is a continuation, not a transformation earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens through description and discovery, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost occurs on the page. Elara begins documenting a locket's history and ends...documenting it, with no foreclosed path or felt price. The "regenerated covenant" remains thematic decoration rather than a stake that narrows options. Orientation is clear early; causality is clean but flat.</comment>

<comment>The jetty setting is vividly rendered (weathered planks, jasmine scent, golden light) and returns at closure, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains a postcard backdrop. The locket as micro-object is handled in multiple beats and charges the investigation, lifting the score slightly. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, avoiding catalog mode.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—preserve the locket's story—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens with cost. Elara faces no opposition, resource limit, or competing desire; the stranger's delivery and Mara's revelation are gifts, not obstacles. No reversal or trade-off narrows options. The resolution (documenting the story) is a continuation of her role, not an earned transformation or renunciation.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Theme (regeneration, enduring promises, small moments) emerges through image and motif rather than statement, and the locket's symbolic role is purposeful. However, the final paragraph edges toward direct thematic summary ("her work was not just about the past—it was about the promise of what could still be") rather than trusting the image to resonate. No banality, but the epiphany feels granted rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual filter (walnut ink, proximate causes, "gently thorough"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("haunted euphoria," "the weight of small moments") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Mara's brief dialogue is functional and naturalistic. The prose maintains distance and voice through turns, with no head-hopping or filter-verb excess.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies and clarity is generally high, but paraphrase loops appear: "preserve the weight of small moments" / "ensure stories...never be lost"; "not just about preservation...about regeneration" / "not just to record but to participate." Template cadence surfaces in parallel constructions ("not just X but Y") across beats. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("structure that had endured," "locket...hum with untold stories"), but density is moderate—several sentences restate the archival mission without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>The walnut-ink archivist, locket photo, and jetty-as-witness offer textural specificity, but the core arc (archivist uncovers a family covenant and documents it) follows a familiar template without transformation or risk. No fresh inflection complicates the discovery; Mara's revelation arrives as convenient exposition. The "regenerated covenant" remains abstract and the emotional trajectory (curiosity → purpose → connection) is predictable. The story commits to its premise but does not deepen or subvert it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>Elara is on the page throughout and her role (archivist) frames all beats, but her choices are minimal—she decides to investigate (off-page), listens to Mara, and begins documenting. These are continuations of her established role, not constrained decisions with visible cost. She is present in closure but not causally active there; the final image is her beginning to document, a task she intended from the start. Setup is early, development is observational, and closure participation is functional but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The locket photo is handled across multiple beats: Elara traces its contours on the bench, shows it to Mara (who identifies her grandparents), and holds it in the final scene. It seeds the investigation and returns in the ending image with reweighted meaning (symbol of enduring promises). However, it does not constrain a choice or create a trade-off; it is a catalyst for discovery, not a source of friction. Setup, development, and closure participation are clear; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>The "regenerated covenant" is explained by Mara as a promise renewed over generations, but it does not shape tactics or narrow options on the page—it remains thematic backdrop. Elara's task (document the story) would be identical without this concept; a simpler "family promise" would serve the same function. It appears in setup (stranger's mention), development (Mara's explanation), and closure (Elara's reflection), but only as exposition, not as a stake or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>2.4</grade>
<comment>"Gently thorough" is used twice as a descriptive label ("worked gently thorough," "with gently thorough care") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. It characterizes Elara's manner but never forces a trade-off (e.g., thoroughness causing delay, or gentleness preventing a necessary confrontation). The trait is ornamental rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>"Steep herself in its history" is mentioned once as Elara's decision and never dramatized on the page as a distinct action—the investigation unfolds through passive discovery (the stranger brings the locket; Mara volunteers the story). It does not drive a turn or redefine options; easily swappable with "investigate" or "research." Setup is present, but development and closure linkage are absent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>2.1</grade>
<comment>"Through proximate causes" is stated once as Elara's method ("to explore through proximate causes, to trace the ripples") but the mechanics never matter on the page. The investigation proceeds through convenient delivery (stranger, Mara) rather than causal tracing. The method is told, not shown, and does not shape attempts or choices. Present in setup only; no development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is vividly rendered and returns in the final image ("blooming jetty at twilight became more than a setting; it was a character...a witness"), reweighting the premise. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it is atmospheric rather than tactical. Setup is strong, closure participation is clear, but development (middle choice shaped by setting) is absent. Lyric reprise lifts the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>2.9</grade>
<comment>"When context changes" is mentioned once by Mara ("when context changes, the covenant adapts") as thematic commentary, but no on-page timeframe tightens decisions or tactics. The story unfolds in a single twilight scene with no live clock or temporal pressure. The element is present as exposition but does not function as a constraint; no setup, development, or closure participation in terms of time-driven stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Elara's motivation "to preserve the weight of small moments" is signaled early, recurs in reflection, and anchors the final beat (she begins documenting with this purpose). However, it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—no moment where preservation competes with another desire or exacts a price. The motivation is told and illustrated but not tested under pressure. Setup and closure participation are clear; friction is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>"Haunted euphoria" is named once and gestured at through contrasts (past whispers, uplifting possibilities, profound connection), but the tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image—the ending is earnest and declarative, not charged with contradictory affect. The tone is more "reverent purpose" than "haunted euphoria." Present in setup as a label; development and closure participation are weak.</comment>
