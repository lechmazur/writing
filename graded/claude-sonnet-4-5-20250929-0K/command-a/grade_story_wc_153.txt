<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to find the moment before deciding") but her interior life reads as abstract and expository rather than embodied. The past regret is told in summary ("someone she had left behind, someone she had never apologized to") without micro-choices or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final act of reading her own letter feels convenient rather than earned by prior pressure, and the resolution ("she felt whole") arrives without visible cost or foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is functional (medium, mangrove, shard) but the drive lens remains ambiguous—moments gesture toward causal (shard guides her), accumulative (singing spirits), and situational (apology timeframe) without committing. The closure unit (reading her own letter, feeling whole) lands as Decisive Change but the cost is asserted rather than shown: no tactic was altered, no relationship state changed on the page, and "no longer a burden" tells the repricing instead of demonstrating it. The shard's mechanics shift without clear rules (it "heals" yet functions as a key, then a map-maker).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth supplies vivid sensory anchors ("roots twisted like ancient fingers," "moonlight pooled like liquid silver") and the shard's glow provides a recurring spatial cue. The hut's fogged windows function as a micro-setting that constrains the reveal of messages. However, the singing spirits remain ornamental—they hum and harmonize but never block a path or force a choice, and spatial choreography within the grove is vague (pedestal appears without prior setup).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—evoking unsent apologies—is signaled early but remains abstract. The single on-page tightening (finding her own letter) arrives late and feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven. The shard enables rather than constrains, and Elara's agency is passive (she follows the path the roots and shard create). No visible cost alters tactics: she carries the shard in, reads the letter, and leaves "whole" without losing or trading anything on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (unspoken apology, regret as bridge) emerges from events but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "every apology, once spoken, becomes a part of the world's harmony" and "all unsent letters would find their way home" state the thesis instead of letting the image resonate. The shard and spirits function as symbolic convenience rather than earning meaning through constraint. The letter's content ("regret, love unspoken, moment lost in fear") abstracts rather than particularizes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a consistent perceptual signature ("skin prickled," "breath caught"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("suffocating and protective," "precipice of an unspoken apology") that reads slightly external to the moment. Filter verbs ("realized," "knew," "felt") cluster in the final third without voice motivation. No dialogue present. The internal voice remains coherent but leans on declarative certainty ("Elara knew its true power") where inference or doubt would sharpen pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("liquid silver," "ancient fingers") but several constructions loop: "Elara's [noun]" opens four sentences, and "the shard" repeats as subject across adjacent beats without variation. The final paragraph summarizes emotional resolution ("she felt whole," "she felt ready") instead of dramatizing it. Paraphrase appears in the opening: "The labyrinth was alive" followed immediately by "the mangrove's embrace." Propulsion is steady but information density drops in the second half where key beats (reading the letter) are told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—medium seeks unsent letters in a magical labyrinth—combines familiar portal-quest and redemption-arc templates without a non-obvious synthesis. The gargoyle shard and singing spirits read as fantasy-kit elements rather than specifics that transform the trope. The turn (protagonist finds her own letter) is foreseeable from the setup. Emotional specificity is limited: "regret, love unspoken, moment lost in fear" could apply to any reconciliation story. No bold risk or unconventional structure heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout but her decisions are reactive: she follows the shard's guidance, presses it to glass, and reads the letter it leads her to. The choice to "break the seal" is declared but not dramatized as a dilemma with cost. She does not create key turns; the labyrinth and shard drive progression. Setup present, middle functional, closure cameo—eligible to ~6.0 under the gate model—but swappability and lack of causal pressure lower the score. Introduced early (+0.5), appears in three beats (+1.4), but ornamental involvement (−0.8) and no visible cost tied to her agency (−0.6) result in mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shard is introduced early (first paragraph), used in three beats (pressed to glass, forms map, envelops with light), and present at closure ("now dull but warm"). Its properties shift (heals, keys, maps) without clear cost or constraint—it enables rather than complicates. Removing it would require rewriting the mechanics, but a similar magical tool could substitute with minor edits. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.0), but swappability (−0.6) and lack of tied cost (−0.4) cap the score below high band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Unsent letters frame the quest and the climax (Elara's own letter), shaping the dominant stake. However, the concept is told more than dramatized: letters appear as condensation messages and a sealed envelope rather than complicating choices. The mechanics (how letters become trapped, why hers is there) remain unexplained. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (messages, final letter) (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.2), but largely ornamental middle (−0.7) and summary-only treatment (−0.5) prevent higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The shard "heals in moonlight" is mentioned in the opening but this property never constrains or enables an on-page action. The moonlight is ambient (pooled, pulsing) yet no choice depends on its presence or absence, and no cost arises from waiting for or lacking it. The trait is swapped for other functions (key, map-maker) without mechanical clarity. Setup present but no middle development or closure participation. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle and 2.8 for missing closure; late ornamental mention (−0.8) and label-only use (−0.6) further lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Evoke" appears as Elara's stated goal ("to evoke what had been buried") and is enacted when the shard reveals messages and she reads the letter, but the mechanics are vague—pressing the shard causes evocation without clear constraint or cost. The action could be replaced with "unlock," "summon," or "reveal" with minimal revision. Setup present (+0.5), two beats (messages, final letter) (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), but swappability (−0.7) and lack of tied cost (−0.5) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Messages appear in condensation on the hut's windows at the midpoint, delivering two key lines ("You were never too late," "Forgiveness is a seed") and forming a map. The method is specific and used in one extended beat, but it does not recur or constrain further choices—Elara follows the map without friction. Setup at midpoint (−0.3), one beat (+0.4), indirect closure linkage via the map (+0.5), but no second use (−0.4) and swappable with other divination methods (−0.6) keep the score mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is introduced early and provides vivid description, but it does not constrain movement—roots "seem to shift" and guide Elara rather than obstruct her. The singing spirits hum and harmonize but never block a path, test her, or force a choice. The grove is the closure location but functions as backdrop. Early signal (+0.6), two locations (labyrinth, grove) (+0.4), closure setting (+0.8), but ornamental pressure (−0.9) and swappability with any magical forest (−0.7) prevent higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the space where an apology waits unspoken" is poetic but abstract—it does not impose a clock or tighten decisions. Elara's journey has no visible time pressure; she wanders, reads, and leaves without urgency or cost tied to duration. The phrase recurs thematically but does not alter tactics. Setup present as metaphor, no middle constraint, no closure clock. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle; ornamental use (−0.8) and no dramatized time cost (−0.5) lower the score further.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to find the moment before deciding" is declared in the second paragraph and drives the quest structure. However, it is told rather than dramatized—no scene shows her wrestling with indecision or paying a cost to access that moment. The climax (reading her letter) enacts the theme but the friction between want and cost is absent on the page. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (stated goal, final letter) (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), but told-only treatment (−0.7) and lack of visible cost (−0.6) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Fierce tenderness" is asserted twice ("with fierce tenderness, Elara broke the seal," "in the fierce tenderness of her heart") but not modulated through pressure—the tone remains uniformly reverent and declarative throughout. The phrase labels the tone rather than embodying it in diction, rhythm, or contradiction. Present at closure but static and told. Setup via label, no middle modulation, closure cameo. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; label-only use (−0.6) and no tonal shift under pressure (−0.5) further reduce the score.</comment>
