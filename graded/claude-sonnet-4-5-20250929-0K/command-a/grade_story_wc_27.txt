<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is declared early ("to discover meaning in the mess") but her interiority leans on stock phrasing—"awkward confidence," "strange energy," "thunderous serenity"—rather than embodied contradiction. The vision sequence tells us what she sees rather than showing micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Her decision to reignite the rebellion emerges from a mystical download rather than dramatized internal conflict; the cost of her new resolve is asserted ("the quiet confidence") but not enacted on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural (the stone-circle hum and stargazing vision layer meaning rather than narrow options causally). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Lira's purpose crystallizes in the vision and she steps toward action—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; we are told she "knew what she had to do" without a visible forfeit or tactical constraint. The hum and vision provide a tightening of focus, meeting the one-deepening threshold for this length, but the final image ("thunderous serenity of the cosmos, the hum of the ancient stones") relies on thematic declaration more than a reweighted particular.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The spaceport repair bay is anchored early with concrete details (cracked concrete, fractured skylights, amber glow, debris-buried stone circle). Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately when Lira kneels and the hum intensifies, narrowing perception. The opera glasses function as micro-setting, transforming her view and thus constraining her next move (she steps out to reignite the rebellion). The stone circle's vibration pressures her stance, meeting the choice-constraint gate for higher scores.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Lira seeks meaning amid the rebellion's lull. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone circle's hum triggers the vision, reweighting her understanding of the rebellion as "a single, shimmering thread" rather than scattered defeat. Agency is attention and realization rather than decision with trade-off; the story tells us her "awkward confidence transform[s] into something steadier" without showing a path foreclosed or a price paid. The escalation is textural (hum intensifies, vision expands) but lacks visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (meaning in small acts, stubborn hope) emerges through the vision sequence but is summarized rather than enacted: "It wasn't in the grand victories… it was in the small acts of courage." The opera glasses and stone circle recur but their thematic weight is declared ("thunderous serenity," "promise") rather than dramatized through choice. The final paragraph moralizes: "She would reignite them, not with weapons or speeches, but with the thunderous serenity of the cosmos"—a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure with thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (stargazer focus, opera-glass frame) but diction drifts into elevated register at peak beats: "a margin of illumination," "thunderous serenity," "the stubborn refusal to let hope die." These phrases feel authorial rather than character-particular. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "not as a lost soul, but as a spark ready to reignite the flame" reads as retrospective narration rather than immediate perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and spatial choreography is clear. Information density is solid in the opening and stone-circle beats. However, the vision sequence leans on abstract high-level descriptors ("vibrant, living constellations," "shimmering thread," "thunderous serenity") rather than concrete particulars. Paraphrase loop in the closing: "thunderous serenity of the cosmos, the hum of the ancient stones, and the quiet confidence" restates the vision's meaning rather than advancing it. The phrase "awkward confidence" appears three times without evolving.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The spaceport-repair-bay setting and opera-glasses heritage provide specificity, but the core arc—lost fighter finds mystical reassurance and resumes mission—follows a familiar template. The stone circle's vision delivers meaning rather than forcing Lira to synthesize it through choices; the turn feels convenient. The final image ("barefoot stargazer who had found her purpose in the margin of daylight") is thematically resonant but relies on recycled motifs rather than a non-obvious synthesis earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and makes one key choice (stepping out to reignite the rebellion), but her decision follows the vision rather than creating the turn. Observation dominates; her agency is receptive (kneeling, raising glasses, lowering them) rather than active until the final exit, which is asserted rather than dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The opera glasses appear in three beats: introduction (paragraph 1), the vision (paragraph 4–5), and the pocket-slip at closure (paragraph 6). Their use transforms Lira's perception (the repair bay dissolves into stars), shaping the middle turn. However, their reweighted meaning at closure is told ("the quiet confidence") rather than shown through a charged final image. The glasses enable but do not constrain a costly choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The rebellion's lull is named early and frames the dominant stake ("a pause that felt less like rest and more like defeat"). It shapes Lira's motivation and reappears at closure when she resolves to reignite the scattered fighters. The concept pressures her internally but does not alter tactics on the page; the vision provides reassurance rather than complicating the lull with new obstacles or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Awkwardly confident" is declared three times but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The trait is label-only; we are told she "carried herself with that strange, awkward confidence" and that it "transform[s] into something steadier," but no beat dramatizes a tradeoff between awkwardness and resolve.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Reignite" is the stated goal and closure action but occurs off-page as intention rather than dramatized turn. Lira steps out "to reignite them" in the final line, but the act itself is future-facing summary. The vision rekindles her own resolve (a pre-ignition), yet the mechanics and cost of reigniting others are not shown. The verb could be swapped for "rally" or "reunite" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The stone circle's hum is signaled in paragraph 3, powers the vision in paragraph 4, and lingers "in her bones like a promise" at closure (paragraph 6). The hum's mechanics matter: vibration triggers the vision, which reweights Lira's understanding. Early seed, middle development, and closure participation are all present. However, the hum delivers meaning rather than imposing a procedural constraint or cost that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The spaceport repair bay is anchored early with concrete details (cracked concrete, fractured skylights, rusted hulks, stone circle). It provides the space for the vision sequence and supplies the stone circle as a resource. The setting pressures Lira's stance (the "lull" is spatialized as abandonment) and the fractured skylights frame the final star-glimpse. Micro-setting (stone circle, opera glasses) alters perception but does not constrain a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Margin of daylight" is named in the opening ("a margin of illumination before dusk fully claimed the sky") and reprised in the final sentence. Time is atmospheric rather than tactical; no clock tightens Lira's decision. The dusk progression provides mood but does not alter her moves or impose urgency. Lyric reprise reweights the frame slightly, but the timeframe remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira's desire "to discover meaning in the mess" is stated in paragraph 2 and dramatized through the vision sequence (paragraphs 4–5), where she perceives the rebellion as a "shimmering thread" and herself as "a spark." The vision answers her question, and her resolve at closure ("she knew what she had to do") follows from that answer. Friction between want and cost is minimal; the vision reassures rather than complicating her motive with new trade-offs. The motivation drives two beats (kneeling, vision, exit) and shapes closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Thunderous serenity" is declared in paragraph 3 ("a thunderous serenity that shook her to her core") and reprised at closure ("the thunderous serenity of the cosmos"). The oxymoron attempts to hold quiet and intensity together, fitting the stone-circle hum and Lira's transformation. However, the tone is asserted through abstract labels rather than modulated in rhythm or image; the final paragraph tells us the tone rather than charging the ending through cadence or sensory pressure.</comment>
