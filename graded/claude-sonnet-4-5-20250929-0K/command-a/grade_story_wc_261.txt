<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("closure seeker" and "to learn to read the stories in scars") is declared but never dramatized through on-page micro-choices under pressure. The telepathic connection with plants and the coffee-ring examination are label-only traits—mentioned but not shown constraining behavior or forcing trade-offs. The final "scars on her soul began to fade" delivers an unearned epiphany via assertion rather than embodied cost. Interiority relies on therapy-speak ("closure," "wounds," "buried truth") without character-particular texture or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story sets "after the anesthesia wore off" as the timeframe but never anchors who, where, or when by ~120 words; Elara's identity, the tower's location, and the causal relationship between anesthesia and memory loss remain vague, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure—sand merging in hourglasses and scars fading—occurs without visible cost; the protagonist does not forfeit, endure, or crystallize a stance that forecloses a path. The drive lens is ambiguous (lyric gestures without accumulative pattern-teaching, causal links that teleport props and abilities), and the "displaced miracle" resolves via discovery rather than protagonist agency. Causality breaks: the ivy "guides" her to a tunnel she somehow didn't know existed in her own tower, the second hourglass appears with no prior setup, and the plants' telepathic voice shifts from "gentle reassurance" to urgent directive without on-page trigger.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass on the sill and the tower's ivy provide concrete anchors, and the basement door and tunnel offer spatial progression. However, the cavern's glowing crystals and the second pedestal materialize without prior spatial logic, and "meteor hush" (the required tone element) never translates into sensory detail or spatial constraint. The setting does not meaningfully limit Elara's choices—she descends, walks, and finds exactly what the plants tell her to find—so it remains descriptive rather than functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara seeking closure and understanding her scars—is declared but never tested by a choice that forecloses an option with visible cost. The plants' telepathic guidance removes agency; Elara follows instructions rather than making pressured decisions. The tunnel sequence offers potential reversals (fragments of past, weeping, scars) but they are summarized visions rather than dramatized obstacles that force trade-offs. The climax (placing the hourglass beside its twin) is a cooperative puzzle-solve without sacrifice, and the resolution ("scars began to fade") is bestowed rather than earned through protagonist action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—healing through confronting buried pain—is stated in the final paragraph ("opened wounds…healed something far greater") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The "displaced miracle" remains an abstract label; its conceptual stakes are asserted but not dramatized. The frosted hourglass recurs but does not reweight meaning between appearances—it glows, merges, and signals completion without thematic friction. Subtext is absent; every revelation (ivy's voice, tunnel memories, cavern miracle) is narrated directly. The ending moralizes ("The scars on her soul began to fade, their stories now complete") instead of offering a resonant image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic—Elara "gazes," "traces," "feels warmth," without character-particular idiom. Diction drifts into prompt-language ("closure seeker," "displaced miracle," "meteor hush") that sits outside the narrative voice. The plants' telepathic voice ("Tunnel. Follow the tunnel.") is the only dialogue-like moment, and it reads functional rather than embodied. Psychic distance remains consistent but uninflected; no compression or modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines: "She didn't know what it meant, but the urgency…left no room for hesitation" echoes the prior sentence's urgency claim without added detail (−0.2). Template cadence in the tunnel sequence: "She saw herself as a child…She saw a younger version…" (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("sanctuary of stillness," "labyrinth of shadows and echoes," "testament to the miracle") and filter-verb stacks ("felt different," "seemed to spiral," "began to shift") dull immediacy in peak beats (−0.5). The closure beat ("The scars on her soul began to fade") abstracts the moment into summary rather than concrete image. Cumulative line-level debt totals ~−1.1, placing the category in the low-5s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—amnesiac protagonist guided by telepathic plants to restore a relic—leans on familiar quest and magical-artifact templates without transformation. "Closure seeker," "displaced miracle," and "accidentally telepathic" read as prompt elements assembled rather than organically synthesized. The coffee-ring examination skill is mentioned once and never used; the anesthesia timeframe and scar-reading motivation do not shape the plot's turns. The twin-hourglass reveal and the glowing cavern arrive as unearned conveniences. No bold risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis; the emotional arc (pain → healing) follows a predictable, tidy path.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is labeled a "closure seeker" early but her choices do not open wounds—she follows plant guidance without friction. The tunnel visions ("weeping over scars") are shown to her, not generated by her decisions. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates fail because she does not create key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears on the sill in the opening, Elara carries it down the tower, and it merges with the twin at the climax. Three beats, early setup, closure participation. However, its mechanics (sand stopped, then flows upward) are asserted without causal grounding, and its "frosted" quality never affects action. Swappable with any magical relic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The "displaced miracle" is a label repeated four times but never defined or dramatized. What is displaced, how, and what restoring it costs Elara on the page remain unclear. It does not shape stakes or tactics; it is the object of a quest summary rather than a driver of pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Telepathy with plants is mentioned in paragraph two, used to guide Elara to the tunnel, and acknowledged in the ending. Setup and payoff gates met. However, the trait has no cost or constraint—it gives her perfect directions without trade-offs, making it a convenience ability rather than a source of pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tunnel is the primary setting for the middle third, houses the memory visions, and leads to the climactic cavern. Setup (door discovered), development (memories encountered), and payoff (cavern reached) gates all met. It is essential to the spatial arc, though its discovery (half-buried door in her own basement) and its endpoint (glowing cavern) are not earned by prior clues.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Coffee-ring examination is mentioned in paragraph two ("had once deciphered the stories") but never performed on the page. The rings "seemed to spiral inward, like a tunnel," a thematic echo, but Elara does not use the method to solve a problem or make a choice. Ornamental; no development or payoff gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The quiet tower at dawn frames the opening and closing paragraphs. Setup and payoff gates met. The tower supplies the basement door and spiral staircase, but it does not constrain Elara's choices—she descends freely and returns without obstacle. The "quiet" and "dawn" qualities are asserted but do not modulate pressure or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wore off" appears in paragraph one and sets memory loss as backstory. It does not track elapsed time, create urgency, or alter tactics. The tower descent and tunnel walk occur in an unspecified duration ("early morning" → return with no clock). No development or payoff gates; timeframe is static context.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To learn to read the stories in scars" is declared in paragraph four but never pursued through on-page action. Elara does not attempt to interpret scars; instead, she follows plant guidance to restore hourglasses. The motivation is told, not dramatized, and does not create friction or trade-offs. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates fail.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is named once ("meteor hush of the early morning") but never embodied through pacing, silence, or sensory restriction. The tone remains uniformly contemplative without modulation under pressure; the climax (hourglass merging, light filling cavern) shifts to warmth and gratitude without tonal cost or friction. Present as a label, not integrated into the story's rhythm or final image.</comment>
