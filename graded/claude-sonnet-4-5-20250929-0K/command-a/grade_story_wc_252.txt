<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to find freedom in embracing her true nature") remains abstract throughout; the "guarded heart" she locked away is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses. The moment she "lets go" and the barrier dissolves reads as passive reception rather than a choice with visible cost—no action is foreclosed, no competing good sacrificed. Embodiment is present in the opening ("calloused hands"), but the climactic beat relies on therapy-speak ("detach—from her fears, her doubts") and the final "combative tenderness" is asserted rather than enacted through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she retrieves her guarded heart and rows back changed), but the cost remains conceptual and un-priced on the page: what path did she foreclose by detaching? The scrimshaw "slips from her fingers" without consequence, the island fades, yet she retains "its essence"—no visible trade-off. The causal link from dream to whale-call to island is present, but the final beat does not narrow options or charge prior material with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is vivid and purposeful: "soft silt," "emerald shafts," "wet sand" ground the opening and middle. The disappearing island constrains the sequence (she must step onto it to access the heart), and the scrimshaw's glow functions as a micro-setting object that enables the barrier's dissolution. The "barrier of water and light" is evocative but remains a static obstacle rather than a setting detail that alters her tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding freedom in her true nature) is signaled early but remains abstract. The one on-page reversal—barrier dissolves when she lets go—is un-priced: no competing option is visibly sacrificed, no tactic altered by the scrimshaw's loss. The island's appearance and the whale's call complicate rather than escalate; Elara's agency at closure is passive (she closes her eyes and releases the object) rather than a forced choice with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (finding freedom by embracing one's guarded self) emerges from the scrimshaw, the disappearing island, and the whale's call. The final image attempts resonance—"combative tenderness" and the island's truth—but the insight is stated rather than enacted: "freedom was found not in escape, but in embracing who she truly was" is a thematic summary that replaces scene pressure. The scrimshaw's return with "essence still with her" gestures at reconfiguration but lacks the specificity to reweight prior material without a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance control is clean. Perceptual signature is present in the opening ("ocean's breath whispered secrets," "calloused hands") and the scrimshaw's "strange warmth." Diction remains consistent, though the climactic beat dips into abstraction ("detach—from her fears, her doubts") that sits uneasily against the prior sensory texture. No head-hopping, and the psychic distance modulates intentionally from close (touch, sight) to reflective at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and opening anchors are strong. The phrase "guarded heart" recurs three times without evolving pressure (ornamental loop). The climactic beat uses scaffold phrasing: "she felt," "she understood then," "she realized"—a stack of filter verbs that dulls immediacy. Sentence variety is present, and no catastrophic loops touch the closure, but the final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The combination of scrimshaw, disappearing island, and whale-call is fresh in assembly, but the emotional arc (retrieving one's guarded heart) is a familiar internal-journey template. The "after violence becomes impossible" timeframe is mentioned once and does not transform the premise. The final insight—freedom through self-acceptance—is earnest but not non-obvious. The piece commits to its premise without bold risk or a turn that redefines prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (wading in, rowing out, stepping onto the island, releasing the scrimshaw) advance the sequence. However, most beats are reactive (following the call, responding to the island's appearance) rather than decisions that alter tactics. The final "let go" is a micro-choice but swappable with any gesture of release. Present in setup, middle, and closure; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The scrimshaw appears in three beats: retrieval (opening), glowing as key (island), and slipping away (closure reprise). Its carvings (waves, stars, whale's tail around a heart) prime the thematic resolution. Removing it would require a different mechanism to unlock the barrier, but the scrimshaw's specific properties (whalebone, pirate relic) do not constrain Elara's tactics—it functions as a magical key rather than an object whose unique history or material matters.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The disappearing island is central: it materializes in response to the whale's call, provides the stage for the climax, and fades after the barrier dissolves. Elara must step onto it to access the guarded heart, and its ephemeral nature charges the closure ("the island was gone, but its truth remained"). The island's specific mechanics—appearing only when "summoned by the right heart"—shape the sequence and the final image's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The attribute "unlocks guarded hearts" is stated as the scrimshaw's function ("a key, one that could unlock the heart"), but no cost or tradeoff is shown. Elara does not wrestle with whether to use it; she simply holds it up and the carvings glow. The trait is ornamental exposition rather than a constraint that shapes her tactics or forecloses an option. Present at closure but not dramatized with friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Detachment is the climactic action: Elara closes her eyes, lets go of the scrimshaw, and the barrier dissolves. It is present in the closure and frames the resolution, but the action is abstract (letting go of fears/doubts/self) and could be replaced by another symbolic gesture (breathing, speaking, touching the barrier) with minor edits. The scrimshaw's physical release is specific, but the "detach" operation is told rather than embodied with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whale's call is signaled early (dream, paragraph 3), guides Elara's rowing (paragraph 4), and directly summons the island (paragraph 5). Its mechanics matter: it is "a sound that didn't belong to any whale she'd ever known" and "from the very depths," cueing the supernatural shift. The call crescendos at closure ("grew louder, a song of acceptance"), charging the final beat. Removing it would break the causal chain from scrimshaw to island.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe anchors the opening and closing (docks, shallows, boat), and the island's "wet sand" and "barrier of water and light" provide tactile grounding. However, the setting does not constrain tactics—Elara rows freely, steps onto the island without obstacle. The seabed's rise is atmospheric rather than a resource or pressure point. Present in setup and closure but does not alter her choices under stress.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after violence becomes impossible" is mentioned once in paragraph 2 ("a treaty that bound even the most ruthless souls") and never tested on the page. It does not tighten Elara's decisions, shape the whale's call, or constrain the island's mechanics. The element is ornamental world-building rather than a force that alters tactics or charges the closure. No setup or middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to find freedom in embracing her true nature") is declared in paragraph 3 and drives her decision to follow the whale's call. At closure she feels "a combative tenderness" and realizes "freedom was found...in embracing who she truly was." The desire shapes the sequence but remains abstract—no visible friction between competing wants (e.g., safety vs. truth) or on-page cost to the choice. Present in setup and closure; functional but not deeply conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The tone is lyrical and tender throughout ("ocean's breath whispered secrets," "strange warmth," "song of acceptance") with one assertion of "combative tenderness" in the final paragraph. Combat or struggle is present in the premise (guarded heart, locked away self) but not in the prose rhythm or sensory texture during the climax. The tone is coherent but static—no modulation under pressure or tonal friction that charges the final image.</comment>
