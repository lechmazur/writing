<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated but never tested by genuine friction—she drifts through the library without contradictory impulses or on-page cost. The "foxglove regret" is named but not embodied in action or choice; her interior reads as abstract poetic narration rather than character-particular perception. No micro-choices narrow options; the song and Vessel appear to guide her without agency or struggle. The final "quiet triumph" is asserted, not earned through a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The drive lens reads accumulative/textural (pattern of echoes, light, and preservation), but no meaningful tightening or cost lands on the page—Elara succeeds without forfeiture, the Vessel glows, the chime shatters without consequence. The ending offers a declarative summary ("their stories alive") rather than a visible or felt reconfiguration. The plot is and-then sequenced (she moves, she finds, she sings, light blooms) with no because/therefore pressure or deepening that changes her stance or options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The opal library and glass orchards are vividly rendered with multi-sensory detail (milky blue, pale green, chiming petals). The wind chime's cracked tube and the Vessel of Echoes are handled across beats and constrain her song at the climax. Spatial choreography is coherent. Setting does not, however, force a tactical choice or cost—Elara moves freely without environmental friction, and the museum opens without resistance. The setting decorates rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserve forgotten names) is signaled early but never narrows options or imposes cost. No on-page reversal or choice alters Elara's path; she follows the melody to the Vessel and sings, and the museum responds with cooperative light. The cracked chime shatters, but this is described as fulfillment, not loss. Escalation is atmospheric (denser clouds, louder echoes) rather than pressure-driven; coincidence (the call, the Vessel's hum) drives all turns. No agency or trade-off is visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme (preservation of the forgotten) emerges from the premise but is restated rather than tested—"preserve what had been lost," "their echoes would never fade." The final paragraph ("thanks to her gently systematic care") moralizes instead of letting image charge meaning. "Foxglove regret" is named yet not dramatized; no friction between preservation and cost. The Vessel and chime return, but their recurrence is symbolic decoration without reweighting prior material through conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited. Diction is consistent but leans toward elevated poeticism ("luminous floor," "shards of moonlight," "river of centuries") that risks register drift from the caretaker's perspective. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Perceptual signature is generic lyricism rather than character-specific filtering—"her heart quickened" and "overwhelming" are stock emotional markers. Elara's narration remains distant and decorative; no micro-modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no grammar or pronoun errors. Rhythm is uniform and lacks sentence-level propulsion—most beats follow subject-verb-modifier structure without variation. Figurative density is high throughout ("crystalline tears," "tapestry of history," "shards of moonlight") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "preserve the sound of forgotten names" / "voices of those whose names had been erased" / "forgotten names." The ending repeats "deserted marvels" and "gently systematic" without added cost. Information density is low; many lines redescribe rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise (library of extinct feelings, wind chime that summons echoes) is imaginative but executed without transformation—Elara encounters no friction, the museum cooperates, and the ending affirms the setup without complication. The story follows a stock arc: caretaker called by mystical signal → discovery → success. "Foxglove regret" and "glass orchards" are ornamental rather than integral. No turn or cost feels inevitable in hindsight; key beats could swap order with minor edits. The piece reads as a response to fantastical prompt elements rather than a singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no key choices—she follows the melody, lifts the Vessel, and sings. Her caretaking is described but not shown constraining tactics. No decision alters the outcome; the museum responds regardless of her agency. Present and functional but swappable with any passive protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The wind chime appears in three beats: setup (cracked tube capable of melody), middle (humming with energy), and closure (shatters as fragments float upward). Its cracked state is noted but does not constrain Elara's song or impose cost—she succeeds despite it. The shattering is described as fulfillment, not loss. The object shapes atmosphere and participates in closure but is not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" frames the museum of extinct feelings and the opal library but remains thematic backdrop rather than active pressure. The artifacts are described as yearning but do not resist or complicate; Elara encounters no deserted obstacle. The concept echoes in the final line but does not change options or constrain tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is mentioned twice (opening, ending) as a label for Elara's routine but never shown enabling or constraining a specific choice. No on-page action demonstrates systematic method versus intuitive response, and no cost arises from this trait. Ornamental descriptor only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Light" appears across multiple beats: the Vessel's glow, light blooming from artifacts, light enveloping Elara, and the Vessel glowing steadily at the end. It signals the museum's awakening and shapes the climax. However, the light is cooperative rather than a contested resource—Elara's song summons it without friction. Present in closure and central to the transformation, but its mechanics are passive.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "echo of a long-forgotten song" calls Elara in the second paragraph and reappears when she sings at the Vessel. The method is signaled early and shapes her path (she follows the echo deeper). At the climax, her song merges with the Vessel's hum, so the method participates in closure. However, the mechanics are abstract—how the song summons or preserves is told, not shown through constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "opal library above clouds" is vividly described (shimmering walls, luminous floor, glass orchards) and houses all action. The setting provides the Vessel and wind chime but does not constrain Elara's movement or force tactical adaptation—she ventures deeper without obstacle. Spatial detail is rich but postcard-descriptive; the environment cooperates rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Museum of extinct feelings" is the threshold Elara crosses and the room where she finds the Vessel. It appears in setup and climax but does not function as a timeframe—no clock, deadline, or temporal pressure tightens her choices. The phrase names a location, not a duration or urgency. Present in two beats but does not serve as a temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To preserve the sound of forgotten names" is stated as Elara's sacred task in the opening and repeated at closure ("preserve what had been lost," "their echoes would never fade"). The motivation is declared but not dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—Elara pursues it without friction or trade-off. The desire shapes her path (she follows the echo, lifts the Vessel, sings) but is not tested by an on-page choice that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret" is named twice (when she feels the pull, at the ending "heavy with foxglove regret") but not embodied in action, perception, or choice. The tone label is literary but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image—Elara also feels "quiet triumph," which undercuts regret. The phrase is ornamental; removing it would not alter emotional arc or stakes.</comment>
