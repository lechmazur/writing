<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is characterized primarily through abstract labels ("pacifist," "steadfast resolve") rather than contradictory impulses in scene. Her emotional progression from "gravity of sorrow" to "gravitationally lighter" to "heart raced" reads as告示板 states rather than embodied struggle. The "stitching" action functions metaphorically but never reveals a micro-choice hierarchy or internal conflict that would make her final step back into the ship feel earned. Therapy-speak intrudes at key beats: "shadow work—confronting the darkest parts of oneself to find the light within" is diagnostic exposition that flattens interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words, meeting the baseline test. The dominant stake—unlocking the dimension for humanity's survival—is declared early, but the closure unit lacks visible cost: Elara completes her stitching, the dimension awakens, and she steps back into her ship "ready to guide humanity" without forfeiting a path or facing a trade-off on the page. The piece gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration ("for the first time in centuries, the future felt possible") but the final image is aspirational rather than reweighted by loss or constraint. The lens reads as loosely Causal with Accumulative/Textural touches (stitching motif, tear shimmer), but the ending does not land a decisive reconfiguration under either.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship hull and console are anchored early, and the dimension's "soil that felt alive" and "ruins" provide sensory grounding. Kwan Yin's Tear functions as both object and micro-setting when placed in the ship's core, constraining the portal-opening sequence. However, the "gravitationally lighter when happy" attribute is told ("the ship felt different—gravitationally lighter") without spatial consequence—no floating tools, altered movements, or tactical adjustments appear. The final image shows Elara stepping "back into her ship," but the recycled hull remains postcard description rather than a constraint that shapes her choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unlock the dimension to save humanity) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options: Elara prepares for years (summary), approaches the anomaly, performs stitching, and succeeds without complication. The dimension's "scars" are observed but do not resist or test her method. "Shadow work" is declared necessary but never dramatized as internal friction—no moment where confronting darkness costs her composure, time, or certainty. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency under pressure; the sequence reads as procedural execution without escalation or visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emergent: "shadow work was not just about confronting darkness—it was about transforming it into something beautiful" and "only compassion could rebuild" are meta-commentary that replace scene pressure. The stitching motif recurs but its symbolic charge is over-explained ("Each stitch was a prayer, a wish for healing"). The final image ("beacon of hope," "new dawn") delivers a tidy moral without ambiguity or felt trade-off. Kwan Yin's Tear as compassion symbol is announced ("a symbol of unwavering compassion") rather than allowed to resonate through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated, prompt-echo register at peak beats: "gravitationally lighter," "shadow work," "ghostly resolve" read as thematic labels rather than Elara's interior lexicon. Perceptual signature is generic—"her fingers instinctively reached," "her heart raced"—with no character-specific idiom. No dialogue appears. The psychic distance stays constant without intentional modulation, and filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew") stack without voice motivation in the final third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The prose is grammatically clean but leans on template cadence and scaffold phrasing. Paraphrase loops appear: "The portal opened with a whisper" followed immediately by "Elara stepped through," then "But as she explored, she realized" (summary without embodied discovery). Stock metaphors recur: "gravity of sorrow," "beacon of hope," "new dawn." The opening is anchored, but the final line ("ready to guide humanity toward a new dawn") is aspirational assertion rather than a charged image. Information density is low in the middle third, where stitching and dimension-awakening are told in general terms rather than specific sensory beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise (last pacifist unlocks dimension via compassion relic and metaphorical stitching) synthesizes familiar SF/fantasy tropes without fresh inflection. "Shadow work" and "Kwan Yin's Tear" function as prompt tokens rather than organically integrated choices. The emotional arc—sorrow to hope via self-confrontation—follows a stock template without specific, non-obvious synthesis. The recycled spaceship and post-extinction timeframe add setting detail but do not transform the undergirding structure. No bold risk heightens stakes; the resolution is safe and affirming.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara's pacifism is declared ("the last pacifist") but never tested by a choice between violence and another path. No on-page decision hinges on this trait; she proceeds methodically without opposition that would force a pacifist calculus. The attribute is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's Tear appears in three beats: Elara grips it early, places it in the ship's core to unlock the portal, and holds it glowing at closure. The core-placement beat shows causal work (creates harmonic resonance), and the final image includes it as a "beacon of hope." However, its properties (compassion essence) are told rather than demonstrated through constraint or trade-off. Setup, development, and closure presence are met; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Shadow work" is named and defined ("confronting the darkest parts of oneself") but remains thematic gloss. No on-page beat shows Elara wrestling with a specific dark impulse or memory that alters her tactics. The concept echoes without constraining choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The "gravitationally lighter when happy" trait is mentioned twice (ship feels lighter, Elara's spirit becomes lighter) but never enables or constrains an action. No floating, movement adjustment, or tactical cost appears. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stitching appears in setup (Elara has "spent years...stitching together fragments"), middle (she stitches the air, guided by tear-shimmer), and ending (final stitch awakens the dimension). The middle beat links stitching to portal unlocking, establishing causal role. However, the mechanics are abstract ("stitched the air," "each stitch was a prayer") without specificity that would make it irreplaceable. Present across beats and shaping closure, but the action could be swapped for another symbolic gesture (weaving, singing) with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs" is mentioned in setup as Elara's guide and again during stitching ("guided by the shimmer of tears on the faded photographs she carried in her mind"). The method is signaled but its mechanics—how shimmer directs stitching—remain vague. It does not constrain attempts or introduce friction. Functional mention without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship (*Eclipsed Dawn*) is anchored early, houses the console and core, and Elara returns to it at closure. The "patched with salvaged metals" and console beep provide texture, and placing the Tear in the core is a middle beat. However, the ship does not constrain choice—Elara faces no resource limit, navigation challenge, or physical barrier tied to its recycled state. It functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Setup and closure presence with one development touch, but swappable with a generic vessel.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the last human is born" and "the last human had been born centuries ago" establish the timeframe as distant future with extinction stakes. However, no ticking clock or temporal constraint tightens Elara's decisions on the page. The centuries-long preparation is summary; the portal approach and unlocking occur without time pressure. Contextual setup without tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To push open a locked dimension" is declared as Elara's mission early and restated at closure ("the locked dimension was not just a gateway to survival"). The goal drives the plot structure (approach, unlock, step through). However, no friction or conflicting want complicates pursuit—Elara proceeds without doubt, competing desire, or visible sacrifice tied to this specific motivation. Functional stake without dramatized internal conflict or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" appears in the final sentence ("With ghostly resolve, Elara stepped back") and the opening establishes somber, contemplative tone through "void," "faint resonance," "gravity of sorrow." The tone is coherent but static—no modulation under pressure. The final image repeats the opening's aspirational mood without reweighting it through cost or loss. Consistent baseline without charge.</comment>
