<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elena's claustrophobia is declared but never meaningfully constrains her choices—she "pauses" once but immediately "presses forward" without cost or tactical adaptation. Her motivation ("stand by the unremembered," debt to Dr. Voss) is told in exposition rather than tested through competing desires or embodied hesitation. The vault sequence offers no micro-choices that reflect her stated fear; she simply "steels herself" and proceeds. Internal contradiction is absent; she operates as a competent agent moving through obstacles rather than a character whose flaw shapes her path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is slow: we don't learn Elena is a spelunker or that the facility is underwater until the second paragraph, and "beneath the crashing waves" reads metaphorical before it registers as literal (−0.4). The lens is ambiguous—causal beats (prying the vault, touching the fleck) coexist with lyric atmosphere ("crashing hush," "phase transition") without a taught pattern or clear dominance at closure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (her claustrophobia "no longer controlled her"), but the cost is abstract: no on-page forfeiture, injury, or tactical price accompanies the shift. The phase-transition sequence bypasses rather than earns resolution—Dr. Voss delivers exposition, the fleck "dims," and Elena emerges "calm" without a visible price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The facility's tidal breathing and flooded chambers are vivid and recurring, and the vault's "colder, thicker" air modulates atmosphere. However, the setting never constrains a meaningful choice: water "rises and falls" but doesn't force a tactical adaptation, and the "crumbling walls" are mentioned but don't impede progress. The fleck on the pedestal charges the climax, satisfying the micro-object allowance. Spatial choreography is vague—Elena "descends deeper" and later the "rising water" guides her "upward," but distances, thresholds, and the labyrinth structure remain abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reaching the codex to understand Dr. Voss's disappearance—is signaled early but never genuinely tightens options. Elena encounters "crumbling walls and flooded chambers" yet no door, collapse, or timing crisis forces a trade-off. The vault door is "rusted shut but not impenetrable," dissolving the obstacle in the same breath. The phase-transition sequence is a gift rather than a test: the fleck "pulls her" into the undersea-cable realm, where Dr. Voss delivers a warning without demanding a choice. Agency is minimal; coincidence (the fleck's power, the water's aid) resolves the journey without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme—respecting the unseen, standing by the unremembered—is stated rather than earned through image or irony. "Some things were meant to remain invisible, and that was okay" is a thesis delivered in the final paragraph, not a resonant reconfiguration arising from prior particulars. The undersea cables function as a conceptual placeholder ("bridges to something older") without dramatized stakes or moral calculus. The fleck's "warning" arrives via exposition from Dr. Voss rather than Elena's embodied realization, and the "crashing hush" motif recurs without shifting meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable with no head-hopping, and the vocabulary ("claustrophobic spelunker," "liminal realm") fits an educated narrator. However, diction is inconsistent: "crashing hush" and "phase transition" feel ornamental rather than character-rooted, and "the unremembered" reads like prompt language rather than Elena's idiom. Psychic distance is mid-range throughout—no modulation under peak stress. Dr. Voss's dialogue ("The cables are more than wires…") is expository rather than goal-driven. Perceptual signature is generic; Elena's noticing is indistinct from a neutral camera.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She had returned… driven by a promise… stood by the unremembered." "The facility's decay mirrored her own internal struggle." "She pressed on… she pressed forward." Figurative language is dense but mixed: "corridors choked with silt and secrets," "veins pulsing with something ancient," "threads of light, alive and moving" pile metaphors without cumulative pressure (−0.6). Stock openers ("As she descended," "Suddenly, the room shifted") and abstract intensifiers ("strange phenomena," "something invisible") dull momentum. Information density is low—many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing knowledge or narrowing options.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—underwater facility, ancient relic, invisible phenomena—is a familiar adventure template without a fresh angle. "Crashing hush" recurs as mood-setting rather than a conceptual hinge. The phase-transition twist arrives late and is explained rather than discovered through choice. The emotional arc (claustrophobia overcome, mentor honored) follows a predictable trajectory with no counter-reading or ironic cost. Elena's transformation is declared ("she felt ready") rather than made inevitable by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elena is the POV and on-page throughout, but her claustrophobia does not constrain a single choice—she pauses once, then "presses forward." The vault sequence (prying the door, touching the fleck) is reactive rather than decision-driven. Introduced early (setup gate met), but no middle or closure choice hinges on her trait. Present but replaceable: a non-claustrophobic character would navigate identically.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fleck is mentioned early ("goal was the Codex margin illuminant gold fleck"), handled at the vault ("reached for it," "seemed to pulse"), and present at closure ("the fleck's glow dimmed"). Three beats: initial goal, vault activation, and fade at return. However, its mechanics (tracking invisible things) are never used on-page by Elena—it "pulls her" passively rather than enabling a choice. Causal role is one-way: it triggers the phase transition, but Elena does not wield or navigate by it. Meets setup, development, and payoff gates but lacks user agency or tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Undersea cables appear in backstory ("Dr. Voss… studying undersea cables"), the phase-transition vision ("threads of light… connecting points"), and Dr. Voss's warning ("The cables are more than wires"). Present across three moments but never constrain Elena's choices—she observes them in the liminal realm without navigating, decoding, or risking contact. Functional but ornamental: the concept frames the mystery without altering tactics or stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Tracks invisible things" is the fleck's stated power, mentioned twice ("supposed power—to track invisible things," "see the unseen"), but Elena never uses it to guide movement or reveal a hidden threat. The phase transition shows her threads of light, yet this is a passive vision, not an active tracking choice. Label-only: the attribute is described but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Return" is signaled early ("She had returned to this place"), motivates the descent (debt to Dr. Voss), and bookends the structure: she emerges "back through the facility" to the surface. Two beats: initial arrival and final ascent. The return frames the journey but is not itself a decision that alters tactics—she came to retrieve the codex and does so. Lyric reprise with modest causal weight: the action provides structure but not a turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Phase transitions" appear late (final third) when "the room shifted… into a phase transition, a space between spaces." The term is used once, descriptively, without prior setup or mechanical cost—Elena is "pulled" rather than choosing to cross. The tidal changes mentioned earlier ("atmosphere shifted with the tidal changes") do not connect causally to the phase-transition moment. Late, ornamental use; swappable with "dimensional rift" or similar. Missing setup and development gates; cap 4.6, further reduced for summary-only presentation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The facility is introduced early ("forgotten research facility… submerged in time"), supplies the vault (locked goal), and its tidal water aids the return ("rising water… became a path"). Three beats: arrival, vault navigation, aided ascent. The labyrinth and flooded chambers are described but never force a detour or resource trade-off—the facility provides obstacles that dissolve on contact. Setup, development, and payoff gates met, but causal pressure is low: setting enables rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Between tidal changes" is mentioned once in exposition ("atmosphere shifted with the tidal changes") and again at the return ("tidal changes now working in her favor"), but no clock, deadline, or urgency is dramatized. Elena does not time her descent, rush against rising water, or adapt tactics to the tide. Present as atmospheric detail but does not tighten decisions. Missing development and closure participation; label-only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Stand by the unremembered" is stated early ("driven by a promise… to stand by the unremembered") and tied to Dr. Voss, reappearing at closure when Elena honors the unseen. Two beats: initial motivation and thematic payoff. However, the desire is never tested—no moment forces Elena to choose between honoring the unremembered and survival, speed, or safety. Told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. Setup and closure gates met; missing middle friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Crashing hush" recurs five times as atmospheric punctuation ("air hung heavy with a crashing hush," "echoing in the crashing hush," "barely audible over the crashing hush," "crashing hush of the waves… like a promise") but does not modulate with pressure or charge the closure image with new meaning. The phrase is vivid yet static—Elena's final "calm" does not inflect the hush differently. Present across the arc but ornamental; tone is declared rather than embodied in syntax or rhythm.</comment>
