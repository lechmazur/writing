<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("emotional numbness," "fractured sense of identity") rather than embodied contradiction. The protagonist remains passive through most beats—Lira hands them swords, the brain responds autonomously—with no micro-choices that reveal competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final merger is declared ("The brain was not a duplicate to be fought over but a part of them to be embraced") rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Therapy-speak pervades peak moments without dramatized embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. The closure unit—shattering the jar and merging with the brain—occurs on the page, but the cost remains abstract: "emotional numbness lifted, replaced by a clarity Kael had never known" tells the change without showing forfeited options or felt price. The "duel" with the brain unfolds through metaphor ("each strike of the swords was a question") without causal pressure or motivated decisions that narrow Kael's tactical options. Lens ambiguity persists: the piece gestures toward Causal (duel structure) but resolves via summary assertion, making the dominant mode unclear at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating dojo is vividly sketched ("suspended between clouds and the endless void") and the brain-in-jar receives concrete sensory detail (glass, amber fluid). However, setting remains decorative: the void, pedestal, and swords do not constrain Kael's choices or provide resources that alter tactics. The dojo walls "seemed to dissolve" without consequence, and spatial choreography during the duel is vague—no tracking of distance, position, or how the brain "responds with movements."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (defeating emotional numbness) is signaled early but never tested on the page through a choice that forecloses an option. The "duel" lacks agency: Kael strikes, the brain mirrors, emotions arrive "in waves" without Kael resisting or adapting tactics. The final act—shattering the jar—is declared decisive but not earned by prior pressure or reversal; no visible trade-off or loss accompanies the merge. Escalation is assertion-based rather than dramatized tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of integration versus fragmentation emerges clearly from the premise, but the final image delivers a stated moral ("The brain was not a duplicate to be fought over but a part of them to be embraced") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. Complementary opposites (yin/yang symbols) and vivification are invoked as labels without concrete pressure. The brain-as-reflection motif could charge the ending but is resolved by summary ("their own story had just begun") instead of particular image or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("traversed the abyss of self," "reclaim their fragmented soul") that exceed embodied urgency. Lira's dialogue ("life cannot exist without death") and Kael's interior voice sound interchangeable, lacking character-specific idiom. The perceptual signature is generic: no selective bias or quirk distinguishes Kael's way of noticing under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent sentences: "emotional rebirth" / "reclaim their fragmented soul"; "the brain is not just an object" / "a piece of you." Template cadence runs through the duel sequence ("Each strike…each parry"). Figurative language stacks without coherence: "dance of complementary opposites," "spark of emotion long dormant," "vivification of their soul"—mixing registers and vehicles. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image. Penalties: paraphrase −0.2, template cadence −0.5, figurative muddle −0.4, total −1.1 in Q7 baseline; artifacts touch closure (summary ending), further −0.6, cumulative −1.7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—literal brain-in-jar custody battle as metaphor for post-ego-death integration—offers conceptual novelty. However, execution leans on stock mystical-dojo and yin-yang imagery without fresh transformation. The "duel" as psychological integration is stated rather than dramatized through specific, non-obvious tactics. "History rewrites itself" outside the dojo is ornamental world-building that does not alter Kael's choices. Emotional resolution follows a predictable arc (numbness → overwhelming waves → clarity) without a turn that feels earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Kael as ego-death survivor is present throughout but makes no key decisions that alter tactics. The protagonist receives swords from Lira, reacts to the brain's autonomous responses, and performs the final shattering without on-page deliberation or trade-off. The attribute is told (backstory labels) rather than shown through choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The brain in jar appears in setup (pedestal description), middle (duel where it "seemed to pulse"), and ending (Kael shatters it). However, it is handled passively: Kael reaches for it once, then it mirrors movements without Kael adapting. The jar's shattering is a plot gesture rather than a causally earned act with visible cost tied to the object's properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Clone custody battle is mentioned in backstory ("custody battle over the brain in a jar had become a metaphor") but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. No legal, ethical, or interpersonal conflict over ownership is dramatized. The concept exists as thematic label rather than driver of escalation or choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" is assigned to Lira ("Her presence alone seemed to slice through pretense") but functions as description, not constraint. Lira's dialogue delivers wisdom; no on-page moment shows this trait enabling or costing a decision. The attribute is told-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Vivify" is invoked explicitly ("to vivify their own spirit," "To vivify is to bring life") and the final merge is labeled "a vivification of their soul." The action appears in dialogue and summary but is not dramatized through specific micro-choices or trade-offs. Easily replaced by "heal," "awaken," or "restore" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Complementary opposites are signaled (yin-yang sword etchings, "dance of complementary opposites") but the method does not shape Kael's approach. The duel's mechanics—how opposites produce integration—remain abstract. The method is thematic label rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo is established early and provides a pedestal for the jar, but the setting does not constrain choices. The void and dissolving walls are atmospheric rather than functional. Spatial details (where Kael stands, distance to pedestal, arena size) remain vague, preventing the setting from pressuring tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"History rewrites itself outside the dojo" is mentioned once in mid-story and has no bearing on Kael's decisions or the dojo's timelessness. The timeframe is ornamental world-building, easily cut without altering plot or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Defeating emotional numbness is stated as motivation in the opening and revisited at closure ("The emotional numbness lifted"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. No on-page moment shows Kael tempted to retreat or forced to choose between numbness and pain with visible cost.</comment>
