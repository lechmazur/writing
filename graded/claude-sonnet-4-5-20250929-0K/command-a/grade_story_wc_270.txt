<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior defaults to stock phrases ("heart lighter than it had been in years") and therapy-speak ("cherished and feared"). Her discovery of plant telepathy and decision to use the embryo lack embodied contradiction—she moves from one declarative stance to another without simultaneous competing impulses. The guard encounter offers a micro-choice, but his instant capitulation removes pressure before it can test her values. The final walk with the embryo feels asserted rather than earned by prior internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is late and cluttered: "insurgent grandmother," "Reconstruction," "new regime," and "uprising" arrive as labels without spatial or temporal anchors by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure—Mara walking away with the cracked embryo—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual only ("what was to come") without a visible forfeiture or trade-off that narrows her options in the present. The causal chain from kite script → embryo alignment → "unsealing" relies on convenience: the guard vanishes, the springs erupt in light, and the vision arrives without obstruction. No meaningful tightening occurs; the plot advances by declaration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs anchor the scene with sensory texture ("steam rose like ghosts," "heat a stark contrast to the cool air"), and the ferns' roots "spreading like a silent army" is a vivid image. However, the setting does not constrain Mara's choices—she decodes the kite and unseals the embryo without the environment imposing cost or altering her tactics. The springs' eruption is spectacle, not pressure. Spatial choreography is clean, but the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges closure) is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unsealing the embryo to restore culture—is signaled early but never faces a credible on-page obstacle. The guard hesitates and steps aside without forcing a trade-off; the unsealing succeeds on first attempt with no cost or complication. The "roar" and "fountain of light" are atmospheric escalation, not pressure escalation. Mara's agency is declarative ("she knew what she had to do") rather than a decision that forecloses a live option. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of tradition evolving through change emerges from the embryo's unsealing and Mara's stance, but it defaults to prompt-like language: "tradition and innovation walked hand in hand," "change was not destruction—it was rebirth." These lines state the thesis rather than dramatizing it through cost. The plants' "whispers" and the kite's script function as symbolic conveniences that solve problems without friction. The final image—Mara walking with the embryo as a "beacon"—asserts hope but does not reweight prior material with a non-obvious answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable third-limited on Mara, and perceptual filters (plants "whispering," the embryo's pulse) are consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats: "exulted," "verdant light," "destiny finally unsealed" clash with the established voice. The guard's single line of dialogue is functional but generic. Mara's interior certainty ("she knew," "she felt") flattens dramatic tension by removing ambiguity. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the prose lacks a distinct rhythmic signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "The embryo was no ordinary relic. It pulsed faintly, as if alive" restates the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle: "She closed her eyes... She straightened... She turned back... She unwrapped it... She knew..." Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation. Stock metaphors ("steam rose like ghosts," "roots spreading like a silent army") reduce specificity. The final paragraph stacks declarations ("The Reconstruction was not just about rebuilding—it was about reimagining") that summarize rather than propel. Line-level clarity is functional, but momentum drags under repetitive stems and scaffold phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—grandmother with plant telepathy decodes a kite to unseal an amber embryo during a regime's reconstruction—combines many elements but does not synthesize them into a non-obvious angle. The "insurgent grandmother" and "accidentally telepathic" traits read as prompt artifacts rather than lived-in choices. The unsealing succeeds without transformation or complication, and the emotional arc (fear → hope) follows a predictable template. The kite's script, the hot springs' eruption, and the plants' approval function as conveniences that solve problems they did not help create. No fresh inflection or risk-taking heightens stakes; the story executes its checklist without surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara (insurgent grandmother) is present throughout and makes the key decision to unseal the embryo, but the choice is uncontested—the guard steps aside, the plants approve, and the unsealing succeeds immediately. Her age and "insurgent" status are labels that do not constrain tactics or generate visible cost. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) and her action drives the plot, but the lack of friction or trade-off caps the score in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The embryo in amber is introduced early (setup), handled twice (Mara carries it, presses it to the kite's tail), and cracks open at closure with glowing light. Its golden hues and pulse are described, and it "unseals" to provide hope. However, it does not constrain Mara's choices or impose cost—it functions as a magic artifact that solves the plot. It meets all three gates and appears in multiple beats, but its causal pressure and irreplaceability are weak; a similar mystical object could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Implanted destiny" as a concept is echoed thematically ("destiny tied to hers," "destiny finally unsealed") but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. Mara's choices are not constrained by competing destinies or a forced path; she acts freely and succeeds without friction. The concept is mentioned but not dramatized with cost or trade-off. It appears in the closure image ("her destiny finally unsealed") but as a label, not a causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Accidental plant telepathy is introduced early and used in two beats: the plants "speak of balance" and later urge calm when the guard appears. The trait enables Mara's confidence but does not impose visible cost—she never misinterprets the plants, faces interference, or sacrifices anything to maintain the connection. The ferns' "silent army" is vivid but ornamental. The trait meets setup and middle gates and contributes to closure mood, but lacks the tradeoff or constraint needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The unsealing action is signaled early, attempted at the climax, and succeeds to open the embryo and generate visions. It defines the plot's major turn and is present in the closure image. However, the action itself is effortless—Mara presses the embryo to the kite's tail, "the unsealing began," and it succeeds without complication or cost. The mechanics are declarative rather than pressured. It meets all three gates and drives the ending, but swappability (a similar ritual could replace it) and lack of friction keep it in the mid-7s rather than higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method—decoding cryptic script on a kite's tail—is introduced early and used at the climax when Mara aligns the script with the embryo. The script is described as "shimmering faintly" and "a code," and she "began to decode it." However, the decoding itself happens off-page; we see her trace symbols but not the puzzle-solving process or any failed attempts. The method shapes the attempt and is present in closure, but the lack of on-page mechanics and the ease of success (no wrong turns, no cost) limit integration. It meets all three gates but remains somewhat ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs are introduced early, provide sensory texture (heat, steam, bubbling), and serve as the location for the unsealing. The springs erupt "in a fountain of light" at the climax, but the eruption is spectacle, not constraint—it does not alter Mara's tactics or impose cost. The setting is present in all three gates but does not pressure choices. It functions as a vivid backdrop rather than a micro-setting that shapes action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Reconstruction timeframe is mentioned ("Since the Reconstruction began," "during the uprising," "the new regime") but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The regime forbids the old temple, yet Mara works uninterrupted at the hot springs. No deadline or temporal pressure is dramatized. The timeframe provides context but does not constrain tactics or alter the stakes on the page. It is present in setup and referenced at closure but remains largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to evolve tradition with intent—is stated early ("Tradition must evolve") and echoed at closure ("change was not destruction—it was rebirth"). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized; Mara faces no on-page conflict between preserving tradition and innovating, no cost for her stance. The guard's brief challenge deflates instantly. The desire is present in all three gates and shapes her goal, but the lack of friction or visible trade-off keeps it in the mid-band.</comment>
