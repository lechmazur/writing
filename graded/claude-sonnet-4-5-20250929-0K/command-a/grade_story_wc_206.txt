<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias remains functionally reactive throughout, his "curiosity" serving as blanket motivation rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The stranger vanishes conveniently, removing relational friction. The final restoration feels declared rather than earned through visible psychological cost—Elias "understood" rather than renounced or transformed on the page. Interior voice converges with narrator voice into elevated fantasy register, flattening POV particularity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The journey to the Covenant collapses into summary ("took him through forests"), voiding causal pressure across the middle. The tether mechanic—"unwound," then "snapped"—supplies a physical task but no tactical cost or failed attempt precedes success. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (light reclaimed, rust recedes) but the cost is conceptual only ("magic spent"), not felt in Elias's present stance or forfeited path. Lens reads Causal with major ellipsis that severs because/therefore linkage in the second half.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The resonance chamber workshop and Covenant gears supply vivid imagery ("gears the size of houses," "fine red dust"). Spatial choreography collapses during the journey and inside the Covenant—no anchoring of Elias's position relative to the suspended box or turning gears. The chip's glow functions atmospherically but does not constrain a micro-choice. Sensory hierarchy (iron, age) appears but does not shift under urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaim the stolen light—is signaled by the stranger's opening request. No on-page reversal or tightening choice occurs; Elias proceeds from curiosity to journey to success without failed attempt or visible trade-off. The coincidental vanishing of the stranger removes interpersonal pressure. Restoration is achieved by turning a key and unwinding thread with no dramatized cost that narrows later options. Agency reads as competence without struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of restoration/balance emerges from action rather than statement. "Mend what isn't torn" recurs and reweights at closure, offering a riddle-answer structure. The chip and tether function symbolically but are introduced via exposition rather than discovery under pressure. The final paragraph edge toward thematic summary ("its story forever etched") undercuts earned resonance. No moral ambiguity or counter-reading persists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias. Voice leans into elevated fantasy register ("gravel and sorrow," "cascading through the chamber like a waterfall of stars") that reads generic rather than character-particular. The stranger's single line of dialogue carries archaic weight but no subtext or evasion. Psychic distance stays consistent. Filter verbs ("felt alive," "understood") appear at key beats, dulling immediacy. No perceptual signature distinct to a repairman's trained attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully in opening and Covenant scenes. Metaphor density spikes without pattern payoff: "river that hummed with secrets," "gears wilting near dishonesty," "waterfall of stars" in quick succession. Paraphrase loop: "its gears wilting near dishonesty, as if it knew the stranger's words were a half-truth" restates within two clauses. Template cadence in journey paragraph: "took him through… Along the way… realized…" compresses transit into list. Stock fantasy register ("sanctuary of ticking gears," "tinkersong wonder") appears without voice motivation. No line-level opacity at closure, limiting deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The music-box repairman premise offers modest freshness. Core fantasy furniture—philosopher's stone fragment, covenant of rust, stolen light—reads derivative without transformation through lived occupational detail or moral calculus. The riddle structure ("mend what isn't torn") promises conceptual payoff but resolves into metaphor rather than dramatized choice. Journey-to-chamber-restore-artifact follows template quest structure unchanged. Tonal confidence ("tinkersong wonder") applied as label does not constitute synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elias is present across all beats. His decision to pursue the journey (middle) and his freeing action at closure (payoff) touch setup, development, and closure gates. However, both choices feel inevitable from curiosity rather than constrained by competing values or visible cost. The occupation (repairman) flavors description but does not supply a tradecraft constraint that alters tactics. Swappable with "scholar" or "tinker" with minor edits. Late limiter: no distinct cost tied to *his* agency; cap 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The chip appears in opening (setup), glows brighter during unwinding (development), and becomes "dull stone" at closure (payoff). All three gates present. However, its function is atmospheric—glowing correlates with progress but does not enable or constrain a choice Elias makes. The chip's properties (philosopher's stone fragment) are told rather than tested. Ornamental involvement across beats: −0.6. Swappability: a "crystal shard" or "enchanted gem" would serve identically; −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The Covenant of Rust is named in the riddle (setup), described as destination (development), and serves as the closure location where gears turn smoother (payoff). All gates present. The concept—time in balance between creation and decay—is explained by the tinker but does not constrain Elias's approach or tactics inside the chamber. Rust receding functions as visual confirmation of success rather than a problem Elias navigates. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Wilts near dishonesty" appears once in the opening beat as description of the box's gears, attributed to the stranger's "half-truth." No middle development or closure reprise. The trait does not constrain Elias's choice or enable a tactic; it colors his suspicion but he proceeds regardless. Single ornamental mention: missing development and payoff gates; cap 2.8. Purely told; no action tied to the wilting.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tether is discovered during repair (setup), traced to the Covenant (development), and snapped at closure (payoff). All three gates present. It drives two beats: discovery prompts the journey; unwinding/snapping completes restoration. Causal role in escalation is moderate—Elias follows rather than wrestles with the tether's resistance. Specificity solid; the tether's invisibility and pulse are distinct. Cost connection weak; no visible price for severing it. Strong setup and payoff lift score; lack of struggle caps at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The riddle "mend what isn't torn" is given in the opening (setup), revisited conceptually during the realization that the box is "tethered" not broken (development), and enacted at closure when Elias frees rather than repairs (payoff). All gates present. The method shapes his final action—freeing vs. fixing—but the mechanics (turning the key, unwinding) are not contested or expensive. The phrase recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, earning lyric-resonance credit. Moderate causal pressure; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The resonance chamber workshop appears in the opening (setup) but does not recur or constrain action during journey or at the Covenant. The Covenant chamber is described vividly (middle and closure) but functions as backdrop; no micro-setting element (tool, surface, access) alters Elias's approach. Spatial choreography inside the Covenant is unclear—Elias "approached" but position relative to suspended box and house-sized gears remains vague. Setup present; development and closure weak. Swappable with generic "ancient chamber."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"In the balance" functions thematically (time/equilibrium) rather than as a ticking clock. The stranger's "midnight" and the opening "clock struck midnight" establish temporal flavor but no urgency that tightens Elias's decisions. No middle or closure beat references elapsed time or a deadline. The balance concept is explained by the tinker and confirmed at closure (gears turning smoother) but does not constrain tactics. Thematic echo only; missing development gate and tactical pressure. Cap 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation—reclaim the stolen light—is given by the stranger (setup), pursued via journey (development), and fulfilled at closure when "the stolen light returned" (payoff). All gates present. However, the desire is externally assigned ("Mend it… and you'll reclaim") rather than arising from Elias's internal conflict. No friction between wanting the light and a competing cost on the page; curiosity suffices. Causal role moderate; closure linkage strong. Lack of internal friction and visible trade-off limits score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" is named once in the Covenant scene, applied as atmospheric label. Tone reads consistently whimsical-elevated ("whispering pines," "melody carried on the wind") but does not modulate under pressure—Elias's discovery of the tether and the journey's warnings receive the same lyric treatment as the resolution. No cadence shift that charges the final image; static mood throughout. Single mention as descriptor; no closure reprise or evolution. Ornamental use: −0.6. Missing development gate: cap 4.6.</comment>
