<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated rather than tested through escalating choices. Her "conflicted nature" toggles between generic impulses ("part of her wanted to turn away... another part yearned") without embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. The final writing moment is declared ("she found her peace") rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on therapy-speak ("her fear of failure, her doubt") and label-only emotions without character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is vague: "feral nexus in mist" at a "forgotten shore" provides no who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure—Elara placing the fragment and beginning to write—lands on the page but the cost is asserted ("the mist lifted... she found her peace") rather than felt through forfeited options or visible trade-offs. Causal linkage is weak: the shell "begins to glow" and the tree appears without prior setup, reading as convenience rather than earned progression. The lens wavers between accumulative (collecting stories) and a late causal turn (placing the shell unlocks peace) without teaching the pattern early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "feral nexus in mist" and "forgotten shore" remain abstract placeholders without spatial grounding or sensory specificity. The glowing tree at the heart of the nexus supplies a symbolic anchor but does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. Micro-setting (the shell fragment) is handled across beats and returns at closure, lifting the score slightly, but the larger environment functions as atmospheric wallpaper rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting and solemnizing hopes—is signaled early but never tested by a live obstacle or trade-off. Elara walks deeper, encounters cameos, and places the shell without escalation or narrowing of options. The ephemeral figures offer no resistance; they simply pass through and leave stories. No on-page reversal, tightening choice, or visible price alters tactics. The final act (writing) is declared resolution without prior pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (hope against erasure) is stated rather than dramatized through specific trade-offs. The shell fragment recurs and the tree image charges the ending, but the final paragraph moralizes ("to ensure they would never be forgotten") instead of letting the image resonate. The cameos function as thematic echoes rather than particulars that test or complicate Elara's stance. No counter-reading or ambiguity; the piece telegraphs its thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and carries a lyric distance appropriate to the accumulative design. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("solemnize," "ephemeral cameo appearance") that reads slightly outside immediate perception. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "realized") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature; Elara's way of noticing is generic rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "the whispers grew louder... longing, despair, triumph, and resignation" repeats conceptually across beats; "conflicted nature" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence: "She paused... She closed her eyes... She felt..." runs across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("wrapped around her like a shawl," "flow like a river") and therapy-speak ("her fear of failure, her doubt") in peak beats reduce specificity. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("her words flowing like a river"), triggering the elevated penalty (−1.0 baseline, −0.3 additional for closure contamination).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—writer collects stories at a mystical nexus—follows a familiar quest-for-inspiration template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The cameos, glowing shell, and tree of stories read as symbolic conveniences rather than irreplaceable particulars. The final turn (placing the shell to unlock peace) is predictable and lacks earned surprise. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece plays it safe in the lyric-fantasy middle ground.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present across all beats and her role as novelist frames the premise, satisfying setup and development gates. However, her "conflicted" nature is stated repeatedly ("her conflicted nature warred within her") without driving a concrete on-page choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The final decision to write is declared rather than tested. Swappable: a painter or musician collecting inspiration would work with minor edits. Late first-third labeling and lack of causal pressure cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shell fragment is handled in beat one (tracing contours), returns when it glows to guide Elara, and is placed among the tree's shells at closure, satisfying all three gates. It constrains one choice (following the glowing path) and charges the final image. However, its "glowing" property is introduced late without prior setup, and the fragment's spiral shape is mentioned but not causally leveraged. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement lift the score; lack of early mechanical signal and moderate swappability (any token object could glow) prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Against the current" is stated as theme ("lives lived against the current," "swim against") and labeled in Elara's internal reflection, but it does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. The stories she collects involve resistance, yet Elara herself faces no current or counterpressure that forces a trade-off. Present across beats as metaphor but not operational; mid-band functional use without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears once in paragraph one ("Elara's mind, ever lucidly watchful, caught fragments") as a label without subsequent action. It does not constrain or enable a choice, alter her perception under pressure, or return. Ornamental mention only; absent from development and closure gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Solemnize" is named as Elara's motivation early ("to solemnize them in her writing") and returns at closure when she writes to "ensure they would never be forgotten." It frames the premise and participates in the ending, satisfying setup and payoff gates. However, the act of solemnizing is declared rather than shown through a concrete on-page ritual or choice with visible cost. The middle lacks a beat where solemnizing creates friction or trade-off. Solid thematic presence but moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Ephemeral cameo appearances" is signaled early (the ghostly woman, soldier, poet, child) and recurs across multiple beats, satisfying setup and development. The cameos deliver stories but do not resist, question, or complicate Elara's goal; they are passive information sources. The method shapes the texture but not the tactics. Present in closure (the voices coalesce) but does not drive the final turn. Functional across beats with moderate specificity; lack of friction or constraint limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "feral nexus in mist" is introduced at the opening and returns at closure ("the nexus stilled"). It provides atmosphere and a path Elara follows, satisfying setup and closure gates. However, the nexus does not constrain her movement or force a tactical choice; she walks unimpeded. The mist thickens and thins for mood without mechanical consequence. The setting is more symbolic stage than functional pressure. Moderate presence without causal leverage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Inside the whisper of closing pages" is metaphorical rather than a tracked clock. No urgency, countdown, or tightening window shapes Elara's choices. Time is vague ("as she walked," "at last") without progression that narrows options. The phrase is poetic but not operational; absent from development and closure as a functional constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To collect the shapes of different hopes" is stated early as Elara's motivation and drives her journey into the nexus, satisfying setup and development gates. She collects stories from cameos and places the shell at closure, aligning action with stated desire. However, the motivation is never conflicted on the page by a competing want or cost; she succeeds without friction. Present and purposeful but lacks the dramatized tension required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Swirling hush" is evoked in the opening line and sustained through "whispers," "mist," and quiet progression, establishing tone early. The tone modulates slightly (whispers grow louder, then the nexus stills) and supports the final image of silence and peace. However, the tone remains largely static—a gentle, mystical register—without sharp tonal turn or charged contrast at closure. Coherent and present across beats; moderate modulation without decisive reweighting.</comment>
