<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to pursue forbidden knowledge") is declared early but never tested by a competing want or cost. Her interiority relies on stock abstractions—"bewildered," "disquiet," "strange clarity"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The woman's late arrival delivers exposition rather than forcing Elara to choose or renounce, and the final "ready to face them" is an assertion of change with no visible forfeiture on the page. Agency remains passive; she receives explanations rather than earning insight through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clear (astral orchard, Elara cataloging anomalies, pistachio cameo found earlier). The plot follows a causal outline—find object, wander, have realization in bathroom, meet keeper—but the bathroom "breakthrough" is told as summary ("she realized") rather than dramatized, and the woman's arrival resolves the mystery through exposition rather than Elara's choice. The ending offers a stance shift ("felt ready") but no visible cost or foreclosed path; the closure reads as setup for a larger journey rather than a decisive change or charged poise within this window. Drive lens appears Causal but ellipsis between beats lacks motivation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The astral orchard is vividly sketched—iridescent petals, whisper gravity, crystalline bathroom with thought-mirrors—and the surreal details cohere tonally. The cameo's shifting etch and the blossoms' hum anchor Elara's physical experience. However, the orchard does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The bathroom setting enables the breakthrough by stated function but is not causally linked to the discovery itself. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding catalog mode.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("pursue forbidden knowledge") is declared but never pressured by opposition, cost, or internal conflict. The middle realization and the woman's arrival add information without narrowing options or raising the price of pursuit. No on-page reversal or tightening forecloses a live path; Elara moves from confusion to "strange clarity" to "surge of purpose" without visible sacrifice or trade-off. The escalation is emotional assertion rather than dramatized pressure that alters tactics or forecloses a choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of "nonlinear inheritance" is explicitly named twice and recurs in the woman's exposition, but it is told rather than enacted through choice or cost. The cameo and orchard function as symbolic conveniences—beautiful mysteries that whisper but do not constrain. The final paragraph moralizes the premise ("no longer just a setting—it was her destiny") instead of letting the image resonate. Thematic Echo penalties apply: prompt-like language ("nonlinear inheritance," "simply complicated") replaces scene pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent—"bewildered curator," "brightened disquiet," "web of possibilities"—but the register feels generic literary rather than character-particular. Elara's perceptual signature is faint; her way of noticing does not distinguish her from a template narrator. The woman's dialogue ("A keeper of stories") and Elara's replies are formal and thesis-adjacent, lacking subtext or idiomatic friction. Psychic distance remains steady, but voice lacks specificity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are evident: "The orchard was no ordinary garden" restates what the opening line already shows; "pursue forbidden knowledge, the kind that whispered" adds synonym churn. Template cadence clusters in the middle ("She paused... she felt... she realized... she murmured"). "Simply complicated" and "brightened disquiet" are forced coinages that read as prompt artifacts rather than voice-motivated compression. Figurative density is high but not always coherent—"blossoming trees and whispering silence" is pleasant but generic. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("mysteries," "destiny," "secrets") without propulsion. Minor −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for register drift into thesis language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The astral orchard and pistachio cameo are fresh images, but the plot—lone curator discovers artifact, meets mysterious guide, learns her destiny—follows a familiar chosen-one template without transformation. "Nonlinear inheritance" and "simply complicated" feel like prompt placeholders rather than discoveries earned through specificity. Emotional beats (bewilderment → clarity → purpose) proceed without friction or surprise. The bathroom-as-epiphany-site is a quirky detail but does not alter the template arc. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 for chosen-one scaffold unearned by lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her wandering frames the narrative, but her choices do not create turns. She observes, pauses, inquires internally, and receives explanations; the woman's arrival and exposition resolve the mystery without Elara altering tactics or forfeiting an option. Setup and development gates are met (curator role, cataloging anomalies), but closure participation is passive listening. Swappable with any "chosen seeker" archetype. Late-paragraph assertion of readiness is not a decision with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo is handled in the opening, clutched during the walk, present at the bathroom realization, and held during the woman's explanation. It appears across four beats and is explicitly called "a key," "a fragment of a story," and "a relic" that encodes legacy. However, its shifting etch and warmth are described rather than causally used; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. It is present in the final paragraph but ornamentally ("held the cameo tightly") rather than reweighted with new cost. Setup, development, and closure gates met; moderate beat involvement but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Nonlinear inheritance" is named explicitly twice and explained by the woman as a civilization's encoded legacy "not as a series of events but as a web of possibilities." It shapes the thematic claim but does not constrain an on-page choice or alter Elara's tactics. The concept is told as a realization and lecture rather than enacted through scene pressure. Setup occurs at midpoint (bathroom), development is summary-only, and closure is thematic claim without visible cost. Functional presence but swappable with any mystery-legacy concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" is used once as a descriptor of the cameo and orchard and echoed in the woman's dialogue ("you see the world as simply complicated"). It functions as a thematic label rather than a trait that constrains or enables action with cost. No on-page choice or tactic is shaped by this attribute; it is ornamental coinage. Setup gate met (early mention), but development and closure participation are absent. Late echo in dialogue does not constitute causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Inquire" appears once as an interior urge ("felt a sudden urge to inquire. Not of the orchard, but of herself") and is immediately answered by the bathroom breakthrough. The action does not drive a major turn; the breakthrough is delivered as summary, and the woman's arrival provides answers rather than forcing Elara to pursue further inquiry with cost. Setup and mid-story presence are met, but the action is easily swappable with "reflect" or "question." Closure participation is absent; the final image asserts readiness without linking to inquire.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The bathroom appears once at midpoint as "a small, crystalline structure... its walls lined with mirrors that reflected not her image, but fragments of her thoughts." Elara's "first philosophical breakthrough" occurs there, linking the method to a key realization. However, the breakthrough is told as summary ("she realized") rather than dramatized with cost, and the method does not recur or shape closure. Setup and development gates met (signaled and used once), but closure participation and causal pressure are absent. Unique but not indispensable; the realization could occur anywhere with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The astral orchard is introduced in the opening line, vividly described (iridescent petals, whisper gravity, blossoms' hum), and present across all beats. Elara's task (cataloging anomalies) and the woman's explanation (civilization thrived here) tie the setting to the plot. The orchard's "breathing" and the bathroom structure at its edge provide sensory texture, and the final image positions it as "her destiny." However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it remains atmospheric. Setup, development, and closure gates met; beat involvement is high but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Between the first and last page" is used once as a metaphorical frame for "nonlinear inheritance... what was discovered, what was unearthed between the first and last page of existence." The phrase does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions or tracks elapsed action. The story unfolds in a continuous present with no clock or deadline. Setup is metaphorical-only, development and closure participation are absent. Ornamental mention without causal function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To pursue forbidden knowledge" is declared early as Elara's clear motivation and echoed by the woman ("you're willing to pursue forbidden knowledge"). It frames her role and is cited as the reason she was chosen. However, the motivation is never tested by a competing want or visible cost; no on-page choice forces her to weigh pursuit against another value. Setup and thematic development are present, but closure involvement is assertion ("felt ready") without friction. The motivation shapes the frame but not a live trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Brightened disquiet" appears once as a descriptor of Elara's emotional shift ("a brightened disquiet that replaced her earlier confusion") and recurs as "disquiet that lingered in her chest." The opening establishes "bewildered" and "unsettling," and the tone attempts a blend of wonder and unease. However, the modulation is asserted rather than enacted through rhythm or imagery. The final image ("ready to face them") resolves disquiet into purpose without retaining tension. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is present but the tonal charge flattens rather than intensifies.</comment>
