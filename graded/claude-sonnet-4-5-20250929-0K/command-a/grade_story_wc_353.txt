<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to create music in a silent world"—is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("symphonically minded," "empathy in motion") without embodied emotion or stakes-driven action. The final "transformation" occurs off-page; we see her step back with trembling hands, but no on-page renunciation or trade-off forecloses a path with visible cost. The hedgehog witness and porcelain insulator presence are observed passively, never forcing a choice that reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly by the opening paragraph. However, the story lacks a meaningful escalation or tightening: Elara begins her work and completes it without reversal, complication, or narrowing of options. The "closure" is asserted—"the sculpture was complete"—but the reader cannot trace a decisive change in stakes, knowledge, or stance; the music was already "there, waiting to be set free" from the start, so no reconfiguration occurs. Accumulative/Textural lens is implied, yet no density increase or pattern break reweights the dominant stake with felt cost at the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is anchored early with sensory specificity ("sunlight filtered through the canopy like whispered secrets"). The hedgehog's uncurling provides a time marker and the ancient alder roots supply spatial detail. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure. The porcelain insulator is handled twice but does not shift spatial options or charge the final image in a way that depends on setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the sculpture's music—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. Elara's method ("analyzing stress cracks") is mentioned, yet no on-page reversal tests her commitment or forces a trade-off. The porcelain insulator "calls to her" and later "amplifies" the music, but these are told effects without dramatized pressure. The ending asserts completion and lingering melody without showing what was risked, lost, or foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—music in silence, voice for the voiceless—is declared in abstract terms rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The porcelain insulator and stress cracks function as token motifs without constraining choice or reweighting meaning at closure. The final paragraph's "reminder that even in stillness, there is motion, and in silence, there is song" reads as an explicit thematic summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("symphonically minded," "empathy in motion") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present in phrases like "listened to the world with her hands," yet interiority relies on therapy-speak labels and stock phrasing ("her heart full") during the closure beat. No dialogue appears on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is adequate, but scaffold and paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "Her method was unique… Her mind was symphonically minded… Her motivation was pure" echoes label-only exposition. The final paragraph contains thematic summary—"music hidden in silence… a symphony of resilience and beauty"—that replaces scene pressure. Figurative language ("whispered secrets," "conducting an orchestra of shadows") appears in most high-pressure beats without variation, and "empathy in motion" recurs as an ungrounded phrase. Template cadence in the opening third ("Her tools were simple… Her work was not about… Her latest project was") adds −0.4; paraphrase loops and thematic tell in the closure beat add −0.6, total −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "tree-song sculptor" premise offers surface novelty, but the execution remains generic: an artist completes a mysterious project with no reversal or specificity tying the stress-crack method to on-page choices. The porcelain insulator's presence is puzzling yet unexploited; removing it would not alter the emotional arc. The hedgehog timeframe and "empathy in motion" concept feel ornamental rather than inevitable. Transformation test fails: swap "sculptor" for "restorer" and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as tree-song sculptor frames the action. However, her choices do not create key turns; she begins her work, continues it, and completes it without complication or cost. The transformation is asserted rather than dramatized through on-page decision. Present in setup and closure but does not drive a middle beat or narrow options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator appears in the first third, is handled mid-story ("She picked it up… placed it carefully on the ground"), and is mentioned at closure ("she had given voice to… the porcelain insulator"). Yet its "amplifying" role is told rather than shown; removing it would not break story logic. Two beats and closure mention, but swappable and ornamental. Caps at 4.6 for no causal middle development; minor positive for closure presence lifts to 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Empathy in motion" is mentioned twice as a label without shaping on-page stakes or altering tactics. It appears as thematic echo rather than a constraint or enabler of action. No cost is tied to this concept; it remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" is a label-only trait mentioned once without constraining or enabling an on-page action with cost. It does not appear in the closure or drive a beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Strum" appears in one sustained beat: "Elara began to strum the wood… with her chisel. Each strike was a note." This action is specific and shapes the middle transformation scene. However, it does not drive a turn or reappear at closure to reweight meaning. One distinct beat with some causal pressure, but swappable (could be "tap" or "carve") without structural loss. Setup late (second third); one beat; no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Analyzing stress cracks in a long-forgotten sculpture" is signaled early ("she analyzed stress cracks… reading them like sheet music") and governs the middle action ("her fingers traced the stress cracks"). The method appears in setup and development but does not shape the closure image or impose visible cost. Two beats, but the mechanics remain vague and do not narrow options. Swappable with "analyzing grain" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "siskin alder grove" is anchored in the opening line and provides atmospheric detail throughout. However, it never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Elara's work would proceed identically in any quiet grove. Setup and descriptive presence across beats, but postcard function. Caps at 4.6 for no middle development that changes options; minor vivid anchoring lifts to 4.3 (still below functional threshold).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the hedgehog uncurls" is explained in the third paragraph and motivates Elara's evening work. However, it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the timeframe is a ritual marker rather than a constraint. Setup present, thematic reprise at closure ("As the hedgehog curled back"), but no middle pressure or cost. Two touches (setup, closure mention) but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To create music in a silent world" is stated explicitly in the second paragraph and frames the entire arc. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs; no on-page friction tests this motivation. Setup, thematic anchor across beats, closure reprise, but label-only. Caps at 4.6 for no middle choice friction; thematic presence across structure lifts slightly to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Intensely quiet" is signaled in the opening phrase and sustained through diction ("faint tapping," "held its breath," "no longer silent") to the final line. Tone modulates subtly as the sculpture transforms, and the closing "the music was there, if only one knew how to listen" charges the final image. Setup, coherent modulation, and closure linkage present; tone does purposeful work without radical shift. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage clear.</comment>
