<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to "teach dust to tell stories" is established, but her interior life remains shallow—she experiences excitement and determination without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The decision to "cloak herself in mystery" and transcribe the lyrics lacks meaningful cost or competing impulses; she simply proceeds methodically. Her copyist profession is mentioned but never constrains a choice or reveals character-specific perception under pressure. No micro-choices foreclose paths or reveal hierarchy of values at the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (Clara, attic room, after midnight) within the first paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: radio glow spreads, song fragments accumulate, room transforms from sanctuary to threshold. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the "threshold" metaphor and Clara's resolve, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—she stands with "quiet determination" without visible forfeiture or altered options. The "thistled calm" giving way to determination is told, not shown through action or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove is vividly detailed (crumbling manuscripts, aged paper, damp wood, mist-clad windows), and the radio's spreading luminescence creates atmospheric charge. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes Clara's choices or tactics. The desk, parchment, and radio are handled, but their presence does not alter options at closure. The "threshold" claim in the final third remains metaphorical rather than spatial, missing the chance to let architecture constrain or enable the closing beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrecting lost stories—is signaled early, but pressure never meaningfully tightens. The pirate broadcast arrives as gift rather than obstacle; Clara "frantically" transcribes but faces no resistance, competing demands, or cost. The song slows "as if to give her time," removing friction. Her closing resolve ("teach the dust to tell stories, one note, one word, at a time") is asserted without a preceding choice that narrows options or tests commitment. No reversal or deepening that changes knowledge or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of story resurrection emerges through concrete images (dust, radio, mist), and the "story famine" premise invites reflection on narrative loss. However, the closing "threshold" and "teach dust to tell stories" rely on restated abstraction rather than a non-literal answer. The pirate broadcast as mysterious gift edges toward convenient symbolism without genuine thematic friction. The final image—Clara standing with quill forgotten—gestures at transformation but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or invite counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Clara's perceptual filter ("diligent," "meticulous") colors early description, but voice flattens under pressure—no rhythmic compression or sentence-level reflection of excitement claimed in the text. Phrases like "her heart quickening," "her mind racing" rely on stock bodily clichés rather than character-specific perception. The prose remains uniform across calm transcription and purported discovery, missing the chance to modulate psychic distance or syntax when stakes rise. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and grammar is clean, but several paraphrase loops appear: "The radio, an old relic... had been her companion" restates the setup without adding pressure; "her resolve firm" echoes "quiet determination" two sentences later. Template cadence in the broadcast paragraph: "She grabbed... her hand moving... The song seemed... She reached out... She sat back" stacks similar constructions. Purple phrasing ("ember alcove in mist," "thistled calm") appears without pattern-teaching or payoff. Minimal propulsion; many sentences describe rather than advance causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "story famine" and pirate broadcast premise offers a fresh angle, but execution leans on familiar tropes: isolated artist in attic sanctuary, mysterious transmission as divine gift, resolve to resurrect lost art. The "teach dust to tell stories" formulation is poetic but abstract, lacking the specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus that would transform the template. No bold structural risk; the arc follows a predictable discovery-to-determination path. The shortwave radio and copyist pairing is specific but underexploited—neither occupation nor technology constrains tactics or deepens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Clara as diligent orchestra copyist is named and described transcribing a symphony in the opening, satisfying setup. Her profession colors the setting (parchment, quill, manuscripts) but does not constrain a middle choice—transcription pauses when the radio activates, and her copyist skills do not shape how she captures the lyrics. At closure she stands with "quill and parchment forgotten," marking a shift away from the role rather than leveraging it. Present across beats but functionally replaceable with "artist" or "scholar" without altering causality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shortwave radio dial glow appears in the opening ("faint glow"), intensifies mid-scene ("pulsed with unusual intensity," "spreading... casting a faint luminescence"), and is noted as "dark and silent" at closure, establishing a three-beat arc. The glow's spread creates atmospheric charge and Clara touches the dial, feeling warmth, but this does not narrow options or enable a tactic under pressure. The final "dark and silent" state is observed but not causally active in her closing resolve. Strong presence, but the glow remains more symbolic than mechanically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Pirate broadcast is named mid-scene when Clara adjusts the dial and a melody emerges "a clandestine transmission that seemed to defy the silence of the story famine." It provides the lyrics Clara transcribes and ends abruptly, leaving static. The broadcast's arrival frames her excitement and notebook work, shaping one key turn (from methodical work to frantic capture). However, it functions as gift rather than obstacle—no cost, no competing frequency, no risk. Present in closure only via the now-silent radio; the concept does not redefine options at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" applies to the radio's dial, described as "secretly luminous face" in the opening and later as spreading glow. The secrecy is not dramatized—no moment where concealment matters or where revelation alters tactics. The luminescence enables Clara to notice the radio's unusual pulse and provides atmospheric charge, but no on-page action is constrained or enabled by the attribute's hidden nature. Label-only secrecy; the glow's visibility is what matters, and that could function without the "secret" modifier.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Cloak" appears twice: the song's mystery "cloak[s] itself" mid-scene, and Clara resolves to "cloak herself in the mystery of the song" near closure. Both uses are metaphorical—no physical garment, no concealment that alters tactics or enables movement. The action does not create a key turn; it describes Clara's interpretive stance. Easily swappable with "immerse," "wrap," or "envelop" without structural impact. Present but ornamental, functioning as theme claim rather than dramatized choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elusive song lyrics are signaled when the melody emerges with "whispered" words "in a language she couldn't quite place" and "fragmented" lines. Clara frantically transcribes them into her notebook, and the lyrics speak of "forgotten worlds and lost tales." The elusiveness (fragmented, unclear language) provides mild friction during capture but does not shape a second attempt or force adaptation. The method appears mid-scene and is noted at closure ("piece together the lyrics"), but mechanics remain vague—no demonstration of how fragments will teach dust or what Clara must overcome to decode them.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Ember alcove in mist" is Clara's name for her room, introduced early with vivid detail (attic, shelves of manuscripts, scent of aged paper and damp wood, mist on windows). The setting establishes atmosphere and in the final paragraph is declared "more than just a room—it was a threshold." However, the room never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome; all action (listening, transcribing, standing) could occur in any quiet workspace. The "threshold" claim is metaphorical and arrives late without causal grounding. Micro-setting option not leveraged; no tool or body constraint alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the story famine" is named in the opening as backstory context: "since the story famine, a time when tales and legends had vanished from the world, leaving behind only silence and dust." The famine motivates Clara's work but does not impose a ticking clock or shape present tactics. The current scene unfolds "after midnight" with "dawn approach[ing]," marking elapsed time but without urgency—the broadcast's timing is coincidental, and Clara's transcription is unrushed. The famine is setup only; it does not tighten decisions within the dramatized window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Clara's motivation "to teach dust to tell stories" is introduced early as her "simple yet profound" drive and echoed at closure when she resolves to proceed "one note, one word, at a time." The phrasing is poetic but abstract; no on-page friction tests this desire against competing costs (time, risk, doubt). Her excitement upon hearing the broadcast aligns with the goal without complication. The motivation is present and consistent but told rather than dramatized through choice under pressure. No moment where wanting to resurrect stories conflicts with another need or forces a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" appears once in the final paragraph: "The thistled calm of the night had given way to a quiet determination." The phrase is evocative but arrives late and remains unexplained—no thorns or prickly tension dramatized earlier to establish the "thistled" quality. Tone throughout reads as atmospheric and meditative (mist, faint glow, methodical work) without modulation under pressure; Clara's "excitement" and "heart quickening" are asserted but prose rhythm stays uniform. The single mention does not teach a pattern or charge the final image with reweighted meaning.</comment>
