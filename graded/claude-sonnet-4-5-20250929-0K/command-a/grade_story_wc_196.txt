<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated clearly but rarely tested under pressure. Her "broken-hearted" state and emancipation history are told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices with visible cost. The final "lighter heart" resolves her brokenness too tidily without dramatized struggle—she finds purpose through archival detective work but no choice forecloses a path or reveals a hierarchy of values. Interior voice leans on summary ("she felt a kinship") rather than specific perception under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who and where early, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, the closure is a summary statement of achieved purpose ("She had found her purpose") rather than an on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost. The final paragraph tells us Elara's heart is "lighter" and explicitly moralizes the theme ("a story of the present, of the small kindnesses") instead of landing an image that reweights prior material. Under a Causal lens, the button→letter→draft sequence progresses but does not narrow options or impose a felt price at closure. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elara loses or forecloses by choosing this path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The foster care file room is established early with vivid detail (sagging shelves, old paper smell, dusty window light). The button and dust patterns supply concrete micro-setting that guides Elara's method and constrains her approach. However, spatial choreography is minimal—Elara moves from shelf to desk but the room does not pressure a choice or evolve causally. The setting functions as backdrop rather than obstacle, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake emerges: Elara's quest to unfurl Liam's story and mend her own brokenness. The button discovery initiates a tightening (cross-referencing the folder), but escalation is limited to information-gathering without opposition or trade-offs. No reversal narrows options; the letter is "never sent" but that fact does not complicate Elara's choices on the page. Agency at closure is a decision to "draft a narrative," yet the cost is abstract—what does she forfeit or risk by committing to this project? The story tells us it's meaningful but does not dramatize a price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of small kindnesses and humanity in bureaucracy is stated explicitly multiple times ("to magnify small kindnesses," "meaning in the fragments"). The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "a story of the present, of the small kindnesses that could bridge generations." This replaces scene pressure with thesis-statement. The dust-as-storyteller conceit is poetic but underdeveloped—it does not constrain Elara's choices or reweight prior material through a non-literal final image. Thematic Echo penalty applies (−0.6): the closing lines articulate the story's thesis in prompt-like language instead of earning resonance through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature (archival lens, dust-reading, emotional investment in files) is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sanctuary of unknown histories," "shimmer, as if approving") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Interior voice leans on summary and filter verbs ("she realized," "she imagined," "she felt") where free indirect style could sharpen immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance is consistent but not tightly calibrated to emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean with moderate information density. Opening paragraph establishes voice and stakes effectively. However, paraphrase loops appear: "a story of loss—it was a story of hope" and "not just a story of the past; it was a story of the present" repeat structure without added pressure. Template cadence surfaces in the third paragraph ("She brought out… She had learned… She decided then…"). The final paragraph stacks summary statements that tell outcome rather than dramatize: "lighter than it had been in years," "found her purpose," "not in the files themselves, but in the lives they represented." Modest line-level deduction (−0.6) for loops and scaffold; the closure beat is heavily summarized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The archival-discovery frame is familiar; the execution does not transform it through unexpected turns or specific lived detail. The button-as-clue and dust-reading method are apt but not developed into a fresh angle—Elara's "unconventional" method is mentioned but not shown constraining her choices in novel ways. Emotional arc (brokenness → purpose) follows a predictable template. The story gestures toward originality with dust patterns and the emancipation backstory but does not synthesize these into an inevitable, non-obvious closure. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies (−0.8): archival mystery + healing-through-discovery is a widely used template, and the story does not sufficiently particularize it through world logic or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her archival work drives the sequence, but her choices are observational and summative rather than pressure-tested. She "decided then that she would unfurl this history" and "began to draft a narrative," yet these are stated intentions without on-page cost or visible tradeoffs. Setup clear, middle use functional, but closure participation is summary rather than decision-under-pressure. Two-gate fulfillment caps eligibility near 6.0; swappability (any archivist could fill this role with minor edits) and summary-only final beat lower the score. Late-element and resolution-without-creation penalties do not apply, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The button appears in beat one (discovery on shelf), beat two (examination under magnifying glass revealing "L. Hayes, 7th Infantry"), and is mentioned in the resolution as a "relic of love." Three distinct beats with evolving meaning: clue → evidence → thematic symbol. Setup strong (+0.8), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage present but not causally active in the final image (+0.4). Swappability moderate: any war relic could substitute with edits (−0.5). Total integration signals push toward mid-7s, but the final mention is ornamental rather than charged, preventing higher band entry. All three gates met; score reflects solid integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Unknown histories" frames the setting (file room of lost children) and Elara's motivation (unfurl Liam's story). Setup clear in opening paragraphs. Middle beat: cross-referencing folder contents to uncover Clara's untold story shows the concept shaping tactics. Closure: "sanctuary of unknown histories" is named but does not reweight—it remains thematic backdrop. Two gates met (setup, middle); closure participation is label-only. Causal pressure moderate (+0.7); the concept enables investigation but does not narrow options or impose cost. Ornamental final use (−0.5) and summary treatment (−0.4) keep the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" is stated in paragraph two as an established trait but never constrains or enables an on-page action. Elara's hopefulness is told ("she had always been tactfully hopeful") yet no scene demonstrates her choosing tact over bluntness or hope over despair with visible cost. Setup present (first third mention), but middle development and closure participation are absent. Label-only (−0.3), no beat involvement beyond mention, no causal pressure. Missing middle and closure gates cap at 2.8; the mention in setup lifts slightly but the trait remains inert.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unfurl" appears as Elara's decision verb ("she would unfurl this history") and recurs in closure ("to find meaning in the fragments"). Setup signal moderate (mentioned mid-story as intention), middle beat shows her drafting narrative to unfurl the story, closure references the action thematically. Two gates met (middle, closure); setup is weaker (action named as plan, not dramatized early). The action is swappable—"reveal," "uncover," "reconstruct" would serve equally (−0.6). Summary treatment (−0.4): the unfurling is recounted, not shown on the page with specific acts. Causal pressure weak; the action does not force tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Through accumulated dust patterns" is introduced in paragraph three as Elara's method, explained with specific technique (magnifying glass, soft brush), and shown revealing the button's inscription. Setup (+0.8), one distinct beat of use (dust-reading yields "L. Hayes, 7th Infantry") (+0.4), closure mention (dust "seemed to shimmer, as if approving") ties the method to the ending image (+0.5). Two gates met (setup, closure); middle development solid with one functional beat. Swappability moderate: forensic techniques could replace dust-reading with edits (−0.5). The method shapes one attempt but does not impose cost or narrow later options, capping causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The foster care file room is established in the opening sentence, provides the button discovery (shelf corner), supplies the folder contents, and remains the single location throughout. Setup strong (+0.8), two beats (discovery, cross-reference work at desk) (+0.9), closure transforms the room from "place of sorrow" to "sanctuary" (+0.7). All three gates met; specificity high (sagging shelves, dusty window, tarnished button location) (+0.6). However, the setting does not constrain a choice—Elara's investigation could occur in any archive with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability (−0.4). Causal pressure moderate: the room supplies resources but does not force tradeoffs. Strong setup and thematic reprise elevate the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the emancipation" anchors Elara's past (legal severance from foster system) but does not tighten present decisions or tactics. Setup present (paragraph one mentions emancipation), but the timeframe does not pressure middle choices or shape the ending. No live clock or deadline; the "after" is backstory context rather than active constraint. Missing middle and closure gates cap at 2.8. The mention provides character context, lifting slightly above pure ornament, but the timeframe remains inert—any post-event marker could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To magnify small kindnesses" is stated as Elara's motivation in paragraph two and recurs in closure ("small kindnesses that could bridge generations"). Setup clear, closure echo present. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized: no scene shows Elara choosing kindness over efficiency or facing friction between her desire and cost. Two gates met (setup, closure) allow eligibility near 6.0, but label-only treatment (−0.3) and lack of on-page tradeoff lower the score. The motivation frames her goal but does not constrain a choice with visible cost, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Examined unknown" tone is coherent: the prose maintains a measured, archival voice examining Clara and Liam's lost story. Setup establishes the reflective, investigative mood. The tone does not modulate sharply under pressure—discovery beats (button, letter) maintain the same contemplative register without urgency shifts. Closure sustains the tone (dust shimmering, Elara smiling) and the final image carries quiet approval, reweighting the opening sorrow. Two gates met (setup, closure); middle consistency solid. However, the tone is static rather than dynamic—no cadence shift or pressure-driven tightening—and the ending's tone of achieved serenity does not charge the final image with tension or cost, capping the score mid-band.</comment>
