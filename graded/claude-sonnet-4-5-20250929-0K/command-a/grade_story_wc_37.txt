<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to rekindle a dying realm") but never tested by a concrete on-page choice that incurs visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing: "her breath catching," "her purpose fulfilled," "her hands steady"—label-only emotion without embodied contradiction. The "scattered memory keeper" trait functions as ornament; memories coalesce conveniently without dramatized struggle that forecloses options. No credible internal conflict or flawed choice shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure gesture—Elara sings, dawn breaks, communities reunite—occurs on the page, but cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no visible forfeiture, trade-off, or renunciation that alters her state. The mirror-world journey offers scene variety but no meaningful causal tightening; each song fragment is retrieved without resistance. The ending summarizes fulfillment ("her task was complete") instead of showing a before/after pressure shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse and mirror world are vividly sketched ("fruit that glowed like captured dawns," "bark etched with lyrics that shimmered like mica"). Spatial choreography is coherent across the threshold and the stream. However, the environment does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics; Elara wanders freely, and each location yields its song fragment on cue. The mica window appears in beats but functions as scenic description rather than a tool whose properties shape outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rekindle the realm—is signaled early but never escalates under pressure. Elara's song-gathering proceeds without opposition, failed attempts, or visible cost; the "final thread eluded her" is resolved in the same paragraph by sitting and remembering. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The mirror world "whispers" guidance, and the greenhouse transforms off Elara's voice alone—coincidence completes the task without protagonist agency that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>A coherent theme of memory and communal unity emerges through the songs and woven-dawn imagery. The mica window and swaddle motif recur but without reweighting meaning at closure; each mention reinforces the premise rather than complicating it. The ending moralizes directly: "scattered memory keeper had become the weaver," "their threads weaving a tapestry of light and unity"—thematic Echo replaces earned resonance. No non-literal final image invites reflection; the resolution is stated rather than implied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and the prose carries a mildly lyric texture ("shrouded in an endless night," "swaddled the realm in warmth"). However, diction slips into stock fantasy register ("Her motivation burned brighter now," "her voice rising with the dawn") without character-particular idiom. Elara's perceptual signature is generic; her way of noticing does not shift under stress. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Clarity is maintained, and the prose moves without major opacity. Multiple paraphrase loops weaken density: "answer lay in the forgotten songs" / "songs had been lost"; "mirror world whispered to her" / "urging her to remember"; "no longer a tomb but a cradle" / "ready to birth a new era." Template cadence in the final paragraph ("her hands steady, her purpose fulfilled") and stock metaphor strings ("threads weaving a tapestry of light") dull the closure image. Filter-verb reliance ("felt a surge," "felt the pull") reduces immediacy in peak beats. Artifacts touch the final third; baseline −1.0 and disallow 9+ globally per patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise—memory keeper restores songs to rekindle a dying realm—follows a recognizable chosen-one retrieval template without fresh inflection. The mica portal, mirror orchard, and song-gathering beats offer vivid detail but no transformation of the trope; the emotional arc (scattered → unified) would function identically with different proper nouns. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis; the resolution is telegraphed and emotionally tidy. Surface novelty (alchemical greenhouse, woven dawns) does not alter the underlying shape.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as "scattered memory keeper" is labeled, but her scattered nature does not constrain a single on-page choice with cost. Memories coalesce conveniently when the plot requires; no decision-point turns on her trait. She observes, wanders, and sings without strategic friction. Present in closure but ornamental—the label could be swapped for "lost wanderer" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mica window appears in three beats: Elara presses it to the glass (entry), holds it in her lap (midpoint reflection), and steps back through it (exit). Each use advances location but does not narrow options or impose cost. The object's properties (portal function) are consistent but generic; any threshold device could replace it. Present at closure but not causally active—no reweighted meaning charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" appears as metaphor and setting detail ("sanctuary of woven dawns," "essence of the dawn itself," "swaddled in warmth") but does not shape a single stake or tactic on the page. The concept is echoed thematically without altering options or imposing constraint. Ornamental throughout; the story's logic would hold if "perpetual twilight" or "fading light" replaced it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Knits communities together" is described as outcome ("communities … felt the pull of the song, their hearts beating in unison") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The attribute is asserted in summary at closure rather than tested mid-scene. No visible trade-off between individual and communal goals; the knitting happens off-stage as mood shift. Label-only mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Swaddle" recurs in two beats: "swaddled the realm in warmth" (backstory memory) and "communities swaddled in the warmth of shared memory" (closure). The action frames the thematic arc but does not drive a major turn; Elara's song-recovery would proceed identically without this verb. Purposeful early-seed → final reprise reweights the dominant stake modestly, reaching mid-band via lyric resonance allowance, but the action itself is swappable with "wrap" or "envelop."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Forgotten songs" are signaled in paragraph one, shape the middle quest (three song fragments recovered from tree, stream, and memory), and culminate in the dawn-breaking finale when Elara sings. The method's mechanics matter: each fragment requires a distinct source, and the final lullaby "came to her—not in words, but in feeling," altering her approach. Present across setup, development, and closure with causal involvement in two beats. Specificity is moderate; "lost melodies" could substitute with edits, capping upper range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night" anchors the opening and closing frames and provides the mirror-world contrast (dormant glass / thriving orchard). The setting supplies spatial variety but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elara moves freely, and each location yields its resource on cue. The greenhouse's transformation (glass walls dulled → light piercing) charges the final image with atmospheric shift. Present across all three gates, but pressure contribution is scenic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"In the mirror world" frames the second and third paragraphs and provides the journey's spatial logic. Timeframe is treated as elastic; no urgency or ticking deadline shapes Elara's choices. The mirror realm's "time and memory intertwined" is asserted but not dramatized through constraint. Present in setup and middle, absent from closure pressure—Elara steps back through the mica window, but the return does not hinge on temporal cost. Functional but replaceable; "in the shadow realm" would serve identically.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To rekindle a dying realm" is declared in paragraph one, referenced at midpoint ("Her motivation burned brighter now"), and fulfilled in the closing lines ("The dying realm was rekindled"). The desire is told rather than dramatized through friction; no on-page choice tests the cost of rekindling versus another want. Present across all three gates but never conflicted with a visible trade-off. Summary-only use and lack of embodied tension lower the score despite structural presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Bound release" appears twice as phrase ("bound release, urging her to remember," "her actions a bound release for a world long trapped") and tonally informs the journey from constriction (endless night, scattered memories) to liberation (dawn, unified song). Tone modulates from stillness to warmth but remains declarative rather than charged. The final image asserts release without visceral cost or ambiguity. Present in setup and closure; coherent but not indispensable—"gradual awakening" or "slow unfurling" could replace it with minor edits.</comment>
