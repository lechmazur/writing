<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lila's interior motivation is declared but not tested through contradictory impulses in scene. She moves through the market with steady resolve, but her actions read as competent maneuvering rather than genuine struggle—the confrontation with the thieves is won through verbal assertions ("I've been playing this game my whole life") without visible cost or a micro-choice that forecloses an option. The watch fob functions as a prop rather than an object that forces a difficult trade-off. Her backstory (father's trade, growing up in this world) is told efficiently but does not anchor a present micro-choice that reweights her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by ~120 words (pirate market, Lila, moonshine runner's daughter, night). The drive lens reads as Causal with a situational accent: Lila seeks the thief, confronts the men, and walks away claiming to have "thwarted" them. However, the closure lacks on-page cost—she leaves with the fob still in her pocket, the thieves staring after her, and the truce holding "for now." The final paragraph offers conceptual repricing ("trust, once broken, could never be fully repaired"), but the cost is asserted in reflection rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or altered state. The before/after is legible but the felt cost is missing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pirate market is vividly anchored (rotting pier, salt and decay, vendors hawking stolen goods) and Lila's navigation shows spatial coherence. The watch fob is handled across multiple beats and the necklace charm creates a visual link that enables her tactical approach. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The micro-setting (the pier edge at dawn) charges the final image without becoming a postcard. Minor: the fortune-teller's booth adds atmosphere but does not constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (expose the betrayal, protect the truce) is signaled early. Lila's confrontation with the thieves is the single pressure point, but she wins through verbal assertion without a visible trade-off or tightening that forecloses an option. The men "shift uneasily" and she walks away; no cost is paid, no resource spent, no path closed. The ending declares success ("she'd thwarted the thieves") but the mechanics of that success are not dramatized. Escalation is minimal; the story reads as situational setup without a turn that narrows options under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (trust, fragility of the hush, secrets as currency) emerges from the market setting and Lila's family trade. The watch fob's conceptual weight shifts from heirloom to weapon to symbol, creating a purposeful reprise. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("The sound of trust breaking was a quiet one, a crack in the foundation that no one noticed until it was too late") rather than letting the image carry it. The ending invites reflection but leans toward assertion. The phrase "comforting unease" in the middle feels like a thematic echo of the prompt rather than earned subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited with clean distance control and a distinct perceptual signature (Lila reads silences, lies in a smile, the weight of the fob). Dialogue is functional and goal-driven; the men's speech carries menace and the fortune-teller's cryptic tone fits the setting. Minor register drift: "curiously steadfast determination" and "comforting unease" feel elevated relative to the prior texture. No head-hopping. The final paragraph shifts into a more contemplative register that fits the reflective closure but slightly dilutes the prior urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied syntax and strong sensory anchors. Information density is high in the opening and market navigation. Minor scaffold: "Her heart quickened. This was it." is a textbook beat. The phrase "she'd thwarted the thieves, not with force, but with words and wit" tells rather than dramatizes the key turn. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "She closed her hand... feeling its weight one last time. The sound of trust breaking was a quiet one..." The closure beat leans on summary rather than image-driven propulsion. No major loops or filter-verb stacks, but the final third loses momentum to reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The pirate-market frame and moonshine-runner milieu offer specificity, and the watch fob as both heirloom and tactical symbol is a fresh inflection. However, the core arc (plucky protagonist outwits thieves through wit and family knowledge) follows a familiar template without a non-obvious moral calculus or transformation. Lila's final stance ("I'm rewriting the rules") is asserted rather than earned through a risky choice. The "sound of trust breaking" metaphor is poetic but not grounded in a particular on-page action. The ending's reflective summary dilutes the fresh details of the market and fob.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lila frames the story and her choices (approaching the fortune-teller, confronting the men, walking away) create the key turns. However, her decisions do not visibly foreclose options or pay a cost; she moves with steady competence rather than struggle. She is present in the closure but the final image is reflective rather than action-driven. Early signal, multiple beats, but low causal pressure and no felt cost tied to her choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The watch fob appears early (first paragraph), is placed on the fortune-teller's table, shifts meaning from taunt to weapon to symbol, and is held in the final beat. It enables the necklace-charm link that drives the confrontation. However, it is not used to constrain a choice or pay a cost; it remains in Lila's pocket throughout, and the closure reweights it conceptually without dramatizing a trade-off. Three beats, closure linkage, but ornamental in the peak moment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Truce of hush" is named and thematically present (the market's fragile silence, Lila as reluctant guardian), but it does not shape on-page tactics or constrain a choice. Lila's confrontation with the men references the hush breaking, but the truce holds at the end without visible consequence. The concept is echoed in reflection rather than tested through action. Present, but replaceable with "uneasy peace" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" appears once in the second paragraph as a label for Lila's determination. It does not enable or constrain an on-page action, and no cost is tied to this trait. Her steadfastness is asserted but not dramatized through a choice where steadfastness forecloses flexibility or imposes a price. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Thwart" is named as her intent in the second paragraph and declared successful in the penultimate paragraph. She confronts the men and walks away, claiming to have thwarted them "not with violence, but by unraveling the truth." However, the mechanism of thwarting is not dramatized; the men are left "staring after her" and the closure is asserted rather than shown. The action is present but its mechanics are summary-only. Functional but swappable with "expose" or "outmaneuver."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"False starts" is named once (the watch fob as a taunt, her father's warning about first clues being traps), but the method is not executed on the page. Lila does not make a false start or recover from one; she moves directly from fortune-teller to thieves to resolution. The element is referenced in backstory but does not shape her tactics. Present as a label, absent as a method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath a rotting pier is anchored early, vividly described (salt, decay, shadows, vendors), and supplies spatial coherence across Lila's navigation. The pier edge at dawn charges the final image. The setting pressures choices (the men are "near the edge," the fortune-teller's booth is a waypoint) and the market's social rules (secrets, silence, the hush) shape Lila's verbal tactics. Strong setup, beat involvement, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is stated in the second paragraph and paid off in the penultimate paragraph ("the first light of dawn"). However, the timeframe does not tighten Lila's decisions or constrain her tactics; no clock is tracked, no urgency ratchets. The sunrise marks closure but does not drive escalation. Present at setup and closure, but ornamental in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To capture the sound of trust breaking" is stated in the first paragraph and echoed in the final sentence. Lila's motivation is told but not dramatized through conflicting wants or a visible cost. She moves to expose the thief and protect the truce, but "capturing the sound" remains a poetic abstraction rather than a legible on-page goal that shapes her choices. The final line reprises the phrase but asserts rather than dramatizes the capture. Setup and closure present, but friction between want and cost is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" is named once mid-story ("the comforting unease settling deeper in her chest") and the tone blends danger with Lila's familiarity and control. The market is both familiar and dangerous, and the ending is quiet rather than triumphant, which fits the tone. However, the phrase itself feels like a label rather than an emergent effect, and the tone does not modulate sharply under pressure—Lila remains steady throughout. Present and coherent, but static rather than charged at closure.</comment>
