<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to map emotions is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses in scene. Interior life relies on abstract labels ("curiosity was piqued," "profound connection") rather than embodied contradiction. The fossil triggers emotional flooding described generically ("joy, sorrow, longing") without character-specific texture. The final chamber scene asserts purpose without a visible cost that forecloses a prior path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. The fossil's floating and chamber discovery follow a because-therefore chain, but closure offers only an assertion of purpose ("journey had only just begun") rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The piece ends on declaration instead of dramatized alteration or renunciation. Drive lens reads Causal through the fossil sequence, but the ending shifts to thematic summary without pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Cave sensory details (salt, damp earth, bioluminescent algae) are vivid and filtered through Elara's professional lens. The fossil's warmth and the pedestal in the hidden chamber constrain her path and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. Minor deduction: the "heat-mapping tools" and their tactile operation remain abstract, missing the micro-setting texture that would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mapping lingering emotions) is signaled early. The fossil discovery and floating episodes provide complications, and the hidden chamber offers a tightening moment. However, Elara's agency at closure is passive observation rather than a choice that forecloses options; the fossil leads, she follows. No visible trade-off or cost narrows her tactics. The resolution declares meaning without on-page price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of bridging past and present emerges through the fossil and chamber carvings. However, the final paragraph summarizes the theme overtly ("testament to the enduring power of human emotion," "promise for the future") rather than letting image resonate. The fossil's role as "transitional object" is stated as concept without embodied friction. Thematic Echo penalty: the ending articulates the thesis in prompt-like language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual filter reflects Elara's professional focus on sensory mapping. Diction is consistent, though phrases like "factually mystical" and "voice of the unknown" (repeated thrice) edge toward elevated register without character-specific idiom. Free indirect passages are clean. Minor deduction for reliance on filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "understood") in peak emotional beats that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies adequately; no sustained template cadence. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 4 and 5 both assert the fossil is a "key" and Elara's role as "storyteller/voice of the unknown" with synonym churn ("not just mapping…uncovering," "not just as a map maker but as a storyteller"). Stock metaphor: "breathing feelings into the air." The phrase "voice of the unknown" recurs four times without evolving meaning. Clarity remains high; information density is moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "sensory map maker discovering mystical artifact" premise follows familiar template beats: unusual find, growing mystery, hidden chamber revelation. The fossil's floating and emotional-imprint mechanics are asserted rather than constrained by specific world logic. "Humans hibernated" timeframe is mentioned once without shaping on-page choices or world texture. No fresh inflection at closure; the golden-light chamber and unity carvings resolve to generic uplift without transformation or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara appears in every beat but makes few decisions that alter tactics. She extracts the fossil, follows it, and places it on the pedestal—reactive moves. Her professional work (heat-mapping) is described but does not constrain choices. Present throughout but swappable with a generic explorer role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The elm leaf fossil appears in beat 2 (extraction), beat 3 (floating/emotional surge), and beat 6 (chamber placement). It enables the hidden chamber discovery and charges the final image. Early signal present; causal pressure moderate (it leads rather than constrains her choices). Missing: the fossil's unique properties (elm leaf, veins) do not matter; any mystical object could serve.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Transitional objects" is named once in paragraph 3 as theme label. The concept does not shape on-page stakes or constrain tactics. The fossil bridges past/present thematically but this framing does not alter Elara's options or cost. Ornamental concept mention without mechanical integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is declared in paragraph 1 as description of her work ("grounded in data yet steeped in the intangible"). The attribute does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost. It remains a label without tradeoff; no beat where data-versus-intuition friction alters her choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The fossil floats twice (paragraphs 3 and 6), prompting Elara's emotional flood and leading her to the hidden chamber. The action drives two beats and the chamber discovery. However, the floating could be replaced with glowing, humming, or pulling with minor edits. Causal role present; specificity moderate; not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heat-mapping is mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 5 ("heat-mapping techniques to decipher its emotional signature"). The method's mechanics remain abstract; we never see her use tools or interpret a map on the page. It does not shape attempts or constrain choices. Functional label without dramatized application.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Coastal cave network anchors all scenes; the hidden chamber is discovered via the cave's deepest part. The bioluminescent algae and pedestal charge the final image. The setting provides the discovery opportunity but does not pressure choices or alter tactics. Present early and at closure; moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After humans hibernated" is mentioned once in paragraph 4 as backstory context for the caves' history. The timeframe does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or shape on-page choices. It remains expository color without mechanical integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To become the voice of the unknown" is stated in paragraphs 1, 4, and 7. The motivation is declared but not dramatized through conflicted choice. No on-page moment where this desire costs her an alternative path or forces a trade-off. Present and thematically relevant but told rather than enacted with friction.</comment>
