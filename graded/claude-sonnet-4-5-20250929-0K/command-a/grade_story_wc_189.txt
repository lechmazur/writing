<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but her choices remain abstract; she "seeks texture" yet never faces a concrete cost or contradiction that forces her to renounce or choose. The jade cicada warms and the grotto "whispers encouragement," but no obstacle tests her method—her epiphany arrives without struggle. Internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized: "Her motivation had shifted" tells rather than shows a renunciation or gain with visible cost. The relationship with Kael is referenced but never pressures a present choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early; no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layers of time-fragments accumulate toward a final insight. However, closure lacks on-page cost—Elara's realization ("no longer sought to discover…but to become a part of it") is asserted through summary rather than a decisive action or visible forfeit. The pause with Kael frames the piece but does not return with a concrete choice or consequence that reweights the opening stakes. One meaningful deepening (cicada shifting meaning) occurs, but the ending resolves through declaration rather than image or renunciation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The grotto under stars is vividly rendered with moss, rocky ceiling, and shifting starlight. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's observer stance. The jade cicada functions as a tactile micro-setting object that constrains her attention and charges the final beat, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion. However, the grotto itself remains atmospheric backdrop; it does not impose a physical constraint or supply a resource that alters her choices. Spatial choreography is clear and the setting evolves with the narrative arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("discover the texture of time") is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening occurs: the cicada obligingly "grew warm," the grotto "whispered encouragement," and Elara's breakthrough arrives without friction. The pause with Kael is mentioned but does not return to pressure a choice. Agency reads as passive reception rather than decision or renunciation; the protagonist observes and absorbs without forfeiting an option or paying a visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening (cicada shift) appears, but escalation is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—time as interconnected tapestry, tangential method as strength—emerges from the cicada's shifting patterns and Elara's reflective stance. The ending attempts a resonant reconfiguration ("texture of time was no longer a mystery but a companion"), but the insight is stated rather than embodied in a concrete image or action with cost. Subtext is minimal; the grotto's "encouragement" and stars "winking in approval" read as overt symbolic cheerleading. The piece avoids moralizing but also avoids dramatized friction that would anchor the theme in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with clear focalization through Elara. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated, though occasionally elevated ("celestial tapestry," "metamorphosis as inevitable as the cicada's emergence") in ways that edge toward generic lyricism. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature is present—"warmly observant" colors her noticing—but under peak stress the prose remains meditative rather than compressing or fragmenting. No dialogue; the Kael relationship is referenced but not enacted. Interiority stays character-particular without therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraph structure modulates with scene needs. Clarity is high; no pronoun confusion or tense drift. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The grotto…was the perfect setting" followed by "The grotto…was no longer just a setting" repeats the anchor without advancing pressure. Metaphor density is high ("tapestry," "thread," "strata," "metamorphosis," "shell") and occasionally stacks without clear escalation. Figurative language in the final third ("synchronized with her heartbeat," "multidimensional maps") reads decorative rather than propulsive. No major scaffold or template cadence, but synonym churn ("warmly observant," "tangential approach") recurs as labels. Minor deduction for density without earned escalation at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The tidal-pool chronicler and jade cicada offer fresh particulars, but the arc—lone seeker receives mystical insight from object in sacred space—follows a familiar template without transformation. Elara's tangential method is declared but not enacted in a choice with visible cost; the breakthrough arrives without obstacle or irony. The "pause in a difficult conversation" frames the piece but does not return to complicate or charge the ending. Emotional specificity is limited; the grotto's "encouragement" and stars' "approval" read generic. No bold risk or synthesis that reweights prior material with unexpected consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her observations anchor the piece, but she makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her "decision" to step out of the grotto and return to Kael is stated in the final paragraph without dramatized consequence. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development (a choice under pressure) is absent. Swappable with another reflective seeker archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The jade cicada appears early, is handled across multiple beats (cool, then warm, then shifting carvings), and returns in the final image synchronized with Elara's heartbeat. It shapes her discovery by "unlocking hidden rhythms" and charges the ending. However, its mechanics remain abstract; it does not constrain a tactical choice or impose a visible cost. Setup, development (middle sensory shift), and closure participation all present. Specific properties (carvings, temperature) matter, lifting it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Transition periods" is signaled early (Elara's journey, the pause, "metamorphosis as inevitable as the cicada's emergence") and returns at closure ("her chronicles would…guide others through their own transition periods"). It frames stakes but does not constrain a present choice or impose a cost that alters tactics. Lyric reprise reweights the opening frame with modest thematic resonance. Two gates (setup, closure participation); middle development as concrete pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is mentioned twice and colors her perceptual stance, but it does not enable or constrain an action with visible cost. It reads as label rather than enacted trait that shapes a choice under pressure. Setup present; no middle beat where the trait forces a trade-off or alters outcome. Swappable with "patient" or "attentive" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Foresee" appears in three beats: foreseeing her method's worth, foreseeing fragments of time, and foreseeing her future chronicles. Setup and closure participation present, but the action does not drive a reversal or impose a cost. It functions as passive reception rather than a decision that redefines options. The foresight does not constrain her in the present moment or force a sacrifice. Late introduction of its full scope (final third) and swappable with "envision" or "intuit."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Tangential approach" is named early, contrasted with Kael's critique, and returns at closure ("would become her greatest strength"). However, the method is declared rather than demonstrated through on-page action. No beat shows Elara using a tangential tactic that changes the outcome or imposes a cost compared to a direct method. Two gates (setup, closure claim); middle dramatization absent. Swappable with "indirect" or "intuitive" method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ancient grotto under stars is vividly described and anchors every beat. It provides atmosphere and a tactile object (moss-covered stone), and the piece claims it is "no longer just a setting but a participant." However, the grotto does not impose a physical constraint or supply a resource that alters Elara's choices; it functions as backdrop. Setup, continuous presence, and closure reprise all present. Micro-setting element (cicada) does more causal work than the location itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Across the pause in a difficult conversation" frames the opening and is referenced at midpoint ("The pause…now felt like a deliberate pause"). Elara steps out to return to Kael at the end, but no clock or ticking urgency tightens decisions. The pause does not escalate or impose a time cost that alters tactics. Setup present; development and closure participation are gestural only. Easily removable without breaking plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated in the opening and returns transformed at closure ("no longer sought to discover…but to become a part of it"). Desire is told rather than dramatized through a choice with competing cost. No beat shows Elara sacrificing an alternative want to pursue this goal. Two gates (setup, closure shift); middle friction where the motivation conflicts with another pressure is absent. Lyric reprise reweights the frame with modest resonance.</comment>
