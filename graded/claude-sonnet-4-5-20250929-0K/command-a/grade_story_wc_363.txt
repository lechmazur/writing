<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are stated but not embodied under pressure—she "wonders" about purpose and "realizes" connections rather than making difficult micro-choices that reveal hierarchy. The final step onto the bridge reads as acceptance without visible competing impulse or cost. Interior life leans heavily on abstract phrasing ("profound silence," "wistful," "latent sacrifice") rather than contradictory sensory particulars. No on-page choice forecloses a live option with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (fragments → puzzle → bridge), but escalation is largely additive discovery rather than tightening under constraint. The bridge-of-light climax asserts transformation ("no longer unraveling but weaving itself into something new") without on-page dramatization of what Elara gives up or gains in concrete terms—her "sacrifice" remains an atmospheric label. Orientation is clean. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she steps forward into uncertainty), but cost is told, not shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The orchard-in-bamboo setting and shifting puzzle images provide vivid anchors ("trees that sang," "streams that flowed backward"). However, setting functions as spectacle rather than constraint: none of these phenomena alter Elara's tactics or close off an option. The bead warms and glows, but its temperature never forces a choice or redirects movement. Micro-setting test not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"carry a message across impossible distance"—is declared but never tested on the page; Elara encounters no opposition, resource limit, or fork that forces a trade-off. Puzzle assembly and journey unfold as sequential discovery without reversal. The bridge appears as reward rather than costly decision. No agency-driven tightening under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of connection/weaving emerges through consistent imagery (loom, silence, tapestry, bridge). The final image reframes "message" as connection itself—non-literal and apt. However, the insight arrives by assertion ("she understood then") rather than through on-page collision of choices. No ambiguity or counter-reading invited; the resolution is tidy. Quiet endings are valid, but this one summarizes meaning rather than charging particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction trends elevated ("wistful," "raveling," "stoically sparkling," "latent sacrifice") and consistent, but the register never modulates under pressure—peak moments use the same lyric distance as opening exposition. Perceptual signature is generic contemplative rather than character-specific. Elara's way of noticing does not shift when stakes rise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops: "wistful...though she did not yet know" echoes "wondered...though its secrets remained locked"; "her only companion was a tree sap amber bead...a gift from her grandmother" restates the bead's identity across beats. Template cadence in final third: "Every step felt," "she felt the weight," "As she walked, she felt." Stock metaphor strings ("liquid gold," "fabric of time," "tapestry of time") cluster without fresh vehicle. Register drift into prompt-echo phrasing ("latent sacrifice," "raveling silence") at closure. Deductions: paraphrase −0.4, template cadence −0.5, stock strings −0.4, closure-beat artifact escalation −0.6. Cap at 4.9 due to artifacts in final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise—silent weaver discovers puzzle-map and crosses metaphorical bridge—follows a familiar quest-for-purpose template without transformation through lived detail or moral calculus. The puzzle is convenient revelation, the bridge a symbol that appears on cue. No friction between wants; no surprising stance. "Weaving silence" remains abstractly poetic rather than concretely constrained craft. Derivative premise guardrail: −1.0.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara appears in all beats but her decisions are acceptance rather than choice under competing pressure: she begins weaving, finds the puzzle, follows it, and steps onto the bridge without on-page deliberation or cost. No key turn traces to her agency. Present throughout but largely observational. Late first-third setup, two beats (finding puzzle, stepping onto bridge), no causal pressure or swappability penalty, no closure linkage beyond physical presence. Base 3.0 + beat involvement +0.4 − ornamental use −0.2 = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The bead is introduced early, described in two separate beats (around her neck, glowing as puzzle takes shape, glowing at bridge), but it never constrains a choice or is handled to alter tactics. It warms and pulses as atmospheric confirmation rather than tool or cost. Three touches, early signal, but purely ornamental. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.3 + beats (×2) +0.9 − ornamental use −0.6 − swappability −0.5 = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Raveling silence" is named in paragraph one and echoed thematically ("no longer unraveling but weaving itself") but never shapes an on-page tactic or narrows an option. It functions as metaphoric frame, not stake. Present early, cameo at closure, but swappable with any metaphor of connection. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.3 − ornamental use −0.5 = 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Stoically sparkling" is applied to the bead once in paragraph two as description; the bead later "glows" without reference to stoicism. The attribute does not constrain or enable any action. Label-only, single mention. Base 3.0 − ornamental −0.8 − swappability −0.3 = 1.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Recommence her journey" appears mid-story when Elara decides to leave; it frames the transition but is swappable with "begin," "start," "embark." No unique causal property. The journey itself is central, but this verb is not. Introduced second third (−0.3), one beat, no closure linkage, high swappability (−0.6). Base 3.0 + beat +0.4 − late −0.3 − swappability −0.6 + slight causal (enables middle journey sequence) +0.1 = 2.6. Correcting for slight middle development allowance, cap at 4.6 per missing-closure-participation gate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The puzzle is found early (rummage box, first third), assembled in middle beats (it shifts, becomes a map), and its final piece triggers the bridge at closure. Two distinct beats, early signal, closure participation (final piece placement creates bridge). However, the "jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box" specificity does not matter—any puzzle or map would serve the same function; the "rummage sale box" detail is ornamental. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + beats (×2) +0.9 + closure linkage +1.0 − swappability (puzzle mechanism, not this exact origin) −0.8 − ornamental box detail −0.3 = 5.3. Slight upward adjustment for closure participation strength: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The orchard and bamboo forest anchor early, are traversed in middle beats, and the clearing is the closure site. Three touches, early signal, closure location. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices—she moves freely, phenomena are spectacle, no resource limit or access barrier. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + beats (×3) +1.4 + closure presence +0.5 − ornamental/postcard use (no tactical constraint) −0.8 − swappability −0.5 = 4.2. Adjusting for closure-location participation: 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"The hush of time's unraveling tapestry" is named once in paragraph four and echoed thematically ("raveling silence she had been weaving," "woven into the tapestry of time itself") but never functions as a ticking clock or decision constraint. Days turn to weeks without pressure. Metaphoric frame only. Base 3.0 + early mention +0.3 − ornamental −0.8 − no urgency mechanism −0.4 = 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "carry a message across impossible distance" is stated in paragraph one and echoed at closure ("her message was not one of words but of connection"), but it is never tested by competing want or obstacle—she simply follows the puzzle without friction. Told motivation, not dramatized in conflicted choice. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + closure thematic callback +0.4 − told-only, no friction −1.0 − no cost tied to this motive −0.5 = 2.4. Correcting for some thematic presence across beats: 3.4, capped by missing middle-development gate at 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Latent sacrifice" is named once mid-story and asserted in the penultimate paragraph ("she felt the weight of her sacrifice—the life she had left behind"). Tone is consistently contemplative-melancholy, but "sacrifice" is label rather than embodied cost. No modulation under pressure. Base 3.0 + early second-third mention +0.2 + closure assertion +0.3 − label-only, not embodied −0.6 − static mood −0.3 = 2.6. Slight upward adjustment for tonal coherence: 3.6.</comment>
