<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to puzzle out new equations for hope") is declared but never tested by a concrete dilemma. Her "logical dreamer" trait manifests only as label and reflection; no on-page choice reveals contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The pattern-making is ornamental rather than goal-driven, and the ending epiphany ("hope...is not something to be calculated, but something to be felt") arrives without causal pressure or visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("serene upheaval," "trial balloons of her own making") rather than embodied perception under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where) arrive early, but "across parallel timelines" remains decorative without altering options or stakes. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens initially but never commits: no density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with cost. The closure—Elara realizing hope is to be lived, not calculated—lacks on-page cost; she simply walks away revitalized. The tide erasing patterns is framed as triumph rather than loss, leaving no felt trade-off or foreclosed path. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under any drive lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly established ("tide-polished," "walls shimmered with centuries of oceanic caress") and the tide provides a recurring environmental pressure. However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara "adjusts" without visible difficulty or cost. The altitude gauge sits beside her, described but not handled in a way that changes action. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, supporting tone effectively, but does not reach the gate for environment meaningfully shaping the final image or forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to puzzle out new equations for hope") is signaled early but never narrows options or generates a live choice. The tide threatens to erase patterns, yet Elara "adjusts" without cost or escalation—no option is foreclosed, no tactic shifts. The ending declares success ("she had found what she sought") without an on-page reversal or tightening that changes knowledge or forecloses a path. No agency decision, renunciation, or endurance with visible cost is dramatized. Pressure remains static throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (hope as pattern to be lived, not solved) emerges from imagery and action rather than direct statement, avoiding most moralizing. The balloonist's altitude gauge and the patterns provide recurring motifs, though the gauge's final meaning ("not a tool for measuring distance, but for reminding her of the journey") leans toward platitude. The ending image of patterns washed away could resonate, but the text asserts triumph rather than letting the loss speak. The piece resists tidy binaries and invites ambiguity around "parallel timelines," yet the final epiphany lacks the particularity to elevate it beyond thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and elevated ("serene upheaval," "lucidly watchful," "the harmony of the design itself"), creating a distinct lyric texture. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara filters setting through abstraction and pattern—though it never degrades under stress. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") are purposeful and sparse. The prose occasionally drifts into expository summary ("Her motivation was clear") and abstract philosophizing, but voice remains coherent and the register matches the contemplative focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with paragraph structure and sentence length supporting the meditative tone. However, abstract phrasing pervades peak beats: "serene upheaval," "trial balloons," "equations for hope," "patterns...were her compass." The opening and closing paragraphs recycle "serene upheaval" and "trial balloon" without reweighting them. Several lines loop conceptually: "the act of creating itself" appears twice in adjacent beats. Figurative language is frequent but some metaphors strain clarity ("time seemed to fold in on itself," "patterns...were her compass"). No single artifact obscures causality, but the cumulative effect dulls immediacy in the final third, triggering deductions for density and loop without reaching the artifact-pervade threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The grotto setting and pattern-making method offer sensory specificity, and the balloonist's altitude gauge is a non-obvious choice. However, the core arc—contemplative character achieves insight through solitary reflection and symbolic action—follows a familiar template. The "parallel timelines" motif is mentioned three times but never developed or transformed beyond decoration. The final realization (hope is felt, not calculated) is a recognizable thematic move. The piece commits to its lyric stance and avoids safety-hedging, but does not risk a bold structural or perspectival choice that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara ("logical dreamer") is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that creates a turn. She arranges patterns, adjusts when the tide rises, and reflects; these are observations and gestures, not decisions that narrow options or alter tactics. The trait is label-only and does not constrain or enable agency with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The altitude gauge appears in three beats: initial handling, mid-scene mention ("its needle trembling"), and final pickup with reweighted meaning ("not a tool for measuring distance, but for reminding her of the journey"). However, it is never used or handled in a way that changes action or constrains choice; it sits beside her as a symbolic anchor. Present across beats but functionally ornamental, capped for lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Trial balloons" is mentioned twice as metaphor ("Her own trial balloon was not one of words...but of action" and the closing "trial balloon of her own making") but never dramatized as a tactic or method that shapes stakes. It echoes thematically without altering options or generating cost. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" is declared once ("She was lucidly watchful, her mind alert to every detail") but does not constrain or enable a choice. No trade-off or visible cost is tied to heightened awareness. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Revitalize" appears twice: Elara "revitalizing her patterns with each wave" and feeling "revitalized" at the end. The action is present in the middle beat (adjusting patterns as tide rises) and at closure, but it does not drive a turn or redefine options—she continues without friction. Functional but replaceable; "adjust" or "renew" would serve equally. Scores mid-band for presence across beats without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pattern-making with shells, pebbles, and seaweed is signaled early, shapes multiple beats (arranging, adjusting against the tide, final erasure), and appears in the ending image. The method is on the page and its mechanics (tide threatening, Elara adjusting) generate texture. However, the patterns never constrain a choice or impose cost; Elara succeeds regardless. Present across setup, development, and payoff, but lacks the causal pressure for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The grotto is established in the opening line, provides recurring environmental pressure (tide rising), and frames the ending ("the tide-polished grotto whispered its secrets"). The setting is present across all three gates and its tidal rhythm structures the action. However, it does not force a trade-off or alter tactics—Elara adapts without visible cost. Scores solidly for presence and structuring role, but does not reach indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Across parallel timelines" is mentioned three times but never developed as a timeframe mechanic. It does not tighten decisions, track elapsed time, or alter tactics. Purely decorative.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation ("to puzzle out new equations for hope") is stated in the opening paragraph and referenced at closure ("Hope...was not an equation to be solved"). It frames the story but is never tested by conflicting wants or on-page friction. The desire is told rather than dramatized through choices with cost. Functional framing but no middle development or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is declared in paragraph two and repeated in the final line. The tone is coherent—meditative yet charged with the tide's cyclical pressure—and modulates subtly as patterns are threatened then erased. The phrase recurs with light reweighting (initial frame, final summary) but does not charge the closure image with fresh meaning. Present at setup and payoff; lyric reprise earns mid-band score despite no middle causal use.</comment>
