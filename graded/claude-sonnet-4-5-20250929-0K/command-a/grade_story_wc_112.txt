<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to prove time moves sideways is signaled early, but her decision-making lacks genuine internal conflict—she hesitates briefly, then pulls the lever without dramatized cost to competing values. The "icy warmth" attribute appears only as a label rather than shaping contradictory impulses in action. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her heart pounded, but her expression remained calm") and the final shift ("thawing slightly") tells emotional change rather than earning it through embodied micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first paragraph. The lever-pull triggers a causal sequence (nexus surge → alarms → system failures → manual override → stabilization), but the climactic reversal lacks visible cost: Elara's second lever adjustment succeeds immediately with "precision," erasing stakes rather than forcing a trade-off. The ending offers a micro turn (responsibility tempers motivation) but the cost remains abstract—"what she had to protect" is stated, not dramatized as a foreclosed path on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The xenobiology station is anchored with sensory detail (metallic surfaces, fogging breath, bioluminescent creatures), and the magnetic nexus physically constrains Elara's actions across beats (bolt-tightening, lever grip, manual override). Spatial choreography tracks clearly from workstation to control room and back. However, the holographic interface collapses mid-crisis yet Elara returns to a functioning "holographic display" at the end without causal explanation, breaking consistency and capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving the theory—is signaled early and drives the lever-pull decision. Pressure escalates when systems fail and the nexus destabilizes, forcing Elara to sprint to manual overrides. Yet the resolution undercuts earned escalation: her second lever adjustment "with precision" immediately stabilizes the nexus without visible trade-off or loss, and the data confirms success at no meaningful cost to her theory, her safety, or her standing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The central question—whether time moves sideways—is plot-explicit rather than emergent from particulars. The mentor's maxim ("Mechanical warmth isn't just about heat; it's about balance") arrives as a convenient epiphany rather than earned insight. The final paragraph moralizes theme directly ("the true challenge was just beginning") instead of letting the image resonate, and "subdued awakenings" as a thematic element remains ornamental, never constraining a choice or reweighting the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and psychic distance is controlled. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("ethereal," "temporal fabric," "subdued awakenings") that reads writerly rather than mechanic-specific, and filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("she knew," "she realized," "she glanced") without voice motivation. Elara's perceptual signature is generic—breath fogging, heart pounding, knuckles whitening—rather than character-particular, and the prose converges on template cadence during peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent sentences: "The nexus required calibration, and she knew the lever hidden beneath its casing was the key. She hesitated, her fingers brushing the cold metal, then activated the holographic interface" restates intent without advancing pressure. Stock metaphors ("icy warmth," "mechanically warm glow") recur without fresh inflection. The opening and closing paragraphs mirror each other with "metallic," "twilight/deepened," "hum," and creature luminescence, creating a symmetric frame that deflates rather than charges the closure image. Template stems dominate: "She [verb], her [body part] [gerund]" appears in seven sentences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise—proving time moves sideways via a magnetic nexus—reads as science-fiction furniture rather than a synthesis that transforms familiar material. The mentor's wisdom, the bioluminescent creatures, and the "obliging" mechanic all function as prompt fulfillment without fresh angle or specific lived detail. The emotional arc (passion tempered by responsibility) follows a generic template, and the holographic interface, lever, and nexus feel interchangeable with standard crisis-device tropes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara (obliging sky mechanic) is present throughout and makes the lever-pull decision, but "obliging" does not constrain or enable any on-page choice—she acts alone with no interpersonal pressure to test that trait. "Sky mechanic" remains a title without occupational specificity shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus appears in the opening beat (bolt-tightening), the climax (lever-pull and destabilization), and the resolution (stabilization and final glance). Its "mechanically warm glow" shifts from steady hum to fiery threat to gentle hum, and the second lever adjustment turns the plot. However, its role as conduit for the time-sideways theory is asserted rather than demonstrated through unique properties that matter on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Subdued awakenings" appears once as an abstract interiority label ("moments of clarity in the chaos") without shaping stakes, constraining a choice, or altering tactics. It does not return at closure or reweight prior material.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Mechanically warm" appears as a descriptor for the nexus's glow in multiple beats but never constrains or enables an action with cost—it is atmospheric rather than functional. The mentor's maxim about "mechanical warmth" as balance arrives late and explains rather than dramatizes a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lever is signaled early ("hidden beneath its casing was the key"), pulled at the climax to trigger the nexus surge and crisis, and adjusted a second time to stabilize the system. Both uses turn the plot and the second adjustment resolves the immediate stakes, making removal structurally damaging.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Through holographic principles" appears when Elara adjusts the nexus settings via a holographic interface, but the mechanics remain vague ("projections of gears and circuits materialized, a dance of light and logic"). The interface collapses mid-crisis, forcing manual overrides, yet the "holographic display" reappears at the end without explanation—it does not shape attempts or constrain tactics in a consistent, causal way.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station provides spatial anchors (workstation, control room, observation windows) and the station's systems (power grid, alarms, manual overrides) supply resources and constraints across beats. The winged creatures outside respond to the station's turmoil, tying setting to stakes. However, the station functions more as backdrop than micro-setting that alters specific tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Within the hush of beating wings at rest" frames the opening and closing but does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions. The creatures "stir" when the nexus destabilizes and "settle once more" at the end, but no clock or temporal pressure constrains Elara's choices—she sprints and adjusts at will without time-driven trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation to prove time moves sideways is stated early and drives the lever-pull, but it lacks on-page friction—Elara's fear is mentioned ("the risk was immense") yet never dramatized as a competing want that forces a choice with visible cost. The data confirms success without requiring her to sacrifice the theory, her safety, or her reputation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Icy warmth" is declared twice as Elara's defining blend ("detachment and passion," "a shield against panic") but remains a label rather than modulating under pressure. The tone does not shift meaningfully as stakes rise or charge the final image; the "thawing slightly" at the end tells rather than enacts tonal change.</comment>
