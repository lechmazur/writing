<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("drawn to the moments when day surrendered to night," "uncovering the forgotten") but her interior life relies on abstraction rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic decision to "metamorphose the shadow" arrives without visible cost or trade-off—she presses stone to vial and achieves transformation through assertion rather than struggle. Embodied emotion is minimal; phrases like "luminous regret" and "heart alight with luminous regret and unwavering hope" label feelings rather than dramatizing them. The final choice feels unmotivated by prior causality, more thematic wishfulness than earned character arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who and where anchor by ~120 words (library, Elara), but the temporal frame ("after dreams become shareable") remains abstract decoration without on-page pressure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (the shadow accretes across footage, then materializes), but closure relies on a convenient mechanism—pressing stone to vial—that the story does not establish or constrain. The shadow's transformation from threat to "reflection of collective hopes" is told rather than dramatized, and the final sculpture offers no visible cost or foreclosed path. Cost Proof Test fails: no exact line shows what Elara sacrifices or loses by this act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blooming library and its crystalline vials create a vivid secondary-world frame, and the river stone recurs with tactile grounding ("coolness," "heavier now"). Spatial choreography is clear (glass wall, archives, forgotten corner), and the shadow's materialization uses the room itself. The stone does not constrain a choice—it enables the climax without resistance—so the 9+ gate is not met, capping at 8.8, but pervasive specificity (aged paper, ethereal glow, twilight horizon) keeps the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the shadow's meaning—is signaled early, and the move from archival research to forgotten corner tightens focus. However, escalation is assertion-driven: Elara "decided to delve deeper" and the shadow simply materializes without resistance or complication. The climax—pressing stone to vial—meets no obstacle and incurs no visible price; the sculpture appears, the library "sighs in relief," and Elara walks away with "triumph and sorrow" that feel declared rather than earned. No foreclosed option or tactical cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of forgotten dreams and preservation is stated overtly ("manifestation of collective hopes and fears that had been lost," "voice to the voiceless, form to the formless") rather than arising from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "a reminder—of what had been lost, and of what could still be saved." The river stone and shadow recur, but their thematic charge is told ("testament to the resilience of the human spirit") instead of resonating through image. Luminous regret appears as a label twice without embodied cost, and the closing beats articulate the thesis rather than letting it emerge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("softly deliberate," "labyrinthine archives," "ethereal light"), though it leans toward lyric generality rather than character-specific perception. Filter verbs ("felt a surge," "realized," "believed") cluster in key beats, softening immediacy. The prose has texture, but under pressure the voice does not compress or sharpen—syntax and rhythm remain uniform. Perceptual signature is present (dusk, twilight, forgotten corners) but not distinct enough to feel inevitable to this narrator alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are evident: "She had always been drawn to the moments when day surrendered to night, a transition she found both beautiful and haunting" repeats conceptually in adjacent lines. Template cadence: "She worked… But her true passion lay… Her latest obsession was…" Stack of "she [verb]" stems across multiple sentences. Figurative language clusters without payoff: "blooming library," "captured sunsets," "shadow unbound," "luminous regret" all appear but do not build pressure or constrain choice. "Softly deliberate" recurs three times as a label without varying function. Stock metaphor "heart alight" and therapy-speak "luminous regret" in the final paragraph lower precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—shareable dreams in crystalline vials, a cloud library, archival shadow—assembles genre furniture (secondary world, mystery archivist, forgotten fragment) without a fresh synthesis. The emotional arc (curiosity → realization → preservation) follows a predictable template. The shadow's dual nature (threat/reflection) and the stone-as-key resolution feel convenient rather than inevitable. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the prose stays in safe lyric mode. The story does not transform its tropes through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup present (first paragraph). Elara's "sharp eyes" notice what others miss in footage (middle beat), but the trait is told rather than dramatized in a high-stakes decision. The climax does not trace to her observation skill—she "decided to delve deeper" and the shadow materializes without her noticing a trigger. Two gates (setup, development) met; closure participation weak. Observation without decisive choice trends low per rubric.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup present (first paragraph, talisman). Handled twice: carried to archives, pressed to vial at climax. The stone enables the transformation but does not constrain Elara's choice—it simply works when applied. The return with "reweighted meaning" ("knowing it had served its purpose") is told rather than charged. Two gates plus closure touch, but swappable mechanism (any talisman could serve) and lack of visible cost cap mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup strong (introduced early as "shadow unbound," footage from decades apart). Shapes middle stakes (Elara's obsession, comparison work). Closure participation: materializes and is transformed into sculpture. The concept drives the plot spine. However, the shadow's mechanics are told ("manifestation of collective hopes") rather than constrained by on-page rules, and its transformation is asserted without resistance. Three gates met; causal pressure moderate; specificity modest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Label appears three times: "task was softly deliberate," "steps softly deliberate," "softly deliberate decision." No on-page action constrained or enabled by this trait—speed or manner does not alter outcome. Ornamental adverb without visible cost or trade-off. Present but non-functional; setup only, no development or closure cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup implicit (Elara's role in preserving dreams). Action occurs at climax: "metamorphose the shadow… by giving it form." The transformation is the story's decisive event and defines the closure. However, the mechanics are asserted (press stone, shadow solidifies) without resistance or steps, making it functionally a single gesture. Two gates (development weak, closure strong); indispensable to closure but thin causal texture caps high-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup present (comparing clips from 2045 and 2120). Method signaled early and mentioned in middle beat ("grainy footage," shadow reaching). Does not shape closure—Elara does not use footage analysis to solve the problem; the shadow simply appears in the room. Method matters in exposition but does not constrain tactics at the climax. Two gates (setup, weak development); no closure participation caps ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Setup vivid (first line, "blooming library above the clouds"). The library provides the archives, vials, and forgotten corner—spatial staging is clear. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choice or supply a resource she must work around; she walks to a corner, and the climax occurs without environmental friction. Postcard description trends low per rubric. Setup and staging present; no tactical pressure caps mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Timeframe declared in setup ("after dreams become shareable"). The condition appears as world-building but does not tighten decisions—Elara's archival work and the shadow's appearance are unaffected by this temporal rule. No on-page pressure from shared-dream mechanics. Setup only; no development or closure participation. Abstract rather than dramatized; cap low-2s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup implicit (Elara's passion for "uncovering the forgotten"). Explicitly stated at climax: "to preserve the shape of hope." The motivation drives the final action (giving the shadow form). However, it is told rather than dramatized—no friction between this desire and a competing want, no visible cost to preserving hope. Two gates (setup, closure); desire present but not conflicted trends mid-5s per rubric.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Tone signaled early ("beautiful and haunting," twilight focus). "Luminous regret" appears twice, including final line. The tone modulates slightly (curiosity → sorrow → triumph/sorrow mix) but remains declarative rather than embodied. The final image ("heart alight with luminous regret and unwavering hope") names the tone instead of charging it through concrete perception. Setup and closure reprise present; static mood without pressure-driven shift trends mid-low per rubric.</comment>
