<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to integrate laughter into healing"—is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The figure's confession unfolds smoothly without resistance or complication from Elara's flaws. "Modestly fearless" remains a label; no moment shows her trading one value for another or paying a visible cost for her choice to listen. The ending grants her fulfillment without foreclosing a live option or requiring sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with light Accumulative coloring (harp notes "aligning" at the end). Orientation anchors arrive by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—figure dissolves, tooth warms in her palm, she climbs out with "luminous ache"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is vague: no tactic or relationship has been altered, no path foreclosed. The figure's release feels automatic once the harp plays, not earned by a protagonist choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Echo Gorge supplies mood and a "labyrinth of jagged rock," but spatial choreography remains generic—no turn depends on a crevice, distance, or climb. The harp returns in the final image ("strings now aligned"), reweighting the opening dissonance, which lifts the score moderately. The crocodile's tooth constrains nothing tactically; it is received, not used to alter a move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (gather spectral confession). The figure's appearance and confession provide one beat of escalation, but Elara faces no counter-pressure, tactical trade-off, or failed attempt. Playing the harp produces immediate success without complication. The cost—"luminous ache"—is asserted in reflection, not demonstrated through a forfeited option or visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of release and healing through listening emerges from the figure's arc. The harp's distortion-to-alignment motif recurs purposefully at the ending. However, Elara's insight—"she had pursued a lost soul and found… a piece of herself"—is stated rather than inferred from specific action. The crocodile's tooth as talisman is symbolic convenience introduced to harvest resonance without prior friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable. Diction is controlled and distinct ("luminous ache," "guttural echo"). The figure's direct speech—"Why do you pursue me?"—carries goal and vulnerability. Elara's perceptual signature leans toward the poetic but stays consistent. Minor slips: "modestly fearless" and "purposeful effect" read as authorial labels rather than embodied stance, and some filter verbs ("felt the ache") dull immediacy in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally good. Paraphrase loop in paragraph 2: "The gorge was a labyrinth… a place where time seemed to bend" restates mood without added pressure (−0.2). Stock phrasing: "hidden sunrise" recurs three times; "luminous ache" appears twice without reweighting (−0.3). Figurative language ("tapestry of sorrow and hope") in the climax beat reads generic rather than specific to Elara's perceptual signature (−0.3). No scaffolding or major template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Soul-collector premise and harp-as-tool offer some freshness, but the emotional arc—listen, witness confession, release figure—follows a predictable template without complication or moral ambiguity. The crocodile's tooth and "integrate laughter into healing" are introduced as symbolic conveniences rather than earned through prior friction. The transformation test fails: swap names and the plot remains unchanged. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation frames the premise. She makes one decision on-page—"I'm not here to take you… I'm here to listen"—that shifts the figure's stance, qualifying as one beat involvement with moderate causal pressure. However, the choice costs her nothing visible and does not foreclose an option. Late-story label ("modestly fearless… her heart full of purpose") is summary-only (−0.3). Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal pressure (modest) +0.4, closure linkage (present in final image) +0.7, swappability (another listener/guide would work) −0.5, summary-only trait −0.3. Total ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tooth appears in three distinct beats: figure clutches it (para 4), it glints during confession (para 5), Elara picks it up and tucks it away (para 6), and it is referenced as talisman in the final paragraph. Gate check: setup ✓ (para 4), development ✗ (not used to enable/constrain a middle choice), payoff ✓ (picked up post-dissolution and claimed as talisman). Two gates met; eligible to ~6.0. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, but purely ornamental in beats 1–2 (−0.8), resolves nothing it helped create (−0.7), swappable relic (−0.5). Total ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Spectral confessions shape Elara's role and the figure's confession is dramatized in para 5 as a memory taking shape. The concept is signaled in para 1 and returns implicitly in the closure (figure dissolves after releasing grief). Gate check: setup ✓, development ✓ (confession is the middle turn), payoff ✓ (implicit in dissolution and harp alignment). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (confession enables release) +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, but the mechanics are vague (confession "takes shape" without cost or resistance) and swappable with "trapped memories" (−0.6). Total ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Label appears twice: "modestly fearless soul collector" (para 1) and "modestly fearless, her heart full of purpose" (final para). No on-page moment shows the trait constraining or enabling an action with visible cost. Gate check: setup ✓ (para 1), development ✗, payoff ✗ (mentioned but not active). One gate; cap 4.6. Early signal +0.4, label-only (−0.6), summary-only (−0.4). Total ~2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Pursue" is signaled in para 1 ("pursued her quarry") and dramatized in para 2 (she descends with purpose). The figure asks "Why do you pursue me?" which frames the confrontation beat. Gate check: setup ✓, development ✓ (the question and her answer are the turn), payoff ✓ (implicit in her climb out). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage (implicit; she "pursued… and found") +0.5, but swappable with "seek" or "follow" (−0.5). Total ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The harp appears in four beats: slung over shoulder (para 2), she raises it and plays one note (para 4), plays with "increasing intensity" (para 5), and it hums "strings now aligned" (para 6–7). Gate check: setup ✓, development ✓ (playing triggers memory), payoff ✓ (alignment symbolizes closure). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (playing enables confession) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, but "distorted notes" vs. "aligned" is vague mechanics (how does misalignment work?) and the method is swappable with any symbolic instrument (−0.7). Total ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is named and described in paras 1–2 and returns in para 6 ("the gorge whispered its approval"). Gate check: setup ✓, development ✗ (no middle choice depends on gorge features), payoff ✓ (whispers laughter at the end). Two gates; eligible to ~6.0. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but purely atmospheric (no tactical constraint; −0.8) and swappable with any liminal space (−0.6). Total ~4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Hidden sunrise" bookends the story (para 1, para 6) and is mentioned in para 4 ("faint light of the hidden sunrise"). Gate check: setup ✓, development ✗ (no middle choice tied to time pressure), payoff ✓ (sunrise "broke over the horizon" as she climbs out). Two gates; eligible to ~6.0. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but no ticking clock or time constraint on choices (−1.0), swappable with "dawn" or "morning" (−0.5), ornamental (−0.5). Total ~3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Stated in para 2 ("to integrate laughter into healing") and echoed in para 7 ("the echoes carrying the sound of laughter"). Gate check: setup ✓, development ✗ (no on-page friction between this goal and a cost), payoff ✓ (laughter heard at the end). Two gates; eligible to ~6.0. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, but told-only (never dramatized as conflicted desire; −0.8), no visible cost or trade-off (−0.6), swappable with generic "healing" (−0.5). Total ~3.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" appears in para 1 (the gorge "stirred with a luminous ache") and para 7 ("a small, luminous ache in her chest"). The tone—melancholy suffused with hope—modulates across the confession and release beats. Gate check: setup ✓, development ✓ (confession beat carries ache), payoff ✓ (tone charges final image). Early signal +0.7, three beats (opening, confession weeping, closing) +1.4, causal pressure (tone reflects Elara's empathic burden) +0.6, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (distinct phrase) +0.5, but static across peaks (no tonal deepening under pressure; −0.4). Total ~6.7.</comment>
