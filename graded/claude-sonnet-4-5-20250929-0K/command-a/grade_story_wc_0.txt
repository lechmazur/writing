<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to strip away the needless drama") is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting choices under pressure. Her professional background as a neutron star researcher feels ornamental—no specific astronomical knowledge constrains her greenhouse experiments. The butterfly's materialization at the end reads as wish-fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interior voice relies on abstract phrasing ("quiet architect," "kindled humility") rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The closure—a butterfly materializing from dust—lands as a symbolic flourish rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost. No before/after is traceable in Elara's options or stance; she observes beauty emerge but makes no choice that forecloses a path. The piece teaches an Accumulative lens through repeated dust-pattern experiments, yet the ending skips escalation and delivers a convenient resolution that the protagonist does not earn through agency. Orientation is clear early, preventing penalties there, but the lens remains decorative rather than pressure-building.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is established early with sensory detail (broken glass, brackish water, skeletal frame) and recurs across beats. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain Elara's experiments—she sprinkles dust freely without resource limits or spatial friction. The butterfly dust vial functions as a micro-setting object but its mechanics remain vague; we never see how shattered glass or damp soil alters her tactics. The setting charges the final image thematically but does not pressure the protagonist's choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding gradual transformation—never tightens into a trade-off or dilemma. Elara experiments across weeks without obstacles, setbacks, or costs; each pattern "grows more complex" without friction. The butterfly's appearance resolves nothing the protagonist risked or renounced. Coincidence (dust autonomously reconstructs a creature) replaces protagonist agency at closure. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of gradual transformation emerges through repeated imagery (dust, decay, growth) and the greenhouse-as-metaphor, avoiding overt thesis statements until the final beat. However, "the dust had stripped away the needless drama of her life, leaving only what mattered" in the closing lines tips into direct thematic summary. The butterfly's materialization offers symbolic resonance but no non-literal answer to a dramatic question—it illustrates the theme rather than complicating it. Subtext in early beats (neutron-star collapse mirroring greenhouse decay) is present but underexploited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled but drifts toward elevated abstraction ("quiet architect," "bridge between the microscopic and the macroscopic") that sits uneasily with the concrete greenhouse setting. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices patterns and scientific parallels—but her neutron-star expertise never inflects her syntax or metaphor choice in a character-specific way. No dialogue; all interiority. Psychic distance stays consistent, avoiding filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean and free of major loops, but multiple sentences rely on template stems: "It was as if the dust…" appears twice in close proximity, and "The dust wasn't just…" / "it was…" structures recur. Figurative language clusters without escalation: "quiet architect," "bridge between the microscopic and the macroscopic," "canvas for creation" stack in the fourth paragraph without advancing pressure. The final beat—"And in that moment, she understood"—is a tell-heavy epiphany that summarizes rather than dramatizes. Information density is moderate; some beats (e.g., the entire third paragraph on her motivation) paraphrase the premise without new pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—scientist discovers transformative power in butterfly dust—follows a familiar template (decay → renewal via symbolic object). The neutron-star background is a surface detail that does not transform the material; swapping her profession to botanist or chemist would require minimal edits. The dust's quasi-magical properties (responding to thoughts, reconstructing a butterfly) are presented without constraint or cost, reducing conceptual rigor. The ending delivers expected symbolism (butterfly = resilience) without a fresh inflection or non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara's profession as neutron star researcher is mentioned in paragraph two and invoked thematically (collapse/decay metaphor) but never constrains her on-page experiments. Her choices—sprinkling dust, observing patterns—do not require or reflect astronomical expertise. The role is swappable with any scientist archetype. Present in setup, absent from middle development and closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The butterfly-wing dust vial appears in the opening beat, is handled and experimented with across multiple middle beats (sprinkling, pattern observation), and returns at closure when a butterfly materializes. However, its mechanics remain vague—no specific properties (texture, reaction to moisture, light sensitivity) constrain Elara's methods. The dust enables the ending but does not impose visible costs or trade-offs during experimentation. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but swappability (any symbolic powder) and lack of tactile specificity lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Gradual change is the story's thematic spine, invoked repeatedly (decay, slow unraveling, accumulated patterns). It shapes Elara's observational approach (weeks of patient experimentation) but does not create tactical dilemmas or narrow options—she never faces a choice between slow observation and urgent action. The concept charges the final image thematically (butterfly's slow reconstruction) but operates as atmosphere rather than a constraint that alters on-page stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Preprocesses reality" appears once in paragraph two as abstract description ("the dust seemed to preprocess reality, shaping the air around it") and is later rephrased as "reshaping it, through accumulated patterns." The attribute is told but never demonstrated—we do not see how preprocessing differs from ordinary interaction or what cost it imposes. No middle beat uses this trait to enable or constrain a choice. Ornamental labeling without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Decay is present from the inciting context (storm-damaged greenhouse) and recurs as Elara maps the space's transformation and links it to neutron-star collapse. It motivates her experiments and anchors the thematic question. However, decay itself does not drive key turns—Elara's experiments proceed without decay accelerating, reversing, or imposing deadlines. The action is thematic glue rather than a causal lever; swapping "decay" for "stasis" or "entropy" would require only minor edits. Present across beats but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Accumulated dust patterns are introduced in paragraph three, developed through middle beats (Elara sprinkles dust, patterns shift and respond), and appear at closure (patterns coalesce into the butterfly). The method shapes her experimental approach but its mechanics remain vague—no explanation of why accumulation matters or what cost interrupting a pattern would impose. The method is functional but swappable (any iterative process could serve). Meets two gates (middle, closure) but lacks causal pressure or specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is established early with vivid detail (shattered glass, brackish water, skeletal frame) and recurs as the site of all action. It provides thematic resonance (ruin → creation) but does not constrain Elara's choices—she moves freely, experiments without resource limits, and the environment's hazards (cold, unstable structure) are mentioned once and forgotten. The setting charges the final image symbolically but does not pressure tactics. Present in all three gates but remains a backdrop rather than a shaping force.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the flood" anchors the opening context and "days turned into weeks" marks elapsed time in paragraph five, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions. No deadline, decay clock, or seasonal pressure forces Elara to act; experiments proceed at leisure. The flood is a completed event that sets mood but does not constrain present choices. Setup gate met, but no development or closure participation. Swappable with any post-disaster marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to strip away the needless drama of her life, to focus on what truly mattered" is stated in paragraph three and echoed at closure ("the dust had stripped away the needless drama"). However, it is never dramatized—no on-page choice shows Elara renouncing something concrete (a relationship, a career path, a competing project) in favor of focus. The desire is told and thematically reinforced but does not generate friction or constrain a middle beat. Present in setup and closure as theme, absent from development as motive-in-action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Kindled humility appears explicitly in paragraph four ("She felt a kindled humility, a sense of awe") and modulates the tone across beats—Elara observes rather than commands, and the prose favors quiet reverence over triumphalism. The tone is consistent and charges the final image ("quiet reverence"). However, it remains a single static mood without modulation under pressure; no moment tests humility with frustration or impatience. Coherent and closure-linked, but lacks dynamic range or tension with competing emotional states.</comment>
