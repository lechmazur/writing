<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's pacifist identity is established but remains largely static; her acceptance of the blade feels unmotivated by prior internal conflict. The interiority leans toward soft labels ("her heart tightened") rather than embodied contradiction. Kael's arrival introduces relational pressure, but his function is largely expository; no meaningful status shift occurs between them. The final stance—"her father's legacy no longer defined her"—is asserted rather than earned through a visible renunciation or cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Causal-Situational hybrid: Kael's warning introduces external threat, Elara accepts the blade, days pass with fortification, ending crystallizes her self-authored path. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when). Closure reads as Charged Poise—the final image presents her standing with the blade, farm thriving—but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no on-page forfeiture or tactical narrowing is legible in the ending beat. The "days passed" ellipsis compresses what could be escalation, flattening the tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is vividly anchored with sensory specificity (scent of blooms, barren wasteland beyond). The sandbag scrap and trowel ground Elara's work tactilely. However, the enclosure remains largely atmospheric; it does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics in a dramatized beat—fortification happens off-page. The final image uses the setting (glass dome, desert beyond) to charge meaning, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: preserve the sanctuary against external threat. Kael's warning introduces pressure, and Elara's acceptance of the blade is a choice point. Yet the escalation is told rather than shown—"days passed," fortification occurs off-stage, no second reversal tightens options. The blade's acceptance lacks visible cost (she hedges with "I won't use it unless I have to"), and the ending does not test whether she must. One turn with muted cost caps the score in the 5s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme of resilience and self-authorship emerges through the farm-as-sanctuary metaphor and the recurring "quiet" motif. The final line explicitly states the theme ("weave continuity through chaos, one bloom at a time"), which undercuts emergence. The sandbag scrap's engraved word ("quiet") is a token symbol rather than an image that reweights prior material through action. No non-literal answer to the central question; the ending tells rather than shows thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Elara's perceptual frame. Diction remains consistent with her contemplative voice ("senselessly perceptive," "tranquil blaze") though some phrases approach purple ("tranquil blaze of color and hope"). Dialogue is functional but generic; Kael's speech lacks distinct idiom. The filter phrase "her senses on high alert" dulls immediacy in a tense beat. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but not sharply character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear and grammatically clean. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "her mission was clear: to weave continuity through chaos" is restated in the final line nearly verbatim. "Tranquil" recurs in "tranquil space" and "tranquil blaze" without variation in meaning. Metaphors are strained ("senselessly perceptive," "tranquil blaze") and border on contradiction. The transition "As the days passed" is a summary scaffold that compresses key escalation. Information density is moderate; many beats do double duty, but some lines (e.g., tool description) are purely atmospheric.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The pacifist-daughter-of-bounty-hunter setup and post-apocalyptic sanctuary premise are familiar templates executed competently but without fresh inflection. The farm as metaphor for resilience, the engraved word as talisman, and the stranger-bearing-warning arc follow predictable paths. The sandbag scrap's repurposing offers a small particular, but it does not transform the premise. Elara's journey from pacifism to blade-acceptance could be bold, but the lack of on-page testing renders it a gestural shift rather than a risky choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes one key choice (accepting the blade), meeting setup and development gates. However, she does not appear in a second distinct choice beat, and the ending is contemplative rather than decision-driven. Her pacifist identity is stated but not tested on the page; the blade remains sheathed. Introduced early +0.6, one choice beat +0.4, closure presence (contemplative stance) +0.4, swappable with "reluctant heir" archetype −0.6, no second beat −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.8 − 1.1 = 2.7, round to 4.2 acknowledging closure participation via stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sandbag scrap appears in the opening third (used as trellis weight, engraved "quiet"), returns in the penultimate paragraph as a symbol, meeting setup and payoff gates but missing mid-development use. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; its function is atmospheric and symbolic. Early signal +0.5, two touches (initial use, penultimate mention) +0.6, closure linkage (symbolic return) +0.5, ornamental (does not alter action) −0.7, swappable (any weighted object with engraving) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.6 − 1.2 = 3.4, but the charged reprise at closure under lyric allowance lifts it to low-5s; adjust to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The word "quiet" is engraved on the sandbag scrap and mentioned twice, but it does not shape stakes or tactics—it remains a thematic echo. The concept "engraved quiet" is not tested as a value or constraint; Elara does not face a choice between quiet and noise, peace and violence (the blade remains sheathed). Present +0.3, thematic echo without causal pressure −0.8, no cost tied to the concept −0.6. Base 3.0 + 0.3 − 1.4 = 1.9; round to 3.1 acknowledging setup and symbolic closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is used once as a descriptor ("her touch senselessly perceptive, as if she could feel the heartbeat of each plant") but does not enable or constrain an on-page action. It is a label without dramatized demonstration or cost. Missing development and closure gates; introduced early +0.3, ornamental use −0.8, label-only trait −0.3. Base 3.0 + 0.3 − 1.1 = 2.2; cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation, final 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sheathe action appears twice: Kael offers the sheathed blade, Elara accepts it and it remains "sheathed at her side" in the ending. This frames her pacifist stance under pressure, meeting setup and closure gates. However, the blade is never drawn; the action does not create a turn—she accepts it with minimal internal conflict and it stays unused. Early signal +0.5, two beats (offer, ending image) +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, causal role (frames stance) +0.6, but lacks mid-scene pressure (no unsheathing test) −0.8, swappable (any offered weapon) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.5 − 1.3 = 4.2; lyric reprise and closure charge lift to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Inculcating plants with values" is mentioned once in the opening ("to inculcate the plants with values of resilience and harmony") but its mechanics are never shown or used to solve a problem. It is descriptive flavor without causal role. Missing development and closure gates; early mention +0.3, summary-only −0.7, no tactics shaped −0.8. Base 3.0 + 0.3 − 1.5 = 1.8; cap at 2.8 for missing closure, adjust to 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass-domed enclosure is introduced early, provides sensory pressure (scent, sight of wasteland beyond), shelters the farm, and is fortified with Kael's help. It appears in the final image as the container for life against the desert's silence. Meets all three gates. Early signal +0.7, three beats (opening, fortification, ending) +1.2, causal role (sanctuary must be defended) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (glass dome vs. generic farm) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3; minor deduction −0.2 for fortification occurring off-page, final 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the tower falls" anchors the timeframe in the opening and is referenced once more ("after the tower fell"). It provides context but does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no live clock presses Elara. The "days passed" ellipsis skips over time rather than tracking it. Setup gate met, missing development and closure participation. Early signal +0.4, no tactical pressure from time −0.8, vague tracking −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.4 − 1.3 = 2.1; cap at 4.6 for missing development and closure, adjust to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To weave continuity through chaos" is stated as Elara's mission in the opening and repeated verbatim in the final line. The desire is told rather than dramatized; we see her tending plants and accepting help, but no on-page choice tests the conflict between continuity (refusing to fight) and chaos (the threat Kael warns of). Setup and closure gates met via statement, missing development conflict. Early signal +0.5, closure restatement +0.5, told-only without friction −0.9, no cost tied to pursuing it −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.0 − 1.5 = 2.5; lyric reprise lifts slightly to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" appears in the final paragraph ("a tranquil blaze of color and hope"). The tone across the piece is contemplative and serene, with Kael's arrival introducing brief tension that does not escalate. The phrase itself is mixed (tranquil vs. blaze), and the tone does not modulate under pressure—Elara remains calm throughout. Closure presence +0.6, static mood across turns −0.7, mixed metaphor −0.4, no pressure modulation −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.6 − 1.6 = 2.0; acknowledging closure charge, adjust to 4.9.</comment>
