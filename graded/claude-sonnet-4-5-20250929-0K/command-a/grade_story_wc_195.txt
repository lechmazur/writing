<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alaric's motivation ("to capture the shape of possibility") arrives clearly but his internal contradiction remains abstract—withdrawal versus transformation is stated rather than enacted through simultaneous impulses in the peak beats. The gauntlet removal gesture and program-handling provide embodied moments, but the shift from passive knight to "storyteller, a weaver of possibility" feels declared rather than earned through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("shivering bliss," "withdrawn nature") without visceral embodiment at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (greenhouse, Alaric, nightshade). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: vines shift patterns, program ink seeps into skin, the final image of stringless marionette reweights the opening allegiance. However, the cost at closure is conceptual and oblique—Alaric "stands taller" and "feels less burdened," but no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path appears on the page. The resonant reconfiguration lacks the felt price required for high-band closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The alchemical greenhouse with bioluminescent vines and nightshade blooms is vivid and mood-consistent. The vines guide choice by forming marionette-movement patterns, and the program physically vibrates in Alaric's hand, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (center of greenhouse, gravel path, walls), but the greenhouse remains largely atmospheric; it does not constrain a tactical decision with visible cost at closure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing possibility through allegiance—is signaled early and pressure accumulates as vines pulse, program vibrates, and patterns coalesce. However, escalation is textural rather than decision-driven; Alaric observes and receives rather than choosing between competing goods. The final image (stringless marionette, lighter air) reweights meaning but presents no on-page trade-off or visible price. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful tightening is present, but cost legibility is weak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—agency and transformation within constraint—emerges through the marionette imagery, which shifts from tangled strings to no strings at closure. The final image offers a non-literal answer (possibility taking root) without overt moralizing. Yet the program-as-talisman and allegiance-as-promise remain somewhat abstract; the ending tells us Alaric "knew he was no longer just a knight" rather than showing the cost of that knowledge through a specific forfeiture or irreversible act.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization through Alaric. Diction is elevated and rhythmic ("shivering bliss," "seeping into his skin like a tattoo"), matching the mystical greenhouse tone. Perceptual signature is consistent—Alaric notices patterns, weight, warmth—but interiority occasionally slips into prompt-echo phrasing ("murmured allegiance," "shape of possibility"). No dialogue present. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the ending, though some filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("vines pulsed in rhythm with his heartbeat," "ink seeping into his skin like a tattoo"). Template cadence appears in the opening ("His once-fierce gaze…," "He clutched…," "It was the only remnant…") with repetitive "His/He" stems across three lines. Paraphrase loop: "allegiance…was not to a person or a cause, but to the idea that…there could be movement, change, life" restates the motivational claim without added pressure. Information density is moderate; some lines ("as reality itself began to shift") rely on summary rather than concrete action. No loops touch the closure beat directly, limiting penalty accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The marionette-theater-program-as-talisman in an alchemical greenhouse offers a fresh synthesis of images. However, the arc—withdrawn knight sheds burden, becomes storyteller—follows a familiar transformation template without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived-detail friction. The allegiance concept and "shape of possibility" read as prompt-fulfillment abstractions rather than organically discovered stakes. Specificity in the vines and program handling elevates freshness, but the ending's epiphany ("he was no longer just a knight—he was a storyteller") feels declarative rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Alaric (withdrawn knight) is present throughout and makes the decision to unsnap his gauntlet and trace the vines, but most action is receptive (vines show him patterns, program vibrates). His withdrawal is told more than shown in contradictory on-page choices. Setup: present early. Development: gauntlet removal (mid-story action). Payoff: final stance as storyteller. Two gates met, but causal pressure is weak—he observes rather than forces turns. Swappable: another reflective knight would function similarly with minor edits. Late first beat involvement and limited agency cap the score at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The abandoned marionette theater program appears early (setup), is handled in multiple beats (clutched, brushed, vibrates, ink seeps), and its tangled-strings image returns reweighted at closure (stringless marionette). Three gates met. However, the program does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it prompts realization but Alaric does not sacrifice or forfeit anything tied to it. Swappability: a different talisman (amulet, letter) could serve the same function with edits. Solid lyric reprise and beat involvement, but lacks irreplaceability and cost connection for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The murmured allegiance ("A murmured allegiance," he whispered) is present early and Alaric returns to it conceptually at closure ("The murmured allegiance had become a part of him"). Setup and payoff gates met. However, it does not constrain on-page choices—Alaric never faces a decision where allegiance to "something greater" competes with another option. Development gate missing: no middle choice turns on it. It functions as theme echo rather than tactical stake. Lyric reprise present but cost connection absent, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" appears once ("factually mystical light") as descriptive flavor for the vines. Setup: present mid-story. Development: absent—no choice constrained by mystical properties versus factual ones. Payoff: not referenced at closure. Only one gate (weak setup). Label-only use without action pressure or tradeoff. Swappable: "eerie," "supernatural," or "otherworldly" would function identically. No cost tied to the attribute; ornamental mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Unsnapping the gauntlet occurs mid-story: "Without thinking, he unsnapped the clasp of his gauntlet, letting it fall to the ground with a hollow clang. The action felt both reckless and necessary, as though he were shedding a part of his old self." Setup: signaled as symbolic shedding. Development: enables him to trace vines with bare hand immediately after. Payoff: the final stance (armor "feeling less like a burden") echoes the gauntlet moment. Three gates met. However, the action is one gesture in a largely passive arc; major turns (vines forming patterns, program vibrating) occur independently. Swappability: removing helm or sword would serve similar symbolic function. Solid causal linkage and closure echo, but not indispensable—caps mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Through forgotten patterns" appears when vines form "forgotten patterns etched into the very fabric of the greenhouse" that are "the movements of the marionettes." Setup: mid-story. Development: Alaric recognizes and traces these patterns, enabling the final transformation. Payoff: the stringless marionette image at closure represents the patterns' culmination. Two gates (development, payoff) met. The method is specific (marionette movements encoded in vines) and irreplaceable. However, late first appearance (~40% mark) and the method is partially told ("These were the movements") rather than enacted through trial. Cost connection weak: no visible price paid to access or use the patterns. Solid causal role but late signal and modest cost cap high-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night is established immediately and remains the sole location. Setup: opening paragraph. Development: vines supply the patterns Alaric traces, nightshade blooms "glowed brighter" at closure, gravel path and spatial anchors track his movement. Payoff: "the greenhouse was different…air felt lighter" at the end. Three gates met. The setting pressures choice (vines guide him) and charges the final image (blooms glow, vines wave). Irreplaceability high: the endless night and bioluminescent vines are specific to this greenhouse. Cost connection present (transformation occurs within and because of this space). Strong integration across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"As reality shifts" appears in the opening ("Tonight, as reality itself began to shift") and recurs conceptually ("as reality unraveled," "world…no longer felt so fixed"). Setup: present early. Development: the shifting is backdrop, not a ticking constraint—Alaric does not race a deadline or make time-sensitive choices. Payoff: reality has shifted by the end, but the timeframe itself does not tighten tactics. One gate (setup) met. The element functions as atmospheric claim rather than a pressure mechanism. Swappable: "at twilight" or "during the eclipse" would function similarly. No visible cost tied to the timing; told more than enacted through urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To capture the shape of possibility" is stated explicitly mid-story: "'To capture the shape of possibility,' he murmured, his voice steady despite the chaos. That was his motivation." Setup: arrives ~50% through. Development: this desire frames his tracing of the vines and acceptance of transformation. Payoff: "possibility itself had taken root" at closure. Two gates (development, payoff) met, but late setup. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through a choice between competing wants—Alaric never faces friction between capturing possibility and another cost. Desire is present and coherent but lacks on-page conflict or tradeoff. Late arrival and summary delivery cap mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Shivering bliss" appears twice: once mid-story ("he felt a shivering bliss creep into his veins") and again near closure ("in that shivering bliss, he knew"). Setup: mid-story. Development: the tone modulates from "withdrawn" melancholy to bliss as pressure builds. Payoff: charges the final realization. Two gates met (development, payoff). Tone is coherent and modulates with escalation (stillness → trembling air → bliss). However, "shivering bliss" as a phrase reads slightly forced and label-like rather than embodied through contradictory sensory detail. The final image carries the tone but does not depend on this exact phrasing. Solid tonal arc but modest irreplaceability.</comment>
