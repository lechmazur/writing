<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's interior is largely told rather than shown through embodied action under pressure. The "uncommonly serene demeanor" and ethical wrestling remain label-level; we never see contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The moment he stands with renewed purpose reads as an unearned epiphany—the shift from doubt to clarity lacks the micro-choices and visible cost that would ground it. The argument catalyst occurs off-page, so the on-page motivation feels asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early enough. Drive lens: leans Accumulative/Textural (dome imagery, stick patterns) but closure execution is weak. The "reversal" from dismantling to rebuilding narratives is told in reflection, not enacted; no on-page decisive change or felt cost occurs—Elias simply decides, arranges puppets, and leaves satisfied. The final image (stepping into morning air with puppets) lacks undeniable pressure or conceptual cost; the "deeper understanding" is asserted, not made legible through action or renunciation. Apply −0.6 for missing on-page closure with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is vivid and specific (cracked windows, dark screens, warped stage), and the stick's tactile presence recurs across beats. However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice that alters outcome—they function as atmospheric backdrop rather than shaping tactics or charging the final image. The dome's "sanctuary" status is told, not demonstrated through spatial pressure. Selective detail is present but does not meet the 9+ gate (constraint or charge).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ethical storytelling boundaries—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The heated argument occurs off-stage; Elias's reversal from "provocation to manipulation" worry to "rebuild, not dismantle" happens in solitary reflection without encountering resistance, cost, or a tightening choice. No live opposition, no visible price paid, no option foreclosed. The puppet arrangement montage summarizes preparation without dramatizing the ethical calculus or showing what he renounces.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (ethical storytelling, complexity over dismantling) is present but delivered via interior monologue and summary rather than through scene pressure. The campfire story stick and "half-lit epiphanies" risk symbolic convenience—introduced as thematic markers without constraining choice. The ending asserts clarity and deeper understanding without a non-literal image that reweights prior material; instead we get the thesis ("turning conflict into understanding") stated plainly. The piece gestures toward ambiguity but resolves it tidily.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("urbane calligrapher," "meteor hush," "half-lit epiphanies") in ways that feel more authorial than character-particular, though it remains legible. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear frequently but stay voice-motivated. No dialogue present. The perceptual signature is present (tracing stick patterns, noticing dome's echoes) but not sharply character-specific; the voice could belong to many reflective protagonists.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean. Rhythm varies, though several paragraphs open with "Elias" or "As he," creating mild template cadence. Phrases like "half-lit epiphanies," "meteor hush," and "uncommonly serene" are repeated without accumulating new meaning. The puppet-arranging montage ("Hours passed as he worked") tells rather than showing key content. Figurative language is frequent but not overwrought; no loops or major artifacts touch closure. Apply −0.3 for template stems and −0.2 for repeated prompts without payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise—calligrapher uses puppet shows to explore ethics—is specific but not deeply transformed; the ethical dilemma and resolution remain abstract. The radar dome setting is fresh, yet functions as atmosphere rather than integral to conflict. The reversal (dismantle → rebuild) is told in reflection rather than earned through a non-obvious synthesis of prior particulars. The piece feels prompt-driven: elements are checked off (urbane calligrapher, campfire story stick, subversive puppet shows) without organic synthesis. Emotional arc could transfer to another setting and method with minimal change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout but his choices are largely reflective rather than decisive. The key "reversal" occurs in interior monologue; arranging puppets is summarized, not enacted with on-page stakes. No choice creates a turn that narrows options or imposes cost. Present and functional but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The campfire story stick appears in three beats: opening (tracing contours), middle (its "pull" sparks the epiphany), and end (clutched as he leaves). Each mention reweights its meaning slightly (burden → reminder → encouragement), meeting the lyric-reprise standard. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; its role is symbolic, not causal. Mid-band: shapes theme but not action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" is named twice and drives the interior reversal, but the epiphany itself (rebuild vs. dismantle) is asserted rather than earned through on-page friction. The concept shapes thematic claim more than stakes or tactics. Functional but replaceable with "insight" or "realization" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" is mentioned in the opening and alluded to in the ending ("sense of peace," "serenity once more") but never constrains or enables an action with cost. It remains a label that describes Elias rather than a trait that shapes his choices under pressure. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Reverse" appears explicitly in the middle epiphany ("what if he reversed his approach?") and again as theme ("the power of reversal"). It drives the story's conceptual turn but the turn itself is told, not dramatized—no on-page action enacts the reversal with stakes. The idea is load-bearing thematically but not causally. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" is named early (establishing Elias's method) and returns at the end (where he'll stage the new show). However, the shows themselves remain off-page; no puppet show is dramatized, so the method's mechanics never shape an on-page attempt or impose cost. Present in setup and payoff, absent in development. Introduced early but remains summary-only; cap at ~4.6 per missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome anchors the entire scene (setup, middle, end) and supplies vivid detail (dark screens, cracked windows, warped stage). The stage becomes the workspace for arranging puppets, which is causally relevant. However, the dome does not pressure a choice or constrain tactics—it serves as atmospheric container rather than micro-setting that alters outcome. Present across all beats and contributes to the ending's spatial anchor, reaching mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"In the hush left behind by a heated argument" frames the opening and the close ("In the hush left behind by the argument, Elias had found..."). The timeframe is present but does not tighten decisions—hours pass in montage without deadline pressure. The "hush" is more tonal than temporal. Present in framing but does not constrain tactics; lyric reprise without live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To explore ethical storytelling" is named early and drives the interior conflict (provocation vs. manipulation, dismantle vs. rebuild). The motivation shapes the middle epiphany and the ending's resolve. However, it is told rather than dramatized—no on-page choice tests the ethical boundary with visible cost. Desire is clear but friction between wants and costs remains abstract. Functional across beats but lacks on-page dramatization of trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is named once explicitly and evoked in the opening/closing "hush" and "stillness." Tone is coherent—quiet, reflective—but does not modulate with pressure (no escalation on the page) and the final image does not charge it with new cost. Static mood that supports theme but does not tighten or reweight at closure.</comment>
