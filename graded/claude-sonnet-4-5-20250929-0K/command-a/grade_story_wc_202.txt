<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to honor overlooked histories is declared but never dramatized as an internal conflict with contradictory impulses. Her work proceeds smoothly through market, painting, map, and tower without genuine struggle or micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. The lens fragment glows conveniently to guide her, removing agency from discovery. Interiority reads as generic ("her heart quickened," "she felt them around her") without embodied specificity or character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors appear by the opening paragraph, so no penalty applies. The piece unfolds as a series of conveniences—painting reveals map, map leads to tower, murals yield complete narrative—without motivated linkage or visible cost. The ending declares fulfillment ("its purpose fulfilled") but the reader cannot point to a decisive change, renunciation, or felt price on the page; Lila smiles and climbs back to the market unchanged. Under a Causal lens (inferred from "because/therefore" sequencing), the closure unit is absent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is vividly sketched with ropes, pulleys, suspended platforms, and sensory detail (copper, burnt sage). The lens fragment constrains one choice—it illuminates the hidden doorway at the tower—lifting the score into the 6-band. However, the market itself functions as backdrop postcard; Lila moves through it without spatial negotiation or resource constraints affecting tactics. The tower's ivy-hidden door is the sole moment where setting pressure alters outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring forgotten histories—is signaled early but never tested by a competing cost or narrowed option. Lila's journey proceeds linearly: fragment → painting → map → tower → success, with no reversals, obstacles that adapt, or visible prices paid. The fragment "pulses with light" to solve problems rather than requiring agency. The ending claims gratitude from "overlooked histories" but no on-page escalation forces a trade-off or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory and erasure emerges from the premise, and the lens fragment functions as a returning image that shifts meaning (childhood promise → translator's tool → fulfilled purpose). However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("ready for the next world, the next story") rather than letting the image resonate. The tower murals and market paintings encode secrets, a strong thematic vehicle, but the ease of translation removes friction. One meaningful reprise (lighthouse → lens → closure glow) earns mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Lila notices "whispers," "shadows that danced like ghosts," "the weight of untold stories"—elevated diction that fits a translator role but lacks idiosyncratic texture. Psychic distance is consistent. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. The prose modulates slightly with emotional beats (quickening heart, tightening fingers) without dramatic shifts under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "elusively tangible" recurs as a label without evolving function; "the lens fragment in her hand" is restated across beats; "honored," "unfastened," "anchored" cycle as thematic synonyms. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "Lila's [noun]" or "The [noun]." Figurative density is high without muddle: "symphony of whispers," "eternal instant," "labyrinth of ropes" read as stock metaphors. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance atmosphere rather than story. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems (Non-closure Accumulation Cap).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—translator deciphering hidden details in paintings to recover lost histories—offers a fresh synthesis of detective and archivist roles. However, execution leans on familiar beats: mysterious market, coded painting, treasure map, ruined tower, murals that yield complete answers. The lens fragment as quest object follows template logic without transformation. Emotional specificity is thin; the ending's fulfillment lacks risk or ambiguity. No bold structural choices or non-obvious moral calculus elevate the concept beyond mid-functional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lila is present throughout but her translator role manifests as observation and convenient discovery rather than decision-making that alters tactics. She deciphers the painting and follows the map without conflict or cost. Her choices do not create key turns; the narrative unfolds through external revelations (symbol match, map discovery, fragment glow) rather than agency. Present and functional but replaceable with a generic seeker.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lens fragment appears in multiple beats: opening (brushing the edge), market (tightening fingers), descent (guiding), tower (pulsing light, illuminating doorway), and ending (glow fading). It enables the key turn at the tower by revealing the hidden entrance. However, its mechanics are magical convenience rather than earned constraint; it glows when needed without cost. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Specificity is moderate; the lighthouse origin charges it emotionally but the fragment's "key" function could be fulfilled by other objects with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Anchors of intuition" appears as thematic language ("anchor it in the intuition," "her intuition, anchored by the fragment," "her heart anchored in the eternal instant") but does not shape on-page stakes or constrain tactics. Intuition is declared rather than dramatized through misreading, hesitation, or competing interpretations. The concept remains ornamental—mentioned repeatedly but not embedded in choice architecture or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Elusively tangible" is used three times as a descriptor (lens fragment, stories made "elusively tangible again") but does not constrain or enable action with visible cost. The attribute reads as atmospheric label rather than mechanical property. No on-page moment shows the elusive quality altering Lila's approach, creating friction, or imposing a tradeoff. Present but decorative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears twice: unfastening the lens fragment's hidden story (paragraph 1) and unfastening the painting from its frame (paragraph 4). The second instance drives a key turn—revealing the compartment and map—so the action is causally necessary to one major beat. However, the first use is metaphorical summary and the ending uses "unfastened" again as summary ("stories Lila had reclaimed"). The mechanics remain vague. Two-gate presence (setup metaphor, middle action) with one causal beat earns mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The method—deciphering hidden details in paintings—is signaled early ("she deciphered hidden details in paintings") and executed once on-page: Lila finds the spiral-within-triangle symbol in the storm painting, matching the lens etch, and reveals the map behind it. This beat is essential to the middle escalation. However, the method is used only once and does not shape the tower sequence, where murals are translated off-page. Setup and development gates met; closure gate missed. One strong causal beat with early signal but no payoff reprise caps the score in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is vividly described in the opening (ropes, pulleys, platforms, vendors) and provides the spatial frame for the painting discovery. Lila descends from it and returns at the end. However, the market does not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter outcome; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. She navigates it without negotiation, cost, or tactical friction. Setup gate met, development and payoff gates missed. Postcard function trends low despite vivid detail.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "between childhood and now" is present: Lila's childhood in the lighthouse shadow is recounted in paragraph 3, and the present-day quest unfolds across the remaining narrative. However, the time span does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the childhood memory serves as backstory motivation without forcing a present trade-off. The work proceeds across a single day (market to dawn) but no live clock pressures tactics. Setup gate met via backstory; development and payoff gates missed. Functional but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Lila's motivation to honor overlooked histories is stated early ("Her motivation was clear: to honor those stories") and restated at the ending ("she had honored them"). However, it is told rather than dramatized through friction between this desire and a competing cost or fear. The quest proceeds without a moment where honoring histories costs her something else she values. The motivation frames the action but does not create conflict or visible tradeoff. Setup and closure reprise present; development gate (conflicted choice) missed.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Eternal instant" appears four times as a tonal label ("chorus of the eternal instant," "made them elusively tangible again...in the eternal instant," "her heart anchored in the eternal instant") but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through rhythm or diction shift. The tone remains uniformly elevated and contemplative without variance across discovery, descent, and resolution. Static mood without cadence shift or purposeful tension. Present as atmospheric claim but not dramatized through prose texture.</comment>
