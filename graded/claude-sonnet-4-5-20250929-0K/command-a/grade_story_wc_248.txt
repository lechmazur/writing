<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The arsonist remains a cipher—motivation is declared ("rescue a forgotten promise") but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Internal experience is absent; we observe only external movement through rooms. The "analytically intuitive mind" is a label without on-page demonstration of what that costs or enables. Tears at the scroll feel unearned because no prior interiority established emotional stakes or what this promise means to them personally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who, where, and when are named early, but no concrete spatial anchor or time cue grounds the reader until well past 120 words; apply −0.4. The closure—scroll discovered, promise "rescued"—lands as a reveal rather than a decision or reconfiguration with visible cost. The arsonist's agency is passive observation; the scroll solves a problem it did not help create. Drive lens reads as intended Causal but the trail functions as a treasure-hunt checklist without narrowing options or forcing trades.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The archive is described in generic terms ("labyrinth," "maze of corridors," "stone floors") without spatial choreography or sensory hierarchy. No recurring object, tool, or body constraint shapes a choice. The mural and door appear as stage props rather than pressure points. Orientation debt from Q2 caps this category at 7.0 per the global rule, but execution would remain mid-band regardless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"rescue a forgotten promise"—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or trade-off narrows options; the arsonist moves from clue to clue without obstruction or visible cost. The scroll appears as a prize, not the result of agency-driven escalation. Coincidence (finding each next clue) advances the plot without forcing a stance or forfeiting a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated in the final paragraph: "a story that deserved to be told," "volcanic tenderness...guided them through the darkness." The promise/legacy motif is introduced and resolved without accruing pressure or reweighting prior material. The tapestry and portrait function as symbols announced rather than discovered through action. Thematic Echo penalty: the arsonist's closure thought ("rescued...for the world") articulates the thesis directly, replacing earned resonance with declaration; apply −0.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited, but perceptual signature is generic: "their mind already piecing together the puzzle" tells rather than shows the analytical process. Diction remains serviceable but textureless—no distinct rhythm or vocabulary tied to this focalizer. "Volcanic tenderness" is asserted twice but never embodied in syntax or perception under pressure. Orientation debt from Q2 applies the 7.8 cap per global cross-caps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "not to burn but to uncover" / "purpose was not to burn"; "followed the trail" / "follow the trail"; "forgotten promise" appears six times without reweighting. Template cadence: "They [verb]" opener runs across six consecutive beats in the middle third. Stock phrasing: "heart quickened," "tears welled," "sense of closure." Apply cumulative artifact penalty of −1.2 for loops, stems, and cliché strings. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The premise—protagonist solves art-trail puzzle to find hidden message—is a widely used template (treasure hunt in ancient archive) without transformation. The arsonist's nickname and "volcanic tenderness" label promise edge but deliver stock emotional beats. No risk-taking in structure or perspective; the arc is linear checklist progression. The scroll's message (love and sacrifice) offers platitude rather than fresh moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The lending library arsonist is named and present throughout but makes no consequential choice; all actions are observational or procedural (trace, compare, wipe, push). Setup present, no middle constraint, closure passive. Cap 2.8 for missing closure participation; late ornamental crying and leaving do not constitute causal agency. Swappable with "the scholar" or "the detective." Apply −0.5 for label-only trait integration and −0.3 for summary-only involvement at the scroll beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The faded tapestry fragment appears in beat one (placed beside portrait) and beat four (mirrored by mural) but never constrains a choice or evolves in meaning. Setup clear, middle mention present, but closure omits it—scroll replaces the fragment as the resolution object. Two-gate allowance permits up to ~6.0, but swappability (any clue-object works) and ornamental use lower the score. The fragment describes rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is introduced early as "a clue, a starting point" but functions only as the first item in a checklist. It does not shape stakes or force a tactic; the arsonist observes brushstrokes and moves on. Setup present, no middle constraint or cost, absent from closure. Cap 2.8 for missing closure participation; functional presence in one beat adds +0.4. Swappable with any damaged artwork.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is mentioned three times as a label ("their analytically intuitive mind," "allowed them to see patterns") but never shown through a micro-choice with cost or tradeoff. No setup dramatization, no middle constraint, no closure linkage—pure tell without embodiment. Cap 2.8 for missing all three gates; label-only use applies −0.6. The trait could be deleted without altering any action on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Portray" does not appear as an on-page action. The arsonist observes portrayed figures in the tapestry and mural but never portrays anything themselves. If "portray" is interpreted as the act of depicting within the found art, it remains passive observation rather than protagonist action. Zero gates; ornamental interpretation only. The story's turns do not trace to any act of portraying.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The trail of artistic creations (portrait → tapestry → mural → sketches → scroll) is signaled early and structures the middle progression across four beats. Setup clear, middle involvement spans multiple discoveries, but the mechanics are frictionless—each clue simply leads to the next without cost or failed attempt. Closure links to the scroll (final creation in the trail) but the trail itself imposes no constraint. Two-plus gates allow ~6.0 range; swappability (any breadcrumb trail works) and lack of causal pressure lower the score to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is named early and houses all action, satisfying setup. It provides rooms and objects (mural, door, pedestal) but imposes no spatial constraint or resource pressure—navigation is effortless, no locked doors or conflicting paths alter tactics. Middle involvement is scenic only; closure occurs inside the archive but the setting does not charge the final image. Two gates allow ~6.0 eligibility; postcard-level description and zero tactical pressure lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" is mentioned once in the opening paragraph as backstory context but never functions as a live timeframe on the page. No clock pressure, no mention of risk from being off-grid, no tactical constraint tied to elapsed time. Setup mention only, no middle or closure presence. Cap 2.8 for missing development and closure gates; vague/untracked application applies additional −0.6. The phrase is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To rescue a forgotten promise" is named as motivation in the first paragraph and restated at closure ("rescued the forgotten promise"), satisfying setup and closure gates. However, the motivation is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—no friction between the promise and another desire, no trade-off forced. Middle presence is label-only (repeated assertions). Two gates allow ~6.0 eligibility; told-only with zero friction lowers the score. Apply −0.6 for summary-only and −0.5 for swappability (any rescue-mission motive works).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" is labeled twice (opening and near closure: "fierce determination cloaked in delicate reverence," "volcanic tenderness...guided them") but never embodied in diction, rhythm, or contradictory action. The prose remains uniform and declarative throughout; no modulation under pressure. Setup label present, absent from middle beats, restated at closure without tonal charge. Cap 2.8 for missing middle development; static-mood penalty applies. The tone is told, not performed.</comment>
