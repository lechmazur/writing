<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("protect vulnerable voices") is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. Her curiosity drives movement but faces no visible cost or friction—she finds each clue cleanly and proceeds without misstep. The whisper commands "Find the last photograph" and she complies without internal resistance or competing desire. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("her heart quickened," "incidental heroism") rather than embodied, character-specific perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early (atrium, twilight, hearing aid on pedestal). The causal lens is attempted but weakens: the hearing aid pulses guide Elara to the photograph without reversal or complication, and the "Protect her story" whisper offers no on-page cost or foreclosed path—Elara simply slips the photo into her satchel and exits. Closure reads as summary rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the final paragraph asserts "incidental heroism" and "profound discoveries" without dramatizing the price or reweighting prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and hearing aid anchor setting and object; the photograph's sepia tone and frayed edges add texture. However, the environment does not constrain choice—mist parts obligingly, corridors lead cleanly to the goal, and the marble archway functions as backdrop rather than pressure point. The hearing aid's "faint pulses" are mentioned but their mechanics remain vague, and the atrium's spatial choreography is loose (center, corridors, archway, exit) without grounded distance or barrier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled: protect vulnerable voices by finding the photograph. No meaningful reversal occurs—each pulse leads cleanly to the next breadcrumb, and the discovery of the photograph feels like a fetch quest rather than a choice under pressure. Agency is observation rather than decision; Elara does not forfeit, refuse, or endure with visible cost. The whisper "Protect her story" is obeyed without complication, and the resolution ("slipped the photograph into her satchel") lacks dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Theme ("protect vulnerable voices," "incidental heroism") is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from concrete action. The final paragraph moralizes: "even the faintest pulse could lead to the most profound discoveries," replacing scene pressure with assertion. The photograph's smile is labeled "both radiant and haunted," but the story does not dramatize why this matters or what cost Elara accepts to preserve it. Subtext is absent in the whisper exchanges, which function as direct commands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("reeling hush," "incidental heroism," "profound discoveries") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Elara's perceptual signature is generic—she notices mist, pulses, and a photograph without idiosyncratic bias or selective attention. The whisper's fragmented speech ("Find the last photograph," "Protect her story") lacks naturalism or subtext. Psychic distance is consistent but the prose reads as neutral summary rather than a lived consciousness under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops: "contact tracer for hearts" → "protect vulnerable voices"; "faint pulses" recurs without variation; "incidental heroism" appears twice in near-identical constructions. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "she had done what she could," "her incidental heroism a quiet but powerful force," "a reminder that even the faintest pulse…" stack summaries rather than images. Stock metaphors: "mist swirled around her ankles," "clinging to her skin like a second layer of sorrow." Figurative language appears in most sentences of the final beat without pattern-teaching or payoff, applying −0.5. No grammar or tense errors, and information density is adequate in the search sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise—mystical contact tracing via a decades-old hearing aid—leans on template "magical investigator finds artifact" plotting without transformation. "Incidental heroism" is asserted as meta-commentary rather than earned through specific choice. The atrium, mist, twilight, and sepia photograph are stock gothic-romantic furnishings; no element carries a non-obvious inflection. The search sequence (pulses → corridors → archway → photograph) unfolds without surprise or risk, and the ending's "ongoing quest" framing promises continuation rather than closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Contact tracer for hearts" is introduced in paragraph one but remains a label; Elara's role does not constrain tactics or create friction. She receives a summons, follows pulses, and retrieves the photograph without professional procedure, ethical trade-off, or failure mode tied to her occupation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears at the midpoint (marble archway beat) and returns in the satchel at closure. It shapes one turn—discovery—but does not reweight meaning or constrain later choice; Elara slips it away and exits. Early signal is absent (setup gate missed), and the photograph is described rather than handled in a way that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is mentioned twice as thematic commentary but never dramatized on the page. Elara does not act heroically in the sense of sacrifice, risk, or unintended consequence—she completes a summoned task cleanly. The concept does not shape stakes or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Curiosity is mentioned four times ("curiosity piqued," "curiosity drove her forward," "curiosity had led her here") but functions as motivation-label rather than a trait that constrains action. No on-page moment shows curiosity costing Elara time, safety, or competing priority; she is summoned, pursues, and succeeds without friction tied to this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Assure" appears once late ("to assure that this voice… would not be lost") as narrated intention. The action does not drive a turn or closure moment; Elara's retrieval of the photograph is the visible act, and "assure" is interchangeable with "ensure" or "protect" without changing the story.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tracking faint pulses via the hearing aid is signaled early (paragraph one: "faint pulses," paragraph two: "pressed it to her ear") and drives the search sequence across two beats (corridors, archway). The mechanics remain vague—how pulses encode direction is unexplained—but the method enables the discovery and is referenced at closure when "the hearing aid's pulses had faded."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is named in the opening line and frames the entire scene. However, it functions as backdrop; mist "parts" obligingly at the end, and the atrium's labyrinthine corridors do not create navigation friction or resource constraint. The setting is present across all beats but does not alter tactics or charge the final image beyond mood.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"When the dead call" appears once as exposition ("summoned when the dead call") but does not impose a temporal constraint or tighten decision pressure. The timeframe is metaphorical rather than urgent; no clock or consequence is attached to delay, and the story unfolds at contemplative pace.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To protect vulnerable voices" is stated in paragraph one and reiterated in paragraph four ("her motivation to protect vulnerable voices"). It frames the mission but is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. Elara does not sacrifice, refuse, or endure to protect; she completes the task cleanly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" is used three times (opening, mid-search, closing). Tone is consistently quiet and contemplative, modulating slightly as mist thickens and then parts. However, the tone remains static mood rather than charging the final image with new pressure; the ending recycles the opening's "reeling hush" without reweighting it.</comment>
