<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's "monthly molting" trait is label-only; it never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible friction. His motivation to "forge beauty from anarchy" remains abstract—he writes poems and stands on rooftops, but no micro-choice reveals competing impulses or costs. Clara is functionally interchangeable; her backstory (the grandfather's letters) delivers exposition without altering her present stance. The ending declares permanence ("this self…was here to stay") without dramatizing the renunciation or trade-off that would earn it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the library becomes a "sanctuary," poems accumulate on walls, and the ending gestures toward reconfiguration. However, the closure unit is purely declarative—"they knew they had forged something beautiful"—with no on-page cost or visible before/after pressure. The coffee tin's false bottom and the grandfather's letters arrive mid-story but function as backstory exposition rather than altering present tactics. Orientation is clear (vagrant poet, rusted library, evening/night), but the lack of a legible cost at closure prevents high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rusted library is vividly anchored (iron gates, dust, sagging shelves, rooftop view) and recurs across beats. The coffee tin's "dented and worn" surface and "secret false bottom" are concrete, though the tin itself does not constrain a choice—it delivers letters, not pressure. Sensory detail is selective (moon clearing skyline, air smelling of dust) but remains postcard-level; the setting does not alter tactics or charge the final image beyond backdrop. Spatial choreography is clean, and the library-as-symbol is consistent, earning mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming the library into a sanctuary—is signaled early but never tightens meaningfully. No on-page reversal or trade-off narrows options; Elias and Clara simply "work," and the library "glows with newfound vitality" by declaration. The poems go from "scattered like leaves" to painted on walls, but the transition is summarized, not dramatized. Agency is present (they choose to rebuild) but costs are invisible—no stamina, resource, or social friction materializes. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift would suffice, but the ending softens rather than sharpens pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—resilience, rebuilding, "blooming resistance"—emerges through recurrence (library as sanctuary, poems as "luminous fracture") but is repeatedly stated rather than embodied in a charged image. "Patching is how we rebuild" and "forge beauty from anarchy" are thesis statements, not discoveries earned through friction. The grandfather's wartime letters echo Elias's belief but arrive as exposition. The final rooftop moment ("the library whispered its own story") reads as authorial summary, not a resonant repricing. The prompt's "luminous fracture" label appears on the page without transforming into a concrete choice or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV control is clean; Elias's perceptual filter is consistent (coat patched with stories, verses on scraps). Dialogue is sparse but functional: Clara's "Do you ever feel like we're just patching things up?" carries subtext, and Elias's reply advances his worldview. However, register drifts into elevated metaphor clusters ("blooming resistance," "luminous fracture," "map of scars") that feel authorial rather than vagrant-particular. Free indirect style is stable, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose voice is distinctive but occasionally inflates beyond the focalizer's idiom, preventing higher placement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "a testament to resilience and hope" echoes "stories of resilience and hope"; "not just physically, but as a sanctuary" mirrors "more than a repository…a symbol." Metaphor density is high ("streets whispered," "moon cleared," "river breaking through a dam") without clear payoff, and some vehicles are strained ("molted personalities monthly" is asserted but never visualized). Filter-verb stacks ("began to see," "felt a jolt," "thought of") dull immediacy in reflective beats. Information density is uneven—exposition about the grandfather and monthly molting pads without advancing present pressure. No grammatical errors, but momentum sags under decorative phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The vagrant-poet-rebuilds-library premise follows a familiar redemption-through-art template without transformation. "Molts personalities monthly" is a quirky label that never materializes as a constraint or choice. The coffee tin's false bottom is a stock discovery device; the grandfather's wartime letters deliver thematic echo without complicating Elias's path. Tropes (rusted sanctuary, poems-on-walls, rooftop epiphany) are executed competently but predictably. The ending's "they knew they had forged something beautiful" restates the opening motivation without fresh synthesis or risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and initiates the library work, but his vagrant status and poet identity do not drive a key turn—he could be any idealistic volunteer. His final rooftop reflection and act of writing are passive; the decision to stay ("this self…was here to stay") is declared, not tested by a choice that forecloses an option. Early signal present, but causal pressure and closure linkage are weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The coffee tin appears mid-story (after the 40% mark), its false bottom revealed in one beat. It delivers the grandfather's letters, which provide thematic backstory but do not constrain a present choice. The tin is not handled again or reweighted at closure. Two-gate fulfillment (development, payoff via backstory) but swappable with any heirloom container; no specific cost tied to the tin itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Blooming resistance" is named twice as theme and symbolized by the library's transformation, but it never shapes a tactic or narrows an option. It functions as an abstract thematic label rather than a force that alters on-page pressure. Present as atmosphere, replaceable as a stake driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The monthly personality-molting trait is mentioned in the opening and referenced once at the end ("he thought of his monthly molting"), but it never constrains or enables an action. No visible cost, no trade-off; it remains a decorative curiosity. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is signaled early (opening motivation), recurs across beats (sorting books, painting poems on walls), and frames the ending ("patching is how we rebuild"). The action drives multiple scenes and ties to closure. However, the rebuilding is summarized rather than dramatized at key moments—no single turn depends on a specific rebuild choice. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but swappable execution lowers irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prison-library friendship is signaled early ("sorted books in the prison library") and enables the relationship that drives the rebuild work. The method matters: the institutional setting (prison library) implies access and shared purpose. It shapes the middle action (sorting books together) and underpins the ending's sanctuary transformation. Three gates met, causal pressure present, but the prison detail could be edited to "community library" with minor loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rusted library is anchored early (iron gates, dust, sagging shelves) and recurs across beats (rooftop, walls for poems). Its decay and transformation frame the stakes. However, the setting does not constrain a tactic—rust and neglect are atmospheric, not tactical obstacles. The rooftop scene charges the ending image, fulfilling closure linkage. Three gates, but the library's mechanics (access, resources, spatial friction) remain unexplored.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"As the moon clears the skyline" frames the opening evening; the moon reappears at the rooftop ending ("the moon hung low"). However, time does not tighten decisions—night provides atmosphere, not a deadline. The timeframe is vague (one evening? weeks of work?) and does not alter tactics. Present as poetic bracket, not as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To forge beauty from anarchy" is stated early and echoed in Elias's recognition of the grandfather's belief. It drives his choice to write poems and rebuild the library, fulfilling setup and development. However, the motivation is never dramatized as a friction between competing desires or costs—no scene tests what Elias would sacrifice for beauty. Closure restates the motivation rather than repricing it. Functional but told more than shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Luminous fracture" is named once in the text ("Each verse was a luminous fracture") and gestured at in the ending ("luminous fractures and blooming resistance"). Tone is melancholic-hopeful throughout, modulating slightly as the library glows, but "luminous fracture" as a tonal signature does not charge the final image—it remains a thematic label. Present as metaphor, not as modulation or constraint.</comment>
