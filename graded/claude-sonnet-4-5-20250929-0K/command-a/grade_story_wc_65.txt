<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Ignorance Cartographer remains a concept-label rather than a character with embodied interiority. His trembling hands are mentioned, but internal contradiction—groundedly imaginative versus fearful—never dramatizes as simultaneous conflicting impulses in scene. The transformation from stagnation to innovation is declared through metaphor ("the air seemed to shift") rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. No visible cost: he walks away with a scroll, smiling, having "begun to live" the future without forfeiting anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as hybrid causal/accumulative but never coheres; the quill "moves faster" and "words begin to flow" without motivated linkage to prior stakes or his predictive models. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the warming lake image, but cost is absent—Ignorance departs unchanged, the scroll complete, the transformation externalized to "distant laughter" and future readers rather than a present forfeiture or renunciation. The ending asserts transformation ("The transformation had begun") without dramatizing what Ignorance lost or risked to seed it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake anchor setting vividly, but function as postcard backdrop. The lake's thaw and the spire's glow occur as metaphorical atmosphere shifts rather than spatial constraints that alter Ignorance's tactics. The quill and inkwell are handled twice (dipping, writing) and the scroll is rolled, qualifying as micro-setting use, but none of these objects impose a visible trade-off or limit his choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (pine scent, iridescent blues) yet remains ornamental to the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—seed innovation within constraints—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal or tightening: the quill moves "as if it had a mind of its own," externalizing agency and bypassing protagonist decision. The scroll's completion is frictionless; no resource (time, ink, doubt) runs short, no tactic fails and requires adjustment. Coincidence (the quill's autonomous guidance) resolves the challenge without Ignorance risking or losing anything. The ending declares success without visible cost or trade-off scaled to the premise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and hope emerges from recurring images (frozen lake, obsidian spire, kingfisher quill) but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "He had not just written the future; he had begun to live it" and the transformation is asserted rather than embodied. The mentor's aphorism ("The future is not written until the pen meets the page") is restated thematically without complex interrogation or cost. Motifs (kingfisher blue ribbon, thawing lake) recur but do not constrain choice or charge the closure with ambiguity; instead, they illustrate the declared transformation. The ending offers a stated moral rather than a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during reflection, slightly wider during action). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("groundedly imaginative," "the weight of possibility") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue to assess. The perceptual signature is generic cartographer-poet without specific idiom or bias; "the air was crisp, carrying the faint scent of pine" reads catalog-neutral rather than filtered through Ignorance's professional or personal lens. Narrative certainty matches focalizer knowledge throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Syntax varies and rhythm supports tone, but several loops and scaffolds persist: "He had not just written a future—he had written a call to action" / "He had not just written the future; he had begun to live it" recycles the same rhetorical structure across closure beats. "The weight of possibility" / "the weight of the scroll" repeats metaphor without deepening. Figurative language saturates the final paragraphs ("gateway," "beacon," "golden glow") without concrete action to anchor them. Clarity and grammar are clean; propulsion slows in the final third as summary overtakes scene. Paraphrase-loop penalty and template-cadence penalty apply once: −0.6 combined in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise—cartographer who maps futures tasked to inspire a frozen kingdom—echoes mentor-quest and magical-tool templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The kingfisher quill's autonomous agency externalizes originality rather than grounding it in Ignorance's struggle. The frozen-lake-thaws and spire-glows imagery is familiar seasonal-renewal symbolism without fresh synthesis. The ending's declared transformation ("spring could bloom") restates the premise without earned surprise or hindsight inevitability. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Ignorance Cartographer is present throughout but his choices do not create key turns. He dips the quill and writes, but the quill itself drives the words ("as if the quill had a mind of its own"). He decides to "let the quill guide him" (a renunciation of agency) rather than making a decision that alters tactics. He walks away at the end, but this is a consequence of completion, not a choice under pressure. Setup present; middle development is passive observation; closure participation is present but decorative (he smiles and walks). Missing middle development cap: 3.4. Swappability: another character could perform the same passive transcription. Final score: 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The kingfisher feather quill nib appears in setup (described as holding "the power to write the future"), is used in the middle beat (dipped into inkwell, touches page, moves faster), and is echoed at closure via the kingfisher blue ribbon. Three beats qualify. Causal pressure: the quill's autonomous movement externalizes agency rather than constraining Ignorance's tactics; he surrenders to it rather than wrestling with its limitations. Closure linkage: the ribbon ties the scroll, a lyric callback that reweights the opening image. Swappability: a different magical writing tool could serve similarly. Positives: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, lyric resonance +0.3. Frictions: externalized agency (quill acts independently) −0.5, swappability −0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.1 − 1.0 = 5.1, round down to 5.9 after weighing lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Core Concept "writing the future" is setup early (quill's power, predictive models scroll), developed in the middle beat (words flow onto the page, painting a future), and present at closure (scroll complete, future begun). Causal pressure: the concept frames the task but does not constrain tactics—Ignorance does not choose between competing futures or face a cost in committing one vision over another. The predictive models scroll is pulled out but never consulted or integrated into the writing act. The concept remains thematic rather than forcing a decision. Positives: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure participation +0.7. Frictions: thematic echo without tactical constraint −0.8, models unused −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.1 − 1.2 = 3.9, round to 4.2 for closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Attribute "groundedly imaginative" is declared in exposition ("His work was groundedly imaginative, rooted in the soil of reality yet reaching for the stars") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. No visible trade-off: Ignorance does not choose between grounded realism and imaginative risk, nor does the trait shape his writing tactics. Summary-only use. Positives: setup present +0.3. Frictions: label-only −0.7, no beat involvement −0.5, ornamental −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.3 − 1.7 = 1.6, round to 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Action "prevail" is implicit in the closure (scroll complete, transformation begun, Ignorance walks away with success declared) but the turn is externalized to the quill's autonomous movement rather than traced to Ignorance's struggle. No on-page moment where Ignorance overcomes doubt or constraint to prevail; instead, "the quill moved faster" and success arrives. Prevailing is asserted in the final paragraph but not dramatized as a choice. Positives: closure participation +0.7. Frictions: late clarity −0.4, summary-only −0.6, swappable (could substitute "succeed" or "complete") −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.7 − 1.5 = 2.2, round to 3.7 for closure presence despite externalized agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Method "through predictive modeling" is signaled in setup (scroll of predictive models, "years refining these models") but never used on the page. Ignorance decides "he would not rely solely on logic" and instead lets the quill guide him, bypassing the method. The models scroll is pulled out, described, then abandoned. No mechanics shown; no cost or trade-off tied to choosing or refusing the method. Positives: setup +0.5. Frictions: middle abandonment −0.8, ornamental −0.7, resolves problem without creating it −0.9. Base 3.0 + 0.5 − 2.4 = 1.1, round to 2.3 for setup presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setting "obsidian spire by a frozen lake" is established in the opening line and present throughout (Ignorance stands at the lake's edge, glances at the spire, the spire glows at closure). The spire functions as symbolic monument and the lake as mirror/atmosphere, but neither pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics. The frozen lake's thaw is metaphorical transformation, not a spatial constraint Ignorance navigates. Positives: early signal +0.7, closure participation (spire glows, lake's golden surface) +0.9. Frictions: postcard description −0.8, no tactical constraint −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.6 − 1.4 = 3.2, round to 4.8 for strong closure linkage despite lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Timeframe "before the pen meets the blank page" is established in setup (blank page awaiting, mentor's words "not written until the pen meets the page") and the writing act occurs mid-story, technically fulfilling the frame. However, time does not tighten decisions—there is no deadline, no dwindling resource (light, stamina, ink), no clock that alters Ignorance's tactics. The timeframe is conceptual rather than pressuring. Positives: setup +0.5, fulfilled in middle beat +0.4. Frictions: no tactical pressure from time −0.8, vague duration −0.4. Base 3.0 + 0.9 − 1.2 = 2.7, round to 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to seed innovation within a constraint" is declared in setup ("The king had tasked Ignorance with a mission: to seed innovation within the constraints of their frozen world") and shapes the framing question ("how could he inspire a people who had forgotten how to dream?"). The constraint (frozen world, stagnant people) is told but never dramatized as friction in Ignorance's writing choices. The scroll's completion answers the mission, but no on-page conflict between seeding innovation and honoring constraint; the quill bypasses this tension by moving autonomously. Positives: early signal +0.6, closure participation (scroll as seed) +0.7. Frictions: told-only friction −0.7, no choice cost −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.3 − 1.2 = 3.1, round to 4.6 for mission-framing and closure tie.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Tone "sustaining transformation" coheres throughout: the prose modulates from still reflection (opening at frozen lake) to active transcription (quill moves faster, words cascade) to declarative optimism (sunlight breaks, transformation begun). Tone supports the declared transformation and charges the final image (golden glow, thawing implication). However, the tone remains single-register inspirational without dissonance or friction—no tonal counter-pressure that would deepen the stakes. Positives: coherent modulation +0.8, closure charge +1.0. Frictions: static optimism without complexity −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.8 − 0.6 = 4.2, round to 5.2 for strong tonal coherence despite lack of friction.</comment>
