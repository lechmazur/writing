<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's "combative tenderness" and "walks backwards when nervous" are told rather than shown in action under pressure. Her motivation "to mentor resilience quietly" is declared but never tested in concrete choice—the annotation work proceeds without dramatized internal conflict or trade-off. The reflection on past mentees blurs into summary; no on-page micro-choice tilts her stance or forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("weight of her motivation," "scars badges of honor") without character-particular contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (forgotten library, Elara, shard-mirror task) arrive early. The piece unfolds as a single extended scene with one dominant stake (annotating the shadow). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shadow "softens," the library feels "alive again," and Elara's backwards walk steadies—but the cost is asserted rather than shown (no path is foreclosed, no tactical consequence visible on the page). The final paragraph tells us the work succeeded without dramatizing what was risked or lost, reducing closure to declaration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library is vivid (dust motes, cracked windows, aged paper and damp wood) and the shard-mirror appears in multiple beats. Setting detail is purposeful but does not constrain a choice at closure—Elara completes her task without the environment supplying friction or altering tactics. The tea-leaf parchment and oolong steam are sensory and specific, but the annotation method feels ornamental rather than spatially urgent. Strong sensory work; spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (annotate the shadow to free it) is signaled early and coherent throughout. Pressure is declared ("its shadow seemed to mock her," "weight that pressed her") but not dramatized through reversals or tightening choices—Elara's work proceeds smoothly to success. The annotation is completed without visible trade-off or narrowing of options; the shadow's "response" to her words is asserted, not earned by prior resistance. One deepening (tea-leaf geometry to written annotation) but no cost legible on the page at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of exile, return, resilience, and voicelessness emerges organically from the shard-mirror conceit and Elara's past. The final image ("more shadows to free, more stories to tell") gestures toward open continuation but does not reweight prior material with fresh pressure—it restates the premise rather than repricing it. "Combative tenderness" is invoked as a label rather than demonstrated in syntax or choice. No thematic echo penalty, but the ending resolves into platitude ("gave voice to the voiceless") without concrete cost or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows some specificity (tea leaves as language, backwards walk) but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("combative tenderness," "essence of reversible exile") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Syntax is controlled but leans on repetitive participial openers ("its silence both haunting," "her words flowing like a river"). Voice reads as authorial-literary rather than distinctly Elara's mind under pressure. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") are frequent but voice-motivated; no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean. Figurative density is high throughout ("dust motes danced," "steam curling like whispers," "scars badges of honor," "river breaking through a dam") without pattern-teaching or payoff—register drifts into poetic ornament that slows momentum. Paraphrase loop in paragraph 2: "shard-mirror before her was no ordinary artifact. Its surface held the trapped shadow…its edges frayed" restates the same idea across adjacent sentences. Template cadence in final paragraph: "She had not just annotated…she had given…" stacks parallel constructions. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph), triggering artifact cap; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8 per penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist, tea-leaf geometry, and reversible-exile conceit form a distinctive premise. Execution leans on familiar fantasy-archive tropes (forgotten library, magical artifact, lone scholar) without transforming them through ground-level cost or non-obvious moral calculus. Elara's arc (nervous scholar completes task, finds resolve) follows a safe, median template. The annotation succeeds without setback or surprise; the shadow's response is convenient. Specific vocabulary ("shard-mirror," "geometry of tea leaves") provides surface texture, but the emotional and causal architecture remains generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her task (annotation) drives the action. Her choices are procedural (brew tea, scatter leaves, trace crescent, write) rather than fork-in-the-road decisions that narrow options or alter tactics under resistance. No on-page reversal stems from her agency—she proceeds smoothly to success. The backwards walk is mentioned but not shown constraining a beat. Functional but replaceable; a generic scholar could perform the same arc with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shard-mirror and its trapped shadow appear in paragraphs 2, 4, and 5, framing the task and returning at closure when "its shadow seemed to shimmer…its edges softening." Early setup, mid-beat focus (paragraph 4: "its silence louder than any scream"), and closure participation (paragraph 5: "no longer felt like a prison but a portal") meet all three gates. However, the glass does not constrain Elara's method or narrow her options—she completes the work without dramatized friction from the object itself. Causal role is present but the object's response is asserted rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Reversible exile is named in paragraph 1 and echoed thematically ("exile and return, loss and redemption") in paragraph 5, but it does not shape on-page tactics or narrow Elara's choices. The concept is treated as metaphor and backstory rather than a mechanical rule that constrains her annotation process. It frames the stakes conceptually but does not alter the action—swappable with "forgotten memory" or "sealed past" without structural change. Present and thematically consistent but not causally necessary.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The backwards walk is mentioned twice (paragraph 1: "walked backwards when nervous, a habit"; paragraph 6: "backwards walk to the door was steady") but never dramatized in scene—no on-page moment shows her moving backward, and it does not constrain or enable an action with cost. It functions as a character-label rather than a trait that alters tactics or charges a beat. Ornamental mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Annotation is the central action: introduced in paragraph 1, executed with tea-leaf geometry in paragraphs 2 and 5, and completed at closure when "her work complete." The annotation shapes two beats (setup and execution) and the closure hinges on its success. Removing "annotate" would require reimagining the entire task. However, the method is smooth and unopposed—no reversal or setback tests the action, reducing its pressure. Essential across beats and ending, but the lack of dramatized resistance keeps it below indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry is introduced in paragraph 2 ("analyzed the geometry of tea leaves…language older than words"), executed with concrete detail (brew oolong, scatter leaves, trace crescent moon), and mentioned in the final annotation beat ("tea leaves forming shapes…mountains and valleys"). Early signal, middle use (two beats), and closure linkage (paragraph 5) meet all three gates. The method is specific and non-generic, but it does not impose constraint—Elara reads the leaves without friction or ambiguity, making the method feel decorative rather than a pressure source. Shapes one key turn (geometry → written annotation) but lacks cost or resistance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (dust, cracked windows, groaning shelves, aged paper, damp wood) and returns at closure ("library…felt alive again"). The setting provides atmosphere and recurring presence across all beats. However, it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply friction—she completes her work without the environment imposing cost or altering tactics. Setup and payoff are strong; middle development is atmospheric but not causal. Essential to tone but not to the action's pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze" is invoked as metaphor in paragraph 1 and echoed in the final line ("wind whispered through the cracked windows") but does not track elapsed time or tighten decisions. The scene unfolds in unspecified duration ("as the last rays of sunlight faded" in paragraph 5) without urgency or a ticking clock that alters Elara's tactics. Present as atmospheric image but does not function as temporal pressure. Ornamental mention without causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to mentor resilience quietly" is stated in paragraph 1 and reflected upon in paragraph 4 ("she had taught them to find strength in silence"), but it is never dramatized in a conflicted on-page choice—Elara's annotation work does not pit this desire against a competing cost or test it under friction. The motivation frames her backstory but does not shape the present action's stakes or tactics. Told rather than shown; swappable with "to preserve forgotten knowledge" without altering the plot. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is named in paragraphs 2 and 5 but not embodied in syntax, gesture, or micro-choice—the prose leans toward elevated, lyrical description without the jagged friction the phrase implies. Tone remains contemplative and serene throughout, with no sharp modulation or contradiction that would charge the final image. The label is asserted rather than enacted. Present as thematic claim but does not constrain style or charge closure. Mid-band for coherence without causal pressure.</comment>
