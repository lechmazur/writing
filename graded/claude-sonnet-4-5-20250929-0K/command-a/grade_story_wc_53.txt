<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "negotiate with her own ghost" remains abstract throughout; the ghost is defined as "a shadow of her eroded ambitions" but never dramatized as a choice-forcing pressure. Interiority relies on therapeutic summary ("regret clung to her like a second skin") rather than embodied contradiction. The camera wheel's voice offering wisdom feels like an external solution rather than a choice Mara earns through prior struggle, undermining agency at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—"kinetic lagoon above the clouds" and "after the carousel halted" anchor setting and timeframe but provide no causal window or spatial grounding for 200+ words. The closure offers a tonal shift ("fractured stillness...felt like a beginning") but no decisive change in options or knowledge; Mara's stance crystallizes without visible cost or a path foreclosed on the page. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural by design (fragment collection, looping voice), but the ending reconfigures only via declaration rather than a final image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is vivid in atmosphere ("waters alive with currents," "clouds thinned") but functions as backdrop rather than constraint; Mara walks its edge without the environment altering her tactics or choices. The camera wheel is handled across multiple beats and returns at closure, satisfying micro-setting criteria. Spatial choreography remains vague—mud, rock, lagoon edge—without clear distances or movement logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—negotiating with her ghost/eroded ambitions—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma that narrows options. The camera wheel's voice provides encouragement rather than forcing a trade-off or foreclosing a path. The ending declares hope and forward motion without a visible price paid or a tactic altered; the "fractured stillness" shifts meaning via narration alone, not through a choice or renunciation that costs something on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of rebuilding from fragments emerges organically through the camera wheel and collected objects, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraph's "rebuild what had been broken" edges into summary. The ghost as guide rather than enemy offers a non-obvious reframing, but it arrives via the wheel's voice—an external message—rather than through Mara's lived particulars. The closure image ("fractured stillness...felt like a beginning") gestures at resonance but does not reweight prior material with a concrete, non-literal answer rooted in the scene's own logic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric distance with purposeful compression ("chronologically confused mind," "fractured stillness"). Filter verbs ("she felt," "she closed her eyes, letting") are frequent but voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy. The camera wheel's voice—*"Don't let it end here"*—is clearly attributed and distinct from Mara's interiority, preventing head-hopping. Diction occasionally lifts into elevated register ("envelop," "syncing with her thoughts") without POV strain, and the perceptual signature (fragment collection, overheard whispers) remains selective and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, supporting the lyric mode without sluggishness. Minor scaffold appears: "The object was peculiar, its gears half-buried, its lens cracked" uses parallel construction that borders on template cadence, and "She had climbed here, to this kinetic lagoon, seeking answers, but all she found were fragments—broken gears, rusted keys, and now this camera wheel" lists rather than dramatizes. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats; clarity and propulsion remain intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon above the clouds and the camera wheel with a trapped voice offer fresh specificity, and the ghost-as-guide reframing avoids a predictable antagonist. However, the emotional arc—scavenger gathers fragments, hears her own voice urging persistence, gains hope—follows a familiar template of solitary introspection and self-encouragement without a non-obvious turn. The ending's shift from prison to beginning is earned thematically but predictable structurally, lacking a synthesis that feels inevitable only in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present across all beats and makes micro-choices (prying the wheel free, collecting objects, standing to move forward). However, these choices do not create key turns; they advance the collection method without altering stakes or foreclosing options. The final decision to step forward is declared rather than tested against a visible cost or dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The camera wheel appears in the opening, is pried free mid-story, guides Mara to other fragments, and is cradled at closure. Its hum syncs with her thoughts and delivers the voice's message, shaping two distinct beats (discovery, nightfall revelation). The wheel's properties (hum, trapped voice) are specific and irreplaceable, and it charges the final image as Mara holds it while stepping forward.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Eroded ambitions" is named early as what the ghost represents and returns in the final paragraph's reflection. It frames Mara's regret but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page choice; it functions as thematic backdrop rather than a decision point. The concept is told more than dramatized, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is mentioned twice (opening and midpoint) as a label for Mara's struggle to order timeline, but it never constrains an action or creates a visible cost. She collects fragments sequentially without disorientation affecting her method or choices. The trait is ornamental, not functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Regret is named early and recurs ("regret clung to her," "weight of her regret," ending's reframing of regret as fragments). It motivates the journey and is reframed at closure, participating in the ending's tonal shift. However, it does not drive a major turn—Mara's path is additive collection without a moment where regret forces a trade-off or forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fragment collection is signaled in the opening, demonstrated mid-story (locket, mirror, journal, overheard whispers), and integrated with the camera wheel's guidance. The method shapes Mara's tactics across multiple beats and appears in the final paragraph's resolve to "collect" and "piece together." It does not force a constraint or choice that alters the ending, but it is present and functional throughout.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is established early with vivid imagery and recurs in every major beat, framing the entire journey. Its currents still and stir, mirroring Mara's emotional state, and the clouds part to reveal the moon at closure. However, the setting does not constrain Mara's choices or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"After the carousel halts" anchors the timeframe in the opening and is mentioned once more ("years since the world above had stopped moving"). The halted carousel contextualizes the fractured world but does not create urgency or tighten decisions; time remains static and vague throughout, with no live clock altering Mara's moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Negotiating with her ghost is stated early, explained as confronting eroded ambitions, and resolved at closure when the wheel's voice reframes the ghost as guide. The motivation is present across the arc and participates in the ending's shift. However, it is told more than dramatized—Mara does not face a concrete choice where the ghost exerts friction or cost, limiting its integration to thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fractured stillness" is named in the opening, recurs mid-story and at closure, and modulates subtly—from "prison" at the start to "beginning" at the end. The tone supports the lyric accumulation and charges the final image. However, the shift is declared rather than embodied through sensory or action change, preventing the tone from doing full causal work at the closure beat.</comment>
