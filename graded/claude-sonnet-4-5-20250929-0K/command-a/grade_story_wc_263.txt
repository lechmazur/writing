<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira remains abstract—a collection of poetic traits rather than a person making choices under pressure. Her "gift" of hearing unspoken words is declared but never constrains a decision or creates friction; she simply listens and rests. The interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilaration") and the backstory childhood memory is inert, adding atmosphere but no present cost. No meaningful choice or endurance with visible consequence appears on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The piece establishes a lens of accumulative texture but never tightens or reconfigures; Lira traces stars, rests, remembers, then rests again with no decisive change, no renunciation that forecloses a path, and no conceptual repricing. The ending ("ready to follow their path wherever it may lead") is pure setup—charged poise requires crystallized options and undeniable pressure, but here options remain vague and cost absent. The structure is a single meditative scene, valid for this length, but closure does not land.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway and astrolabe are vividly rendered and return across beats, and the sensory detail (emerald/violet hues, cold stone, visible breath) is selective and purposeful. The archway anchors the spatial frame and the astrolabe's trembling needle offers a tactile cue. However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice or charges the final image—they remain atmospheric rather than causal, capping the score below high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity to restore the village—is declared early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Lira begins ready to listen, listens, and ends ready to continue. "Rest" as the central action imposes no trade-off, and no live option is foreclosed. The astrolabe's trembling and the archway's glow hint at escalation but deliver no on-page cost or narrowed tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of creativity-as-stardust and the longing for something just out of reach emerge from concrete images (glass shards, silver thread, aurora song). However, the ending tells rather than reweights: "shadowed rapture of the stars, ready to follow their path" is a thematic echo, not a resonant reconfiguration. The piece gestures toward a question but provides no answer or repricing; the final paragraph states readiness without dramatizing what that readiness costs or means.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the diction ("moonstruck dreamer," "shadowed rapture") creates a consistent lyric texture. Psychic distance remains controlled. However, repeated stock phrases ("her heart pounding with a mixture of fear and exhilaration," "something just out of reach") and elevated register ("the essence of creativity, scattered across the universe") flatten the narrator's perceptual signature. No dialogue appears to assess. The voice reads competent but not distinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and imagery is clear, but multiple paraphrase loops appear: the second and third paragraphs restate Lira's gift and motivation with synonym churn ("unspoken words" / "whispers of the universe"; "trapped creativity" / "scattered...waiting to be reclaimed"). Template cadence: "She was known for...," "Her gift—or curse...," "Her motivation was clear..." stack filter-heavy declarative stems. Stock metaphors ("heart pounding," "something just out of reach") and the therapy-speak phrase "shadowed rapture" in the final beat lower line-level craft. Deductions total approximately −1.4 for loops, cadence, and filter stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—dreamer hears cosmic whispers and seeks to free trapped creativity—follows a widely used template (sensitive protagonist on a mystical quest) without transforming it through specific lived friction or non-obvious cost. The astrolabe, aurora, and archway are vivid but do not yield a fresh synthesis; the emotional arc (longing → listening → continued longing) could transfer unchanged to many settings. No bold risk or turn distinguishes the material from similar quest-beginnings.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "moonstruck dreamer" label is present throughout but Lira makes no decision that alters tactics. She listens, rests, and resolves to continue—observation without agency. Missing middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The astrolabe appears in three beats (introduction, tracing stars, needle trembling) and is handled on the page. Its needle responds to stardust, signaling specificity. However, it does not constrain a choice or shape the ending; Lira simply holds it while listening. Present across beats but causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Remembered stardust" is explained early and motivates Lira's quest, but it never changes on-page options or tactics. It remains thematic backdrop rather than a stake-altering force. Functional setup, minimal middle involvement, no closure payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The ability to "hear unspoken words" is declared and described but never enables or constrains an action with cost. Lira listens throughout, but no trade-off or friction arises from the gift. Label-only attribute without dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Rest" is named twice (fourth and fifth paragraphs) and frames the closing beat, but it imposes no sacrifice or transformation—Lira rests to let the universe unfold, then ends ready to act. The action is present but swappable with "wait" or "listen" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" is the on-page method in the central beat and prompts the astrolabe's response. However, the mechanics are vague (what does tracing accomplish?) and the method does not shape a turn or choice. Functional middle involvement, weak causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway anchors all three scenes (edge of village, beneath it, glowing symbols) and is described as a gateway, charging the setting with symbolic weight. The archway "seemed to glow brighter" as the astrolabe trembles, offering a lyric reprise. However, it does not constrain movement or alter Lira's options—she could rest anywhere. Early seed and closure presence without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Unwritten calendar" guided by celestial movements is declared but never tracked or used to tighten a decision. Time remains abstract ("not by days or months") and imposes no deadline. Ornamental timeframe without on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to free trapped creativity" is stated clearly in the second paragraph and frames Lira's quest, but no on-page friction tests it—no competing want, no cost of pursuit. Told motivation without conflicted choice. Functional setup, missing development and closure tie.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" appears explicitly in the final paragraph and implicitly throughout ("beautiful and haunting," "fear and exhilaration"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (quiet wonder to heightened anticipation). However, the phrase itself is abstract and the final use feels decorative rather than charging the image with new weight. Consistent presence, modest closure linkage.</comment>
