<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kael's "empirically ironic nature" and "frugal habits" are stated labels without dramatized contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. His quest proceeds in a linear summary—finds tile, deciphers it, embraces unknown—without internal conflict forcing a hierarchy of values. The final paragraph claims emotional shift ("once made him question…now compelled him") through assertion rather than on-page struggle. No embodied tension between skepticism and faith alters a single tactic or forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph, meeting the test. However, the entire arc is summary: Kael hears rumor, finds tile in one beat, deciphers it in the next, and achieves covenant off-page. No on-page reversal narrows options or changes knowledge through because/therefore linkage. The ending declares purpose and guardianship without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes before/after legible with felt cost. Closure is absent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The palace courtyard's schematic floor and observatory dome are described vividly, but remain postcard backdrops. The hidden compartment appears conveniently without prior spatial set-up. The tile's alignment with stars is told, not shown through tactile manipulation or environmental constraint. Sensory detail (dusky harmony, shimmering symbols) is generic and does not filter through Kael's professional astronomer lens or constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—seal a covenant with the unknown—is declared but never tested on the page. Kael encounters no opposition, sacrifice, or trade-off; the tile is found easily, deciphered off-stage, and the covenant achieved by declaration. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option. The resolution is delivered by summary ("realized," "felt," "understood") rather than protagonist agency under pressure, and no cost alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme of devotion and cosmic connection is stated repeatedly ("encrypted devotion," "covenant," "devotion and sacrifice") rather than emerging from concrete action. The magic square functions as a symbol claimed by narration, not earned through Kael's struggle. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "frugal ways had prepared him for this destiny," "enduring power of encrypted devotion." No non-literal image reweights the premise; thematic echo pervades the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but the prose lacks perceptual signature—no astronomer-specific noticing or professional idiom colors the narration. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("empirically ironic," "dusky harmony," "essence of unwavering commitment") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Internal thought is expository and label-driven ("deep-seated belief," "insatiable curiosity") without rhythmic modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and templated phrasing: "frugal" appears four times, "empirically ironic" twice, "dusky harmony" thrice, "encrypted devotion" four times, "seal a covenant" four times—mostly as label assertions rather than varied texture. Runs of "His/He [verb]" stems across paragraphs 2–4 create template cadence. Stock metaphors ("bridge to the future," "guardian of ancient knowledge") and thesis-speak ("enduring bond between humanity and cosmos") dull momentum. Mixed register (astronomer's empirical POV vs. cosmic mysticism) is unanchored. Artifacts pervade closure paragraph, triggering −1.7 baseline in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Core premise—astronomer finds mystical artifact to unlock cosmic secrets—is a widely used template (Indiana Jones meets Stargate) without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Magic square tile," "ancient palace," "celestial covenant" are stock genre furnishings. The quest proceeds without friction or surprise; Kael's skepticism is told but never dramatizes a credible struggle. Emotional and plot beats could transfer unchanged to any seeker-hero with minimal edits. No fresh inflection reshapes the familiar material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Kael the "frugal astronomer" is present throughout but his frugality never constrains a choice—no resource scarcity, no efficient-path dilemma dramatized. His astronomer knowledge is mentioned (schematic, stars) but not shown shaping a tactical decision. He observes and declares rather than deciding under pressure. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The magic square tile appears in paragraph 2 (found), paragraph 3 (carried to observatory), and paragraph 4 (aligned with stars). However, its use is summarized ("deciphered," "connected the dots") rather than dramatized through tactile handling or puzzle-solving beats. It enables the ending but does not constrain earlier choices or return with reweighted meaning. Functional but the mechanics remain opaque.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Encrypted devotion" is a thematic label repeated four times without shaping on-page stakes or tactics. The tile's code is never shown; decryption happens off-stage. Devotion is claimed in narration, not tested through sacrifice or conflicting wants. Present as atmosphere, absent as causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" is mentioned twice as a personality label but never enacted. No scene shows Kael's skepticism clashing with mystical evidence; no ironic observation alters a tactic. The trait exists only in exposition, not in choice or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears once in paragraph 3 ("began to uncloak the tile's mysteries") and is echoed in the final line ("uncloaking secrets"). The action is told in summary rather than dramatized through discovery beats. Swappable with "decipher" or "reveal" without structural change. Present but not load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Through schematic representations" is mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 4 (courtyard schematic, aligning tile with constellations). The method is named but its mechanics—how tracing lines leads to the compartment, how alignment yields the message—are skipped. Told rather than shown, with no on-page problem-solving that the schematic enables or constrains.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "ancient Babylonian palace reimagined" is described (stone carvings, ziggurats, courtyard, observatory) but functions as backdrop. No spatial constraint shapes Kael's path; the hidden compartment appears without prior set-up. The setting is present and logically consistent but does not alter tactics or charge the closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>"Between regimes" is mentioned once in paragraph 1 ("caught between regimes") as historical context. No urgency, ticking clock, or temporal pressure tightens Kael's decisions. Time is static and untracked. Present as label, absent as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"To seal a covenant with the unknown" is declared in paragraphs 1, 3, 4, and 5. Kael's desire is stated but never tested against a conflicting want or cost. No on-page friction dramatizes devotion versus doubt or sacrifice versus gain. Told motivation without choice-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" appears three times as an atmospheric label ("air was thick with dusky harmony," "dusky harmony deepened," "dusky harmony enveloped him"). The phrase is static, not modulating with pressure or tied to Kael's perceptual state. Ornamental mood claim rather than lived tone that charges the ending.</comment>
