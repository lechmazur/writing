<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to reshape forgiveness is clear, but her interior remains generic—"longing," "heart pounding," "guilt and grief" operate as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The spire encounter never forces a micro-choice between competing impulses; she recites poetry and the environment responds without her wrestling conflicting desires in action. The final declaration "I am the shattered mirror" reads as epiphany-by-assertion rather than a choice earned through prior on-page struggle. Backstory is minimal, but the interiority at peak beats defaults to therapy-speak ("wound I choose to heal") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Lira, bone towers, canyon, pre-ritual) arrive promptly. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: mist thickens, echoes fragment, spire glows, shadows coalesce—density increases toward the final image. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the mist parts, revealing "a path forward," and Lira stands "unburdened." Cost is implied ("a piece of herself, a shard of her heart") but not dramatized—no on-page forfeiture or visible alteration of tactics. The spire does its work off-stage between paragraph three and four; the crucial moment when she "would have to surrender" is told, not shown, undercutting the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The towers of bone, canyon of endless echoes, pale spire in mist, and swirling mist are vivid and consistent. Sensory detail is selective: "cold, damp stone," "forged hush," "silver and blue" hues charge the atmosphere. The spire constrains Lira's approach ("cautiously") and the mist's thickening tracks her emotional escalation, satisfying the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the bone towers frame the opening but never reappear to pressure choice or charge the closure, remaining postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: can forgiveness be reshaped into something Lira can carry? The pressure accumulates as mist thickens and echoes multiply, consistent with the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when shadows of wronged/wronging appear, raising the question's cost. However, Lira's agency is passive—she recites, the spire responds, shadows dissolve—without a tightening choice that narrows options. The ritual deadline is mentioned twice but never pressures tactics on the page. The final "path forward" appears as a gift from the spire rather than a cost Lira visibly pays through renunciation or endurance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—forgiveness as refracted truth, mirror/shard imagery—emerges from the premise and recurs purposefully. The impromptu poetry carries subtext: "Is it memory, sacrificed on the altar of peace? Or is it pride, buried beneath the weight of apology?" offers genuine moral calculus. The final "I am the shattered mirror" image attempts non-literal resonance. Yet the closing declares theme overtly: "Forgiveness is not a gift I give, but a wound I choose to heal" reads as a thesis statement rather than an image that reweights prior material. The spire's work is summarized ("had done its work") instead of shown, flattening the earned-insight test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows Lira filtering the canyon through metaphor ("skeletal fingers," "mirror," "altar"), though this texture remains consistent rather than modulating under peak stress. The poetry fragments carry distinct diction ("soft lilt," raw/unpolished), but peak interiority defaults to elevated register: "the price of forgiveness, she understood, was not something she could pay with words or actions alone." Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the spire glow sequence. No dialogue is present to judge. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "realized then") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not stack to dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence variety is present; rhythm modulates from the slow opening ("whispering void," "forged hush") to urgent mid-beat ("more urgent, more desperate") to calm closure. However, scaffold and paraphrase loops accumulate: "echoes pressing," "echoes repeating," "echoes grew louder," "echoes faded" recur without advancing pressure. "The mist swirled" / "The mist swirled faster" and "Each one a variation" / "each one a fragment" / "each one a step" form synonym cycles. Metaphor density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "skeletal fingers," "altar of peace," "tapestry of acceptance," "shattered mirror" within a single 700-word frame risks overwriting. The final paragraph summary—"The pale spire in mist had done its work"—tells closure rather than showing it, violating the momentum test at the decisive beat. Template stems ("She approached," "She pressed on," "She raised") and therapy-speak ("wound I choose to heal") cluster in high-pressure moments, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—artist seeks forgiveness via a mystical structure that refracts truth—follows the Quest for Redemption / Magical Resolution template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The spire operates as a convenience: Lira recites, it responds, shadows appear and dissolve on cue, the path opens. The bone towers, canyon of echoes, and pale spire are atmospheric but not grounded in verifiable world-logic or particular culture. The "impromptu poetry" method and "refract" action are thematically apt but executed generically—no distinct poetic idiom, no friction between Lira's voice and the spire's demands. Emotional specificity is limited to stock guilt/grief labels. The transformation test fails: swap names/setting and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira (defiant artist) is present throughout and frames the premise. She defies the elders' warning (setup), approaches the spire (development), and recites poetry to conclusion (payoff). However, her choices do not create key turns—she recites, the spire responds autonomously. Her defiance is asserted in backstory but never tested on the page; the elders' warnings echo in her mind but do not complicate her action. "Defiant artist" operates as a label rather than a trait that constrains tactics or forces a trade-off. Present in all three gates but agency remains observational, capping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The pale spire in mist anchors setup (paragraph one: "it was said that the spire held the power"), development (paragraphs two–three: Lira touches it, it hums and glows), and payoff (paragraph four: the light envelops her, the path is revealed). It appears in four beats with evolving function: landmark → tactile object → glowing catalyst → resolution agent. However, the spire acts on Lira rather than her acting through it—she does not manipulate, choose between uses, or pay a cost tied to its properties. The mechanics (how refraction works, what triggers it) remain vague. Two-gate minimum met with solid beat involvement, but swappability (another mystical object could serve) and passive use limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The price of forgiveness is the stated motivation and recurs explicitly: "What is the price of forgiveness?" (paragraph three), "The price of forgiveness, she understood, was not something she could pay with words or actions alone" (paragraph four), and the shard-of-heart metaphor. Setup is clear. The concept shapes Lira's choice to approach the spire and her poetry questions probe it. However, the price is told ("a piece of herself, a shard of her heart") rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture, no visible choice between competing costs, no alteration of tactics when the price becomes clear. The ending declares forgiveness achieved ("unburdened") without showing what Lira sacrificed or retained. Present in setup and thematically, but lacks causal pressure and closure demonstration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Innocently mischievous" is asserted once: "Lira's innocently mischievous spirit thrived on rebellion." It appears only in setup, never constrains an on-page action, and does not create visible tradeoffs. Her approach to the spire is cautious, her poetry earnest and desperate—no mischief on the page. The label does not recur or inflect her choices. Ornamental mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Refract" anchors the premise (setup: "the spire held the power to refract truths"), Lira's goal ("to refract a single truth into many"), and appears in action three times: the mist refracts (paragraph two), the spire refracts her soul (paragraph four), and the truth is "refracted into a thousand pieces" (final line). The action drives the spire sequence and charges the closure image. However, "refract" operates metaphorically throughout—no specific mechanic (angle, medium, light source) matters. Swapping "refract" for "reflect," "splinter," or "multiply" would require only minor edits. Present in all gates with closure linkage, but middling specificity and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Impromptu poetry sessions: Lira recites poetry in paragraphs two and three ("Forgiveness is a mirror," "What is the price of forgiveness?"), and paragraph four ("I am the shattered mirror"). The method is signaled early and attempted twice. However, the poetry is not "impromptu sessions" (plural, interactive)—it is solitary recitation. The mechanics (why poetry, how it engages the spire, what cost improvisation carries) are not explored. The spire responds to her words, but the link is ambient, not causal—no failed verses, no revision under pressure. Present in middle beats and closure, but the "session" framing is misleading and the method's constraints do not shape attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes: present in setup ("rose like skeletal fingers," "canyon of endless echoes"), the canyon's echoes respond in paragraph three ("repeating her words in fragmented whispers"), and the setting frames the closure ("the path forward"). The echoes are active participants, complicating her poetry with "variations" and "louder" intensity. However, the bone towers themselves are static scenery after the opening line—they never constrain movement, supply a resource, or reappear. The canyon's acoustic property (endless echoes) drives one beat (paragraph three fragmentation), qualifying as micro-setting, but the towers remain postcard description. Two gates met (setup, development via echoes), solid beat linkage, but partial element use and moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Before the ritual" is mentioned twice: opening ("Before the ritual, the elders had warned her") and paragraph four ("The ritual was nearing"). The timeframe establishes urgency in setup but never tightens decisions—Lira does not hurry, ration attempts, or weigh the cost of delay. The ritual's imminence is asserted in the final sequence but does not alter her tactics or force a choice. Setup present, but no development or payoff pressure; the clock is declarative, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Lira's motivation—to refract a single truth into many, to see if forgiveness could be reshaped—is explicit in setup ("Her motivation was clear") and drives her approach to the spire and her poetry. The desire is restated in the final line ("refracted into a thousand pieces"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in friction. No competing want (safety vs. truth, memory vs. peace) forces a visible trade-off; the elders' warning and ritual deadline are mentioned but do not complicate her pursuit. Setup and closure present, but want/cost friction is absent, limiting integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Forged hush" is named once in setup ("The air was thick with a forged hush") and the atmosphere of held breath and whisper recurs: "whispering void," "soft lilt," "silence," "fragmented whispers," "moved in silence." Tone is coherent and modulates from eerie stillness (opening) to urgent questioning (middle) to calm resolution (ending). The hush charges the opening and the "silence" in the shadow sequence (paragraph four). However, "forged" (artificial, conspiratorial) is not sustained—later tone is mystical/ethereal rather than constructed. The hush does not directly shape a choice or charge the final image, which centers on light and path rather than sound. Setup strong, modulation present, but closure linkage is weak and the "forged" specificity is abandoned.</comment>
