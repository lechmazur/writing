<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated but never tested on the page; she moves through the gallery with reverence but makes no difficult choice. The task is presented as already decided, and the scattering unfolds without internal contradiction or visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans on abstract claims ("weary," "grief and beauty") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The rocking chair and mask are observed, not engaged as crucibles that alter her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present early (gallery, Elara, velvet pouch). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ritual scattering accumulates meaning through layered reflection and image. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; Elara arrives decided and completes the act as planned. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration via the final reflection on impermanence, but the cost is asserted philosophically rather than felt in a forfeited choice or altered tactic. Closure is present but soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gallery's "high ceilings," "polished marble," and "dim lights" establish atmosphere, and the rocking chair and porcelain mask supply vivid, recurring objects. The mask's "jagged edges catching light" is specific and purposeful. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome; it functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The chair's slowing rhythm charges the final image modestly, earning mid-range credit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring the gallery owner through ritual—is signaled early but never tested. Elara faces no opposition, internal friction, or trade-off; she simply executes the plan. No escalation or deepening occurs; the scattering proceeds as intended from the start. The cost is claimed in reflection ("acceptance of fragility") but not dramatized as a forfeited path or altered tactic. Agency is intention without pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Impermanence and fragility emerge through the mask, ash, and gallery's vanishing nature. The final paragraph reflects on the "mirage of safety" and the crystallization of fleeting emotion, offering a resonant though abstract answer to the thematic question. The theme is not imposed through moralizing but arises from image and ritual. However, the epiphany is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the connection to "mirage of safety" remains philosophically stated rather than dramatized as a stake.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. Diction is consistent, leaning toward elevated literary register ("benediction," "somber marvel"). Perceptual signature is present but generic—Elara notices symbols of impermanence without a character-specific filter. No dialogue appears. The prose maintains psychic distance and voice without head-hopping, but the narrative stance reads slightly generic rather than distinctly Elara's particular way of seeing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally maintained, but the prose leans toward overwriting in peak beats: "somber and marvelous," "beautiful and painful," "silence a testament to the power." Synonym churn appears ("whisper secrets," "bear witness," "testament"). Template cadence is mild but present in adjacent reflection blocks. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Information density is moderate; several lines restate the same conceptual ground (impermanence, fragility, mirage of safety) without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The premise—scattering a charcoal portrait's ash in a gallery—offers a fresh angle, and the porcelain mask is a striking visual. However, the emotional arc (acceptance of impermanence) follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn. The mirage of safety is invoked but not dramatized as a stake that shifts. The piece commits to its premise but does not transform it through specific, grounded conflict; the ritual unfolds as planned without risk or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and performs the central action (scattering), but her choices are pre-decided; she does not face a turn or trade-off on the page. Setup is early; middle and closure participation are present but passive. No visible cost tied to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mask appears in two beats (mid-scene observation and final reflection). It is described vividly and thematically charged, but it is never handled or used. The mask watches and symbolizes fragility without constraining a choice or altering tactics. Early signal present; middle and closure participation are observation-only.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The mirage of safety is mentioned explicitly in two beats and reflected in the ending. However, it is discussed as theme rather than shaping on-page stakes or altering options. It does not narrow tactics or test Elara's choices; it is asserted philosophically.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" and "incomplete information" are mentioned in a single reflective sentence but never enacted. Elara does not withhold, reveal, or manage information on the page in a way that constrains her action or creates cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Powder the air" (scattering ash) is the central action, performed on-page and tied to the closure ritual. Setup is early, middle beat involves the act, and closure reflects on it. However, the action is executed as planned without reversal or consequence; it could be replaced with another ritual gesture. Visible in three beats but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Through incomplete information" is mentioned once in a reflective aside ("weave truth carefully, understanding that reality was often best revealed through incomplete information") but not demonstrated. No on-page scene shows Elara managing or withholding information to achieve her goal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The vanishing point gallery is named early and provides atmosphere, recurring objects (chair, mask), and thematic resonance. It appears in all three gate positions. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome; it functions as symbolic backdrop. Early setup, closure linkage via final reflection, but no middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The rocking chair's slowing is mentioned early and reaches stillness mid-scene, marking the moment Elara begins scattering. It provides a time cue but does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the ritual proceeds at Elara's chosen pace. Present in setup and middle, mild closure echo.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To crystallize a fleeting emotion" is stated as Elara's motivation and reflected in the ending. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice or visible trade-off. The motivation is consistent but not tested; no friction between want and cost appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is signaled early and sustained through the piece: "somber and marvelous," "dim glow," "silent benediction," "quiet endings." The tone is coherent and modulates gently with the ritual's progression, charging the final image. No sharp tonal turns, but the texture is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
