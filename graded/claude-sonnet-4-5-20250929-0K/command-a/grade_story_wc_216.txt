<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains a functional placeholder whose task is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "profound sense of purpose" at closure reads as label-only emotion without embodied cost or visible foreclosure. Thaddeus appears as pure exposition vehicle; his trembling hands gesture at emotion but his interiority never complicates the beat. The "ancient pact" and "borrowed-time" premise are asserted without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive quickly (Eldermere, silo, Elara's role), avoiding the Orientation Test penalty. The drive lens reads as causal-hybrid but weakens at closure: activating the device solves the chronometer problem without visible cost—"time had found its rhythm" declares resolution rather than showing what Elara forfeited or what path closed. The garage-sale investigation occupies significant text yet contributes minimally to the final beat, creating a loose middle that does not tighten options. The closure unit ("She had not only mended time but also rediscovered her own connection") asserts conceptual repricing without making the cost undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The emerald silo's weathered metal and hidden chamber supply vivid anchor details. The garage sale as recurring venue pressures Elara's tactics (embedding cryptic descriptions). However, spatial choreography inside the silo remains vague—"deeper into the silo" and "hidden chamber" lack the proximity or access friction that would constrain movement. The urn fragment's intricate patterns return at closure but function as symbolic recurrence rather than micro-setting that alters the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore time's flow) is signaled early, but escalation is mechanical: discovering the fragment → garage sale messages → Thaddeus explains → device activation. No on-page reversal narrows Elara's options; Thaddeus's arrival hands her the solution. The device activation carries no visible cost—no stamina burn, no social price, no forfeited path—only a declared "sense of belonging." Under a causal lens, the lack of trade-off or foreclosure at the peak beat is a critical gap.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "texture of time passing" phrase recurs but remains abstract; the story does not dramatize what temporal weaving costs Elara in micro-choices. The urn fragment's return on her desk gestures toward timeless bonds, yet the final image does not reweight prior material—it decorates rather than charges. Thematic statements cluster in the final paragraph ("timeless bonds that wove through existence") without scene pressure, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The central question (why time faltered) resolves via exposition rather than earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature is generic: "strange warmth," "profound sense of purpose," "sense of belonging" repeat therapy-adjacent phrasing without character-specific idiom. Dialogue between Elara and Thaddeus ("Where did you find this?" / "She explained her discovery") reads as functional exchange without subtext or goal-driven evasion. Diction stays consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—peak beats (device activation) maintain the same measured cadence as exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is adequate, but scaffold and paraphrase loops pervade: "The fragment felt *suddenly timeless*, as though it carried the essence of eternity" restates the same idea; "she felt a shift within herself, as though the silo's secrets were awakening something dormant" loops conceptually without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the garage-sale paragraph ("She carefully crafted... She wrote... she described... Each item became..."). The final paragraph stacks filter verbs and abstract claims ("she would trace its patterns, feeling the texture of time passing, a story etched in every line") that soften the closure image. Cumulative artifact debt (paraphrase loops, template stems, filter stack in closure beat) totals approximately −1.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise (timekeeper in a silo mends broken time via mysterious artifact) maps closely to "magical職/task + broken object + quest for origin" templates without fresh synthesis. The garage-sale method offers a specific tactic but remains ornamental—messages do not complicate or fail before Thaddeus arrives. The "day after numbers changed meaning" phrase promises estrangement but delivers only cosmetic symbol-swirl without altering Elara's approach. Emotional beats default to stock epiphanies ("profound sense of purpose," "sense of belonging") that could migrate unchanged to other magical-repair narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara (borrowed-time timekeeper) is named early and present throughout, but her decisions do not create key turns—Thaddeus supplies the explanation, the device is already built, and activation proceeds without complication. She observes the chronometer's flicker, discovers the fragment, and executes the garage-sale plan, yet none of these choices narrow live options or impose visible cost. Closure participation is passive (she "felt a profound sense of purpose"). Present in setup, middle, and ending, but replaceable with any curious custodian; causal pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cremation urn fragment appears in three beats: discovery (touch releases warmth), garage sale (Thaddeus recognizes it), and device activation (guides them to the chamber). It returns in the final image on her desk, reweighted as "a reminder of timeless bonds." Early signal, middle involvement, and closure callback satisfy two-plus gates. However, the fragment's unique properties (intricate patterns) enable navigation but do not constrain choice or impose cost; swapping it for any map-object would leave structure intact. Charged reprise lifts it into mid-band, but irreplaceability is low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule (core concept) frames the mystery and supplies the artifact set (urn fragment, hidden device). Setup is early, and the capsule's scattered contents motivate the middle investigation. At closure, repairing the capsule's mechanism (the temporal weaver) restores time's rhythm. However, the concept does not constrain tactics—Elara's garage-sale plan and Thaddeus's arrival bypass the capsule's damage as a live obstacle. Functional across beats but swappable with any "broken magical archive" without altering emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" (attribute) appears once as a label when Elara touches the fragment: "The fragment felt *suddenly timeless*, as though it carried the essence of eternity." No on-page action is enabled or constrained by this trait; it functions as atmospheric descriptor. Missing middle development and closure participation. Present in setup only, ornamental, no visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Rediscover" (action) drives Elara's middle investigation: she decides to rediscover the urn fragment's origins, leading to the garage-sale plan and eventual partnership with Thaddeus. Early signal and middle involvement present, but at closure the action shifts to "activate the device"—rediscovery completes off-stage when Thaddeus explains. The action does not shape the final image; swapping "rediscover" for "investigate" or "trace" would require only cosmetic edits. Functional in middle, but no closure linkage and low irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions (method) is signaled early and dramatized with examples ("Vintage clock, ticks with the rhythm of forgotten years"). Middle development: the method draws Thaddeus, who provides the key information. However, the mechanics are ornamental—no message is decoded on the page, no false lead complicates, and the method does not recur at closure. Functional in one beat (Thaddeus's arrival) but easily swappable with "display the fragment publicly" or "ask the town historian." Two gates (setup, middle), but low causal pressure and no closure participation cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The emerald silo (setting) is named in the opening line and houses all key beats: Elara's task, fragment discovery, hidden chamber, device activation, and final image. Early signal, pervasive presence, and closure participation satisfy all three gates. The silo's "weathered metal," "core," and "hidden chamber" supply spatial detail, but the environment does not constrain movement—no locked doors, no stamina cost, no access friction alters tactics. The setting frames action without pressuring choices. Functional across beats but does not charge the final image with environmental specificity beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"After numbers change meaning" (timeframe) is named once as a temporal marker: "The day after numbers changed meaning—when the chronometer's digits became symbols." This phrase anchors the final act (venturing deeper, activating the device) but does not tighten decisions—no countdown, no degrading condition, no escalating cost tied to elapsed time. The timeframe labels a moment rather than functioning as a live constraint. Setup present, minimal middle pressure, and no closure participation beyond serving as a section header. Ornamental use; swappable with "the next day" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To understand the texture of time passing" (motivation) is attributed to Thaddeus's late wife and echoed in Elara's final reflection ("feeling the texture of time passing"). The phrase appears in setup (via Thaddeus's exposition) and returns at closure, but Elara's on-page choices are driven by the practical goal (restore the chronometer) rather than existential inquiry. No middle beat dramatizes friction between wanting to understand and the cost of that pursuit. The motivation is told, not conflicted in choices; lyric reprise without causal pressure places it in low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Anticipated mysteries (tone) is established early ("mysteries anticipated but never fully solved") and sustained through the garage-sale enigma and hidden chamber discovery. The tone modulates minimally—curiosity remains steady without dread, urgency, or disorientation that would charge peak beats. At closure, the tone coheres ("her work was far from over") but does not reweight prior material; the silo's mysteries remain abstract rather than pressuring the final image. Setup and middle presence with stable mood, but no tonal cadence shift to elevate the ending.</comment>
