<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is declared ("to navigate the geography of loss") but never tested through competing choices or genuine friction. Her actions are goal-directed—scavenging, building, adjusting—but these moves never face meaningful internal contradiction or embodied cost that would reveal hierarchy of values. The arrival of travelers provides satisfaction but no visible price paid or path foreclosed. Interiority remains abstract ("heart swelled," "sense of purpose") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative elements (the beacon's growing effectiveness), but the ending dissolves into summary rather than landing a discrete closure unit with visible cost. The cryptic calls set up a mystery, building the device provides a because/therefore chain, but the resolution—travelers arrive, community forms—occurs in summary across an indefinite span ("soon others arrived") without a final image that reweights prior stakes or forecloses a path on the page. The Orientation Test is satisfied (who/where/when anchored early), but closure lacks the required Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The starlit signal station on a windswept cliff is established early with sensory anchors (weathered walls, scars of storms, floorboards). The censer foot's moon-phase fluctuation provides a recurring environmental constraint that shapes Mara's work timing. However, spatial choreography during the building sequences remains vague—what parts she scavenges, where she places the device, how the station's layout affects her labor. The final image defaults to generic stargazing rather than using station-specific detail to charge the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring balance through the beacon—is signaled early, but escalation remains largely external and convenient rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure. The hydraulics failure is backstory, the cryptic calls are received passively, the device "began to emit" its tone without a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The arrival of the first traveler provides a micro-turn but lacks friction; subsequent arrivals are summarized ("word spread, and soon others arrived") without on-page tightening or trade-off. No meaningful price is paid to achieve the beacon's success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of navigating loss and restoration emerges through the reverse migration conceit and Mara's beacon work, but the final paragraph states the thematic claim overtly ("navigate not just the skies, but the depths of the human heart") rather than letting the image earn it. The censer foot recurs but remains more symbolic ornament than a specific particular that constrains choice. "Raw solace" is declared twice without being dramatized through contradictory texture in the work itself. The piece gestures toward cyclical nature and pilgrimage but resolves into tidy affirmation without ambiguity or cost that would deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, and the perceptual filter stays within Mara's access throughout. However, diction drifts toward elevated abstraction in key beats ("the geography of loss," "the depths of the human heart") that sits uneasily with the scavenger-builder role. Dialogue from the traveler is brief and functional. Under peak pressure (building the device, adjusting it), the prose remains externalized description rather than tightening into embodied perception or rhythm that reflects urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence openings and paragraph rhythm. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "cryptic phone call" is repeated three times in adjacent lines; "the station… felt alive, as though it too was part of the endeavor" restates the same idea without added pressure. Stock phrasing in emotional beats ("heart swelled," "sense of purpose") dulls immediacy. The final paragraph stacks abstract claims ("the geography of loss," "the depths of the human heart," "the patchwork navigator had found her path") where concrete image would serve better. No severe artifacts touch the closure, but accumulated decorative phrasing lowers density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—reverse migration, a beacon calling the lost home—echoes familiar tropes (lighthouse keeper as guide, mysterious relic with cyclical power) without a fresh angle that transforms through specific detail or moral calculus. The cryptic calls and moon-phase censer are genre furniture; their mechanics are told rather than discovered through choice. Mara's pilgrimage from isolation to community follows a predictable arc with no non-obvious inflection. The "patchwork navigator" title promises ingenuity but her actual skills (scavenging, building) remain generic. The piece executes its template competently but offers no synthesis that feels inevitable or necessary in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her building work drives the beacon's creation, but her choices do not create key pressure turns. She responds to external prompts (calls, device activation) rather than making trade-offs that narrow options. The decision to keep working is stated but not tested against competing wants or costs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The censer foot appears in three beats: found beneath floorboards, used as compass during building, and its glow dims at the end. However, its role is largely symbolic—described as "key" and "guide" without constraining a specific on-page choice or enabling a tactic under pressure. The moon-phase fluctuation times the work but does not impose visible cost. Reweighted meaning at closure is asserted ("cyclical nature") rather than charged through image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Reverse migration" is named early and frames the world premise, but its mechanics remain abstract. The concept shapes the broad stake (calling people back) but does not constrain tactics on the page or force a choice with visible trade-off. It functions as backstory explanation rather than an active pressure element in the scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The moon-phase fluctuation is mentioned twice: the censer's glow "intensifying as the lunar cycle peaked" and "dimmed as the moon waned." This timing enables the beacon's activation at full moon but does not impose a visible cost or constrain an on-page action beyond pacing. The trait is functional but replaceable with any cyclical timer.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Build" is the central action: Mara scavenges parts, pieces together the device, and adjusts it across multiple beats. The building creates the beacon that draws travelers, shaping the middle and ending. However, the work is summarized ("grueling," "hours of labor") rather than dramatized with micro-choices or trade-offs that reveal cost. The action drives causality but could be swapped with "repair" or "assemble" without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Cryptic phone calls at midnight appear in one beat ("the first… came at midnight," repeated "the next night, and the night after"), framing the mystery and providing instructions. However, the calls do not shape on-page attempts—Mara's building proceeds without reference to their mechanics or content beyond the single word "Build." They function as inciting prompt rather than method that constrains tactics or participates in closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is anchored early (windswept cliff, weathered walls, floorboards) and provides the workspace for building. It supplies the buried censer and becomes a refuge at the end. However, spatial layout does not constrain choices during the work, and the station's specific features (hydraulics, ruins) are mentioned but not used to shape tactics. It functions as consistent backdrop rather than micro-setting that pressures decisions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the hydraulics failed" is named in the opening but remains backstory context. The failure makes mechanisms "erratic," forcing reliance on ingenuity, but this constraint is told rather than dramatized through a choice that the failure forecloses. The timeframe does not tighten present decisions or create a visible deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To navigate the geography of loss" is stated twice as Mara's motivation and echoed in the final line. It frames her purpose but is not dramatized through conflicting wants or a choice where loss imposes visible cost. The desire remains abstract label rather than friction tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Raw solace" is named twice: "the raw solace she found in the process" and "a raw solace that anchored her amidst the chaos." The tone registers in those moments and the ending's bittersweet note (dimming censer, long journey ahead), but does not modulate with pressure across beats—building sequences and traveler arrivals carry uniform earnest satisfaction. The tone is present but static, more assertion than embodied texture that charges the final image.</comment>
