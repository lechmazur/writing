<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is label-only: "odd historian," "sensitively perceptive" appear as tags without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal cost. Her obsession with the tapestry and belief in the displaced axis are declared rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The climactic ritual sequence ("her mind probing," "her heart beating in time") relies on stock interiority and perfect execution without genuine struggle or blind spots. No visible internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; the protagonist remains competent and untroubled throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is late: the post-dream world is not anchored until midway through paragraph one; "after the last human dream was dreamt" arrives as exposition rather than a present constraint (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0 per Orientation Test). The closure—restoring dreams via ritual—lacks visible cost; the golden light and "vibrant symphony" declare success without foreclosing a path or showing what Elara sacrificed. Drive lens reads Causal at setup but shifts to summary告completion without earned causality; the ritual's mechanics are told, not tested. The final image ("the world dreamed again") asserts a change off-page rather than landing a decisive on-page turn with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The silo library is vividly sketched ("bronze quiet," "metal walls weathered by time") and the hidden compartment provides a spatial discovery beat. The fireplace in the abandoned manor and the stone altar in the silo center supply concrete anchors. However, setting does not constrain the climax; Elara places the tapestry and performs the ritual without environmental friction or tactical adjustment. The Orientation Test penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding and reversing the displaced axis—is signaled early but never tested by a live complication or reversal. Elara finds diaries, deciphers scrolls, and executes the ritual in an unbroken success chain; no choice narrows options or imposes visible cost. The ritual's energy crackle is atmospheric, not a pressure point requiring agency. Closure declares restoration without showing what Elara gave up or what path she foreclosed; felt cost is absent on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The displaced axis and the end of dreaming serve as thematic anchors, but they remain abstract; no particular complicates or tests the idea in scene. The diaries' revelation that the fracture was "a deliberate act" is told rather than embodied in a character choice or image. The ending's "vibrant symphony" and restored dreams are asserted rather than earned through a non-literal image that reweights prior material. Theme is stated ("collect the stories walls have heard") rather than dramatized through cost or contradiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Voice is stable third-person with elevated diction ("bronze quiet," "displaced axis," "sensitively perceptive") that occasionally drifts into label-speak. Free indirect style is clean but generic; Elara's perceptual signature is not distinct or biased in character-specific ways. Narrative certainty remains high throughout; no uncertainty or inference reads as inference. The climactic beat ("her mind probing the depths of the tapestry's imagery, her heart beating in time with the dragons' roar") recycles stock interiority without embodied texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is adequate, but scaffold and loops reduce density. "Sensitively perceptive" appears three times in identical phrasing; "displaced axis" recurs without reweighting. Paraphrase loops: paragraph one's "stories walls have heard" is restated in paragraph two and again in the final line without added pressure. Template cadence in paragraph six: "She closed her eyes, her mind probing… her heart beating…" stacks filter constructions. Mixed metaphor: "bronze quiet" (tactile/auditory) collides with "walls have heard" (metaphor) without payoff. Figurative density in the climax ("golden light," "hum with life," "vibrant symphony") asserts rather than dramatizes the change. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence, −0.3 for filter-verb stacks in the peak beat; total −1.1 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The core premise—historian restores humanity's dreams via medieval tapestry—echoes template "chosen one restores lost magic" arcs without fresh synthesis. The diaries and scrolls function as convenient quest tokens rather than particulars that complicate the goal. The ritual's success is declared rather than earned through specific, non-obvious choices; the protagonist's "odd historian" label and "sensitively perceptive" trait do not transform the familiar structure. No bold risk or lived detail distinguishes this telling from stock restoration fantasies.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her actions frame the arc, but her choices do not create key turns; she discovers, deciphers, and performs without complication. The historian role is label-only; no decision alters tactics or reveals cost. Caps: swappable (cap 3.8), no middle development beat with cost (missing gate), summary-only use at closure (−0.3). Score 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tapestry appears in three beats: initial obsession (para 1), tracing edges (para 2), and placement on altar (climax). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9. However, the tapestry is never handled with cost or friction; its dragons are described, not used to constrain a choice. Swappable with any artifact that channels energy (−0.6). Base 3.0 + 2.9 positives − 0.6 swap − 0.1 ornamental = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The displaced axis is mentioned in paragraphs 1, 4, and 7 but functions as thematic label rather than on-page constraint. It shapes Elara's belief but does not narrow her options or impose visible cost. Late first appearance (para 1, ~15%): +0.7 early signal; two thematic beats +0.9; no causal pressure or closure cost. Base 3.0 + 1.6 − 0.5 ornamental = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" appears three times as a label; it is stated in paragraph 1, restated in paragraph 3, and invoked in paragraph 6 but never dramatizes a trade-off or enables a specific action. No middle beat with cost (missing gate), swappable with "intuitive" or "insightful" (−0.7). Base 3.0 + 0.4 (two beats) − 0.7 swap − 0.1 label-only = 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Probe" appears in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 7. It describes Elara's investigation but does not redefine options; she probes diaries, theories, and imagery without encountering resistance that changes her approach. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, no causal pressure or closure cost. Swappable with "examine" or "study" (−0.6). Base 3.0 + 2.1 − 0.6 − 0.6 ornamental = 3.9, but four beats and closure mention lift to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are introduced in paragraph 3, used to decode the tapestry's secret in paragraph 4, and lead to the hidden scrolls. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (unlocks scrolls) +0.8, closure participation (ritual instructions) +0.9. Swappable with any ancient record (−0.5). Base 3.0 + 3.2 − 0.5 = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The silo library is named in paragraph 1, houses the discovery in paragraph 5, and hosts the climax in paragraph 7. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure participation (stone altar) +0.8. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a friction that alters tactics (−0.5 ornamental). Base 3.0 + 2.9 − 0.5 − 0.1 postcard description = 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The post-dream timeframe is declared in paragraph 1 and restated in paragraph 2 but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. No urgency, no ticking deadline, no tactical adjustment tied to time. Setup present +0.4, thematic mention (two beats) +0.4, no middle or closure pressure. Base 3.0 + 0.8 − 0.9 vague = 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to collect the stories walls have heard" is stated in paragraph 1 and echoed in the final line but never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Elara's dedication is declared, not tested. Setup +0.6, closure reprise +0.7, no friction between wants and costs (told-only, −0.7). Base 3.0 + 1.3 − 0.7 = 3.6, lifted by closure reprise to 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears in paragraphs 1 and 6. It establishes mood but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image; the ending shifts to "golden light" and "vibrant symphony" without tonal bridge. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, no closure charge (tone abandons "bronze quiet" for triumph). Static mood (−0.6), swappable with "hushed stillness" (−0.5). Base 3.0 + 1.5 − 1.1 = 3.4.</comment>
