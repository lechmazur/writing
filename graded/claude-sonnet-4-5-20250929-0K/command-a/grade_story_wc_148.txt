<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—redeeming his father's legacy—is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The interior relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("chasing hush," "thread this labyrinth") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The climactic decision to "tell his story" arrives as summary epiphany rather than enacted struggle with visible cost. Interiority reads generic and detached, failing to ground choices in body or contradictory desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: the reader learns Elias is a prisoner only obliquely, and his actual situation (alone? guarded? why imprisoned?) remains vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure unit—Elias deciding to "tell his story"—occurs off-page as declaration rather than on-page action with cost; no before/after state is legible. Causality is weak: the journal conveniently appears, the hush mechanism is told rather than tested, and the ending replaces scene pressure with thematic summary ("He was Elias, the boy who chased truth").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and jagged reef are named early but function as backdrop; "copperlight repose" charges one chamber descriptively yet does not constrain Elias's choices. Spatial choreography is coherent across the descent and return. The lattice is handled in multiple beats but its physicality and constraint remain abstract, and the ending's visual sweep ("hues of gold and crimson") ornaments rather than pressures the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—redeeming the family name—is declared but remains abstract; the ticking clock ("before they find the bodies") never tightens on-page decisions. The journal reversal (father's guilt, the hush's cost) is told rather than tested, and Elias's climactic choice to reject silence arrives as summary epiphany without visible tradeoff or foreclosed path. Pressure does not escalate; coincidence (finding the journal) drives the turn, not protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (truth versus inherited lies) is stated overtly in the final paragraph ("no longer the son of the boy who cried wolf") rather than arising from particulars. The lattice, hush, and labyrinth accrue symbolic weight but remain ornamental; their meanings are told, not enacted through choices. The ending moralizes ("in that truth, he found his freedom") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image. Epiphany is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent but leans on elevated, abstract diction ("impossibilities," "thread the labyrinth," "chasing hush") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Free indirect style is clean, though interiority defaults to summary and philosophical reflection. Psychic distance remains stable, but the narration withholds practical facts (why imprisoned? who will find the bodies?) for manufactured suspense. Perceptual signature is generic; Elias's way of noticing does not reflect a distinct mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate, but density is low: multiple sentences restate theme without advancing situation ("The lattice sustained impossibilities" recurs as ornament). Figurative language clusters without payoff ("thread the labyrinth," "chasing hush," "hovering in defiance" as metaphor). The final paragraph stacks summary and metaphor ("copperlight repose faded," "boy who chased truth") in place of propulsive action. Paraphrase loops appear in the journal-reading passage, restating the hush's cost across adjacent lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—son of the boy who cried wolf in a lighthouse prison—offers a fresh synthesis, but execution defaults to template metaphor (labyrinth, silence, redemption arc). The lattice and hush remain abstract MacGuffins; their mechanics are told rather than explored through choice. The ending's epiphany ("he found his freedom") follows a familiar redemption structure without transformation or risk. Coincidence (finding the father's journal) drives the turn, undercutting ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elias's identity as the son of the boy who cried wolf is declared and frames his abstract motivation, but the lineage does not constrain on-page choices. No decision arises causally from this heritage; it functions as thematic label. Present in setup and ending as metaphor, but lacks middle development or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The lattice is mentioned in the opening, clutched during descent, and held at the ending, but its physicality and function remain vague. It "sustains impossibilities" and "hums" symbolically without constraining action or enabling a tactic. Swappable with any talisman; no unique property shapes a beat. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is named early and recurs thematically, but the concept does not alter on-page tactics. Elias's rejection of silence is told in summary rather than enacted through a choice with cost. The hush mechanism (tied to the lattice, consuming bodies) is explained but never tested. Present in setup and ending as metaphor, lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is attributed to the lattice but remains a label without visible tradeoff. No on-page action hinges on this trait; it ornaments description. Mentioned multiple times but never constrains or enables a choice. Swappable with any vague magical property.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Hover" appears twice as metaphor (near the door, in defiance at the ending) but never as literal action with stakes. Easily swappable with "linger" or "stand." Does not drive a turn or redefine options; ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>The narrow door is mentioned early and revisited at the ending, but "through the scuffs" plays no causal role. Elias pushes it open without resistance; the scuffs "glow faintly" as ornament. The method does not shape attempts or constrain tactics. Present but functionless.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison off a jagged reef is named early, frames spatial movement (descent, return), and anchors the final image. The setting supplies the staircase and chamber but does not constrain choices; Elias's access is unimpeded. The reef is postcard backdrop in the ending. Present across beats with some structural integration but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" is declared in the opening but never tightens on-page decisions. No clock is tracked; Elias reads the journal and ascends without urgency. The timeframe ornaments stakes as abstract label but does not alter tactics. Setup present, middle and closure absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with your own story" is stated early and echoed at the ending, but the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Elias's shift from silence to truth is summarized epiphany without visible cost. Present in setup and ending with thematic weight but lacks friction or tradeoff in beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" appears once to describe the chamber's glow, then returns in the final paragraph as metaphor ("faded as dawn broke"). Tone does not modulate with pressure; the elevated, philosophical register remains static. The phrase charges one image descriptively but does not shape the ending's emotional weight or reconfigure prior material.</comment>
