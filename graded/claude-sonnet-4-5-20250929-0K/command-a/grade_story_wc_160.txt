<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is declared (harmonize conflicting values) but never internally contradictory or tested by a visible tradeoff on the page. His "trembling" is asserted twice but remains ornamental; the text tells us he's resolving to find balance, yet we never see him struggle between what the villagers want and what the scholars want in a moment that costs him something. The final design is sketched in dust and accepted by both parties off-page, foreclosing any dramatized choice. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("his mind worked like the gears") and the epiphany arrives without prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn "Elias, the ingenious floodgate machinist" in paragraph one, but who summoned him, why he's uniquely suited, and what actual conflict he faces remain vague until late in paragraph two. The closure—Elias presents a compromise plan that both parties accept—occurs entirely off-page ("By dawn, Elias had presented his plan…The scholars nodded; the villagers sighed in relief"). No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; the resolution is summarized, not dramatized. The drive lens is ambiguous (Causal gestures compete with Accumulative motifs like the chain's poem), and the adhesive analysis delivers information but does not narrow options or alter tactics in scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The amphitheater's "breathing" walls and glowing cracks create atmosphere and recur at closure ("seemed less foreboding now"), reweighting the setting with a felt change. Spatial choreography is clear (center, walls, fissures), and the volcanic heat underscores tension. However, the setting does not constrain a choice: Elias paces and sketches freely, and the amphitheater's approval is metaphorical rather than tactical. The antique chain and adhesive details anchor the scene in specificity but do not alter Elias's access or options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (harmonize villagers' fear with scholars' curiosity) is signaled early but never escalates through on-page reversal or tightening. Elias discovers the envelope's adhesive message and the chain's poem, yet neither revelation forecloses an option or forces a trade-off; he simply synthesizes a floodgate design that satisfies everyone. No visible cost: the scholars nod, the villagers sigh in relief, and Elias leaves with his achievement intact. The tension is declared ("palpable as the heat") but never dramatized in a choice that alters tactics or meaning. Coincidence may complicate, but here nothing complicates—the solution emerges smoothly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chain's poem ("To give is to gain, to break is to mend") and the recurring amphitheater imagery seed a theme of unity through imperfection. The final paragraph attempts resonance ("the beauty in imperfection"), but it arrives as authorial statement rather than emerging from the floodgate design or Elias's visible sacrifice. The "encrypted compassion" concept is asserted twice yet never shown constraining a choice or shaping subtext. The ending gestures at reflection ("he had not broken") but does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer; instead, it summarizes the theme directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable (third-limited on Elias) with no head-hopping. Diction includes some specificity ("brass links glinting," "interlocking with the next"), but the narrative voice drifts into elevated abstraction ("testament to a time when gods and mortals might have shared the same stage") that does not reflect a machinist's perceptual signature. Psychic distance fluctuates without purpose: "his resolve dappled with doubt and hope" reads literary rather than embodied. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") are sparse and acceptable. The phrase "slyly heartfelt" appears once as a descriptor of the poem, not as a trait shaping Elias's speech or choice rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Template cadence runs dominate: "His hands trembled… his resolve dappled… his words as precise… his achievement" chains possessive openings without variation. Paraphrase loops appear ("the tension between them had grown as palpable" / "urging him forward" / "seemed to close in" / "seemed less foreboding")—the amphitheater's anthropomorphism is restated without added pressure. Stock metaphors abound: "his mind worked like the gears," "chain trailing behind him like a lifeline," "dots, both literal and metaphorical." Figurative density in peak beats (paragraphs 2–4) obscures momentum. Pronoun references and tense remain clean, and spatial choreography tracks, preventing further collapse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise (machinist harmonizes volcano fears via surveyor's chain puzzle) is functional but derivative of puzzle-box narratives and occupational-hero templates. The adhesive analysis and chain-as-map conceit offer specificity, yet the emotional arc (declared trembling → confident solution) follows a stock trajectory without transformation. The poem's final line and the floodgate compromise arrive as convenient synthesis rather than earned insight from prior friction. No bold structural risk or perspectival inflection; the narrative voice remains neutral-literary throughout. The ending's "beauty in imperfection" moralizes rather than charging a particular image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his occupation (floodgate machinist) is stated early. His key decision—designing a compromise floodgate system—occurs off-page ("By dawn, Elias had presented his plan") and is summarized rather than dramatized. He observes, deciphers, and paces, but the turn from trembling to resolve happens internally without an on-page choice that alters tactics or costs him something. His ingenuity is asserted ("ability to decipher what others could not") but not demonstrated in a beat where his specific skill constrains or enables a visible outcome. Present and functional but replaceable with another thoughtful expert.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The antique surveyor's chain appears in four beats: held in paragraph one, uncoiled and examined in paragraph three, trailing behind Elias in paragraph four, and coiled beside his sketch in paragraph five. Its inscriptions (poem fragments) provide the conceptual key ("To give is to gain, to break is to mend") that frames the floodgate compromise. The chain is not merely described; its changing use (measurement tool → map → lifeline image → coiled artifact) tracks Elias's progression. However, the chain does not constrain a choice—Elias could have arrived at the same insight without it—and the final image does not recharge it with new cost. Strong development across beats but mid-band closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Encrypted compassion" is named twice: once in the adhesive message (paragraph two) and once in the resolution summary (paragraph five, "encrypted compassion in his design"). It does not shape on-page stakes or tactics; Elias never faces a moment where encrypting versus declaring compassion alters his options or costs him something. The concept remains thematic ornament rather than a driver of choice. Label-only, no causal pressure, no closure participation beyond summary mention.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" appears once, modifying the chain's poem ("each line slyly heartfelt, speaking of unity and sacrifice," paragraph three). It describes the artifact's tone, not Elias's choices or voice. No on-page action is constrained or enabled by this attribute; Elias does not speak slyly or act with heartfelt indirection in a way that creates a tradeoff. Ornamental descriptor, no beat involvement, no cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias trembles twice: "his hands trembled as he connected the dots" (paragraph three) and "His hands stopped trembling as he sketched the design" (paragraph five). The cessation of trembling marks his shift from doubt to resolve, functioning as a micro-turn at closure. However, the trembling itself is asserted rather than embodied in a choice that alters tactics, and the action is easily swappable with any other physical marker of anxiety (e.g., "his breath steadied," "his grip tightened"). Present in setup and payoff, minor closure signal, but no middle development or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The adhesive analysis is signaled in paragraph two ("By analyzing the leftover adhesive, he had discovered a hidden message—a code that spoke of encrypted compassion") and reappears in paragraph four ("The adhesive analysis had revealed a clue: the envelope had once contained a blueprint"). The method is told rather than shown; we never see Elias perform the analysis or use its mechanics to solve a problem on the page. The revelation provides information but does not narrow options or shape attempts—Elias synthesizes the floodgate design via the chain's poem, not the adhesive. Summary-only, no dramatized use, mid-beat involvement without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The crumbling amphitheater inside the dormant volcano is anchored early and recurs across all beats. Its breathing walls and glowing cracks create atmosphere and mirror Elias's internal state. The final image ("crumbling walls seemed less foreboding now, their cracks a reminder of the beauty in imperfection") reweights the setting with thematic resonance. However, the amphitheater does not constrain a choice: Elias moves freely, and the setting's approval is metaphorical. The volcano's heat and scholars' desire for access frame the stakes but do not alter Elias's tactics on the page. Strong setup and lyric payoff, but no middle pressure or resource constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" (timeframe prompt) is interpreted as the amphitheater's anthropomorphic breathing, mentioned in paragraphs two ("seemed to breathe around him") and five ("The amphitheater's breath steadied"). This rhythmic motif sets a tone but does not function as a clock that tightens decisions. Elapsed time is vague; the phrase "By dawn" in paragraph six introduces the only temporal marker, yet it does not pressure Elias's work—he completes the design off-page. No live ticking constraint, no tactics shaped by time scarcity. Present as atmospheric motif, absent as timeframe pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (harmonize the villagers' fear with the scholars' curiosity) is stated in paragraph one and drives his task. The conflict is set up early and resolved at closure when he presents the compromise floodgate. However, the motivation is never dramatized as internal friction: Elias does not weigh loyalty to one group over the other or sacrifice a personal value to achieve balance. The harmonization is told as achieved ("encrypted compassion in his design had harmonized their conflicting values") rather than shown through a choice with visible cost. Functional setup and resolution, but no on-page friction or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" is interpreted through Elias's oscillation between doubt and confidence. The phrase "his resolve dappled with doubt and hope" appears in paragraph three, and "slyly heartfelt resolve" closes the story in paragraph six. Tone shifts from uncertain ("trembled") to steady ("stopped trembling," "steadied") as pressure mounts, modulating with the amphitheater's breathing. However, the modulation is asserted via filter language rather than enacted through syntax or rhythm that charges the final image. The tone descriptor is present and coherent but does not constrain diction or elevate the closure beat through cadence control. Functional, mid-band coherence, minimal charge.</comment>
