<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The priest is defined entirely through abstract labels ("loop pedal priest," "guardian of time and sound") without embodied emotion, micro-choices under pressure, or internal contradiction. Interiority is replaced by metaphysical narration ("his voice could weave and rewind moments") that tells function rather than showing stakes-driven choice. The "climax" — the priest declaring "The unraveled stillness is not chaos but clarity" — arrives without prior struggle or contradictory impulses; the possession simply "recoils" without earned cost or alteration in the protagonist. Motivation remains declarative and external throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors appear early but remain abstract ("dimensional anchor," "vast and enigmatic space") without spatial grounding past ~120 words; apply −0.4. Drive lens: ambiguous through midpoint (accumulative metaphor versus causal mission-plot); by the end the priest's declaration causes the possession to dissolve, suggesting causal intent, but linkage is asserted not dramatized. Closure effect: the possession "recoils" and "dissolves" off-page with no visible cost to the priest — no path foreclosed, no felt price, no resonant reconfiguration. The final silence is described as "different" but the change is told, not shown in a choice or image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Setting remains abstract throughout: "dimensional anchor" offers no spatial constraints, access points, or tactile detail that shapes choice. The palette is mentioned but never handled or used as a tool; it "glows" and "fades" without altering tactics. Sensory detail is generic metaphor ("muffled clarity," "resonant" silence) rather than concrete perception. Orientation cap applied in Q2 carries forward: cap Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("stop the possession") is signaled early but never tested with a trade-off or narrowed option. The priest's questions and palette-waving encounter no resistance; the possession's "hunger" is described but never forces a micro-choice or tactical shift. The final beat — "The possession recoiled, its form dissolving" — is passive outcome, not protagonist agency under pressure. No visible cost: the priest steps back "into the shadows" unchanged, no path foreclosed. One meaningful tightening or deepening is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme ("hidden assumptions," "unquestioned beliefs") is stated repeatedly in abstract diction rather than emerging from concrete action. The priest's rhetorical questions ("What is unseen yet holds us?") are offered as keys but arrive as philosophical prompts, not scene-specific inquiry with stakes. The final declaration — "The unraveled stillness is not chaos but clarity" — is a thematic thesis statement in place of resonant image. No non-literal answer; the ending moralizes directly. Conceptual Repricing is claimed but not dramatized with undeniable cost or reweighted prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Voice is homogeneous elevated-register abstraction ("threads," "void given form," "symphony of inquiry") without perceptual signature or rhythmic shift under pressure. POV distance is stable (third limited) but narrator certainty exceeds what the priest can plausibly observe ("a being of pure assumption, feeding on unquestioned beliefs"). No dialogue. Prose reads as committee voice — "cosmic event," "muffled clarity," "stillness that cloaked the anchor" — generic philosophical phrasing rather than character-particular idiom. Orientation debt applied in Q2 carries cap at 7.8; line-level issues independently warrant this score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Heavy text-artifact load: paraphrase loops ("silence wasn't empty but resonant," "silence now carried weight, a deliberate pause"), template cadence ("The priest…," "The anchor…," "The possession…" across consecutive sentences), and stock metaphor strings ("threads," "void," "fabric of existence"). Mixed metaphors: the palette's "black color" is simultaneously "absence, potential, the space" and something that can be "painted…in the air itself" without coherent physical logic. Register is uniformly abstract-philosophical with no modulation. Filter-verb stacks and synonym churn ("plumb," "unraveling," "peeled back") across peak beats. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("a little less afraid of its own questions"). Apply −1.7 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Core premise (mystic guardian uses abstract art-tool and rhetorical questions to stop cosmic possession) reads as template high-concept fantasy without transformation through specific lived detail or world logic. The "loop pedal priest" and "palette with one color" are quirky labels without causal necessity — the priest could use any other symbolic tool with minor edits. Emotional and tactical arcs could transfer unchanged to different names and settings; the Transformation Test fails. Thematic stance ("question assumptions") is familiar and executed through generic philosophical prompts rather than a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character present throughout but choices are declarative, not dramatic: the priest "knew," "began to plumb," "raised his voice" without on-page trade-offs or reversals. Observation and narration dominate; no key turn traces to a micro-choice under pressure. Late first functional mention (palette-waving) after midpoint. Missing middle development and closure participation as agent; the possession reacts to his declaration, but the priest himself is unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Palette appears in three beats: introduction, mid-scene "paint with the black color," and final glow/fade. Each mention is ornamental description without handling that alters tactics. The "black color" is described as "void given form" and "absence, potential" but these metaphysical claims do not constrain a choice or enable a tactic on the page. Missing causal pressure and closure linkage; the palette fades "as if it had never been" without reweighting prior material. Cap at 4.6 for late functional development; lower to 3.1 for swappability (could be any symbolic art-tool).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Unraveled stillness" appears as theme-label in dialogue ("The unraveled stillness is not chaos but clarity") and earlier narration ("stillness that had been unraveled over eons"). Concept is told, not dramatized: it does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. No on-page cost tied to unraveling stillness; the priest's work succeeds without trade-off. Missing middle development and closure participation as stake-driver. Present only as abstract motif.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Decorates with silence" is mentioned twice: opening narration ("decorated with silence, not as an absence but as a presence") and mid-scene ("His silence now carried weight"). Attribute is described, not enacted: no on-page action where silence constrains or enables a choice with cost. Label-only trait. Missing middle development and closure participation. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure; lower to 2.2 for label-only use and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Plumb" appears three times: "plumb the anchor's essence," "priest's rhetorical devices…plumbing the depths," and "He continued to plumb." Action is told in narration without dramatized mechanics or cost. Major turn (possession's dissolution) is not traced to plumbing; it reacts to the priest's declaration instead. Missing middle causal linkage. Cap at 3.4 for missing middle development; lower to 3.0 for summary-only use and swappability (could be "probe," "explore," "question").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Method signaled early ("His method was through rhetorical devices, questions…") and appears in two beats: the opening questions and the mid-scene "questions growing more pointed." Mechanics are told ("keys, unlocking layers") but the questions themselves do not shape attempts or constrain tactics with cost. The possession reacts to the final declaration, not to the prior questions. Missing closure participation as method-driver. Cap at 3.4 for missing middle causal development; lower to 2.6 for told-only mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor is present throughout but offers no spatial constraints, access points, or resources that alter tactics. It is described as "vast and enigmatic space," "place of muffled clarity," with "walls shifting" and "cracking" in response to the priest's work, but these reactions do not supply or withhold anything the priest needs. Postcard description without pressure. Missing middle development and closure participation as constraint. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure; lower to 2.3 for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>Timeframe ("before the possession completes") is declared in opening and closing ("In the final moments before the possession completed") but never tracked on the page. The possession's approach is described as "growing stronger, its hunger more insistent," but this urgency does not tighten the priest's decisions or alter tactics. The clock is asserted ("a race against time"), not felt. Vague time trends low. Missing middle development and closure participation as tightener.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Motivation stated in opening ("to illuminate hidden assumptions before the possession completed") and echoed in the priest's questions and final declaration. Desire is told, not dramatized in conflicted choices: the priest encounters no friction between illuminating assumptions and another want or cost. The mission succeeds without trade-off. Missing middle causal pressure. Cap at 3.4 for missing middle development and swappability (generic hero-mission phrasing).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Muffled clarity" is signaled early and modulates once: "The anchor's atmosphere shifted, the muffled clarity sharpening into focus." Tone is abstract-philosophical throughout without modulation under pressure; the priest's voice and narration maintain uniform elevated register across opening, crisis, and closure. The final image ("a different silence—one of understanding") is told as tonal shift rather than charged through sentence rhythm or diction change. Missing closure charge. Cap at 4.6 for late development; lower to 3.8 for static mood with one asserted shift.</comment>
