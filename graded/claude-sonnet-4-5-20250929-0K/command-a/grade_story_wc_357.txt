<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains a label rather than a lived consciousness; her "intrepid" status is told, not embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The arrow tip pulses and grows warm, but her reaction is generic awe rather than character-specific perception. Her "discovery" of resilience arrives as a convenient epiphany without prior struggle or blind spots that would make the insight earned. The final claim that "she had discovered the source of resilience…for herself" tells the arc rather than dramatizing a renunciation or shift with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story presents a linear quest structure: retrieve artifact, follow river, reach grove, restore echoes. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but causality is driven by the arrow tip's convenience rather than protagonist choice—it pulses, flares, projects a map, and completes itself without Elara confronting a meaningful trade-off. The closure attempts Decisive Change (echoes restored, planet thriving), yet the cost is invisible; Elara presses the artifact into a groove and light erupts, resolving the problem the artifact created without forecloses a live option on her part. The lens reads Causal by intent but delivers outcomes via object magic rather than because/therefore linkage rooted in her agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet's floating rock arches, bioluminescent moss, and gravity inversion create vivid sensory anchors, and the massive archway's cooler air and emerald glow are specific. The grove's towering trees with star-shimmer fruit and the monolithic stone provide a charged final setting. However, the environment remains decorative; gravity inversion is declared imminent but never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page, and the river's flow guides navigation in summary rather than through embodied spatial problem-solving. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not pressure the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—find the source of resilience—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens through protagonist agency. Elara follows the arrow tip's cues (it pulses, flares, projects a map) rather than making choices that foreclose options. The "echoes are fading" complication is told in a summary beat, not dramatized as a constraint that forces a trade-off. The resolution (pressing the artifact into the stone) is a single mechanical act with no visible cost, no loss of alternative, and no tactical alteration. The inversion hour, declared as chaotic, passes without affecting her movements or decisions.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of resilience emerges through the planet's memory-encoded plants and Elara's stated discovery of "her purpose, her resilience, and her home," but the final paragraph moralizes rather than offering a resonant image. The echoes gathering in the grove and the broken arrow becoming whole carry symbolic potential, yet their meaning is explained rather than reweighted through Elara's concrete sacrifice or renunciation. The whirling silence bookends the piece, but the phrase functions as ornament rather than a charged motif that constrains choice. The ending asserts theme ("the delicate balance between life and chaos") in abstract terms that replace scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prose carries a consistent elevated register ("whirling silence," "the planet's song"). However, diction drifts toward generic epic fantasy at pressure points—"her heart raced," "she stood in awe," "the echoes had chosen her"—without character-particular perception. Elara's way of noticing (moss-covered ship, organic patterns) is told rather than filtered through specific professional or personal bias. The narrative withholds what the symbols on the arrow tip mean until the hologram appears, a purposeful elision, but the reveal does not alter her tactics or impose cost; it simply confirms her trajectory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentences are grammatically clean and rhythm varies, but several beats loop without adding pressure: "The orchard planet was unlike any other" restates what the opening already showed, and "Elara's heart raced; this was the source of resilience she'd been seeking" tells emotion and plot rather than advancing either. The phrase "whirling silence" recurs three times, twice as ornament. Figurative language ("shimmered like stars," "chorus of whispers") leans stock. The final paragraph stacks summary claims ("she had discovered," "she knew," "she would protect") that deflate the closure image rather than letting it resonate. Information density is moderate; beats often do two jobs (describe and advance), but scaffold phrasing ("Her mission was clear," "she realized") reduces propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating arches and gravity inversion offers visual novelty, but the quest structure (find artifact, follow map, restore power) is template-standard. The broken arrow tip that "becomes whole" at the moment of restoration is a familiar fantasy motif executed without transformation. Elara's emotional arc—discovering resilience within—is asserted rather than earned through specific, non-obvious synthesis. The echoes as planetary memory and accelerated plant growth hint at fresh concepts, yet they remain exposition rather than constraints that force difficult choices. The piece reads competent but derivative, with no turn or inflection that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is on the page throughout and her goal (find the source of resilience) frames the quest, but her agency is minimal. She steers her ship, clutches the arrow tip, and presses it into the stone—observation and mechanical compliance rather than choices that create reversals. The artifact's cues (pulsing, flaring, projecting the map) drive turns, not her decisions. Late cap applies (causal role limited to following prompts), and swappability is high (any competent pilot could perform these actions). Setup and payoff gates are met, but middle development shows no on-page choice that alters tactics or narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The broken arrow tip appears in beat one (setup), pulses and grows warm in the inversion approach (middle), projects the holographic map, and "becomes whole" when pressed into the stone at closure (payoff). All three gates met. It participates in three distinct beats and shapes the ending image. However, its function is passive convenience—it guides rather than constrains, and Elara never faces a cost tied to using it (no trade-off, no risk of breaking it further). Specificity is present (symbols, hologram), but causal pressure is low; it solves the problem it introduced without forcing a sacrifice. Score: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, swappability −0.5, ornamental use −0.6, resolves without creating friction −0.9 → mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The gathering of echoes is revealed in the holographic map, described as "residual imprints" stored in plants, and restored when the arrow tip completes the stone. Setup delayed to midpoint (−0.3), payoff present. The concept frames the climax but does not constrain Elara's choices—she learns of it, reaches it, and activates it in summary. It operates as backstory explanation rather than a force that alters her tactics or imposes a visible cost. Two gates (middle learn, closure restore), one beat of involvement (+0.4), closure linkage weak (activated off-stage), swappability moderate (any "memory network" could serve) −0.6, summary-only −0.4 → low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Accelerated plant growth is mentioned twice: "growth accelerated by the planet's unique forces" (paragraph two) and "plants growing visibly faster" at closure. Setup present, closure cameo. The trait is a setting feature, not a constraint or enabler tied to a character choice. It does not narrow options, impose cost, or require Elara to adapt tactics. Label-only (−0.3), ornamental (−0.6), swappability high (any growth effect could serve) −0.5, no middle development gate (cap 3.4) → low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Discovery ("discover the source of resilience") is the stated mission and frames every beat: following the river, reading the hologram, reaching the grove, and restoring the echoes. Setup immediate, payoff at closure, all three gates met. However, the action is observation-heavy—Elara discovers by arriving and pressing the artifact, not by solving a problem or making a sacrifice that redefines her options. The verb "discover" is swappable with "reach" or "activate" with minimal structural change. Three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.0), setup (+0.5), swappability (−0.6), summary-only climax (−0.5) → mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Navigating by water flow appears in paragraph one ("the flow her only reliable guide") and paragraph five ("followed the river's flow to the grove"). Setup and payoff present, but the method is told rather than shown as a tactic under pressure. The river is a static guide; Elara does not adjust course, read currents, or face a navigational problem that this method solves. Two beats (+0.9), setup (+0.4), closure linkage weak (she arrives, but the method does not charge the image) +0.3, summary-only (−0.6), swappability (−0.5) → low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is established in paragraph one and the massive archway becomes the midpoint anchor where the arrow tip projects the map. The grove in the final act is planet-specific (towering trees, monolithic stone). Setup immediate, development and payoff present, all three gates. The arches provide visual texture and the grove supplies the closure location, but neither pressures Elara's choices—she navigates through them without obstacle or cost. Three beats (+1.4), setup (+0.6), closure location (+0.5), no constraint on choice (−0.7), postcard description in opener (−0.4) → mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The gravity inversion hour is introduced in the opening line and mentioned again: "As the inversion hour approached" and "the gravity inversion began, and the world tilted, but she remained steady." Setup and middle mention present, closure reference ("the gravity inversion ended and the world righted itself"). The timeframe does not tighten a decision or alter tactics; Elara "remained steady" without adaptation, and the ending notes its conclusion in summary. Three gates met by mention, but no live clock that forces a trade-off. Setup (+0.5), three mentions (+1.4), no causal pressure (−0.9), summary-only (−0.7), swappability (any hour-window could serve) (−0.5) → low-3s, capped at 3.4 for missing middle development as a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Finding the source of resilience is Elara's stated mission in the opening and frames her actions throughout, with closure claiming "she had discovered the source of resilience…for herself." Setup immediate, payoff at closure, three gates met. However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. She does not hesitate, doubt, or sacrifice an alternative goal; the quest proceeds linearly. Three beats (+1.4), setup (+0.6), closure linkage (+0.8), told-only interiority (−0.8), no friction between want and cost (−0.6) → low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Whirling silence appears in the opening line, recurs in "the whirling silence now alive with the planet's song," and closes with "In the whirling silence, Elara Voss found her purpose." Setup and closure reprise present, two gates. The phrase carries lyric resonance and modulates from silent to "alive," but it remains atmospheric—tone does not constrain choice or shift under pressure (the inversion is declared chaotic, yet Elara remains steady without adaptation). Early seed + final reprise (+1.0), closure linkage (+0.6), setup (+0.5), static mood in middle beats (−0.5), ornamental recurrence (−0.4), no pressure modulation (−0.4) → mid-4s.</comment>
