<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is stated clearly ("hold the line against the tyranny of indifference") but her interiority relies on abstract declarations rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "underestimated rebel" framing is told repeatedly without dramatizing genuine stakes or miscalculation that compounds. Her resourcefulness is asserted ("carefully resourceful," piecing together puddle maps) but the final choice—transmitting the ledger—arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path; she simply adapts and vanishes, leaving no felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph, satisfying the test. The drive lens reads as causal-situational hybrid, but the escalation is weak: Mara finds the archive, retrieves the ledger, and broadcasts it without meaningful resistance or a decision that narrows options. The closure—her vanishing into the night after the broadcast—lacks visible cost; she retains the key, her freedom, and her mission with no on-page forfeiture or reconfiguration. The enforcers' arrival functions as a late complication that she sidesteps rather than a turn that alters stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The auric lagoon is vivid and anchored early (emerald/gold waters, starlight, damp sand) and it constrains Mara's access by requiring her to wade and locate the submerged door. The archive's sensory details (algae-encrusted door, dusty records, flickering holograms) build atmosphere but remain largely ornamental in the final beats. The setting does not charge the closure image; Mara's escape into "the night" with stars "winking in approval" is generic and ungrounded in prior spatial particulars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving the revised histories and reigniting resistance—is declared early but never tested by a genuine reversal or trade-off. The enforcers' approach is mentioned but Mara adapts without visible cost, retaining both the key and her freedom. The broadcast solves the problem without sacrifice; no live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered by constraint. Escalation is absent under any lens; the lagoon's resistance is metaphorical ("seemed to resist"), and the archive sequence is a retrieval without complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of defiance against "the tyranny of indifference" and "coded freedom" emerges through the key, the revised histories, and Mara's mission, but it is frequently stated rather than enacted. The final image—stars winking in approval, Mara vanishing as a "ghost in their machine"—gestures toward resonance but relies on abstract metaphor ("coded freedom," "hold the line") without a non-literal answer grounded in particulars. The ledger's contents are never specified, leaving the "truths" generic and the thematic payoff unearned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and Mara's perceptual filter is consistent (mission-focused, resourceful). However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("auric," "suffixed humanity's spirit," "tyranny of indifference") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Interior access is shallow, relying on summary ("her heart pounding," "her mind raced") rather than specific, character-particular texture. The prose modulates little under peak stress; Mara's thought at the climax ("she did what she did best—she adapted") is generic and unearned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Multiple text artifacts degrade clarity and momentum. Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "She was the underestimated rebel, the one they dismissed" then "a rebel who refused to be underestimated"; "carefully resourceful" is both an attribute and restated as "Mara was carefully resourceful." Template cadence runs ("She had…," "She was…," "Mara's…") dominate the opening third. Stock metaphors ("stars seemed to wink in approval," "hold the line," "ghost in their machine") cluster in the closure beat, dulling the final image. Figurative density is high without payoff; "suffixed humanity's spirit" and "auric lagoon" read as thesaurus choices that obscure rather than sharpen. These artifacts appear in the final third, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—underestimated rebel uses a relic key to access hidden archives and broadcast suppressed truths—is a recognizable template without transformation. The puddle-map method is mentioned but not developed into a specific, irreplaceable mechanic; it functions as a convenience to locate the lagoon. Mara's resourcefulness is asserted rather than demonstrated through ingenious constraint-solving; the archive's ancient communication system appears on cue to solve the broadcast problem without prior setup. The emotional arc is linear and predictable, with no risky turns or non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Mara (underestimated rebel) is present throughout and her choices advance the plot (wading into the lagoon, unlocking the door, broadcasting the ledger), satisfying setup and development gates. However, her final choice—transmitting the archive and slipping into shadows—is a competent adaptation rather than a decision that alters stakes or forecloses a path with visible cost. The "underestimated" framing is told repeatedly but never tested on the page; no one underestimates her in scene, and she executes her plan without meaningful friction. Swappable with a "determined rebel" or "resourceful infiltrator" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The phone booth key is signaled early (end of first paragraph), used functionally in the lagoon beat (unlocking the submerged door), and carried to the final line ("the key still clutched in her hand"), satisfying all three gates. It is tied to "coded freedom" and described as a symbol of defiance, adding specificity. However, it does not constrain or enable a mid-story choice with cost, and its final mention is a static cameo rather than a reweighted reprise. The "defunct phone company" backstory is told but not developed into irreplaceable mechanics; a generic "archive key" would function identically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Revised histories" are signaled early (Mara has "studied the revised histories, uncovering the truths") and shape the dominant stake (proving the original rebellion). The archive ledger contains "the original rebellion—not the sanitized version," driving the climax beat. The concept participates in closure (the broadcast reawakens resistance). However, the histories are never specified or dramatized; the ledger's contents remain abstract ("raw, unfiltered history"), leaving the concept generic. The tension between official and true history is told rather than enacted through a specific distortion or consequence that alters Mara's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is mentioned twice as a label ("Mara's resourcefulness was her greatest asset," "Mara was carefully resourceful") and cited in the puddle-map method. However, the trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through visible trade-offs or constraint-driven ingenuity. The archive's communication system appears on cue to solve the broadcast problem without prior setup or resource scarcity. The final escape ("she did what she did best—she adapted") is generic competence without a visible cost tied to this trait. Swappable with "clever" or "determined" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Reappear" is mentioned twice: Mara plans to "reappear—not as the ghost of a failed rebellion, but as its beacon" and later "she would reappear when they least expected it." However, the action occurs off-page as a future intention rather than a dramatized turn. The broadcast initiates her reappearance to the city, but the mechanics are compressed into summary ("transmitted the ledger's contents to every corner of the city"). Removing "reappear" and replacing it with "escape" or "strike back" would not fundamentally alter the plot. No visible cost or tactical shift is tied to this specific action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The puddle-map method is signaled in the second paragraph ("pieced together the map from puddle reflections at dusk") and mentioned again ("The map had suggested this was the spot"). It provides the lagoon's location, satisfying setup and development gates. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown; Mara does not interact with puddles on the page, and the method's specificity does not constrain her tactics or impose cost. The map is absent from the closure beat. Swappable with "ancient map," "coded coordinates," or "insider tip" with minor edits; the puddle detail is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The auric lagoon is anchored early (opening line) with vivid detail (emerald/gold waters, starlight, damp sand) and pressures Mara's access (wading to waist depth, finding the submerged door). The setting participates in all three gates: setup, development (the water resists her), and closure (she vanishes "into the night" with stars above). However, the lagoon's specificity does not charge the final image; Mara's escape into "the night" abandons the lagoon's particulars. The "auric" descriptor and "under starlight" are vivid but do not alter tactics beyond requiring her to wade.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "when plans unravel" is signaled ("her plans, however, were unraveling faster than she could mend them") and the enforcers' approach creates urgency ("closing in," "footsteps echoed above"). This satisfies setup and development gates. However, the clock is vague; no specific duration or ticking constraint is tracked, and Mara's final moves (transmitting the ledger, slipping into shadows) proceed without visible time pressure or a forced trade-off. The unraveling is told ("faster than she could mend them") rather than dramatized through failed attempts or tactical pivots.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The motivation "to hold the line against the tyranny of indifference" is stated explicitly in the third paragraph and repeated in the final paragraph. It shapes the dominant stake (broadcasting the suppressed truths to reawaken resistance) and drives the climax choice. This satisfies setup, development, and closure gates. However, the motivation is abstract and told rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or a visible cost. The "tyranny of indifference" is never specified or enacted; Mara's mission proceeds without friction between this want and a competing need or fear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Coded freedom" appears as a descriptor (the key is "a symbol of defiance, a coded freedom etched into its brass surface") and in the climax ("a coded freedom broadcast"). The tone gestures toward defiance and secrecy but is undermined by over-explanation and stock metaphors ("ghost in their machine," "hold the line"). The prose remains declarative and elevated throughout, with little modulation under pressure. The final image ("stars above seemed to wink in approval") shifts into wish-fulfillment rather than sustaining the coded, tense tone. The broadcast's "coded" nature is told but not enacted through specific encryption or risk.</comment>
