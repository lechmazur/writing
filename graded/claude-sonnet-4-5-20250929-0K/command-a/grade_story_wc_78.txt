<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leeward remains more archetype than individual; his motivation ("turn obstacles into instruments") is declared repeatedly but never contradicted or complicated by a competing impulse. The restlessness mentioned at the opening vanishes without dramatized internal friction or cost—he simply plays and achieves peace. Embodied emotion is thin: "heart full and his spirit at peace" labels rather than enacts the shift, and no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly within the first paragraph. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (restlessness replaced by "restless euphony"), but the cost is asserted rather than legible—no foreclosed path or visible trade-off appears on the page. The xylophone sequence accumulates sensory density and the clouds respond, yet the final image ("restless euphony that lingered in the air like a promise") delivers thematic claim without demonstrable consequence or altered tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating orchard on driftwood is vivid and consistently tracked; sensory details (blue hour hues, leaves whispering, seashells in the xylophone) are selective and atmospheric. The xylophone itself—driftwood and seashells—subtly constrains Leeward's action (he must use what the orchard provides) and charges the final beat. Spatial choreography is clean, and the sea-and-sky setting modulates with the narrative pulse, meeting the micro-setting test for higher-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (interpreting the clouds' message, resolving restlessness) is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or cost. Leeward strikes notes, the clouds respond cooperatively, and the orchard harmonizes—no reversal, no trade-off, no escalation. The "restlessness" is declared resolved in a single uncontested sequence, and agency reduces to uninterrupted action rather than a choice that forecloses an option or incurs visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (obstacles as instruments, discord into harmony) is over-articulated: "sketched resonance," "turn obstacles into instruments," "restless euphony" label rather than enact the concept. The xylophone mallet recurs with symbolic weight, but the final paragraph moralizes ("The world was his instrument, and he was its prophet") instead of letting image resonate. The fractal-cloud map offers an interesting visual, yet its thematic payoff is told rather than earned through a non-obvious choice or reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and psychic distance controlled; no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent—elevated, slightly archaic ("gnarled," "hum with a life of its own")—and fits the oracular role. However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular, and the prose lacks rhythmic variation under pressure: syntactic patterns and paragraph lengths remain uniform throughout, dulling momentum at the climactic xylophone sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity is high, but information density is low—many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing action or knowledge. Template cadence is pervasive: "He was not merely…but," "The orchard was…," "As he…" sentence stems repeat across paragraphs. The final third contains paraphrase loops ("restlessness was gone, replaced by a restless euphony") and filter-verb stacks ("he felt," "he knew," "he realized") that dull immediacy. Minor scaffold penalties accumulate but do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise (tide prophet, floating orchard, cloud-reading xylophone) combines several prompt elements but follows a familiar New Age template: mystic perceives cosmic message, performs ritual, achieves harmony without struggle. The fractal-cloud map and driftwood xylophone are visually fresh, yet the emotional arc—restlessness to peace via uncontested action—is generic. No risk-taking or transformation elevates the synthesis; the piece reads as a mood exercise rather than an earned discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Leeward is present throughout and his action (playing the xylophone) drives the sequence, but his choices are uncontested and do not alter tactics or foreclose options—he simply executes his role as interpreter. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, yet causal pressure is minimal: the clouds cooperate, the orchard harmonizes, and no cost or trade-off appears.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet is introduced early ("his tool…smooth and worn"), handled in the central beat (striking notes), and returns with modest reweighted meaning in the final image ("he lowered the mallet"). It enables the core action and symbolizes transformation, meeting setup, development, and payoff. However, it does not constrain choice or impose cost—Leeward uses it without friction or consequence, limiting causal indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Sketched resonance" is named in paragraph one and explained ("every obstacle…could be transformed into an instrument of harmony"), then echoed thematically in the final beat ("restless euphony"). It remains a label rather than a mechanic that shapes on-page choices or tactics. No cost or constraint tied to the concept appears; it functions as theme assertion rather than story engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Leeward "interprets cloud movements" throughout; the clouds are fractal, respond to his music, and form "a map, a guide." This trait enables the central action and is present in setup, middle, and closure. However, it does not constrain or impose cost—he reads the clouds successfully without error, hesitation, or trade-off. The attribute is functional but swappable with any other interpretive skill.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Dub" appears once as a descriptor for the first xylophone note ("a clear, resonant dub"). It does not recur, shape a turn, or differ functionally from "note" or "tone." No causal work or closure linkage is evident; the term is ornamental and easily replaced without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Fractal generating" is mentioned in paragraph two ("fractal…as if they had been generated by some cosmic algorithm") and again in paragraph five ("Each strike of the mallet was a step in the fractal-generating process"). It frames the cloud-reading action but does not alter tactics or impose a visible constraint. Present in setup and development but without distinct cost or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The orchard afloat on driftwood is established in the opening, provides the xylophone (made of driftwood and seashells), and recurs in the climax ("the orchard joined in, its leaves rustling in harmony"). It constrains resources (Leeward must use what is available) and charges the final image ("the orchard would continue to float"). Setup, development, and payoff are present, with modest causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The blue hour is signaled in paragraph one ("At the blue hour, when the sky was painted in hues of indigo and silver") and returns at closure ("As the blue hour faded into twilight"). It sets atmospheric tone and marks the passage of narrative time, yet it does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. Present in setup and payoff with lyric resonance but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To turn obstacles into instruments" is stated explicitly in paragraph two and restated in paragraph six ("His motivation was clear: to turn obstacles into instruments"). It frames Leeward's goal and is present at closure, but the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. Setup and payoff are met; middle friction is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Restless euphony" appears as a phrase in the final paragraph ("replaced by a restless euphony that lingered in the air like a promise"). Tone throughout is elevated, meditative, and harmonious, with modest modulation as the xylophone sequence intensifies. The closing image charges the phrase with thematic weight, meeting setup (restlessness mentioned early) and payoff, though the tone remains more static than dynamically restless.</comment>
