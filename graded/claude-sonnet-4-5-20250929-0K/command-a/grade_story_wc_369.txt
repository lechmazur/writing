<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias remains almost entirely reactive, adjusting and turning the sextant without facing a meaningful choice that narrows his path or reveals contradiction. Motivation is declared ("to discover what trees witness") but acts as poetic ornament rather than dramatized want confronting fear or cost. Interior life is delivered through therapy-adjacent reflection ("the resilience of the human spirit") rather than embodied micro-choices. A faint micro-turn appears when he places the repaired sextant down, but no visible cost forecloses a prior option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: moonlight and dream fragments coalesce toward a pattern-break moment. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—the sextant heals, the labyrinth lightens—but cost remains abstract and conceptual ("sorrow made whole") without a visible forfeiture or decision that alters Elias's stance on the page. The ending declares transformation rather than dramatizing a decisive before/after with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stormlit tower, moonlight through cracked window, and dusty table create coherent spatial grounding. The sextant's brass and shattered glass receive tactile attention across beats, and the moonlight acts as a physical catalyst (healing the glass). Spatial choreography (chamber, corridor, descent) tracks cleanly. The setting does not constrain a tactical choice at a pressure point, capping high-band eligibility, but micro-setting (the table, the sextant as object-setting) charges the ending image sufficiently for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled: repair/understand the labyrinth's sorrow repository. Pressure accumulates through the sextant's deconstruction and the dream fragments coalescing, constituting one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. No reversal or narrowing choice tests Elias's commitment; the sextant heals passively in moonlight without a decision or trade-off. Cost remains declared ("weight of what trees witness") rather than a visible forfeiture that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme ("sorrow quantified and healed," "what trees witness") emerges through recurring imagery: the sextant as vessel, moonlight as healer, dreams as mapped fragments. The final image attempts to reweight prior material but delivers a stated moral ("the resilience of the human spirit, the beauty of sorrow made whole") rather than trusting scene particulars to land the answer. Thematic Echo in the penultimate paragraph ("what trees witness: the resilience...") shifts the effect from earned resonance to explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction veers into elevated register ("repository of scattered dreams," "accumulation of lives, the quantified sorrow of existence") that sits uneasily with a maintenance worker's practical task. Psychic distance widens at emotional peaks into abstract philosophizing rather than tightening to embodied perception. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular. The voice is consistent but lacks the particularized texture needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "The sextant was more than a tool; it was a key" followed immediately by "the sextant guided him differently" and "The sextant wasn't just broken; it was a vessel." Template cadence runs appear ("each corridor a fragment," "each piece he removed revealed a fragment"). Stock metaphors ("the shadow of the stormlit tower," "the soft hum of dreams") lack fresh propulsion. Baseline −0.8 for paraphrase/template patterns; an additional −0.3 for therapy-adjacent abstraction ("sorrow quantified," "resilience of the human spirit") that flattens concreteness in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise—maintenance worker repairs dreamscape labyrinth via symbolic object—follows a widely used template: liminal occupation discovers metaphysical truth through mystical artifact. Execution relies on stock metaphor chains (moonlight heals, trees witness time, broken objects mirror broken souls) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The emotional arc (discovery of resilience) could transfer unchanged to different names and setting. Derivative Premise penalty −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias appears in every beat but makes no causal choice that narrows options. He adjusts, picks up, turns, deconstructs, realizes, places—all observational verbs. Setup present (opening), development ornamental (he works but does not decide), payoff cameo (he smiles and walks away). Swappable with "archaeologist" or "curator" with minor edits. Late penalty waived (present throughout), but ornamental use and lack of decision pressure cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sextant is handled across three beats: discovery/pickup, deconstruction revealing symbols, healing and replacement. It drives the middle beat (etched symbols match labyrinth patterns) and anchors the ending image (whole, gleaming). Causal pressure is moderate: it reveals dream fragments, but Elias does not face a choice tied to its use. Closure linkage strong; specificity moderate (astronomer's tool fits theme but brass-and-glass could be any relic). Two beats + closure participation + moderate specificity yield mid-6s; lack of cost connection and decision constraint prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Quantified sorrow" appears as label in two phrases ("sorrow quantified in its brokenness," "the quantified sorrow of existence") but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. No scene turn depends on measuring or counting sorrow; the concept decorates theme without altering Elias's method or options. Ornamental use; mid-development mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Moonlight healing is dramatized: the sextant's glass mends as moonlight bathes it. Setup implied (moonlight painted the stone), development on-page (glass realigns with soft glow), payoff clear (sextant whole by zenith). The trait enables the resolution but imposes no visible cost or constraint on Elias's actions—he does not trade daylight for moonlight or risk anything to access it. Two-gate participation (development + payoff) without cost connection or tactical constraint yields low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Deconstruct" appears once as Elias deconstructs the sextant's mechanism to find etched symbols. That beat reveals dream fragments and advances the repair sequence. Setup absent (action not foreshadowed), development present (one key beat), payoff indirect (the sextant heals, but via moonlight rather than continued deconstruction). One distinct beat + moderate causal linkage; swappable with "examine" or "disassemble" without major edits. Mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Mapping scattered dreams" is Elias's established method (mentioned in paragraph one and two). It frames his expertise but does not shape on-page attempts—no scene shows him actively mapping, adjusting a map, or altering tactics based on map feedback. The sextant symbols "matched the labyrinth's patterns," implying map logic, but the mechanic remains summary-only. Setup strong, development summary, payoff absent. Two-of-three gates with summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The stormlit tower and moonlight provide vivid atmosphere and anchor all action. Setup immediate (opening line), development continuous (moonlight streams, bathes the sextant, reaches zenith), payoff clear (storm passes, tower stands as beacon). The setting enables the healing but does not constrain a choice or force a tactical trade-off—Elias does not navigate obstacles, manage the storm, or sacrifice position. All three gates met; causal enablement without decision pressure yields mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"At the moment a pin dropped" appears twice as poetic framing (opening and closing) but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. No live clock measures duration, and the moonlight's zenith arrival is declared rather than used to constrain action. The phrase functions as tonal bookend without temporal pressure. Setup lyric, development absent, payoff lyric reprise. Ornamental use; lyric-resonance allowance applies but lack of tactical constraint limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>"To discover what trees witness" is stated as Elias's motivation in paragraph two and answered in the penultimate paragraph ("the resilience of the human spirit"). The desire is never dramatized as a conflicted choice—no moment shows Elias risking comfort, time, or safety to pursue the discovery. Setup present, development told-only, payoff delivered as epiphany rather than earned through friction. Summary-only use and lack of on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Mundane miracles" is named in paragraph four and closing paragraph; the tone of gentle wonder (sextant mending, dreams coalescing, lighter labyrinth) holds consistently. The tone does not modulate with pressure—no shift from doubt to awe or mundane to numinous that charges a turn. Setup implicit (opening work routine), development steady (miracles unfold), payoff clear (final testament). Coherent but static mood without cadence shift that reweights stakes yields mid-5s.</comment>
