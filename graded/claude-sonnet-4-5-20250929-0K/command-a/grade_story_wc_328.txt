<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is declared ("to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") but never tested by competing impulses in scene. The final laugh feels performed rather than earned through visible contradiction—she simply decides to let go without dramatized cost. Interior states rely on abstract labels ("hollow," "obsession") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The protagonist observes more than she chooses until the ending gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Lena releasing control) but the closure arrives via summary ("she felt a shift within herself") rather than on-page action that forecloses a path. The garden's metamorphosis and cryptid encounter reverse themselves without consequence, leaving no visible cost or narrowed options. Orientation anchors—who Lena is undercover from, what experiment failed, how the arrowhead "shifts dimensions"—remain vague past the opening third. The drive lens wavers between causal (arrowhead quest) and accumulative (atmosphere) without a taught pattern, and the ending does not commit to either.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The underground garden supplies vivid sensory details (moss-covered stone, glowing mushrooms, ozone scent) and the arrowhead's "gravitational pull" guides Lena into the alcove, constraining movement at a key beat. However, the garden's metamorphosis and return to "original state" occur without spatial consequence, and the pool reflecting the cryptid rather than Lena reads as convenient symbolism. The setting shapes one turn but does not charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving cryptid origins via the arrowhead—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus after discovery in paragraph two. The phone call ("Metamorphose. Now.") and garden upheaval complicate without tightening options; Lena's laughter resolves the conflict through internal release rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The cryptid's directive ("the lock is within you") delivers the answer rather than forcing a trade-off. One tightening (finding the arrowhead) but no visible cost that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of "bitterness into cosmic joke" is stated twice and summarized at closure rather than emerging through particulars. The arrowhead and garden metamorphosis serve as symbolic counters without constraining Lena's moral calculus. The phrase "harmony untamed" recurs but remains abstract—no on-page choice tests whether to control or release that harmony. The final image (carrying "frostbitten hope") asserts thematic resolution without a concrete action that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping, and diction carries a consistent atmospheric register ("labyrinth of shadow and scent"). However, perceptual signature is generic—Lena's interiority could belong to any researcher. The cryptid's dialogue ("the lock is within you") shifts into riddle-speak without voice distinction. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized") stack in the final paragraph, dulling immediacy at closure. No purposeful psychic distance shifts under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "She clutched it tightly" / "Lena clutched the arrowhead"; "The arrowhead pulsed" / "its energy syncing." Template cadence runs through the opening ("its walls lined…its air thick"). Mixed metaphor: "gravitationally playful" applied to dimension-shifting strains physics without a taught rule. Stock phrasing ("her heart pounding," "her mind racing") in peak beats replaces embodied perception. Clarity holds, but density and propulsion are hampered by scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The cryptid-researcher premise and underground-garden setting are functional but familiar. "Gravitationally playful arrowhead" and "cordless phone as cryptid link" attempt freshness, yet neither element is used in a non-obvious way—the arrowhead pulls her to the alcove; the phone delivers exposition. The "bitterness into cosmic joke" motivation is declared rather than dramatized through an unexpected choice. Emotional arc (grief to laughter to acceptance) follows a template without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lena is present throughout and her role (cryptid researcher undercover) frames the quest, but her choices do not create key turns. She reacts to the phone call and garden shift; the arrowhead's pull guides her to the alcove. The final decision to "let go of bitterness" is internal and told rather than tested by a dilemma. Functional but largely observational; swappable with a generic "seeker" role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The flint arrowhead appears in three beats: discovered (paragraph two), pulses and guides Lena to the alcove (paragraph four), and is pocketed at closure (final paragraph). Its "gravitationally playful" nature enables one key move (pulling her into the alcove), and it is mentioned in the ending. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost—Lena follows its pull without resistance. Solid setup, middle use, and closure presence, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Harmony untamed" is mentioned three times as a thematic label ("a harmony untamed between the natural and the unnatural," "their harmony untamed") but never shapes an on-page decision. Lena does not choose between control and release in a way that alters tactics or closure. Present as concept; no causal work or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Gravitationally playful" is attributed to the arrowhead in paragraph one and again in paragraph four when it "pulls her toward a hidden alcove." This use enables one beat (guiding movement) but carries no cost—Lena follows without struggle or trade-off. The attribute is ornamental in the opening and functional once, but swappable with "magnetic" or "tugging." Mid-functional; no deeper integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" appears as the phone command (paragraph three), the garden's transformation (paragraph three–four), and Lena's internal shift (final paragraph). The garden's metamorphosis complicates the scene but reverses without consequence. Lena's personal metamorphosis is summarized rather than enacted through a choice. Present across beats but lacks irreplaceability—"transform" or "change" would serve equally. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The cordless phone is introduced in paragraph one (salvaged from a cabin, link to the cryptid) and used in paragraph three to deliver the "Metamorphose" command. It "buzzed" with residual energy in the final paragraph. Setup and one functional beat, plus closure mention, but its mechanics (why static-laden, how it connects to cryptids) remain vague. The phone could be swapped for any communication device without altering story logic. Present and functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The herbalist's underground garden is established in the opening line and supplies the arrowhead, the metamorphosis event, and the alcove sanctuary. It pressures Lena by shifting and closing walls, guiding her into the alcove. However, the garden's transformation and return to "original state" occur without lasting consequence, and the pool's reflection is symbolic rather than tactical. The setting shapes two beats (discovery, alcove entry) and frames the ending, but does not constrain the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"After the missing return changed" is mentioned in paragraph one as backstory context (the cryptid vanished after a failed experiment) but does not tighten present decisions or create a live deadline. Time is vague throughout; no clock pressures tactics. The timeframe provides setup but no escalation or closure participation. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Lena's motivation "to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is declared in paragraph two and revisited at closure when she laughs and releases grief. However, this desire is not tested by friction—no on-page choice pits bitterness against another value. The resolution (letting go, laughing) is internal and told. Setup and closure mention, but no middle development or visible cost tied to the motivation. Functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" is introduced in paragraph two ("The garden's frostbitten hope matched her own") and returns in the final line ("a frostbitten hope that warmed her from the inside out"). The tone of fragile resilience is coherent across the garden's atmosphere and Lena's arc. However, tone does not modulate purposefully under pressure—fear, wonder, and acceptance are evenly rendered. Lyric reprise reweights the phrase at closure, earning mid-band credit, but no escalation between anchors.</comment>
