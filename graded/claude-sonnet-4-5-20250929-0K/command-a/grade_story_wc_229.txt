<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "prove that whispers travel farther than shouts" is declared but never tested through contradiction or cost. Interior states lean heavily on abstract labeling ("screaming tenderness," "vibrations of intent," "purify his doubts") rather than embodied sensation or micro-choices under pressure. The woman's appearance and cryptic statement feel convenient rather than emerging from Elias's agency. The final resolution—"his doubts" simply evaporating—lacks visible tradeoff or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the vial cork, scent, and lighthouse imagery recur with increasing charge. However, closure arrives through a convenience encounter (the woman appears, delivers the thesis, vanishes) rather than Elias's own accumulation of understanding. The final paragraph declares resolution ("his doubts" gone, the lighthouse "different") without showing cost or a visible before/after in action or stance. Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence demonstrates what Elias has forfeited or how his options narrowed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, and garden scent are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elias's perception. The vial cork's vibrations and the grove of shimmering blossoms constrain his choices (he follows the scent, approaches the woman). Spatial choreography remains coherent (lighthouse interior, shore, grove). The micro-setting (the cork, the lantern room) charges the final image enough to lift the score into the 7-band gate, though occupation-level lighthouse detail is thin and the garden scent's mechanics are more symbolic than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers over shouts—is signaled but never pressured by a live opposing force or internal contradiction. The heat wave breaking and the woman's appearance are situational gifts rather than escalations driven by Elias's agency. One tightening occurs when Elias follows the woman, but this is a compliance move without visible cost or narrowed options. The woman's delivery of the thesis ("Whispers travel farther than shouts") reads as validation rather than a trade-off, and Elias returns to the lighthouse with doubts simply removed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of quiet intention versus loud action is stated repeatedly ("whispers travel farther than shouts," "vibrations of intent," "purified by stillness") rather than emerging from events. The vial cork and garden scent serve as motifs but are not causally constrained—they guide Elias without cost. The woman's line in the grove is a direct thematic articulation (Thematic Echo) that replaces scene pressure; this triggers the −0.6 penalty. The final image attempts resonance but the lesson is delivered rather than earned through Elias's struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in Elias's close third throughout. Diction is mostly character-appropriate, though phrases like "screaming tenderness" and "vibrations of intent" drift toward elevated abstraction. The woman's dialogue ("Whispers travel farther than shouts") is on-the-nose and lacks subtext. Perceptual signature is present (the scent, the hum of the cork) but flattens under peak moments when embodied detail would sharpen pressure. No head-hopping; distance control is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is adequate. However, paraphrase loops appear: "purify his doubts, to find clarity in the chaos" restates the same idea; "the vibrations of intent weren't just in the cork—they were in him" summarizes rather than dramatizing. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("not just of light, but of intention, of tenderness, of the quiet strength") stacks parallel prepositional phrases mechanically. Stock metaphor ("invisible thread," "screaming tenderness") appears without fresh inflection. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise (lighthouse keeper discovers mystical object and receives wisdom from mysterious figure) follows a familiar quest-for-insight template without transformation. The woman's appearance and disappearance are trope-standard rather than specific to Elias's world or stakes. The vial cork's properties (hums, guides through scent) are convenient rather than grounded in lighthouse or occupational logic. The final image's parallelism ("not just of light, but of intention, of tenderness...") reads as rhetorical rather than earned particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes the choice to follow the woman, but his arc is driven by external gifts (the cork, the scent, the woman's arrival and instruction) rather than his own turns. He observes, follows, and receives validation; no key reversal traces to his agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vial cork appears in three beats: discovery (night before), examination (lantern room), and final return (pocket). Its vibrations guide Elias's attention and the scent connection, shaping middle tactics. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost at closure; it remains a passive guide rather than forcing a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Vibrations of intent" is named repeatedly and thematically articulated by the woman, but it does not change on-page options or tactics. The concept is told rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows paths or exacts cost. It functions as theme-layer decoration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Purifies intentions" appears as a label in Elias's reflection ("to purify his doubts") but never constrains an action or forces a visible tradeoff. It remains abstract and summary-only, with no on-page cost tied to the purification process.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Beckoning occurs twice: the woman beckons from shore, and Elias raises his hand in response; the garden scent also "beckons" him. The shore beckoning drives the key turn (Elias descends and follows), shaping the middle and leading to the thematic encounter. Removing the beckon would require structural rewrite, though the woman's agency rather than Elias's limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The scent of a garden at night (jasmine, damp earth, blossoms) is signaled early, recurs in the lantern room, and guides Elias to the grove. Its mechanics (scent as invisible thread) matter to his path. However, the scent is more atmospheric than tactile, and its role in the final grove scene is descriptive rather than constraining a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn is anchored early and recurs in the final paragraph as "a beacon not just of light, but of intention." The lantern room provides the setting for Elias's vial-cork examination, and the lighthouse's beam is noted. The setting shapes one key beat (the descent) and charges the closure image. The dawn timeframe and lighthouse structure alter Elias's movements enough to lift the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The heat wave breaking is mentioned in the opening and closing paragraphs as context for Elias's "stirring of hope" and sense of change, but it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. Time remains vague (no live clock), and the "after" frame is mood rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts" is declared early and articulated by the woman at closure, but it is never dramatized through a conflicting want or on-page cost. The story tells us this is his goal; we do not see him sacrifice a louder path or face friction between the whisper and a competing need.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Screaming tenderness" appears once as a label ("a screaming tenderness that made his chest ache") but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through diction or rhythm. Tone remains steady and elevated throughout without the fierce/tender oscillation the phrase promises. The final paragraph's parallelism attempts resonance but reads as static rather than dynamically tender.</comment>
