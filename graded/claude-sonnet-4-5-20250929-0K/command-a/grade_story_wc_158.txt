<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The poet remains a collection of labels rather than a living consciousness under pressure. Her "shyly unstoppable" nature is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices with visible cost. The galaxy postcard functions as symbolic furniture, not an object that constrains her decisions. Interiority is decorative—"photosynthesizing pain into beauty" and "blossom armistice" are thematic packaging that never ground in specific bodily experience or competing wants that force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure event occurs; the ending asserts completion ("The blossom armistice was complete") rather than dramatizing a decisive change, renunciation, or crystallized stance. The piece summarizes weeks and months in fast-forward without a single causal because/therefore link or escalation beat—time passes, the poet sings, something "shifts" vaguely one night, then she finishes and walks out. The Orientation Test is satisfied (who/where/when by ~120 words), but the piece never coalesces into a legible drive lens or delivers cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The shell is vividly described in the opening with strong architectural specificity ("towering spirals," "whispering chambers," "hidden alcove"), and spatial anchors remain stable. However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it functions as atmospheric backdrop without applying pressure to the protagonist's goal or shaping the closure image with consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to transform pain into verses—is declared but never tested by opposition or a competing cost. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the poet simply continues her work across summarized time until she decides she's done. The "shift" in the antepenultimate paragraph is asserted ("something shifted," "the shell seemed to hum") without causal grounding or a visible price that forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core concept "blossom armistice" and the method "photosynthesize pain into beauty" are repeated as thematic labels without emergent dramatization. The final paragraph's "reef-shadow joy" and "galaxy of possibilities" deliver generic uplift rather than a resonant reconfiguration rooted in prior particulars. Theme is announced rather than earned through specific events that reweight the question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person close, and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register. However, the diction drifts into prompt-adjacent phrasing ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy," "centuries of longing") that reads as ornamental rather than voice-particular. Perceptual signature is weak—the poet's way of noticing does not feel selective or character-specific, and interiority relies on abstract claims rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym chains appear: paragraphs 1 and 4 both assert the poet's motivation using near-identical phrasing; "the shell seemed to listen/hum/exhale" recurs without added meaning. Template cadence runs through the piece ("Her motivation was clear," "Her method was unconventional," "Her shyly unstoppable nature"). Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("the essence of the shell," "the expanse of her imagination") that clashes with scene pressure. Accumulated line-level debt: −1.2 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—poet seeks solitude to create transformative art—follows a well-worn template without fresh synthesis. Prompt elements are present but arranged predictably: the postcard as talisman, the shell as sanctuary, the final walk-out as closure. No risk-taking or non-obvious inflection; the emotional arc could be transplanted to a lighthouse, a cave, or a desert monastery with only noun changes.</comment>
