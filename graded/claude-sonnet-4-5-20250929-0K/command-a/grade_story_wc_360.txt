<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is presented through abstract labels—"cryptic," "habitually borrows personalities"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The "borrowing personalities" trait is told but never dramatizes a conflicting impulse acting in scene. The final "change" is asserted ("he felt changed") rather than earned through causal pressure that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority relies on stock epiphany phrasing ("he understood now") and therapy-speak ("transposed empathy") without character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but never coheres; the piece toggles between causal gestures (touching the fragment) and lyric mood without teaching a pattern. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph, waiving that penalty. Closure reads as a diffuse mood shift ("felt alive," "carried with him the faint glow") without a legible Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; no visible cost forecloses a path on the page. The "chaos within" and "expanding boundaries" remain abstract conceptual claims unsupported by on-page action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The Topaz workshop is anchored early with vivid details (shelves, open ceiling, starlight), but these remain postcard elements that do not constrain a choice or charge the final image. The halo fragment is handled in two beats (observation, touch) yet functions as a passive prop rather than a micro-setting that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory selection (light pulsing, trembling fingers) is purposeful, lifting the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to understand the mathematics of emotion"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page reversal narrows options or changes knowledge under the inferred lens. The "surge of emotions" and "struggle to ground himself" are told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice with visible cost. Agency is passive throughout: Elias receives sensations rather than making a decision that forecloses a path. Pressure does not escalate; the piece loops through mood description without a meaningful tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (empathy, connection, boundaries) emerges from concrete images (halo fragment, borrowed personalities, workshop) but is over-articulated in the final paragraph: "empathy was not about erasing boundaries but about expanding them" is a thesis statement rather than earned resonance. The "mathematics of emotion" remains a metaphor without specificity. The final image—carrying the faint glow—gestures toward resonance but the conceptual cost is not legible on the page. Subtext operates weakly; the piece tells its themes rather than trusting particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with some perceptual signature (stars, lucid turbulence, cryptic habits). Diction suffers from register drift into corporate/academic phrasing ("transposed empathy," "mathematics of emotion") that does not fit the character's lexicon in peak beats. Psychic distance wobbles: "he realized" and "he understood now" are filter-heavy tell moments. Rhythmic control is adequate but repetitive sentence stems ("The workshop," "Elias") create template cadence in the middle third. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose carries clarity and momentum through the first two-thirds, but the final third collapses into paraphrase loops ("felt changed," "resonated deep within his core," "felt alive in a way it never had before") and stock metaphor strings ("tapestry," "labyrinth of mirrors," "chamber within him"). Figurative language appears in most sentences of the climax beat without pattern-teaching or payoff: "chorus of voices," "complex tapestry," "expanding boundaries." Template cadence runs ("He felt," "He realized," "He knew") across three consecutive sentences trigger additional deduction. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −0.8 baseline in Q7, escalated to −1.0 for spread across closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—letterpress operator, halo fragment, empathy experiment—reads as a prompt-fulfillment assembly rather than a specific synthesis. The "borrowing personalities" and "mathematics of emotion" are high-concept labels without lived grounding or non-obvious moral calculus. Emotional beats follow a familiar template: curiosity → overwhelm → epiphany → integration. No risk-taking that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the piece retreats into abstraction at every pressure point. The transformation test fails: plot and arc work unchanged with different names and places.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout but his choices do not create key turns. He observes, touches the fragment, stumbles back, and sits—all reactive moves without a decision that alters tactics. Present in setup, middle, and ending, meeting all three gates, but lacks causal pressure or cost connection. Late first appearance not applicable; swappability moderate (any seeker archetype could replace him with minor edits). Score: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7, minus swappability −0.6 and ornamental use −0.8 = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears early (setup gate), is handled in two beats (observation on workbench, touch with surge), and is present in the ending image ("carried with him the faint glow"). It enables the empathy experience but does not constrain a choice or carry visible cost tied to its properties. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, minus ornamental description −0.5 and summary-only final use −0.4 = 5.8, rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Transposed empathy" is named early but functions as a label rather than a mechanic that shapes stakes or tactics. It is echoed thematically ("feeling emotions not his own") but does not change on-page options or narrow choices. Present but ornamental. Score: setup +0.4, one beat mention +0.4, minus ornamental use −0.9 and label-only trait −0.3, plus late thematic echo +0.3 = 2.9, capped at setup-missing threshold.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Habitually borrows personalities" is mentioned in the opening and referenced once more ("personalities he had borrowed") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The trait remains a told label without visible tradeoff. Score: setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, minus ornamental use −0.8 and label-only mention −0.6 = 2.1, capped by missing development and closure gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears in one beat ("began to disorient himself through deliberate ambiguity") as an action Elias takes before touching the fragment. It does not trace to a major turn; the overwhelm and struggle follow the touch, not the disorientation. Easily swappable with "focus" or "meditate" with minor edits. Score: setup absent (−0.6 late penalty), one beat +0.4, causal pressure weak +0.3, minus swappability −0.7 = 4.3, capped at 4.6 by late introduction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Through deliberate ambiguity" is signaled in the third paragraph ("disorient himself through deliberate ambiguity") but the mechanics are vague and do not shape attempts or choices. It appears as a method label without demonstrating how ambiguity enables or constrains the empathy experiment. Score: setup +0.4, one beat +0.4, minus ornamental use −0.7 and swappability −0.5 = 3.1, capped by missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The Topaz workshop under stars is anchored early with vivid detail (shelves, open ceiling, starlight). It appears in setup, middle beats (description, "sanctuary of lucid turbulence"), and ending ("workshop felt alive"). It does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome; it remains atmospheric. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, minus postcard description −0.9 and ornamental use −0.6 = 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Between vanishing stars" frames the opening and closing (stars fade, dawn arrives) but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. Time is tracked loosely ("as dawn approached," "first rays of sunlight") without live pressure. Score: setup +0.7, closure linkage +0.9, minus vague tracking −0.6 and no causal pressure on choices −0.8 = 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To understand the mathematics of emotion" is stated early and drives Elias into the experiment, appearing in setup and middle beats. It is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; "profound yearning to bridge gaps" remains abstract. No visible friction between wants and costs on the page. Score: setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, minus told-only execution −0.9 and ornamental thematic echo −0.4 = 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Lucid turbulence" is named once ("sanctuary of lucid turbulence") and gestures toward the tone (vivid workshop, disorienting empathy, struggle to ground). The tone does not modulate meaningfully with pressure; it remains a single elevated register throughout. It charges the final image weakly (workshop "felt alive"). Score: setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.6, coherence through turns +0.4, minus static mood execution −0.7 and label-only mention −0.4 = 4.4.</comment>
