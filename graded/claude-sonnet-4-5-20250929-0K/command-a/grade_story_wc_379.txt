<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to uncover stories is stated but her interior life remains generic—"her heart quickened" and "emotion swirling within her" are label-only. The decision to open the mailbox lacks embodied hesitation or contradictory impulses; she simply inserts the key when given one. Mrs. Ellis delivers exposition rather than applying pressure through a relationship crucible. The final realization ("she had found a purpose") is an unearned epiphany, not a choice that forecloses a visible path with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads Causal but the key linkage—locket warmth urging Clara forward—is coincidental rather than motivated. Mrs. Ellis's arrival and exposition resolve the mystery through convenient storytelling rather than Clara's agency. The closure ("Clara knew she had found more than a story; she had found a purpose") is a Conceptual Repricing claim, but no visible or felt cost appears on the page; reading a letter aloud does not foreclose options or impose sacrifice. Orientation Test penalty (−0.3) waived; causality and cost issues lower the score significantly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is vividly rendered with jasmine scent, cobblestones, and amber light. However, it remains postcard description; the setting does not constrain Clara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The locket and mailbox are props moved by plot convenience rather than spatial or environmental pressure. Sensory detail is present but does not modulate with urgency or filter through Clara's professional lens as a curator.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking the mailbox mystery—is signaled early but never tightens through Clara's agency. The locket conveniently contains the key; Mrs. Ellis conveniently appears to explain; the letter conveniently delivers theme. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The "sandstorm calm" moment at closure is asserted rather than earned through escalation. Cost is invisible; Clara gains insight without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme "listening heals" is overtly stated by Mrs. Ellis and then restated by Clara in the final paragraph ("the power of listening, of understanding, of healing"), replacing dramatization with sermon. The locket and letter could carry resonance, but their meaning is explained rather than embodied. No ambiguity or counter-reading survives the tidy moral. The Thematic Echo in the closing lines triggers the standard penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent but generic; Clara's curatorial expertise never colors her perceptions or diction. Mrs. Ellis's dialogue reads expository ("That mailbox has been here longer than anyone can remember. It's said to hold letters...") rather than goal-driven or evasive. The prose carries minimal perceptual signature—"heart quickened," "emotion swirling"—without character-specific texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and grammar is clean. However, paraphrase loops appear: "she had always been motivated by the stories behind objects, but this felt personal" restates the opening's "knack for uncovering stories hidden within forgotten objects." Template cadence in the final paragraph: "she realized then... she had found... she had found..." Stock metaphors—"heart quickened," "voice barely above a whisper," "sandstorm calm"—flatten peak beats. Minimal −0.6 deduction for loops and stock phrasing; the closure beat is not obscured but lacks propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The locked-mailbox-with-hidden-letter premise is a familiar mystery template. The locket-contains-key device is convenient rather than specific. The "listening heals" moral and the mysterious elderly sage are stock elements executed without transformation. No fresh synthesis or risk-taking elevates the familiar frame; swapping names and setting would leave the emotional arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Clara is present across beats but her curatorial discernment does not shape a key turn. She observes, asks questions, and follows prompts from the locket's warmth and Mrs. Ellis's guidance. The decision to open the mailbox is enabled by the convenient key rather than curatorial skill. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The locket appears in the opening, grows warm to prompt Clara's approach, and reveals the hidden key at the climax. It is handled across three beats and returns with reweighted meaning. However, the warmth is coincidental magic rather than causal pressure, and the key's discovery is convenient. It shapes one key turn (unlocking the mailbox) but does not constrain earlier choices or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The locked mailbox mystery is the dominant stake, signaled early and present at closure. Clara's goal to unlock it drives the scene. However, the mystery is solved by Mrs. Ellis's exposition and the convenient locket key rather than Clara's tactics. It frames expectation and appears in the ending, satisfying two gates, but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is claimed in the final paragraph ("Because you listen") but not dramatized. Clara follows the locket's warmth and Mrs. Ellis's guidance passively. No on-page action shows her leading by listening or constrains a choice through this trait. Label-only mention without visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Clara hears the mailbox creak, hears Mrs. Ellis's voice, and reads the letter aloud. Hearing is present but functionally interchangeable with "noticing" or "seeing." The mailbox sound triggers curiosity but does not redefine options. The letter's content is told rather than experienced through hearing. Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mrs. Ellis states "Through neighborhood storytelling" and recounts the locket owner's history. The method is named and supplies the mystery's backstory, shaping one beat. However, it arrives mid-scene as exposition rather than being signaled early or constraining Clara's attempts. It enables rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The vibrant courtyard at dawn is described in the opening with sensory detail (jasmine, cobblestones, amber light) and remains the single location. However, it does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The mailbox's placement is spatial but not tactical. Postcard description without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes least" appears once in Mrs. Ellis's dialogue but does not tighten decisions or track on-page time. The dawn setting is static; no clock or external intrusion pressures Clara's choices. The phrase is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that listening heals" is stated by Mrs. Ellis and affirmed by Clara in the final paragraph. It is not dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction between wants and costs. Clara's desire to uncover stories is claimed but not tested. Told-only with no on-page tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" appears once at closure as an asserted mood ("the sandstorm calm of the moment settling over her"). It does not modulate through turns or charge the final image with tension. The courtyard's serene dawn tone remains static; no tonal shift reflects escalation or cost. Single static mood, minimal impact.</comment>
