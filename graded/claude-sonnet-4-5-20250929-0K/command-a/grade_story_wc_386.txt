<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated ("to salvage something pure") but not tested by on-page friction or contradictory impulses. Her actions—examining, placing, focusing, whispering—read as unobstructed ritual without internal conflict or meaningful micro-choices under pressure. The character feels more like a conduit for atmospheric set-dressing than a protagonist whose flaws or desires generate complication. Emotions are labeled ("heart quickened," "tremor in her chest") rather than embodied through contradictory physical action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story presents a sequence of visions and dream fragments but lacks causal linkage: the baker's dream and the librarian's dream deliver exposition without altering Elara's options or tactics. The ending offers a glow and a whispered promise, but no decisive change in her situation or stance—no path is foreclosed, no felt cost paid. Orientation is delayed (candle-lit shrine location unclear until second paragraph; who Elara is addressing or what she risks remains vague), triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and capping Q3 at 7.0. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final image does not reweight the dominant stake with visible cost; the globe "clears" and she "steps out," leaving closure as atmospheric assertion rather than earned reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The glacier-ice shrine and melted snow globe supply vivid details, but neither constrains a choice or charges the closure beyond decoration. Spatial choreography is clear (shrine interior, altar, stepping out), and sensory selection (flickering flames, crystalline walls, murky liquid) fits the tone. The body and tool (gloved hand, journal) appear but do not alter tactics. Accumulation caps Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test penalty applied in Q2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to salvage something pure"—is signaled but never tested by opposition or a live trade-off. Elara assembles the family's story without encountering resistance, error, or resource cost; the visions arrive in sequence without escalation or a turn that narrows her options. The globe "clears" at the end without causal pressure or protagonist agency driving the change. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens; the final glow reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges (giving voice to the voiceless, memory versus erasure) but remains asserted rather than tested. The final image—a clearing globe and dawn light—gestures at resonance but delivers a comfort-blanket moral ("even in the coldest places, warmth could be found") instead of a non-literal, earned reconfiguration. Subtext is thin; the visions declare their meaning rather than implying it through action or silence. The piece leans on borrowed poetic phrasing ("tapestry woven from fragments," "borrowed starlight") that substitutes texture for conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent third-limited focalization and an elevated register ("hushed stillness," "boundary between living and dead blurred like the edges of a dream") that suits the atmospheric aims. However, diction occasionally drifts into stock phrases ("her heart quickened," "eyes snapped open," "tremor in her chest") and therapy-speak ("weave truth carefully"). No dialogue appears; perceptual signature is present but generic (candles, ice, visions) rather than character-specific. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or POV leaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Repetitive sentence stems and synonym loops appear throughout: "The shrine was…," "Elara placed…," "Elara held…" across adjacent paragraphs; "the globe seemed to glow" echoes "the shrine seemed to come alive." Stock metaphors (tapestry woven from fragments, window of connection, borrowed starlight) and filter-verb stacks ("she sensed," "she focused," "she whispered") dull immediacy. Information density is low; beats often restate atmosphere without advancing causality. The paraphrase loop and template cadence penalties (−0.6 cumulative) apply here, and the artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The wreck-diver ghost-whisperer premise and dream-analysis method offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc (discovery → assembly → comfort) follows a well-worn template without transformation. The family backstory could be swapped for any tragic shipwreck without altering structure or stakes. No bold risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis; the piece prioritizes atmospheric safety over narrative friction. The ending's warmth-in-coldness image reads as platitude rather than earned insight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role (ghost whisperer) frames the action, but her choices do not create key turns. She observes visions passively; the dreams arrive unbidden, and the globe's clearing at the end occurs without her decision altering tactics. Setup present, middle involvement minimal (no choice-driven complication), closure participation ornamental (whispering names does not foreclose a path). Multiple frictions: late causal involvement (−0.5), summary-only integration (−0.5), ornamental closure cameo (−0.4). Starting anchor 3.0; small lift for setup and thematic echo, net 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The snow globe appears in the opening (setup), is placed on the altar and examined across multiple beats (development), and "clears" in the final paragraph (closure participation). However, its evolving state does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics; it remains a passive symbol. The clearing feels authored rather than earned. Setup +0.4, beat involvement (two touches) +0.5, closure linkage (present but ornamental) +0.3, swappability friction (another object could serve) −0.5. Net ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" appears as a descriptive phrase in paragraph one ("her sanctuary, her window of connection to the unseen world") and again in the final paragraph's reflection, but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. It functions as thematic label rather than operational concept. Late first development (only echoed at end), ornamental use (−0.8), label-only (−0.3). Starting 3.0, net 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is mentioned once in paragraph two ("began to weave truth carefully, a skill honed over years") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. It remains a told trait. Label-only (−0.3), no middle beat involvement (−0.5), no closure linkage (−0.5). Starting 3.0, net ~2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Expose" appears in the narrative intent ("expose the truth hidden within the melted globe") but the act of exposing is accomplished off-stage via dream assembly; no on-page turn traces directly to this action with felt cost. Setup present (stated), but middle and closure beats summarize rather than dramatize exposure with friction. Summary-only (−0.6), swappability (could be "discover" or "reveal") (−0.5). Starting 3.0, small lift for setup +0.2, net 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The method ("analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams") is signaled early and supplies the middle beats (baker's dream, librarian's dream). However, the mechanics remain opaque—how Elara accesses these dreams, why these strangers, what effort or cost the analysis demands—rendering the method functional but unexplained. Setup +0.5, beat involvement (two dreams) +0.7, no visible cost or constraint (−0.6), swappability (could be any clairvoyance method) (−0.4). Net 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The candle-lit glacier-ice shrine is established early and provides vivid atmosphere, but it does not pressure Elara's choices or supply resources that alter the outcome. She places the globe, focuses, and leaves; the shrine remains backdrop. Setup +0.5, spatial clarity +0.3, no middle constraint (−0.4), ornamental closure use (−0.3). Net 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Timeframe element is "None."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To salvage something pure from the wreckage" is stated as Elara's motivation in paragraph four and echoed in the final promise to "keep their story alive." However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicting choices or visible friction; she achieves the goal without trade-off or obstacle. Setup +0.4, told twice +0.3, no middle friction (−0.5), closure participation told rather than tested (−0.4). Net 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears as a descriptive phrase in paragraph two ("a place of borrowed starlight") and recurs implicitly in the final image ("first light of dawn painted the sky"). The tone—hushed, elegiac—remains consistent but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with reweighted cost. Setup +0.4, lyric reprise +0.3, static mood throughout (−0.5), no escalation charge (−0.3). Net 4.9.</comment>
