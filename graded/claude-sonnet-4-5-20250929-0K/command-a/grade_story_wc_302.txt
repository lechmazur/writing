<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains abstract throughout—"veiled dreamer" functions as a label rather than a person with embodied contradictions. Her motivation is declared ("cautious exuberance," "to find her answer") but never tested by competing impulses or visible cost; she moves through the library without friction or choice that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart raced," "burned brighter") and the final smile bypasses the struggle required to earn transformation. The watch chooses her, removing agency from the closure moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. However, causality is weak: the protagonist follows a hum without obstacle, the library "trembles" in acknowledgment without resistance, and the parchment's light at the end is granted rather than earned through prior choice. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the journey begins), but no visible cost or foreclosed option appears on the page—she smiles and steps into mist with resolve, unchanged by sacrifice. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The glowing library, mist, and shifting symbols provide vivid sensory anchors and the watch hums in sync with the space. The setting shapes one key moment (the desk with quill and parchment) but does not constrain later choices—the protagonist moves freely without spatial friction. Micro-setting (the watch, the parchment) charges the final image, lifting the score above ornamental description, though the library itself remains a backdrop rather than an active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("find the one that held her answer") is signaled early but never tightened or tested. The protagonist encounters no live obstacle, makes no choice that narrows options, and pays no visible price; the library grants access, the quill writes, and she departs with the parchment intact. The watch's backward ticking and the library's trembling are atmospheric rather than escalatory. No meaningful pressure point forces a trade-off or alters tactics, and the resolution is bestowed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme (unspoken words given voice, time as non-linear, the library as sanctuary/prison) is declared through symbols and the protagonist's written parchment rather than emerging from concrete choices. The final image (parchment pulsing with light, "journey between two fateful letters") gestures toward resonance but remains abstract—no specific event reweights prior material with undeniable cost. The piece invites reflection through atmosphere, yet the ending offers a stated thesis ("she was ready") instead of a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is competent but leans on generic fantasy register ("ethereal light," "cautious exuberance," "the journey between two fateful letters") that lacks character-specific texture. Perceptual signature is thin—descriptions could belong to any observer. The prose modulates minimally under pressure; the protagonist's voice at the desk ("words flowed from her mind") reads identical to her voice at the entrance, missing the urgency that should narrow or sharpen perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean; no major loops or causality breaks. However, scaffold phrasing recurs ("She knew," "she realized," three instances) and the piece leans on filter verbs ("she gazed," "she knew instinctively," "she paused, listening") that dull immediacy during key beats. Figurative language is competent but stock ("mist parting like a curtain," "heart raced"). Sentence openings show variation, yet information density is low—many lines restate atmosphere without advancing situation or choice, particularly in the second paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise (library of unspoken words, blank watch as guide, symbols that shift) assembles familiar fantasy tropes without transformation through specific choice or non-obvious moral calculus. The "veiled dreamer" and "confidence man's watch" read as archetypal placeholders; the journey follows a predictable arc (seek → find → document → depart with resolve) that could apply to many quest frames. The cyclically reversed time and propagation delays are mentioned but not dramatized in ways that create fresh tension or complicate the protagonist's task.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "veiled dreamer" is named early (setup gate met) and narrates throughout, but makes no key decision that alters tactics or stakes. She follows the hum, writes when prompted, and departs—observation and compliance rather than choice. The character is present in the ending (payoff gate met) but is not causally active there; the library trembles and the mist swirls independently. Development gate missed: no middle choice constrained by this character's traits or wants. Functional but replaceable; the story could assign these actions to any seeker with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The watch is introduced early (setup), hums to guide her path in the middle (development), and goes silent at the end (payoff). It appears in three distinct beats, shaping one key turn (leading her to the desk). However, its properties are largely static—it hums, it ticks backward, it warms—without evolving meaning or visible cost tied to its use. The watch enables rather than constrains; removing it would require a different guide mechanism but would not break the story's emotional or thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "unfolding cipher" is mentioned early (setup) and appears as the library's hum in the middle (development), but its mechanics are decorative—she "followed the hum" without deciphering or cost. The cipher is referenced again in the parchment revelation ("The cipher unfolded further") as a thematic echo, not an action that changes her options. It does not constrain tactics or shape the closure decision. Functional presence without causal pressure; the story would work with "the library's song" or any ambient guide.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Cyclically reversed" is applied twice: the archway symbols "cyclically reversed" and the watch hands ticking backward "cyclically reversed." Both are ornamental descriptions without on-page cost or enablement. The trait does not constrain a choice, alter a tactic, or charge the ending—it labels time's non-linearity thematically. Present in setup and middle, absent from closure participation. Swappable with "spiraling," "looping," or similar metaphors.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Document" is signaled early (the parchment and quill await her), enacted at the desk in a full beat (she writes in shifting symbols), and the resulting document pulses with light in the final paragraph, charging the closure image. The act of writing reveals the library's nature and her role as conduit, reweighting her journey. However, no visible cost attends the act—she writes easily, without sacrifice or trade-off—and the story would function with "translate" or "speak the words aloud" with similar beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Propagation delays" appears once in the fourth paragraph as thematic exposition: "unspoken words were alive, growing through propagation delays." The method is not signaled early, does not shape any on-page attempt or tactic, and is absent from the closure. Summary-only mention without dramatization. Late introduction (second half), no development or payoff gates met. Ornamental; the story's causality does not depend on this mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "glowing library in mist" is established in the opening line (setup), provides the central location throughout (development), and its glow dims as she departs in the final image (payoff). The library supplies the desk, quill, and parchment that enable the key action and its trembling acknowledges her presence. However, it does not constrain her movement or force a trade-off—she enters freely, wanders at will, and leaves when ready. The setting shapes atmosphere and provides resources but does not pressure her choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Between two fateful letters" appears only in the final sentence as a metaphor; no temporal frame or urgency is established earlier. The story unfolds in an untracked present with no clock or deadline shaping decisions. Setup, development, and payoff gates all missed. Ornamental phrase without integration; removing it would change one line of tone but no logic or tactic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To find the library of unspoken words" is stated in the second sentence (setup) and drives her path through the middle (development). The parchment revelation that "her role was to be a conduit" reweights this motivation at the end (payoff). However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—no visible cost or friction tests her commitment. Functional across all three gates but lacks the trade-off or sacrifice needed for higher integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named explicitly in the first and final paragraphs and modulates once ("now tinged with resolve"). The tone is told rather than embodied—emotional labels replace contradictory impulses in action. Setup and payoff gates met, but development is static; the tone does not shift meaningfully under pressure in the middle beats. Present in the closure image but does not charge it with felt cost. Functional reprise without causal depth.</comment>
