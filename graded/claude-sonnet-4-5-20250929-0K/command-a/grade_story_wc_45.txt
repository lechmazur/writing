<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's "forgiving skeptic" stance is asserted but never tested on the page—she questions legends yet immediately commits without internal friction. The motivation "to turn mistakes into constellations" appears as poetic tell rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The guilt over her friend's substitute body is introduced late and remains abstract; no on-page micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values or forecloses a path with visible cost. The symbolic stone drop feels like therapy-speak ritual rather than a genuine renunciation earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: garden discovery → fountain encounter → symbolic exchange. The closure unit (stone drop, transformation, reweighted tooth) lands as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is implied rather than legible—what exactly did Elara give up by releasing her "belief in order and control"? The backstory about the substitute body and friend's theft arrives after the 50% mark and does not constrain present choices. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the maze "tests resolve" in summary, and the fountain figure grants wisdom without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid (damp earth, blooming jasmine, glowing flowers) and the hedge maze, fountain, and garden are spatially coherent. However, the environment remains postcard-pretty rather than pressuring choices—Elara navigates the maze without visible constraint or cost. The tooth hums and the waters erupt, but these remain ornamental effects that do not alter tactics. The garden feels like a set piece for the symbolic exchange rather than a crucible that shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—healing the changeling, the village, and herself—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the fountain woman simply asks for "a piece of your certainty," and Elara complies without dramatized friction or trade-off. The substitute body guilt arrives late and does not create escalation. The resolution (stone drop → transformation) feels granted rather than earned by protagonist agency, and the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme "mistakes into constellations" and "embrace the unknown" is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from specific events. The tooth's transformation into a glowing star and the phrase "nostalgic innovation" read as thematic echo and prompt-language rather than earned resonance. The fountain woman's wisdom ("To mend the past, you must embrace the unknown") is direct moralizing. The final paragraph—"even the smallest mistakes could become constellations"—recaps the thesis instead of offering a non-literal answer through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative distance is consistent. Diction is often poetic ("cleft in certainty," "spun silver," "fragment of moon") but leans toward elevated register that occasionally feels like authorial voice rather than character-specific perception. The fountain woman's dialogue is formal and expository. Elara's interior texture is present but smooths under pressure—no perceptual degradation or embodied contradiction in the peak moment of the stone drop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean with no major grammar or syntax errors. Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is frequent but controlled (enamel "catching the light like a fragment of moon," hair "shimmered like spun silver"). However, several lines lean toward purple ("bones were being reset," "spirit renewed") and the phrase "nostalgic innovation" in the final line reads as concept-first rather than image-first. Minor paraphrase loop: "healing herself" appears twice in close succession in the penultimate paragraph. Information density is moderate; the maze passage and fountain encounter could compress further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—secret garden, changeling's tooth, symbolic exchange for healing—is familiar fairy-tale territory without a fresh angle. The maze and fountain sequence follows expected beats: obstacle → revelation → symbolic sacrifice → transformation. Phrases like "cleft in certainty," "turn mistakes into constellations," and "nostalgic innovation" feel like prompt-derived abstractions rather than lived particulars. The substitute body detail arrives late and does not transform the arc. The emotional truth (guilt, yearning, redemption) is generic rather than specific to this voice and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is labeled "forgiving skeptic" in paragraph one but the trait does not constrain or enable any on-page choice. She questions legends yet immediately commits without visible friction. Present in setup and ending but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The changeling's baby tooth appears in paragraph one (setup), guides Elara to the fountain (middle), is placed in the water as the key action (closure participation), and transforms into a glowing star (payoff with reweighted meaning). It drives two distinct beats and shapes the ending. However, its properties (translucent enamel, humming) remain symbolic rather than mechanically constraining—any magical object could serve the same function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" appears twice as theme language (paragraph one and closure) but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. Elara's journey involves symbolic exchange, not a dramatized confrontation with uncertainty that alters options. The concept is told rather than pressuring choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is asserted in paragraph two ("allowed her to navigate puzzles others couldn't") but the maze passage is summarized without showing how the trait enables tactics. No on-page action demonstrates the attribute's cost or constraint. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Yearning is present throughout: Elara is "drawn by a yearning she couldn't ignore" (setup) and the ending notes "ready to embrace the unknown and all its possibilities." However, the yearning is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices. The major turn (stone drop) traces more to the fountain woman's request than to Elara's internal drive. One-beat causal role; swappable with "seek" or "desire."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Bone setting appears once as metaphor ("as if her very bones were being reset") during the fountain's transformation but does not function as a method or process that shapes attempts. The garden "mends not just bodies, but truths" is abstract claim. No mechanics or repeated use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret garden behind the hedge maze is signaled early (setup), the maze "tests resolve" (middle), and the garden's fountain is the site of the climactic exchange (closure). The setting drives two beats and participates in closure. However, the maze passage is summarized rather than dramatized with spatial constraint, and the garden supplies symbolic transformation rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the substitute body is found" is mentioned once in paragraph five as backstory but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The substitute body guilt is abstract and does not alter present tactics. Ornamental mention without time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To turn mistakes into constellations" is stated in paragraph two and echoed in the final paragraph. The motivation frames Elara's journey but remains abstract—no on-page friction between this desire and a competing want or cost. The stone drop is the only choice tied to it, and the connection is thematic rather than causal. One-beat involvement; lyric reprise without dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Nostalgic innovation" appears in the final line and the tone blends wistful reflection (childhood stone, "moments she had taken for granted") with forward momentum ("ready to embrace the unknown"). The tone is coherent but static—no modulation with pressure or cadence shift that charges the final image. Present across beats and ending but does not deepen under stress.</comment>
