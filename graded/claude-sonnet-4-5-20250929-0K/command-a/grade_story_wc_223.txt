<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to become the historian of small gestures") is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Her interiority relies on stock constructions: "luminous absence," "kinship," "strange sense of liberation" function as labels without embodied particulars. The walk with Kael resolves her crisis-actor past through a single symbolic gesture with no visible cost or foreclosed path. Kael's "benevolently ruthless" trait is declared but never demonstrated in action or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when early enough (whispering gallery, interregnum, Elara). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure should tighten via density or pattern break. However, the ending asserts transformation ("unbound her and set her on a new path") without a concrete on-page cost or a decisive image that reweights prior material. The walk spells words but no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered—"unbinding" remains metaphorical and the closure unit lacks felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery anchor is present and tonally coherent (echoes, silence, worn chessboard). The floor's "intricate patterns" appear only when Kael introduces them—late and convenient—but they do constrain the walk action. Spatial choreography is clear (center, section of gallery). However, the chessboard and floor patterns do not materially alter Elara's choice at closure; they charge the final image but remain more symbolic than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elara's desire to "unbind" from past roles. Pressure remains static: the walk with Kael functions as a single illustration rather than a tightening turn. No reversal or escalation narrows options; the resolution ("you just needed to see them in yourself") is delivered as epiphany without prior friction or a visible price. The chessboard-without-pawns metaphor reappears but does not force a tradeoff or crystallize a choice with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (interregnum as a time of missing pieces and possibility) emerges from the chessboard image and the walk spelling *hope*, *forgiveness*, *belonging*. However, the words are stated on the page—"emerged: *hope*, *resilience*, *truth*"—rather than evoked through action. The final paragraph moralizes: "echoes of the past, but promises of the future." The chessboard returns with a neat symbolic interpretation ("symbol of the interregnum itself") that explains rather than charges.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara. Voice texture is elevated but generic: "weight of forgotten conversations," "nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence" read as thesaurus selections rather than character-specific diction. Kael's dialogue ("A game without pawns…") feels expository. The prose maintains distance control and no head-hopping occurs. Register remains consistent if somewhat overwritten.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple instances of elevated diction without grounding: "nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence," "benevolently ruthless." Paraphrase loop in the opening: "echoes lingered…carrying the weight" restated as "listen—to the whispers, to the walls." Template cadence in paragraph three: "She felt…for she too had lived…moving from role to role." Filter-verb stack in final paragraphs ("felt," "knew," "realized") dulls immediacy at closure. Apply −0.8 for density and template issues touching the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise (crisis actor seeking authenticity in an interregnum gallery) is conceptually interesting but execution leans on prompt-label phrasing: "benevolently ruthless," "nomadic penumbra," "historian of small gestures" function as decorative rather than lived particulars. The walk-spelling-words device arrives late without prior signal. The chessboard-without-pawns is a familiar symbol of incompleteness. Transformation test: the arc (troubled seeker finds insight via symbolic conversation) could port to other settings with minimal revision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Crisis actor identity is mentioned in opening and informs Elara's motivation but does not generate a specific on-page choice or tradeoff. She reflects on blurred lines between truth/fiction but makes no decision that tests or costs her that background. Present in setup and thematically referenced but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Chessboard appears in two beats: center scene where Elara traces grooves, and end where it is reinterpreted as symbol of interregnum. It prompts brief dialogue with Kael but does not constrain or enable a tactical choice. The reprise reweights meaning thematically but does not charge a decision. Two-gate participation (setup, closure mention) with thematic linkage earns mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Nomadic penumbra" is declared as Elara's kinship with the chessboard ("state of being both present and absent") but never constrains an action or alters a tactic on the page. It functions as a label for theme, not a stake-shaping force. Ornamental use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is applied to Kael in exposition ("a trait that had served him well") but no on-page action demonstrates the tradeoff between benevolence and ruthlessness. He walks Elara through the gallery and offers insight—neither benevolent nor ruthless in the moment. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unbind" is stated as Elara's goal early ("to unbind myself from the roles") and returned at closure ("the act of walking was unbinding her"). The walk functionally enacts it via spelling words. However, no specific prior constraint is shown being removed on the page—no foreclosed option, no visible cost. Present across beats and tied to closure image but remains metaphorical. Three-gate participation with thematic charge but no tactical specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Pattern of walking that spells words is introduced by Kael in the middle section and executed once (spelling *hope*, *forgiveness*, *belonging*). It appears in one beat and shapes that beat's symbolic action. However, it does not complicate an earlier choice or return with altered meaning. Single-beat functional use without prior signal or closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Whispering gallery is present throughout: opening anchor, center chessboard location, section with etched floor, and final departure. It provides atmosphere and the floor patterns enable the word-spelling walk. However, the setting does not pressure a choice—Elara could reflect and walk elsewhere without structural change. Present in setup, middle, and closure but remains more backdrop than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Interregnum is mentioned in opening exposition ("when the old regime had fallen but the new had yet to take hold") and tied thematically to the chessboard symbol at the end. It does not tighten a decision or create a deadline on the page. Time remains vague; no clock pressures Elara's actions. Setup and thematic closure mention without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To become the historian of small gestures" is stated as Elara's motivation in paragraph one and echoed by Kael at the end ("You've always been a historian…"). It frames her presence in the gallery but does not generate on-page friction or a choice between competing costs. Told desire without dramatized conflict. Setup and closure mention but minimal middle involvement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" appears once in Elara's reflection ("she felt a luminous absence within her—not a void, but a space filled with potential") near the end. It captures a tonal quality (contemplative, paradoxical) but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through recurrence. Single mention, thematically apt, but static—no evolution or reprise.</comment>
