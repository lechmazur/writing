<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared through exposition rather than tested under pressure—her "uncommonly thoughtful nature" exists as label and mentorship memory, not lived contradiction. The climactic exchange shows no visible internal conflict between competing impulses; her choice to offer the drawer pull arrives smooth and pre-decided. Kael's arc—from wounded pride to tentative agreement—lacks embodied hesitation or micro-choices that reveal competing desires. The final handoff feels like symbolic ceremony rather than a decision that forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (parapet, negotiator role, prisoner exchange). The piece commits to a situational lens—two figures under storm pressure crystallizing a stance—but the core beat (Elara's pitch, Kael's nod) lacks a meaningful narrowing of options or visible cost. The closure reads as thematic agreement rather than a Decisive Change or Charged Poise with undeniable pressure; the drawer pull passes hands, but no prior path is foreclosed on the page. The Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elara or Kael sacrifices in this moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The parapet and mist are established early and modulate with storm intensity. Sensory detail (cold air, lantern flicker, wind howl) supports atmosphere but remains ornamental—the environment does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The drawer pull is handled twice (pocket touch, final exchange) yet its physical properties (tarnished brass, etchings) do not shape a decision. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting charges mood but does not meet the 9-band gate of constraining choice or charging the final image causally.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—breaking the cycle of apology/forgiveness between kingdoms—is signaled early. Pressure remains static: Elara delivers her pitch uninterrupted, Kael voices one objection, then acquiesces. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; the negotiation unfolds as persuasion without friction. Agency manifests as Kael's nod, but no prior tactic is abandoned and no cost legibly paid. The piece offers situational crystallization without the tightening or visible price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme (recycling mistakes, neutral territory as understanding-space) is articulated directly by Elara in mid-scene and echoed in the final paragraph summary ("untethered two kingdoms from their past, one thoughtful step at a time"). The ending offers a stated moral rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The drawer pull's story is told rather than dramatized with cost, and the moon metaphor (waning = letting go) remains decorative. Thematic Echo penalty: Elara's pitch and the final paragraph both voice the thesis in prompt-like language, triggering −0.6.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focus on Elara holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Her perceptual signature (moon-phase synchronicity, mentor's wisdom, empathy-first stance) is consistent but borders on self-aware labeling ("uncommonly thoughtful nature"). Dialogue carries subtext in Kael's "neutrality is a luxury" and Elara's counter, yet both speakers use equally polished syntax under pressure—no tonal distinction or stress-driven compression. Filter verbs ("knew," "felt," "hoped") cluster in the opening without voice necessity. Psychic distance remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean with varied sentence structure. Multiple beats open with character-name stems ("Elara stood," "Elara knew," "Elara smiled," "Elara's lips"), creating template cadence across the piece (−0.5). Stock metaphors appear: "mist... like forgotten secrets," "chains of mistrust," "chasm between." Figurative density in the opening (furrowed hush, storm-worn, windblown, shrouded, clung) front-loads lyricism without payoff at closure. Paraphrase loop: "untether" recurs in dialogue and closing summary without added pressure. Line-level artifacts touch the final paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally per Q7 rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—prisoner-exchange negotiator synchronizing talks to moon phases—echoes templated "unconventional mediator" plots without transformation through lived detail or world logic that matters. The moon's waning is told symbolically but does not constrain a choice. The antique drawer pull's backstory (king and rebel treaty) reads as inserted anecdote rather than organic necessity. Emotional arc and setting could swap names/places with minimal rewrite. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece hedges into safe resolution without consequence. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's role is signaled early and present in all three gates (setup, middle pitch, closure handoff). Her decisions, however, do not create key turns—she arrives with a pre-formed plan, delivers it uninterrupted, and Kael's nod follows persuasion rather than Elara's agency narrowing options. The negotiator function shapes the frame but not the escalation. Beat involvement: present in opening, middle dialogue, and final exchange (+0.9). Causal pressure weak: her choice to offer the drawer pull is prepared, not a live fork (+0.2). Closure linkage: participates in the handoff but does not decisively drive the image (+0.4). Swappability: another mediator type could fulfill the role with minor edits (−0.6). Total estimate ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drawer pull appears in three beats: pocket touch (grounding), held up during pitch (symbolic proof), passed at closure (promise). Setup gate met (first third). Development gate: it illustrates her argument but does not constrain a middle choice (−0.3). Payoff gate: present in final handoff, reweighted as "silent promise." Early signal (+0.5), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+0.9), but the object's unique properties (etchings, tarnish) do not matter—any token relic could serve (−0.7). Ornamental in pitch beat: described without action pressure (−0.6). Total estimate ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Neutral territory is named in Elara's dialogue ("neither side claims dominion") and the parapet functions as literal neutral ground. Setup gate met. Development gate: the concept frames her pitch but does not alter tactics on the page. Payoff gate: closure occurs on the parapet, reinforcing the concept. Early signal (+0.5), beat involvement in dialogue and setting (+0.4), causal pressure weak—it shapes rhetoric, not a live choice fork (+0.3). Closure linkage: setting supports but does not decisively charge the final image (+0.5). Swappability: "common ground" or "no-man's-land" could replace with minor edits (−0.6). Total estimate ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Uncommonly thoughtful" is labeled in exposition and illustrated by Elara turning the drawer pull for grounding. Setup gate met (first third). Development gate: her empathy approach is told in the opening but does not constrain a middle action with visible cost—she executes her plan without friction. Payoff gate: final paragraph restates "uncommonly thoughtful nature." Label-only penalty (−0.3 twice, total −0.6). Beat involvement: opening reflection and final summary, no middle dramatization (+0.4). Causal pressure absent: no on-page tradeoff where thoughtfulness costs her another option (0.0). Swappability cap at 3.8 applies.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Untether" is signaled in Elara's opening reflection, voiced in her pitch ("untether ourselves from the cycle"), and returns in the closing summary ("untethered two kingdoms"). Setup gate met. Development gate: the word anchors her argument but the action itself (breaking chains of mistrust) is not dramatized with a visible mechanism or cost. Payoff gate: closure summary uses the term. Early signal (+0.6), beat involvement in dialogue and summary (+0.9), causal pressure weak—the concept frames the negotiation but does not drive a turn (+0.3). Closure linkage: present in final paragraph but as summary, not image (+0.5). Swappability: "release," "free," "disentangle" could substitute (−0.7). Summary-only in closure (−0.6). Total estimate ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Moon-phase synchronization is introduced in the opening ("synchronizing negotiations through moon phases") and mentioned once more ("her words synchronizing with the rhythm of the storm, as if the moon itself were guiding her"). Setup gate met. Development gate: the moon is hidden during the scene and its mechanics do not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Payoff gate: moon appears in the closing image ("The moon, hidden but ever-present, watched over them") but does not causally shape the outcome. Late closure cameo without causal work: no piggyback credit (−1.0). Ornamental mention penalty (−0.3). Beat involvement: opening setup and closing image (+0.4). Total estimate ~2.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The parapet is named in the opening and anchors all action; mist and storm are persistent. Setup gate met. Development gate: the environment supplies atmosphere but does not constrain a tactical choice—no move is enabled or blocked by wind, mist, or stone. Payoff gate: closure occurs on the parapet, and storm "raged on" in the final image. Early signal (+0.7), beat involvement across opening, middle, and close (+1.4), causal pressure weak—setting does not alter tactics (+0.2). Closure linkage: present but ornamental, not causally active (+0.4). Postcard description penalty (−0.8). Total estimate ~5.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "between apology and forgiveness" is declared in the opening line and voiced in Elara's pitch. Setup gate met. Development gate: the phrase frames stakes rhetorically but does not function as a live clock narrowing decisions. Payoff gate: closure lands in that conceptual space but no ticking timer alters moves. Early signal (+0.5), beat involvement in opening and dialogue (+0.4), causal pressure minimal—time as metaphor, not constraint (+0.1). Vague-time penalty: no tracked deadline or urgency mechanism (−0.6). Swappability: "during negotiation" or "in the space of truce" could replace (−0.5). Total estimate ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation is voiced by the mentor's maxim ("Wisdom is not found in perfection but in recycling mistakes") and repeated in Elara's pitch ("Let us recycle our mistakes into wisdom"). Setup gate met. Development gate: the desire shapes her argument but is not dramatized with friction—no competing want tests her commitment. Payoff gate: closing summary restates the recycling frame. Early signal (+0.6), beat involvement in memory, dialogue, and summary (+0.9), causal pressure weak—told in dialogue, not enacted with cost (+0.2). Told-only penalty (−0.8). Summary-only in closure (−0.6). Total estimate ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" appears in the opening line and closing paragraph. Setup gate met. Tone modulates with storm intensity (wind's howl, thickening mist) and eases slightly at Kael's nod. Development gate: tone supports pressure without rigidity. Payoff gate: "furrowed hush" returns to frame the ending. Early signal (+0.6), coherent modulation across beats (+0.8), closure linkage: the phrase reappears but does not decisively charge the final image—more recap than transformation (+0.4). Lyric reprise allowance: early seed → final return reweights mood without mid-scene use, eligible up to ~6.3. Specificity: the phrase is distinct but not irreplaceable (−0.4). Total estimate ~5.7.</comment>
