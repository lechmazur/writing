<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains largely static, her "sympathetic skeptic" label announced but never tested through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The transformation from skeptic to believer unfolds through passive reception of visions rather than difficult micro-choices with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract longing ("a void, a longing for something she couldn't quite name") and therapy-speak epiphany ("courageously kind hands") rather than embodied contradiction. The tile does the work; Elara observes and transcribes without agency that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (dreaming, climbing, visions accrue toward a realization), but the closure is told rather than shown: "she knew its magic would remain within her" summarizes the change without an on-page image that reweights prior material with cost. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (village, shore, cottage anchored by ~80 words). Causality is weak—tile glows, Elara transcribes, tower amplifies, visions appear—without protagonist decisions narrowing options. The final paragraph states theme and resolution rather than landing a decisive image, violating the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Anchors are clear and varied (cottage, shore, tower), and the spiral staircase overgrown with ivy provides texture. The whale migration and star canvas offer atmospheric backdrop, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image—they remain postcard detail. The tile warms in her pocket and the pedestal at tower-top serve minor functional roles, meeting the micro-setting allowance, but the setting does not pressure Elara's tactics or alter the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara's longing for connection—is signaled early but never tightened through a choice that forecloses a live option. She climbs the tower because she "felt drawn," the tile reveals visions, and her skepticism "began to fade" without on-page resistance or trade-off. No meaningful escalation occurs; the tile solves the problem it introduced. Coincidence (tile discovery, tower's amplification, whale synchrony) drives all turns, and no visible price is paid that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Theme of connection and bridging skepticism/wonder is stated directly in the final paragraph ("bridging the gap between skepticism and wonder") rather than emerging from scene particulars. The magic square, forgotten patterns, and entangled memories are named but not dramatized as constraint or pressure—symbolic convenience without earned cost. The ending offers a tidy moral rather than a resonant, non-literal image, and the "unheard symphony" becomes an explicit metaphor rather than subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and diction stays consistent (slightly elevated, mythic-tinged). However, perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices in catalog fashion (journals, star charts, ivy, constellations) without character-specific bias. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("felt an inexplicable pull," "felt drawn," "felt herself being pulled"), dulling immediacy. Sentence stems repeat ("She was known," "She realized," "She saw"), and the prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "felt a void, a longing" restated across paragraphs, "felt drawn"/"felt an urge"/"felt an inexplicable pull" cycle without added detail. Template cadence runs through exposition blocks ("It was a small…," "It was as if…," "It was not just…"). Stock metaphors ("canvas of stars," "shower of starlight") and therapy-speak ("courageously kind hands") appear in peak beats without embodiment. The final third stacks these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise—magic object unlocks visions and transforms skeptic—is widely templated (chosen-one discovery arc). The magic square, tower, and whale migration are present as atmosphere but do not transform the familiar structure through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The tile's mechanics (glowing, floating patterns, unlocking memories) rely on convenient amplification rather than grounded constraint. Transformation test fails: swap tile for amulet, tower for temple, whales for auroras, and the emotional arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Elara is labeled "sympathetic skeptic" early (setup gate met) and her skepticism is mentioned when she finds the tile and later "began to fade" (development weak, payoff summary-only). Her choices do not create key turns—she observes, transcribes passively, and receives visions. The element is functional but replaceable; "curious scholar" or "reflective wanderer" would work identically. Swappability and ornamental use deduct; late resolution summary prevents closure credit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The magic square tile appears early (setup), is transcribed mid-story (development beat), and placed on the pedestal at closure (payoff gate met). However, it does not constrain Elara's choices—it glows, guides her hand, and reveals visions without cost. Specificity is minimal; the magic square's mathematical properties are mentioned but never matter to tactics. It resolves the problem it introduced (convenient amplification) and could be swapped for any mystical object. Two-beat involvement and closure presence prevent lower score; lack of causal pressure and swappability cap upward movement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Entangled memories are named late ("unlocking entangled memories" appears past midpoint), violating setup. The concept is explained via summary ("not just her own, but those of the tower, the village, and even the whales") rather than dramatized through conflicting pressures or choices. It functions as thematic label without altering Elara's options or tactics. Late first appearance, summary-only use, and ornamental integration all deduct; missing setup gate caps at 4.6, further lowered by lack of causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Courageously kind" appears only in one late sentence ("It required courageously kind hands") as a label without prior setup or dramatized action. No on-page choice demonstrates this trait constraining or enabling behavior with cost—it is asserted as the tile's unlock condition, not shown through Elara's micro-decisions. Missing setup and development gates, label-only use, and no cost connection all deduct heavily; late arrival caps at 4.6, further reduced to low band by ornamental treatment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Transcribing appears in three beats: cottage dream-state, and twice implied ("transcribed the final sequence" at closure). Setup is met; development shows the action ("As she did, the numbers seemed to shift"), and payoff is present. However, the act itself does not create major turns—the tile's magic drives the revelations regardless of transcription. The action is functional but could be replaced with "touched," "spoke to," or "focused on" with minor edits. Swappability and lack of decisive causal role prevent higher score despite multi-beat presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Forgotten patterns" is named early in the dream ("forgotten patterns—ancient symbols") meeting setup, recurs in the vision of ancestors mid-story (development), and appears in final reflection ("the beauty in forgotten patterns"). The method shapes Elara's understanding thematically but does not constrain her attempts or alter tactics—she sees patterns, they reveal themselves, and she accepts. Mechanics are not tested; the phrase functions as thematic echo rather than a method with costs or choices. Lyric reprise across three beats and thematic presence prevent lower score; lack of causal pressure and summary-only treatment cap upward movement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The stargazer's open tower is introduced early (setup), drives Elara's decision to climb mid-story (development beat: "felt drawn to it"), and hosts the closure scene (payoff). The tower's "crumbling structure" and pedestal provide spatial grounding, and its celestial-amplification property enables the tile's full effect, meeting causal pressure. However, the tower does not constrain choice—Elara ascends without obstacle, and the pedestal's function is convenient rather than earned. Three-gate presence, causal enabling, and closure linkage support mid-6s; lack of cost or constraint and convenient mechanics prevent higher band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Whale migration is mentioned in the inciting paragraph, observed from the tower ("migrating whales could be seen breaching"), and referenced in the epilogue ("every year, during the whale migration"). Setup is met, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—Elara's actions unfold at her chosen pace with no deadline. The migration synchronizes with constellations thematically but functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a clock that shapes attempts. Lyric reprise and thematic presence prevent lower score; lack of pressure and ornamental treatment deduct heavily.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To sculpt space for reflection" is implied in Elara's longing and stated late ("to sculpt space for reflection and connection"). The desire for connection is setup early ("a void, a longing"), but "sculpt space for reflection" as a discrete motive appears only in summary near closure, missing clear development. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants and costs—Elara's path is frictionless reception. Late explicit naming, summary-only treatment, and lack of on-page friction deduct; implied early presence and thematic closure mention prevent lower band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" appears mid-story ("a faint melody—an unheard symphony"), grows louder at the tower, and returns in the epilogue ("the unheard symphony that now lived in her heart"). Setup is met, development shows intensification, and payoff is present via lyric reprise. Tone is coherent—mythic, contemplative—and modulates slightly (faint to loud to internalized). However, tone remains static through turns without charging the final image with pressure; the symphony is metaphor-label rather than embodied sensory constraint. Three-beat presence and coherent modulation support mid-4s; lack of pressure-driven charge and metaphor convenience prevent higher score.</comment>
