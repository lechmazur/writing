<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to discover hidden truths is clearly established, but her interior life reads more as summary than embodied contradiction. The trait "devotedly observant" remains largely label-only; we're told she notices telescope misalignment but don't feel the cost of that observational compulsion pressing against other needs. The final act of recalibrating a telescope feels symbolic rather than a choice forged from competing impulses, and the "orbits of regret" motif is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story follows a causal chain—journalist's call → investigation → discovery → symbolic defiance—but key beats are summarized rather than dramatized. The climactic meeting with the director and the final telescope recalibration both happen off-stage or in fast summary, denying the reader the on-page pressure that should earn the closure. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration through the symbolic act, but the cost remains abstract ("orbits of regret would always be a part of her") rather than a visible forfeiture of safety, connection, or resource that we see her pay.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and specific—glass dome, brass telescopes, dusty charts, misaligned lenses—and the misalignment directly drives Eleanor's investigation. However, the spatial choreography during her wandering and the director's office tea scene remains vague; we don't track her movement through corridors or feel how the building's architecture constrains or enables her snooping. The rosewood pen nib is described but never handled on the page in a way that shapes a tactic or choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing the surveillance scheme—is clear, but escalation is thin. Eleanor uncovers evidence, arranges a meeting, receives evasive answers, then acts alone; no on-page reversal tightens her options or forces a trade-off. The director's evasion is told rather than dramatized, and the final recalibration of the telescope is a gesture without visible cost: we don't see what Eleanor risks or forfeits by defying the director or what immediate consequence follows her symbolic act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of truth-seeking versus personal cost emerges through Eleanor's journey, and the "orbits of regret" motif attempts to resonate across the arc. However, the final paragraph tilts toward explicit theme summary—"The orbits of regret would always be a part of her, but so too would her devotion to truth"—rather than letting the recalibrated telescope image carry the weight. The rosewood pen nib is mentioned three times but never shifts meaning; it remains a static heirloom rather than a motif that reweights at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Eleanor's perceptual filter ("devotedly observant") colors descriptions. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("orbits of regret," "solemn playfulness giving way to grim determination") that feels imposed rather than voice-specific. The director's dialogue is summarized rather than dramatized, denying us the subtext and goal pursuit that would test Eleanor's resolve. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the lack of interior contradiction under pressure flattens the voice during key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and free of major loops, but several beats rely on summary rather than scene: "Over tea in the director's office, she subtly probed for answers" compresses what should be a pressure point. The opening's phrase "orbits of regret" recurs three times without earned variation, and "solemn playfulness" is declared but not enacted in rhythm or diction. Figurative density is moderate and mostly coherent, though "echoing observatory" and "orbits of regret" lean ornamental. Sentence variety is adequate, but the final paragraph's explicit theme statement dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—heiress discovers observatory used for political surveillance—is functional but familiar, and the emotional arc follows a template: discover wrongdoing, investigate, symbolically defy authority, resolve to expose. The rosewood pen nib and "orbits of regret" motif feel like prompt-fulfillment tokens rather than organic story engines. The recalibrated telescope is a predictable symbol. No turn or image surprises; the journalist's disappearance is mentioned but not leveraged for tension or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eleanor (newsprint heiress) is present throughout and her investigation drives the plot, but her status as heiress is used only once—"Using her connections as an heiress, Eleanor arranged a meeting"—as a convenience tool rather than a source of conflict or cost. Her choices (investigate, meet director, recalibrate telescope) advance the plot but feel like plot moves rather than decisions that reveal competing values or exact visible prices. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but remains more observer than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib appears three times (opening, "armed with her rosewood pen nib and journal," and closing), but it is never handled, used to write, or causally involved in a choice. It remains a static family heirloom described in the opening and final paragraphs without shifting meaning or constraining action. The nib does not enable a tactic, complicate a beat, or charge the final image beyond symbolic window-dressing. No middle development or payoff beyond ornamental recurrence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" is introduced early and recurs in the final paragraph, but it functions as abstract theme rather than a concept that shapes Eleanor's on-page choices or narrows her options. The phrase appears three times without altering tactics or dramatizing a cost tied to cyclical guilt or inevitability. It reads as lyrical dressing rather than a mechanism that pressures the protagonist's investigation or final act. Setup and closure presence without middle development or causal leverage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" is declared early and demonstrated once when Eleanor notices the misaligned telescopes. That observation triggers her investigation, giving the trait functional middle involvement. However, the attribute is not shown to constrain a choice or exact a visible cost—no moment where her compulsion to observe isolates her, exhausts her, or forces her to sacrifice safety. The trait enables plot but does not generate friction or a felt trade-off. Setup and middle gate present; closure linkage weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Intervene" is signaled early ("Determined to intervene, Eleanor decided to investigate further") and enacted in the final beat when she recalibrates the telescope. That recalibration is a direct intervention, though summarized rather than dramatically staged. The action is not swappable—removing it would leave the arc incomplete—but its compressed treatment and lack of visible consequence limit its charge. Setup, middle (meeting the director), and closure presence with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"Proof by contradiction" is mentioned once in the narrative summary—"her methodical mind settling on proof by contradiction"—but never enacted as a method. We don't see Eleanor formulate a hypothesis, test it by assuming the opposite, or arrive at a conclusion through that logical framework. The phrase is label-only, not dramatized in her investigation tactics or choices. Present in setup but absent in middle development and payoff; purely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "echoing observatory above clouds" is vividly established in the opening and provides the discovery that drives the plot: misaligned telescopes pointed at earth. The setting supplies the central clue and the symbolic final act (recalibrating a telescope). However, spatial details remain general during the investigation; we don't feel how the building's layout constrains Eleanor's snooping or enables her access. Setup, middle (misalignment discovery), and closure (recalibration) all present, with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the journalist calls" anchors the story's inciting incident and is mentioned early ("The call from the journalist had come late the previous evening"). The narrative then moves through "first light of dawn," "as the day wore on," and "that night," establishing a roughly 24-hour span. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Eleanor's investigation unfolds without a live clock or deadline that pressures her choices. Setup present; middle and closure participation weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To discover hidden truths" is Eleanor's stated motivation, introduced early and sustained through her investigation, director meeting, and final act. The motivation drives multiple beats and is conflicted once—"Her motivation to discover hidden truths now felt like a burden"—but that friction is told rather than dramatized through a choice where she weighs retreat against persistence with visible cost. Setup, middle (drives investigation), and closure (she decides to share findings) all present, with moderate causal weight but limited embodied friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Solemn playfulness" is declared once—"her solemn playfulness giving way to a grim determination"—but not enacted in diction, rhythm, or dialogue. The prose maintains a consistent earnest register throughout without the tonal modulation or ironic lightness the phrase suggests. The meeting with the director is described as "a delicate balance of solemnity and playful charm," but we don't see that balance in quoted speech or narrative voice. Label-only; no middle dramatization or closure charge.</comment>
