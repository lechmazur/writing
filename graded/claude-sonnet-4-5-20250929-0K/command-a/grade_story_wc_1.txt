<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("discover purpose in the pauses") is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her "steadily adaptive" trait functions as a label without visible cost—she simply decides to retrace the smuggler's route without internal friction. The apprentice's captivity is discovered off-page and doesn't force a meaningful choice or renunciation with felt consequence in the text. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("renewed determination," "mind racing with plans") rather than character-particular thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) appear early enough. The closure unit—Elara discovering the ledger's full truth and her apprentice's location—lands on the page, but the cost remains vague ("renewed determination" and future plans rather than a present forfeiture or stance shift). The because/therefore chain is present (ledger → frost patterns → caches → grotto → truth) but the final beat summarizes consequence ("she would use...") instead of dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path now.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The canyon, campfire, frost patterns, and bioluminescent grotto are vivid and sensorially grounded. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the frost guides Elara's investigation but doesn't constrain her choices or impose a tactical cost. The grotto's kiln appears as revelation rather than obstacle. Spatial choreography is clean and the mood is consistent, but environment doesn't shape the final image or narrow options at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering her apprentice and exposing the rival guild—is signaled early and sustained. The investigation tightens once (ledger → frost → caches → grotto revelation), but the escalation is linear discovery rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The resolution is deferred to future action ("she would use..."), so agency at closure is a plan rather than a present forfeiture or renunciation. Coincidence does not resolve, but the kiln and ledger discoveries feel convenient rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—finding purpose in fragments and pauses—emerges from Elara's art (capturing fleeting light) and her investigation (tracing ephemeral frost patterns). The ledger strip as symbol of resilience is somewhat on-the-nose but rooted in action. The final image of stars reflected in glass creations and "drifting resonance" gestures toward thematic closure, yet the epiphany ("purpose could be found even in the pauses") is stated rather than enacted through a difficult choice. No overt moralizing, but the thematic answer feels anticipated rather than discovered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filter is consistent (glass-artist metaphors: "natural tapestry," "fleeting beauty of moments"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("scorched testament," "drifting resonance") that feels writerly rather than character-rooted. No dialogue to evaluate. Elara's way of noticing is selective and metaphor-driven, but the voice doesn't modulate meaningfully under pressure—the final paragraph's tone matches the opening despite the stakes rising.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm. Several paraphrase loops appear: "patterns...patterns," "purpose...purpose," "drifting resonance...drifting resonance" recur without reweighting. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "her art...her resilience...her sense" stacks parallel stems. Stock phrasing weakens peak beats: "renewed determination," "mind racing with plans," "her breath visible in the crisp air." Information density is moderate; some scaffolding ("Now, with her workshop...") front-loads context that could be woven into action. No outright causality breaks, but figurative language ("seemed to whisper," "seemed to mirror") hedges vividness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glass-artist-as-investigator using frost patterns to decode a smuggler's ledger offers a fresh synthesis. However, the emotional arc—survivor seeking truth and rescue—is familiar, and the plot beats (hidden caches, shadowy antagonist, captive apprentice) follow a recognizable template. The "luminous glass that captures moonlight" and "bioluminescent grotto" feel ornamental rather than integral to the moral calculus or final choice. Risk is present in the premise but not in execution; the resolution defers to future action, avoiding a bold on-page stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the decision to retrace the smuggler's route, but her choices are linear discoveries rather than turns that narrow options. The final beat—planning to "outwit her enemies"—is future intent, not present action. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is planning rather than decision with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ledger strip appears in the opening, guides the middle investigation (frost patterns match its markings), and the full ledger is discovered in the grotto at closure. It touches three beats and enables the plot, but its mechanics (how markings map to frost) remain vague. Reweighted meaning at the end (symbol of resilience) is stated rather than charged through a fresh image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" functions as metaphor for the ledger and the blackened kiln. It appears in the middle (description of the strip) and at the grotto revelation, but it doesn't constrain tactics or impose a cost—Elara reads the ledger without difficulty. Present but ornamental; removing "scorched" wouldn't break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is labeled in the opening and claimed as method ("she decided to retrace...unconventional..."), but no on-page action dramatizes the trait's cost or constraint. Elara adapts successfully without friction or tradeoff. Mentioned as character summary; no visible price paid.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Retrace" structures the entire middle section: Elara follows the ledger's patterns through frost, discovers caches, and reaches the grotto. Setup is clear, development drives multiple beats, and the final revelation hinges on completing the retracing. Causal and irreplaceable; the story would collapse without this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Patterns in morning frost" appear in the investigation beat, guiding Elara from ledger markings to hidden caches. Signaled and used on-page, but the mechanics are gestural ("seemed to mirror") rather than specific. Shapes one key turn (frost → caches) but could be replaced with another clue method (tracks, maps) with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The canyon appears in opening and closing frames, and the grotto is the site of the final revelation. However, setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Elara's investigation isn't pressured by environment (weather, terrain, pursuit). The bioluminescent grotto is vivid description but doesn't alter her tactics or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After surviving the attempt" frames the opening and motivates Elara's quest, but time doesn't tighten decisions—there's no urgency or clock pressuring her investigation. The timeframe is backdrop (night campfire → morning frost → nightfall grotto) rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Present in setup and structure but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To discover purpose in the pauses" is stated in the opening and echoed in the closing reflection ("purpose could be found even in the pauses"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. Elara's investigation doesn't test this desire against competing costs or fears. Thematic claim without on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" appears twice as a phrase (middle: "drifting resonance of the canyon"; closing: "drifting resonance within her"). Tone is lyrical and contemplative throughout, modulating slightly from survivor's stillness to determined planning. The mood charges the final image but doesn't shift meaningfully under pressure. Present and coherent; not indispensable.</comment>
