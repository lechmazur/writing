<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is present and her pursuit is coherent, but her emotional progression relies on stock phrases ("anger…burned deep within her," tears welling) rather than embodied contradiction. The brother's death functions as setup but never creates a genuine on-page choice between competing impulses; her anger transforms into "something quieter, more resolute" through revelation rather than dramatized struggle. The woman's dialogue borders on therapeutic exposition ("It's a mirror. It reflects the moments we try to escape"), and Elara's final acceptance feels granted rather than earned through visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece signals a causal lens early (tracker follows drone to tent, woman reveals ink's nature, vision unfolds) and delivers an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara sees her brother's final moments and shifts from seeking control to acceptance. Orientation is clean. However, the closure depends on a convenient reveal: the woman has the ink and explains its purpose exactly when needed, and Elara's transformation occurs through passive reception of imagery rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The cost—releasing the need to rewrite history—is asserted more than demonstrated through visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment and post-eclipse light anchor setting early, and the tent interior with diagrams and ink scent provides spatial grounding. The drone's metallic wings and the vial's cool glass offer tactile moments. However, the desert itself remains largely ornamental; sand and wind do not constrain Elara's choices, and the encampment's layout or resources never alter tactics. The setting charges atmosphere but does not pressure the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why time bends in crisis and her brother's death—is signaled early and remains coherent. The drone-led search creates forward motion, but the tent discovery and the woman's explanation arrive without resistance; Elara faces no trade-off or tactical narrowing. The vision of her brother is granted rather than fought for, and the final acceptance lacks a visible price that alters later options. One meaningful tightening is present (following the drone to the tent), but escalation remains atmospheric rather than agency-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of understanding versus control emerges through the ink's metaphorical role and the woman's dialogue ("It's a mirror…not a means to rewrite history"). However, the piece leans heavily on direct thematic statements in both the woman's exposition and the final paragraph ("the courage to face the questions," "understanding over control"). The ink's ephemeral patterns offer a recurring image, but the closure moralizes rather than letting particulars speak. Elara's insight is delivered to her rather than earned through specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elara's perceptual filter (pale skin glowing, eyes scanning with "consciously wild intensity") is consistent. The woman's dialogue carries a distinct weariness and calm authority. However, several lines drift into writerly elevation ("Time itself seemed to bend," "a testament to the power of understanding over control") that exceed Elara's in-scene cognition. The final paragraph summarizes rather than trusts the closure image, and the woman's lines occasionally tip into expository service.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear and varies rhythm across paragraphs, with strong sensory moments (metallic wings glinting, cool glass, ephemeral patterns swirling). However, template cadence appears in adjacent lines ("She had spent years honing her skills, but this mission was unlike any other. Time itself seemed to bend…"), and several stock constructions dilute immediacy ("her heart quickened," "tears welled in Elara's eyes"). The final paragraph's elevated register ("a testament to the power of understanding over control," "the wind carried her story") feels imposed rather than earned. No paraphrase loops, but density could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The combination of albino tracker, hummingbird drone, and disappearing ink that reveals time's secrets is inventive on paper, but the execution follows a familiar template: lone seeker follows clue to wise guide who explains the answer. The ink's metaphorical reveal—"it's a mirror, not a tool"—echoes countless mentor-lesson moments. Elara's arc from anger to acceptance via vision-quest runs a well-worn groove, and the final image of her walking into the desert with newfound wisdom completes the checklist without a fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her tracking leads to the tent, but her choices are largely reactive. She follows the drone's path, listens to the woman's explanation, and receives the vision; the only decision visible on the page is to accept the woman's teaching. Her albino trait is mentioned but never constrains or enables a key choice with cost. Mid-band functional use, but her agency does not drive turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drone appears in three beats: perched on her wrist as she releases it, leading her to the tent, and hovering to capture details during the vision, then returning to her wrist at the end. It enables the search and provides continuity, shaping one major beat (finding the tent). However, its artificial hummingbird nature—the uncanny precision—never matters; a generic tracker device would function identically. Solid reprise at closure but swappable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Disappearing ink is the object of Elara's search, frames the central mystery, and its ephemeral patterns materialize in the climactic vision to reveal her brother's final moments. The woman's explanation that it "reflects the moments we try to escape" connects directly to Elara's motivation and reweights her goal from control to understanding. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure, with specific mechanics (ephemeral patterns, spilled ink) that matter. Strong integration, though the reveal is granted rather than fought for.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Consciously wild intensity" appears once in the opening as a descriptor of Elara's gaze but never returns or constrains an action. It reads as atmospheric labeling without cost or tactical consequence; the trait does not enable or prevent any on-page choice. Ornamental mention only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elara's journey is framed as discovering why time seems to slow in crisis, and the woman explicitly addresses this ("time doesn't slow; it unfolds"). The vision sequence shows time unfolding rather than slowing, but the action itself—someone or something disappearing—does not shape the middle beats or alter Elara's tactics. The concept is thematically present but mechanically vague; no one disappears on the page in a way that changes options. Functional theme echo, replaceable in execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (drone programmed to follow traces of disappearing ink, ephemeral patterns that pulse with life) and returns decisively at closure when the spilled ink's patterns materialize around Elara to reveal her brother's final moments. The mechanics—how the drone tracks faint traces, how the patterns coalesce into images—are asserted more than dramatized, but the method is causally present in setup and payoff. Solid two-gate integration; middle development is thinner.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is named in the opening and closing, and Elara moves through it to reach the tent, but the setting never pressures her choices. The tent's location "at the edge" provides spatial detail, yet no resource, barrier, or environmental condition alters tactics. Postcard description with spatial coherence but no causal pressure. Functional backdrop, easily swappable with another desert camp.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the eclipse ends" anchors the opening and the closing mentions "the remnants of the eclipse" on the horizon, but the timeframe does not create urgency or constrain Elara's actions. No clock tightens her search, and the post-eclipse moment functions as atmospheric framing rather than a tactical pressure. Early signal and final reprise, but no middle constraint. Lyric bookend without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to uncover why time bends in crisis and explain her brother's death—is stated in the opening, drives her to follow the drone, and is directly addressed by the woman's revelation and the vision sequence. Her anger and refusal to let his death "remain unexplained" create friction that the closure resolves by shifting her goal from control to understanding. Strong setup and payoff with a visible reweighting of desire, though the cost of letting go is asserted more than demonstrated through renunciation of a live option.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Serene anger" is named in the opening ("Her anger…burned deep within her" beneath a "serene demeanor") and returns when "Elara's anger flared, but she kept it in check," then transforms into "something quieter, more resolute" by the end. The tone modulates with the arc, but the contradiction between serenity and anger is told more than embodied in gesture or perception. Functional mood tracking without the layered contradiction that would charge the final image. Mid-functional with label dependence.</comment>
