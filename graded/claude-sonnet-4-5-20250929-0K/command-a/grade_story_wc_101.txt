<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her agency feels declarative rather than tested under contradictory impulses. The widow encounter offers a micro-choice, yet the gathering proceeds without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans toward summary ("she felt a peace she hadn't known in years") rather than embodied contradiction in the peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes who/where/when adequately and follows a causal progression: midnight runs → discovery → gathering → community commitment. Closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (community shifts from hollowed survivors to active participants), but the cost remains abstract—no specific path is visibly foreclosed on the page. The lens reads as Causal with light Accumulative coloring; the gathering functions as a turn, but the final image ("she felt a peace") tells rather than showing the reweighted stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor anchors the setting and recurs at the gathering, but it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains atmospheric. Sensory detail is present (lanterns, moonlight, cracked tiles) but filtered more by narrator convenience than POV bias. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—building intergenerational support—is signaled early and tightens once when Mara steps into moonlight and word spreads. The gathering represents a deepening, yet no live option is foreclosed with visible cost; the young girl and elder volunteer without friction. Agency exists in Mara's decision to reveal herself, but the escalation curve is gentle and the final cost is declared rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the premise (exile, unity, intergenerational care) but is stated overtly: "we're not just survivors... families build for the future." The bell functions as explicit symbol rather than accruing meaning through pressure. The final image offers sentiment ("peace she hadn't known") instead of a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext is present in the widow's sharp-eyed recognition but undercut by subsequent explanatory dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries some texture ("hollowed," "amplified quiet"), though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("defiance against the isolation the sanctions had imposed"). Dialogue is functional and goal-driven in the widow exchange; the gathering speech feels declarative but fits Mara's role. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful paragraph breaks and varied sentence openings. Minor scaffold appears: "Word spread quickly, not of Mara's identity, but of the mysterious donor" uses a template corrective structure, and "the weight of her secret suddenly lighter" is a bodily cliché. The phrase "amplified quiet" recurs without evolving pressure. No dense loops, but information density is moderate—several beats restate the premise without advancing tactics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The exile-community-leader-as-secret-benefactor frame is familiar, and the resolution (public gathering, communal commitment) follows a predictable arc. The bell as hope-symbol and "amplified quiet" offer mild tonal freshness, but the emotional calculus (anonymity → revelation → unity) does not surprise or complicate expectation. The sanctions period provides context but does not transform the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara initiates the food runs, decides to step into moonlight when discovered, and declares the gathering—three distinct beats. Her choices drive the arc, but the final gathering is executed without on-page friction, so causal pressure is moderate. Present in closure (ringing the bell, walking home), though the ending leans reflective rather than decision-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The silver bell appears in the opening, is clutched during the widow encounter, rung at the gathering announcement, placed on the table, rung again during the speech, and carried home—six touches across setup, middle, and closure. It gains symbolic weight ("promise," "beacon") and charges the final image, though its use remains declarative rather than constraining a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Anonymous donations shape the opening act (midnight runs) and the gathering revelation, appearing in two major beats. The concept enables Mara's strategy and community curiosity, but once revealed it does not complicate further—no cost or tradeoff emerges from the anonymity itself. Present in closure discussion but not reweighted.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is applied to the bell's reminder and Mara's voice at the gathering, but the trait does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost—it remains a tonal label. No on-page moment where gentleness forecloses aggression or persistence incurs a price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Declare" appears twice: Mara declares the gathering (middle turn that draws the community) and uses declarative speech at the event ("tonight... we're not just survivors"). The action redefines options and enables the communal commitment, participating directly in closure. Swapping for "announce" would lower intensity but the beat structure holds.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Midnight food runs are signaled early, recounted in the widow beat, and explained at the gathering—present in setup and middle. The mechanics (anonymity, doorstep baskets) matter to the plot, but the runs themselves are summarized rather than dramatized with on-page obstacle or cost. Closure echoes them thematically without new action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor frames the opening, hosts the gathering (middle and closure), and is noted in the final paragraph. It provides venue but does not constrain choice—Mara could hold the gathering elsewhere with minor edits. The cracked tiles and weathered table add texture without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The sanctions period is mentioned in setup ("left them hollowed") and closure reflection ("far from over"), establishing context and tightening resources. Time does not create a live deadline or alter tactics on the page—events unfold in a loose "one night... the night of the gathering" sequence without urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Building intergenerational support is Mara's stated goal, dramatized in the food runs (helping elders), the gathering invitation (all ages), and the elder/young-girl exchange at the end. The motivation drives the arc, though friction between this want and competing costs is absent—Mara's path proceeds without sacrifice or trade-off legible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" appears as descriptor (bell's "clear tone cutting through," "crowd fell silent") and recurs in closure reflection. Tone remains coherent but static—quiet reverence without modulation under pressure. The phrase charges the thematic claim but does not shift meaning through the arc; it labels rather than enacting tonal pressure.</comment>
