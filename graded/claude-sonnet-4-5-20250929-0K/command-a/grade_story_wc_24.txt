<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias pursues a philosophical quest but his interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection ("essence of time itself") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The discovery of the parchment delivers a tidy epiphany without prior dramatic struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path. The final peace feels declared rather than earned through on-page choices that alter his stance with friction. Motivation remains consistent but lacks the contradictory impulses and micro-choices under pressure required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph, meeting the test. However, the closure relies on a convenient discovery (hidden slot, parchment) that Elias has never noticed despite years of tending the clock, creating a causality gap. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding shift) but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page—no visible forfeiture or tactical change results from the revelation. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a late turn toward epiphany, but the turn is delivered by a prop rather than protagonist agency, undercutting earned closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The horizon measurement station and hydraulic clock anchor setting early and purposefully. The mantle clock key's notch charges the discovery beat, and the mist clearing at the end functions as a purposeful environmental shift that mirrors the internal revelation. However, the station's occupational function (measuring the horizon's curve) remains abstract; the brass face and hidden slot serve plot convenience more than spatial constraint. Micro-setting (the key, the stone floor) does constrain one choice (kneeling to retrieve), lifting the score into the functional band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what clocks measure—is signaled early and held throughout. However, escalation is minimal: Elias stays in the station, counts backwards, and retrieves the key without competing options or visible cost. The parchment resolves the quest without a tightening choice or trade-off; the mist clearing and his sense of peace declare resolution rather than dramatizing a forfeiture or stance crystallization. One meaningful beat (inserting the key) narrows options slightly, but the final image does not reweight cost under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme—time as essence rather than measurement—emerges from the parchment's message but is stated too directly: "Time is not measured in seconds, but in the spaces between." The razor-edges motif recurs (inscription, parchment) but functions as ornament rather than constraint. The final image (mist clearing, long shadows) gestures toward resonance but the thematic payoff is delivered via exposition rather than a non-literal answer earned through particulars. The piece reaches for depth but lapses into assertion at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable and the prose carries a meditative, slightly elevated register consistent with Elias's philosophical focus. However, interiority leans on filter constructions ("his mind racing," "his heart pounded") and some diction ("eminently peculiar," "fjord quiet") feels externally imposed rather than character-specific. No head-hopping; the voice maintains coherence across beats. The perceptual signature is generic (squinting, clutching) rather than distinctly Elias's way of noticing under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong and sentence rhythm varies purposefully. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "He sought to understand what clocks really measured, not just hours or minutes, but the essence of time itself" restates the motivation across two clauses without adding pressure. The phrase "fjord quiet" and "eminently peculiar" read as elevated diction imposed on the voice rather than emerging from it. The final paragraph stacks declarations ("profound sense of peace," "his understanding... would never be the same") that summarize rather than dramatize the shift. Minor loop and scaffold issues accumulate to −0.6 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—a clock shepherd discovering time's true nature via a hidden compartment—follows a familiar template: solitary seeker, mysterious key, revelatory text. The "razor edges" inscription and counting-backwards method feel ornamental rather than transforming the core. The parchment delivers the theme in near-prompt language, reducing freshness. The horizon measurement station offers potential specificity but remains underused; the ending's emotional arc (confusion → revelation → peace) is stock. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his choices (staying, counting, inserting the key) drive the plot. However, his role as "hydraulic clock shepherd" is mentioned but not dramatized—his tending skills do not constrain or enable key beats. The decision to insert the key comes from noticing a slot rather than applying specialized knowledge. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but the occupational specificity is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mantle clock key appears early (clutched, inscription read), returns at the discovery beat (notch, insertion), and is mentioned in the final paragraph (resting in his pocket). It enables the parchment discovery and its inscription ("Razor edges shape the unseen") primes the thematic payoff. However, the key's function is passive—it unlocks rather than constraining a choice or forcing a trade-off. Three beats, closure linkage, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Razor edges" appears in the key's inscription and the parchment's message ("razor edges of its passage cut away the unnecessary"). It frames the theme but does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page—Elias's actions (counting, inserting the key) would proceed identically without the razor metaphor. Present in setup and payoff, but swappable with another metaphor (e.g., "sharp turns," "fine threads") without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Eminently peculiar" describes the key in the opening paragraph but functions as a label without constraining action or enabling a choice. The key's peculiarity is asserted rather than demonstrated through unique properties that matter to the plot. Ornamental mention only; easily removable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elias squints at the inscription early and again at the notch on the key, and the second squint leads to the discovery. The action is specific and returns with changed meaning, but it does not create a major turn—the notch would be visible without squinting, and the action does not foreclose options or impose cost. Two beats, purposeful reprise, but limited causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Counting backwards ("Ten… nine… eight…") appears in the middle third and is framed as a method to access the clock's mystery. However, the count does not unlock anything—the key slips from Elias's fingers at "one," and the discovery follows from retrieving it, not from the count itself. The method is mentioned but does not shape the mechanics of success. Present in setup (implied motivation) and middle, but not in closure; swappable with another ritual.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The horizon measurement station anchors setting early and its stated purpose (measuring the world's limits) parallels the thematic question. However, the station does not constrain Elias's choices or supply resources—he could conduct the same quest in any clock room. The stone floor (where the key lands) is the sole micro-setting element that affects action. Setup and thematic parallel present, but limited tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Blowing the whistle appears twice (end of day, start of new day) to frame the timeframe, but the interval between whistles is untracked and exerts no pressure. Elias stays "instead of leaving" but no deadline, fatigue, or competing demand tightens his choices. The frame is present but inert; time does not shape tactics or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand what clocks really measure" is stated early, sustained across beats (counting, inserting the key, reading the parchment), and resolved at closure. However, it is told more than dramatized—Elias's philosophical desire does not conflict with a competing want or cost. The quest proceeds without friction or trade-off; the motivation drives the plot but lacks the embodied contradiction required for higher bands. Present in setup, middle, and closure with thematic payoff, but minimal on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Fjord quiet" is named early ("the kind of silence that pressed against your ears") and recurs implicitly in the final image (mist clearing, long shadows). The tone of meditative stillness holds across beats and supports the philosophical frame. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure—the discovery beat and the ending carry the same contemplative register without heightening or release. Coherent and present at closure, but static; no cadence shift that charges the final image.</comment>
