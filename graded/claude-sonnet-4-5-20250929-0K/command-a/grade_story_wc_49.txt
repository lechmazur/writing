<question>1</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>Elara's motivation is declared but never tested by a genuine obstacle or cost. Her internal experience consists entirely of stock embodiments ("heart swelled with hope") and therapy-speak epiphany without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation arrives without struggle or trade-off—she simply succeeds because the narrative wills it, making her arc feel ornamental rather than earned.</comment>

<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors are present early, but the drive lens never coheres: the piece gestures toward Causal (vine → song → remedy) yet delivers Accumulative mood without pressure tightening. The closure unit—glowing orbs suspended around Elara—is a Decisive Change by declaration only; no felt or visible cost appears on the page, and the "work is far from over" tag explicitly defers consequence off-page. The cost-proof test fails: no sentence shows what Elara has forfeited or risked to achieve this state.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>The arbor is vividly described with selective sensory detail (dew sparkling, leaves rustling), and the vine tendril functions as a micro-setting object across multiple beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara's actions proceed as planned without spatial friction. The setting charges the final image atmospherically but does not impose cost, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>3.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—restoring sacred practices—is signaled early but never narrows options or forces a trade-off. Elara hums, the tendril glows, the songs return: each step is additive without reversal or cost. The story declares that alignment is "crucial" yet applies no time pressure or failure consequence, leaving escalation as mood rather than structure.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the harvest-moon motif and the "spins golden stories" metaphor, but the final paragraph shifts into overt moralizing ("spin stories of hope and healing, one song at a time"). The ending offers a tidy thesis statement rather than a resonant, non-literal answer, and the orbs—introduced only at closure—feel like symbolic convenience rather than earned particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction is controlled with a consistent lyric register ("verdant arbor," "gathering hush"). However, interiority relies on stock constructions ("heart swelled," "deep sense of peace") and the narrative certainty never modulates under pressure—Elara's perceptions remain smoothly confident throughout. The prose has texture but lacks the perceptual signature and rhythmic variation under stress required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Clarity and grammar are clean, and sentence openings vary. However, paraphrase loops appear across adjacent beats: the second paragraph restates the tendril's glow and Elara's study without new information, and the final two paragraphs recycle "stories" and "sacred practices" in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence runs dominate high-pressure moments ("She hummed... her fingers tracing... The tendril shimmered"), applying a −0.4 deduction. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>3.9</grade>
<comment>The core premise—tinkerer restores lost magic through study and song—is a widely used fantasy template executed without fresh inflection. The vine tendril, harvest moon, and "forgotten songs" are stock genre furniture; the transformation test fails because the plot and arc work unchanged with different names. No specific, non-obvious synthesis or risk-taking elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>Elara is present throughout and her actions (adjusting goggles, studying the tendril, humming) move the plot, but none of her choices creates a meaningful turn—she succeeds on her first attempt without obstacle. She observes and enacts rather than deciding under pressure, placing her in functional-but-replaceable territory.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The vine tendril appears in setup (discovered relic), middle (pulsing golden light, Elara's months of study), and closure (uncoils, transforms into orbs). It is handled across multiple beats and its transformation shapes the ending image. However, its specific properties (why this tendril, not another relic?) are never tested by constraint or cost, and it could be swapped for any generic magical artifact with minor edits, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>4.3</grade>
<comment>The harvest moon is present in setup ("soft glow… still lingering"), mentioned as a source of power, and invoked at closure ("harvest moon's stories were alive again"). It occupies all three gates but never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it is atmospheric backdrop rather than active stake-shaper. The concept is told rather than dramatized, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>2.8</grade>
<comment>"Spins golden stories" is a metaphor attributed to the moon and repeated at closure, but it never constrains or enables an on-page action. Elara does not struggle with or leverage this attribute; it is a thematic label without visible cost or trade-off, rendering it ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Remedy is the stated goal and the orbs at closure are described as holding remedies for village ailments. The action appears in setup (motivation), middle (seeking songs that summon remedies), and closure (orbs contain remedies). However, no specific remedy is demonstrated or tested on the page, and the action could be swapped for "heal" or "cure" without structural change, limiting the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Forgotten songs" are signaled early (Elara has studied them for months), shape her middle attempts (humming to unlock the tendril), and deliver closure (songs flow through her, forming the remedies). The method drives the plot across all three gates. However, the mechanics are vague—why these songs, how they work, what makes them "forgotten"—and the method succeeds on first full attempt without cost, preventing entry into the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>4.7</grade>
<comment>The verdant arbor at dawn is anchored early and recurs through sensory detail (leaves, dew, first light breaking). It provides atmosphere and frames the action but never constrains a choice or alters Elara's tactics—she could perform the same ritual in any quiet natural space. The setting is present and purposeful but replaceable, landing in the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>2.1</grade>
<comment>"When everything aligns" is mentioned once in the third paragraph as a stated condition, but no clock or countdown tightens decisions. The harvest moon is fading, yet Elara faces no urgency or failure consequence. The timeframe is a label without dramatized pressure, making it ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>Restoring sacred practices is Elara's stated goal from the opening, drives her study of the tendril, and is invoked at closure ("restore the balance that had been lost"). The motivation is present across all three gates and coherent. However, it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction—Elara pursues it without doubt or cost—preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>"Gathering hush" appears in the opening and third paragraph ("gathering hush of dawn deepened") and the arbor falls silent after the song, creating a coherent mood arc. The tone modulates slightly from anticipation to fulfillment but remains a single static register (lyric reverence) without pressure-driven variation. It supports the story but does not charge the final image with new weight, placing it in the functional band.</comment>
