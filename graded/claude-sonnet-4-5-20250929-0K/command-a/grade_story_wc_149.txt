<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation (repaying a debt) is declared but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths. Interiority leans heavily on abstract labels—"mournful elation," "lovingly venomous"—without embodied contradiction or character-particular perception. The whispered collective of other spirits in paragraph five dilutes focus without pressing her toward a visible trade-off. No meaningful change or credible endurance with felt cost appears; she simply steps forward with "a glimmer of hope," an assertion rather than an earned shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "who" (ghost bride's identity, her binding event) and "when" (the timeframe's pressure) remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The piece reads Accumulative/Textural in ambition (gothic atmosphere, recurring bead, pattern of sorrow), but no decisive tightening or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with visible cost. The ending—stepping into endless night with "a glimmer of hope"—offers mood rather than closure; no path is foreclosed, no conceptual price made legible. Closure form is absent, capping the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vivid ("petrified blossoms," "winter-cracked fields," twisted tree) and the carved bead recurs with glowing light, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image with tactical consequence. Sensory detail supports atmosphere yet remains ornamental; the environment does not narrow options or supply a resource that alters the ending. Spatial choreography is clear (aisles, roots, center tree), meeting baseline scope for this length, but the micro-setting test for high bands is not satisfied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repaying the debt—is signaled early but never tightened through an on-page reversal or choice that narrows options. The bead's awakening and the chorus of whispers complicate atmosphere without forcing a trade-off or visible cost. The protagonist's agency is passive: she kneels, clutches, stands, and steps forward, all without forfeiting a live alternative. Under the Accumulative lens, no meaningful deepening or cadence shift reweights cost; under Causal, no because/therefore linkage alters tactics. Escalation is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (collective debt, betrayal, transformation) emerges from recurring images (bead, tree, endless night) and the chorus of spirits, but the ending asserts "a glimmer of hope" rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer through a final image that reweights prior material. The bead's "resonant awakenings" remains a label; no earned insight arises from specific on-page struggle. Subtext operates in the "lovingly venomous connection," yet that contradiction is told, not enacted in a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, diction elevated and gothic ("petrified blossoms," "ephemeral cameo appearances"). Perceptual signature is atmospheric but not character-specific; the ghost bride's way of noticing (spectral, mournful) does not constrain knowledge or reveal a distinct bias. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized") appear but remain voice-consistent. No head-hopping or tense drift. The prose reads competent and legible, but rhythmic control under pressure is absent—peak beats (paragraph four, kneeling) lack syntactic acceleration or compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: paragraph two's "The bead was no ordinary trinket; it was a key" repeats the same claim in adjacent clauses; "soothed and tormented" / "lovingly venomous" recycle the contradiction without adding pressure. Template cadence ("Her presence was a whisper, a flicker...") and stacked modifiers ("mournful elation," "ephemeral cameo appearances") dull immediacy. Stock metaphors ("branches twisted like the arms of a mourner") and summary-only peaks (the climax is "grappled with conflicting emotions") flatten propulsion. Apply −0.8 for loops and scaffold, −0.3 for stock phrasing in peak beats; total −1.1 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The ghost-bride-in-greenhouse premise is familiar gothic template material (spectral figure, betrayal debt, magical object, threshold moment). "Resonant awakenings," "lovingly venomous," and "mournful elation" are prompt-phrase ornaments rather than specific, lived inflections. The bead's glow and collective whispers offer atmospheric layering but no non-obvious synthesis; the arc (haunting → hope) could transfer to any spectral setting with minor edits. No bold structural risk or earned turn transforms the template. Derivative premise penalty: −0.8 in Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The ashen-veil ghost bride is present throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She kneels, clutches, stands, steps—observation and motion without agency-driven turns. Setup present, development ornamental, closure participation minimal (she steps forward with the bead's light, no choice). Cap 4.6 for no middle development; deduct −0.8 for summary-only key moments (paragraph four), −0.6 for swappability (any spectral figure could perform these actions). Yield 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The carved stone bead appears in three beats: buried beneath roots (paragraph two), glowing as she kneels (paragraph four), clutched as talisman in the ending (paragraph six). Setup early, development (glowing, awakening) enables the whisper-chorus complication, closure participation (clutched, illuminates path). No visible cost tied to the bead's use; its properties (resonance, glow) are asserted, not tested. Two gates met, causal pressure weak. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, minus swappability −0.5 (any magical token could glow), minus ornamental middle use −0.6. Yield 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Resonant awakenings" is label-only: the bead's resonance and the spirits' awakening are described ("began to glow," "surge of venom") but do not shape an on-page choice or narrow tactics. Present as theme claim, not causal force. Setup weak (first mentioned paragraph two as abstraction), no middle development, closure ornamental (whispers urge, no cost). Cap 2.8 for missing closure participation; deduct −0.4 for label-only use. Yield 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Lovingly venomous" appears once in paragraph two ("a lovingly venomous connection that both soothed and tormented") as descriptor without constraining or enabling action. No on-page trade-off, no visible cost. Setup ornamental, no middle development, no closure participation. Cap 2.8, deduct −1.0 for label-only mention. Yield 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The ghost (her spectral state, haunting) frames the premise and enables her to perceive the whispers, but the action itself—being a ghost—does not drive a turn. Her ghostliness is static backdrop; the bead's awakening and her stepping forward could occur in mortal or other supernatural frames with minor edits. Setup early, development ornamental, closure participation weak (she steps forward as ghost, no unique ghost-specific cost). Cap 4.6 for no middle development; deduct −0.5 for swappability. Yield 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Through ephemeral cameo appearances" is mentioned once in paragraph two ("during one of her ephemeral cameo appearances, when the veil between worlds thinned") as backstory flavor; the method does not shape present tactics or return at closure. Setup absent (mentioned in reflection), no middle development, no closure participation. Cap 2.8 for missing closure; deduct −0.8 for summary-only, −0.8 for late/ornamental mention. Yield 1.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is present throughout: "petrified blossoms," "glass walls," "trees that bore no fruit," "endless night" framing. Setup immediate, middle development (the largest tree anchors her spirit, roots hide the bead), closure participation (she steps into endless night from the greenhouse threshold). The greenhouse supplies the anchor-tree resource and the shrouded atmosphere, shaping her location and symbolic stance. Three gates met, causal pressure moderate. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, minus ornamental description stalling momentum −0.5, minus postcard-catalog style −0.8. Yield 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"Over the hush of winter-cracked fields" appears once in paragraph one as atmospheric frame; the timeframe does not tighten decisions or track elapsed pressure. No clock, no urgency shaped by season. Setup ornamental, no middle development, no closure participation. Cap 2.8 for missing closure; deduct −0.6 for vague/untracked time, −0.6 for ornamental mention. Yield 1.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The debt motivation is declared in paragraph one ("to repay what was owed"), reflected in paragraph three ("the debt she owed"), and present in paragraph five ("her debt was not just personal but collective"), but never dramatized in a conflicting on-page choice with visible cost. Told-only with no friction between want and price. Setup early, development summary-only, closure participation weak (she steps forward to confront debt, no foreclosed path). Cap 4.6 for no middle development; deduct −0.3 for summary-only treatment, +0.6 for early signal and closure mention. Yield 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Mournful elation" is named in paragraph three ("Her elation...was always tempered by the mournful memory") and implied in paragraph five ("mournful elation that both comforted and burdened"), modulating from sorrow to "a glimmer of hope" in the ending. Setup early, middle development (the conflicting emotions appear twice), closure participation (tone shifts to hope-charged darkness). The tone is consistent yet static—no purposeful cadence break that reweights the stake. Two gates met, lyric reprise present. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, minus label-only treatment −0.6, minus static mood without pressure modulation −1.3. Yield 5.3.</comment>
