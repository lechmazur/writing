<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is signaled ("steely longing," "strategically creative mind") but her interior life relies heavily on abstract labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift from playing "for herself" to "with newfound purpose" lacks a causal trigger in her prior choices; the film reel delivers insight passively. The strategic plan and its execution remain ornamental—she follows compasses and loads a reel without meaningful resistance or cost that forecloses a live option on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (seeking hidden film fragments, memory montage, symbolic objects), but the closure relies on a convenienct magical fix: the clock ticks, compasses still, and Elara plays a "new song" without visible cost or renunciation. The film-reel sequence summarizes memory vignettes rather than dramatizing a choice that narrows options. Orientation is anchored early (arbor, bench, piano), so no penalty there, but the ending asserts transformation ("embrace fate," "new song") without showing what path she foreclosed or what she sacrificed to earn the change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tidal arbor, floating islands, and flickering compasses create a vivid fantastical setting with purposeful details (weathered bench, ancient projector, beam of sunlight). Sensory selection is competent but leans visual; the arbor's labyrinth and the chamber with the reel are sketched rather than inhabited with tactile constraint. The clock and piano anchor micro-setting but do not constrain a key choice—Elara moves freely through the space without friction. The final image (horizon inviting night, arbor sighing) adds atmospheric charge but remains decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the film reel to "surprise fate"—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition. Elara follows compasses, finds the reel on a pedestal, loads it, and steps into its world without friction, cost, or a narrowing of options. The film montage recounts memories but does not force a trade-off or renunciation. The ticking clock and stilled compasses at the end are presented as gifts from the reel rather than consequences of her agency, undercutting escalation and felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme—embracing fate rather than defying it—emerges through the reel's revelation but is articulated too directly in the final paragraphs ("had not changed her fate but had shown her how to embrace it"). The anniversary clock, compasses, and piano recur but function as ambient symbols rather than particulars that constrain choice. The "new song" metaphor is broad and does not offer a non-literal answer; instead it restates the premise. The piece invites reflection but leans toward thematic echo rather than earned resonance from specific action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Interiority favors stock phrasing ("wistful," "steely longing," "newfound purpose") over character-particular perception. Diction remains consistent but elevated in a way that flattens voice—"ethereal breeze," "kaleidoscope of colors," "labyrinthine heart" read ornamental rather than filtered through Elara's specific grief or pianist's lens. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is controlled but the narrative stance lacks the rhythmic modulation or perceptual signature that would elevate it into the high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean with varied sentence openings and no major loops. Figurative language is frequent but often generic ("the horizon itself was waiting," "kaleidoscope of colors," "arbor seemed to sigh") without grounding in physical logic. Stock metaphors and elevated diction appear in multiple peak beats (film dissolving, stepping into the reel, arbor's approval) without pattern-teaching or payoff, applying a −0.5 deduction for density without coherence. The final paragraph summarizes emotional shift ("blend of sorrow and hope, of endings and beginnings") rather than letting image carry the weight. Information density is moderate; some scaffolding remains ("She realized then," "knowing she had").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The fantastical arbor and film-reel premise offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc—widow processes grief, gains insight, plays hopeful music—follows a familiar template. The "hidden sections" motif and the compasses guiding lost souls feel ornamental rather than transformed through Elara's specific struggle. The final turn (embracing fate vs. changing it) is thematically conventional and stated outright, reducing ingenuity. No bold structural or tonal risk; the piece plays it safe within its genre conventions without a non-obvious synthesis or earned surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decision to seek the film reel initiates the middle sequence. However, her "strategically creative mind" weaves a plan in summary, and the compasses do the navigating. She loads the reel and "steps into" it, but the reel itself delivers the insight passively. At closure she returns and plays with "newfound purpose," but this shift is asserted rather than earned by a visible trade-off or renunciation. The pianist identity is mentioned (piano, melody) but does not shape her tactics or constrain her choices under pressure. The character drives setup and is present at closure but does not create a key turn through an active decision with cost. Early signal +0.4, closure presence +0.3, but no causal narrowing of options or mid-beat involvement with cost: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The broken anniversary clock appears in the opening (setup +0.3), is carried into the film sequence, and reappears at closure ticking softly—an early→final reprise (+0.5 lyric allowance). However, it is handled passively: Elara does not repair it, choose to leave it broken, or sacrifice anything tied to it. The ticking resumes as a magical gift from the reel rather than as a consequence of her choice, so no causal pressure or cost connection. Present in three beats (opening, carried, ending) but ornamental in all three. 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The flickering compasses are introduced early (trunk detail, "guide lost souls"), and Elara follows them to the chamber—minimal functional involvement (+0.2). They still at closure, their needles pointing toward the horizon, a thematic capstone. But the compasses do not constrain Elara's choices or impose a cost; they simply lead her to the reel without complication. No middle beat where their mechanics alter tactics or create friction. Early signal +0.3, closure mention +0.2, but no causal pressure: 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" is labeled in the opening paragraph ("Her strategically creative mind began to weave a plan") but never dramatized. The plan itself—follow compasses, find reel—requires no ingenuity, tradeoff, or improvisation on the page. The trait does not enable a visible action with cost or constrain a choice. Label-only trait −0.5, no beat involvement beyond the assertion, no closure linkage: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Refuge" is thematically present: Elara plays "not for the lost, but for herself, her music a refuge from the silence." At closure she plays again, but the music has shifted from refuge to "new song." The action bookends the piece (early→final +0.4) and is tied to her identity, but it does not create a turn—she plays before and after without a visible cost or a decision to abandon refuge. The reel delivers the change; the piano is a vessel, not a crucible. Lyric reprise +0.4, thematic link +0.2, but swappable and no causal narrowing: 3.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The black-and-white film reel is signaled in the opening as "whispers of hidden sections" (+0.3 setup), becomes the object of Elara's quest (middle beat +0.4), and delivers the memory montage that leads to her realization. However, its mechanics are vague—"hidden sections" dissolve into colored scenes without clear cost or constraint—and it functions as a magical device that grants insight rather than a method she must master or pay for. Present in setup, middle, and closure (three gates), but the method itself is passive and replaceable with any mystical revelation. Three beats +0.9, but resolves a problem it did not create −0.7: 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The tidal arbor is vividly described (gnarled branches, floating islands, labyrinthine heart) and anchors the story spatially. Elara moves from bench to chamber to arbor's heart, and the arbor "sighs in approval" at closure—a charged image. However, the arbor does not constrain her movement or supply resources that alter her tactics; she follows compasses freely. The setting is atmospheric but does not pressure a choice. Early signal +0.5, closure image +0.3, but ornamental use −0.5, no causal constraint: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "until the horizon invites night" is signaled in the opening ("as the sun began its slow descent") and paid off in the final line ("the horizon invited night"). The progression from sunset to night tracks Elara's journey through the arbor and back, lending a gentle temporal arc. However, the time does not tighten her decisions—she has ample time to explore, watch the reel, and return—so no live clock that alters moves. Early→final reprise +0.6, thematic coherence +0.3, but no pressure or cost: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to surprise fate with an unplanned encore" is stated outright in the third paragraph and drives Elara's quest for the film reel. At closure she realizes she has "surprised fate not with an encore, but with a new song altogether," a direct callback. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—there is no friction between her longing and a competing cost or fear that complicates her choices. The reel delivers the insight; she does not renounce or sacrifice anything to earn the "new song." Setup +0.4, closure callback +0.4, but told-only and no friction: 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Steely longing" is invoked early ("a steely longing she hadn't felt in years") and the tone remains elegiac and wistful throughout, with moments of quiet determination. The final image—playing a melody that blends "sorrow and hope, of endings and beginnings"—modulates the tone toward resolution. However, the emotional register stays elevated and abstract rather than sharpening under pressure; peak beats (stepping into the reel, memories intertwining) maintain the same lyric distance without intensification. Coherent tone +0.4, closure modulation +0.3, but static texture and label-only at key moments −0.3: 5.1.</comment>
