<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "vouchsafe a future" is asserted but not grounded in concrete choices under pressure. The puppet-mending shows physical engagement, but internal contradiction is absent—she doubts briefly then commits without visible competing impulses. The blood-mingling gesture feels symbolic rather than a micro-choice with cost. Embodied emotion is present in "fingers trembling," yet the resolution arrives through passive patterning rather than a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the puppet mends and the lighthouse beam steadies, crystallizing fragile hope. However, escalation is flat—Elara arranges fragments, hums, doubts, then succeeds without meaningful narrowing of options or a causal turn that tests her method. The "hush broke" line shifts pressure, but no prior beat forced a tactical choice. Under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative drifting toward Causal at closure), the because/therefore linkage is weak. Cost is implied but not dramatized: no visible forfeiture or tactical trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse at dusk anchors who/where/when early and charges the final image ("beam steadied, cutting through the dusk like a blade of hope"). The puppet fragments function as micro-setting, handled across beats (arranging, blood-dripping, glowing), constraining Elara's physical engagement. Sensory detail is selective—stone floor, violet and ash sky, rough shard edges—filtered through urgency. No occupational depth beyond "adjuster," but the setting pressures her tactile work and the ending reprise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent midnight—is signaled early but never tightens options. Elara's lullaby falters once, then resumes with "renewed determination" without a trade-off or visible cost. The puppet mends passively via "nested patterns" whose mechanics remain abstract. No on-page reversal forces a choice; the glow intensifies and success arrives without agency-driven escalation. Under the Hybrid lens, the ending reconfigures meaning (fragile hope vs. relentless clock) but lacks a live decision or forfeiture that narrows paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—fragility and beauty in flawed existence—emerges through the puppet's cracks and Elara's blood-mingling, avoiding overt moralizing until the final line ("beautifully flawed and achingly fragile"). The mentor's quoted wisdom is on-the-nose yet brief. The ending image ("whispered her lullaby into the pane of hush") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. Subtext in gesture (pressing palm, blood mingling) and the recurring "beautifully flawed" motif charge the resolution. One point of modest thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph lowers the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent—"bruised sky," "pane of hush," "ripple"—but leans elevated without stress modulation. Perceptual signature is light: Elara notices cracks and light, yet her way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("feeling," "seeing") appear but do not dull immediacy. The phrase "whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes" and "bruised awe" recur as template cadence, flattening voice under peak pressure. Psychic distance is consistent, but the prose reads more orchestrated than inhabited.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "hush" appears eight times, "beautifully flawed" thrice, "nested patterns" and "lullaby" recur without evolving meaning. Template cadence in para 2: "The lighthouse was… Yet tonight… Elara's hands moved…" Stock metaphors ("like a sentinel," "like a blade of hope") and elevated register ("vouchsafe," "encroaching," "achingly fragile") clash with urgency. Filter-verb stack in para 3 ("saw herself," "feeling," "let it drip") dulls immediacy. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching. Information density is low—many lines restate mood. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("beautifully flawed" in final para), disallowing 9+ globally and capping Q7 at 8.7; pervasive loops and template stems trigger −1.4 in Q7 plus −0.3 for paraphrase adjacency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The doomsday-clock-adjuster premise and broken-puppet-mending ritual echo familiar mystical-craftsperson templates without fresh transformation. "Nested patterns" and "lullaby across lifetimes" remain abstract rather than grounded in specific world logic or moral calculus. The lighthouse and dusk setting, while atmospheric, function as postcard backdrops. Emotional arc—doubt to renewed determination—follows a predictable path. The mentor-wisdom quote and blood-binding gesture are stock moves. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece hedges toward median safety. Derivative premise and lack of specificity trigger −1.0 in Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Doomsday clock adjuster is present throughout but makes no key turn driven by choice. Elara arranges, hums, doubts, then succeeds passively. Observation and mood dominate; no decision alters tactics. Setup (para 1), development (arranging fragments), but no closure-active choice. Cap 4.6 for missing causal turn at closure; swappable with "healer" or "keeper" −0.4; ornamental职业label −0.3. Base 3.0 +0.8 setup +0.4 one beat = 4.2, caps/frictions → 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Broken puppet head is handled in three beats: examining cracks (para 1), blood-dripping (para 3), mending (para 6). Returns with reweighted meaning (faint smile at closure). Setup early, development (blood mingling constrains her physically), payoff (mends and smiles). Causal pressure moderate—enables the ritual but does not narrow options. Specificity high (porcelain, painted eyes). Base 3.0 +0.8 setup +0.9 two beats +0.5 causal +0.7 closure +0.5 specificity = 6.4, −0.2 for late intensification of agency → 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Pane of hush appears four times as metaphor but never shapes tactics or alters options. Mentioned (para 2, 5, 7) without constraining action. Setup unclear—first use para 2 is descriptive. Development absent. No payoff—final line cameo does not reweight stakes. Label-only theme claim −0.3, ornamental −0.5, summary-only −0.3, missing development gate cap 3.4 → 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Beautifully flawed appears four times as label (para 2, 3, 6, 7). Mentioned but does not constrain on-page action with cost. Elara "saw herself in it" is told reflection, not a choice. Setup (para 2), no middle constraint, closure cameo (para 7) does not reweight. Missing development cap 3.4, label-only −0.3 → 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>Vouchsafe appears once (para 2) as stated goal, never dramatized as action. No turn traces to it. Easily swappable with "ensure" or "secure." Setup weak (stated, not enacted), no development, no closure participation. Missing all gates → ornamental. Cap 2.8 for missing closure, swappable −0.8, ornamental −0.5, late mention (para 2, ~20%) −0.2 → 2.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Through nested patterns is signaled early (para 2) and reappears (para 5, 6). Mechanics described ("each layer… different era") but do not shape Elara's attempts—she hums and presses, patterns glow passively. Setup (para 2), development weak (para 5 glow is consequence, not choice), payoff (para 6 mending) does not show the method constraining tactics. Two-gate eligibility → 6.0 range, but mechanism is summary-only −0.8, swappable with "ritual" −0.4 → 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Hidden lighthouse at dusk anchors throughout and steadies beam at closure. Dusk charges final image ("cutting through the dusk like a blade of hope"). Setup (para 1), development (groaning walls para 3, stuttering beam para 5 add pressure), closure (beam steadies para 6). Spatial grounding clear (stone floor, windows). Lighthouse constrains her sanctuary but does not alter tactics. Base 3.0 +0.8 setup +0.9 two beats +0.7 closure +0.3 specificity = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Across the hush of time's final ripple appears twice (para 2, 7) as poetic phrase. Time does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure or deadline constrains Elara's work. Vague temporal framing; dusk is static backdrop. Setup unclear, no development, closure cameo does not alter options. Missing development cap 3.4, ornamental −0.5 → 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>To whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes is stated (para 2) and enacted (humming para 2, 5, 7). Desire present but not conflicted—Elara doubts briefly then commits without friction between wants and costs. Setup (para 2), development (lullaby falters para 5), payoff (whispers lullaby para 7). Two gates → 6.0 eligible, but friction absent and told-only motivation −0.8, summary-only enactment −0.4, introduced ~20% −0.2 → cap 4.6 for missing setup gate (not by first third).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Bruised awe appears twice (para 5, 7). Tone—melancholic wonder—is coherent through turns and modulates (doubt para 5, hope para 6). Diction ("bruised sky," "achingly fragile") supports tone. Setup (para 1 bruised sky), development (para 5 "bruised awe" guides her), payoff (para 7 "heart swelling with bruised awe" charges final image). Three gates met. Base 3.0 +0.8 setup +0.4 one beat +0.7 closure +0.5 modulation = 5.4.</comment>
