<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore faith is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses acting in scene. The interior voice relies on stock phrasing ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment") and therapy-speak ("shattered by years of wandering") rather than embodied contradiction. The final discovery feels unearned—no genuine struggle or foreclosed path accompanies the restoration. Micro-choices (lifting the sundial, clearing debris) advance plot mechanically without revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive clearly (catacomb orchard, diaspora returnee, excavation task). However, no meaningful causal linkage drives the discovery—Elara wanders until the land "guides" her, then stumbles upon the hollow without prior agency narrowing options. The closure (finding belonging via the mural) lands as told resolution rather than a decisive change with visible cost; the faith is restored by discovery alone, not by a choice that forecloses a path. Drive lens reads Situational-leaning but the stance crystallization at closure is declared, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with recurring sensory anchors (roots snaking through bones, ivy, moss, golden hue). Spatial choreography remains coherent across the excavation. The sundial base functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final beat by unlocking the tomb, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Deduction: the orchard's pressure on choice is more atmospheric than tactical—Elara follows the land's "whispers" rather than concrete constraints altering her decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore faith via excavation) is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened. Elara's "purposeful wandering" replaces agency-driven escalation; the roots "guide" and she "stumbles upon" the hollow without a reversal or forced trade-off. No visible cost accompanies the discovery—no loss of time, tool, or alternate path foreclosed. The chamber opens easily once the sundial base is placed, resolving without friction or protagonist choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of restoration and cyclical time emerges from the sundial and mural imagery. The final mural offers a resonant visual answer tied to faith rebuilt through connection to ancestry. However, the thematic question is stated rather than dramatized ("even in the darkest times, there was always a way to rebuild"), and Elara's epiphany arrives without friction or counter-pressure. The sundial motif constrains one choice (unlocking the tomb) and charges the closure, earning modest credit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited with stable distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (tracing patterns, listening to whispers) but the diction drifts into elevated register incongruent with immediate perception under pressure ("fractured by centuries of displacement," "beacon guiding her toward a future rooted in the past"). Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "realized") cluster in reflective passages without voice-motivated purpose. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Multiple prose artifacts harm momentum: paraphrase loops ("It was more than an object; it was a bridge" / "no longer just an object; it was a symbol"), template cadence in the opening paragraph (repeated "where" clauses), and therapy-speak labels ("cautious enchantment," "warmly curious") used without embodiment. Stock metaphors ("bridge between past and present," "beacon guiding") in the final paragraph dull the closure image. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance. Sentence openings vary minimally across paragraphs two through four.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The diaspora-returnee excavating ancestral roots to restore faith follows a recognizable template without transformation through lived specificity or non-obvious moral calculus. The sundial-as-key and mural-as-answer beats are telegraphed without surprise or fresh inflection. The orchard setting offers vivid texture but the emotional arc (broken → belonging via discovery) could transfer to any heritage-reconnection frame with minor edits. No bold risk elevates the design.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her diaspora-returnee status functions primarily as backstory motivation rather than driving on-page choices. The excavation task is inherited, not chosen under pressure. Her key actions (lifting the sundial, placing it in the tomb) are mechanically functional rather than turning-point decisions that alter tactics or foreclose paths.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sundial base appears in three beats: discovery/lifting (paragraph 3), reflection on its weight and celestial maps (paragraph 3), and placement to unlock the tomb (paragraph 5). It enables the closure action and carries thematic weight (cyclical time, continuity). However, its function as key is convenient rather than earned through prior constraint—no cost or trade-off accompanies its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Interrupted journeys" is named in the opening and closing paragraphs as thematic echo but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. Elara's journey has been "interrupted by doubts and detours" (told backstory), and the mural depicts "interrupted journeys of life," but no present interruption alters her excavation method or closure choice. The concept remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" appears as a label in paragraphs 1 and 4 without constraining action or enabling a choice with cost. It describes Elara's affect but does not create trade-offs (e.g., curiosity leading her into danger vs. caution pulling back). The trait is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is signaled early as Elara's task ("rebuild something far more fragile: her faith") and referenced at closure ("a reminder that…there was always a way to rebuild"). It shapes the dominant stake but remains abstract—no on-page rebuild action with visible cost occurs. The faith restoration happens via discovery, not reconstruction effort that tests commitment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is named in paragraph 2 and described as Elara's method ("allowing the orchard's rhythm to guide her steps"). However, the method is told rather than shown through varied attempts or course corrections. The discovery occurs via "stumbling upon" rather than through wandering's mechanics mattering to the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting is established early with vivid detail (tree roots between bones, ivy, moss) and supplies the key resource (the hidden tomb). It appears in most beats and pressures Elara's movement through its spatial layout. The setting's atmosphere of life-and-death intertwining directly supports the theme and charges the final image of restoration among ancestors' bones.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "days turned into weeks" (paragraph 4) establishes duration but does not tighten decisions. No live clock pressures Elara's excavation; she proceeds at the land's pace without urgency. The temporal span functions as summary rather than escalation mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore lost faith is signaled in the opening sentence and referenced at closure. It drives her presence in the orchard and frames the excavation's purpose. However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between want and cost—faith is restored by discovery without testing commitment or forcing trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" is named in paragraph 4 and coheres with the orchard's "whispers growing louder, shadows softer" and Elara's measured pace. The tone modulates slightly from curiosity to realization but remains largely static—no sharp tonal shift at the discovery that would charge the final image with undeniable pressure. The enchantment is told rather than embodied through prose rhythm.</comment>
