<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's grief is embodied through her workbench actions and the traced stencil, but her interior remains static across most beats—subdued throughout without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The tattoo moment reads as externally triggered (curtains glow, stencil pulses) rather than emerging from her own wrestle between yearning and resistance. The final "renewed determination" arrives without visible cost or a choice that forecloses an alternative path; she simply returns to work with confidence she "hadn't felt in years," which feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early enough; the drive lens reads Situational (grief-rooted yearning meets magical pressure). The curtains' illumination and the tattoo's autonomous glow complicate Elara's stance, but the transfer itself is passive—she holds the stencil and warmth spreads—without a decision that narrows options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (renewed purpose), yet the cost is asserted ("promise…to herself") rather than dramatized; no visible path is foreclosed, no tactical shift shown. One meaningful pressure point exists (the light/tattoo sequence), meeting the 600–800 word minimum, but the ending lacks the felt price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory is vividly rendered—brass fittings, glass panes, ethereal glow—and the "genuinely artificial" paradox is signaled early. The tattoo stencil on vellum and the curtains of intention are handled objects that recur. However, the environment does not constrain a choice: Elara's transformation is triggered by the curtains' autonomous glow rather than spatial access or resource scarcity. The observatory functions as atmospheric backdrop more than a crucible that alters tactics or charges the final image with material consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting with her husband's legacy—is signaled early. Pressure remains stable rather than escalating: Elara traces, gazes, folds origami in a "predictable rhythm" until the curtains respond to her "quiet yearning." The climax is externally granted (light, glow, warmth) rather than driven by protagonist agency; she does not choose to press the stencil against her skin after weighing cost, she acts "without thinking." No live option is foreclosed on the page; the pendant crafting in the final beat adds a new task without dramatizing what she gave up to commit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—finding life in decay, teaching withering to bloom—emerges through particulars (mourning bands, withering plants, crumbling sites) and avoids overt moralizing until the whispered line "To teach withering to bloom again," which edges toward summary. The spiraling vine and the seed pendant offer resonant images, and the phrase "not just to her husband's memory, but to herself" reweights the opening yearning. The final paragraph's "a reminder that even in the darkest times, illumination was possible" is a thematic statement that tells rather than letting the image carry the answer, lowering the score from higher bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in "hollow," "deft and sure" becoming "subdued ardor," and the observatory as "timeless." Diction is controlled, though some phrases—"curtains of intention," "genuinely artificial"—read as authorial concepts rather than fully naturalized through Elara's idiom. The phrase "curtains of intention…imbued with the intentions of those who had passed through" is expository scaffolding mid-scene. Under peak stress (the tattoo transfer), the prose remains measured and observational rather than compressing into her immediate embodied state, which slightly dulls the intimacy expected at climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are generally strong. Minor loop: "The observatory itself was a place of paradox, genuinely artificial in its construction" followed by two sentences re-describing its walls and telescope feels mildly redundant. "Her hands, once deft and sure, now moved with a subdued ardor" opens with clean specificity. The phrase "She realized the curtains of intention had chosen her, responding to her quiet yearning" is tell-heavy summary that compresses the causal hinge into abstraction. Stock metaphor "like a lifeline" and "hollow" are functional but not fresh. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The combination of mourning jewelry, botanical decay, and observatory mysticism offers a fresh synthesis. The "curtains of intention" and "genuinely artificial" paradox are conceptually intriguing but remain label-level; their mechanics are told rather than discovered through action. The origami-with-coordinates device is specific, yet its purpose and Elara's theory of "teaching withering to bloom" stay abstract. The tattoo-transfer climax—autonomous glow and warmth—leans on magical convenience rather than transforming the trope through Elara's lived choice or world logic. Emotional truth is present in the grief-to-purpose arc, but the resolution's passivity and the final paragraph's generic affirmation ("even in the darkest times, illumination was possible") lower the ingenuity score.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her origami ritual and workbench actions anchor early beats. However, her key transformation (accepting the tattoo, returning to craft with renewed purpose) is externally triggered by the curtains' glow rather than arising from her decision under pressure. She does not weigh competing goods or face a trade-off; she acts "without thinking" when the stencil touches her arm. The ending shows her crafting a pendant, but this is a new action rather than a turn that redefines prior stakes. Functional but replaceable: another passive protagonist receiving mystical aid would yield a similar arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tattoo stencil appears in the opening paragraph (setup), is traced habitually mid-story (development), glows autonomously at the climax, and transfers to Elara's arm, reappearing symbolically in the pendant's etched vine (closure participation). It is handled across three distinct beats. However, its transformation is externally driven (the stencil "began to glow," "seemed to lift off the vellum") rather than shaped by Elara's tactical choice under cost. The stencil's mechanics are told rather than dramatized as a dilemma she resolves. Scores in the mid-6s for multi-beat presence and closure linkage, but the lack of visible choice-cost tied to the stencil caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "curtains of intention" are introduced mid-story, shimmer when Elara approaches, and trigger the climactic illumination. They are described as "woven from threads imbued with the intentions of those who had passed through," yet this mechanism remains abstract; no prior scene shows Elara or others imbuing the curtains, and their rules are unexplained. The curtains act autonomously ("had chosen her") rather than responding to a choice Elara makes under cost. They complicate the plot but could be replaced with another mystical catalyst (enchanted mirror, relic) with minor edits. Functional but swappable, scoring mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" is applied to the observatory's construction in the second paragraph: "a place of paradox, genuinely artificial…walls lined with glass panes…both ancient and modern." The attribute is described but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. Elara does not navigate a choice shaped by the observatory's artificial-yet-timeless nature; the setting remains atmospheric. The phrase reads as thematic labeling rather than a lived constraint that alters tactics. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears early in the observatory's "ethereal glow" and climaxes when "the room was bathed in a soft, golden light—an illumination that seemed to come from within the curtains themselves." This light triggers the tattoo transfer and shapes the final affirmation ("illumination was possible"). The action drives two beats (the curtain-glow and the closing line) and charges the ending image. However, the illumination is passively received rather than Elara choosing to kindle or seek it under cost, which keeps it below the indispensable band. Essential across beats and ending, scoring solidly in the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Leaving origami figures with coordinates inside is introduced in the third paragraph as part of Elara's "predictable rhythm" and explained as leading to sites "where her husband had once found beauty in decay." The method is setup and its purpose (teaching withering to bloom) is stated. However, no beat shows Elara folding an origami figure on the page, no visitor finds one and reacts, and the coordinates do not constrain or enable the climax. The method is told-only and does not reappear at closure. Functional setup without development or payoff, scoring low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The timeless observatory is anchored early with vivid particulars (brass telescope, glass panes, stillness) and recurs throughout. It provides the setting for all action and the curtains within it trigger the climax. The observatory's "timeless atmosphere" is invoked at closure as "a bridge between her grief and her purpose." However, the setting does not pressure a choice—Elara does not navigate spatial constraints or resource scarcity to act. The location enables the mystical event but does not alter her tactics with visible cost. Essential across beats and present at closure, but lacks the causal constraint needed for higher bands, scoring mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After hitting rock bottom" is not explicitly stated but implied through "The loss of her husband…had left her hollow" and her subdued, repetitive routine. The timeframe is setup in the opening beat. However, the story does not track time tightly or show a deadline that tightens decisions. Elara's transformation occurs "one evening" without urgency; she could have continued her routine indefinitely. The ending's "renewed determination" suggests a shift but does not dramatize time pressure or a ticking clock. Present in context but does not constrain choices or tactics. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To teach withering to bloom again" is introduced in the third paragraph as the implicit purpose of the origami coordinates and explicitly whispered at the end. The motivation frames Elara's actions (crafting mourning bands, visiting decay sites) and reappears in the pendant design. However, the friction between this want and a competing cost is not dramatized; Elara does not face a trade-off where pursuing bloom forecloses another path on the page. The motivation is told more than it is tested under pressure. It shapes the arc and charges the final image, scoring in the high-5s, but lacks the visible conflict needed for 7+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Subdued ardor" is signaled in the opening line ("her hands…now moved with a subdued ardor") and modulates through the story: quiet grief, curiosity at the curtains, startlement at the glow, and "renewed determination" at closure. The tone remains coherent and supports the atmosphere of restrained yearning. However, it does not intensify sharply under peak pressure; the climax is awe-tinged but still measured. The final paragraph's "soft and steady" light mirrors the opening's subdued quality, creating a lyric reprise. The tone charges the final image but does not vary dynamically enough to reach the indispensable band. Solidly integrated across beats and ending, scoring low-6s.</comment>
