<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation ("translate isolation into independence") is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her internal state remains abstract—"brittle determination" and "reincarnation memory" function as labels without embodied conflict or micro-choices that foreclose options. The orb integration at the climax feels passive; she receives visions and power rather than making a choice that reveals her hierarchy of values under pressure. Therapy-speak ("coexist," "embodiment," "bridge between the extinct and the eternal") in the final beats replaces on-page emotional cost with meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Elena is, her lineage connection, and the library's mechanics arrive as exposition rather than anchored cues, penalized −0.4 in Q2. The closure involves Elena receiving power from the orb and understanding her role, but the decision or renunciation that forecloses a path is absent; she is granted transformation rather than earning it through a visible choice. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (building atmosphere and layered world detail toward a final reweighting), but the cost at closure is conceptual only—"she was its embodiment"—without a felt price or forfeited option on the page. The stone circle's mechanics and the sundial's unlocking function arrive late without prior constraint shaping her tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tidal library setting supplies vivid, layered imagery—moss-covered stones, clouds, brass mechanisms, shifting shelves—and the library "testing her worthiness" adds mild atmospheric pressure. The brass sundial unlocks the stone door, a functional use that constrains one choice. However, the environment does not narrow tactics or force trade-offs at the closure; it provides stage dressing for Elena's ascent and descent. Spatial choreography is clear; sensory detail is filtered through Elena's perception, though the final beats lean on abstraction ("every fiber of her being") rather than concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled but remains abstract throughout. Elena's journey into the library and interaction with the orb face no opposition or reversal; the door opens, the visions arrive, the power integrates without friction. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; the resolution is delivered by the orb's visions rather than protagonist agency. The hum and the stone circle function as quest markers, not obstacles that test commitment or force a price. No visible cost is legible at closure—Elena smiles, empowered, with no path foreclosed or resource spent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of bridging extinction and continuity emerges from the Theraliths-as-stones conceit, but the final paragraph ("no longer just a guardian of knowledge; she was its embodiment, a bridge between the extinct and the eternal") states the thesis rather than allowing it to resonate through image or action. The brass sundial and stone circle function as symbolic keys but do not accumulate pressure or reweight prior material with cost. "Coexist" and "translate isolation into independence" remain prompt labels rather than insights earned through specific struggle. The orb's visions deliver wisdom, avoiding ambiguity or complexity in favor of a tidy revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elena, but psychic distance fluctuates—"she understood now" and "she was no longer just a guardian" read as external summary rather than interior realization. Diction drifts into elevated, semi-abstract register ("atomically reflective," "brittle awakenings," "harmonious melody," "embodiment") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("she felt a surge," "seemed to echo") without voice motivation. Perceptual signature is generic—Elena notices moss, clouds, and carvings, but her way of noticing does not reveal biased priorities or a distinct idiom. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines: "brittle determination" / "brittle awakenings" / "brittle light"; "hum" / "humming" / "hum growing louder" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle section—"She stepped away," "She paused," "She approached," "She placed"—flattens propulsion, triggering −0.4. Stock metaphors: "clouds swirled like a restless sea," "library was alive," "world around her dissolved." Register drift into quasi-technical diction ("atomically reflective," "celestial tides") clashes with the fantasy frame. The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns—"embodiment," "bridge," "beacon," "promise"—that obscure concrete closure. Artifacts touch the closure beat, applying −0.6 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—floating library, extinct species guardianship, reincarnation memory, magical orb—assembles familiar fantasy quest elements without transformation. The tidal library's mechanics (shelves shift with tides) and the Theraliths-become-stones conceit are described but not integral to choice or cost. The sundial-as-key and stone-circle-as-power-source follow template logic: hero descends, unlocks door, receives visions, gains power, ascends empowered. Emotional truth is replaced by abstract epiphany; no friction between wants and costs generates surprise. The transformation test fails—swap names and setting, the arc remains unchanged. Proximity to "chosen one receives ancient power" templates lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elena's status as "contemporary of extinct species" (Theraliths guardian lineage) is established early but functions as backstory flavor rather than driving choices. The trait does not constrain or enable on-page decisions; it contextualizes her scholarship and the reincarnation memory but does not create a turn or trade-off. Present across beats as context, but swappable—any lineage or expertise could justify her presence. No closure participation; the trait does not reweight the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The brass sundial appears in the opening (early signal +0.3), is used once to unlock the stone door (one beat +0.4), and returns in the final line to reflect light as a "beacon" (lyric reprise +0.3). Its "atomically reflective surface" aligns with door carvings, a specific function (+0.4). However, it does not constrain earlier choices or impose a cost; it is a passive key. The final reprise is decorative—reflecting light does not reweight prior stakes. Two gates met (setup, payoff), but no middle development, capping at 6.0; swappability and ornamental final use lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" appears as a repeated phrase—"brittle determination," "brittle awakenings," "brittle light"—but remains thematic label rather than on-page concept that shapes stakes. It does not narrow options or impose a visible constraint. The reincarnation memory (one instance of "awakening") triggers her descent, a weak causal link (+0.4). The concept is present in closure vocabulary ("brittle awakenings and the promise of coexistence") but as summary, not dramatized choice. Ornamental use −0.5, late first clear appearance (second third) −0.3, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Atomically reflective" describes the sundial's surface twice—opening and door-unlocking—but the trait is label-only. The alignment with carvings does not depend on atomic reflectivity; any mirrored or inscribed surface could serve. No cost or constraint tied to this specific attribute. Present but ornamental −0.8, swappability −0.6, no closure participation −0.7 (cap 2.8 applied). Static description without action pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Coexist" is the stated goal (Elena's role is "to coexist with their legacy") and appears in the final line as thematic summary. It does not drive a choice or create a turn; the orb grants her integration without friction or trade-off. The concept shapes motivation abstractly but does not narrow tactics or impose visible cost on the page. Present in closure vocabulary (+0.7), but swappable with "integrate," "harmonize," "unite" (−0.6). No middle beat where coexistence is tested or refused. Introduced after 40% mark as explicit goal, capping at 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The hum is introduced early (Elena "had begun to hear" it), signals the stone circle's location, and guides her descent (setup +0.3, one beat +0.4). The hum crescendos at the orb ("growing louder, more insistent"), functioning as atmospheric pressure (+0.5). It transforms into "harmonious melody" at closure, a reprise that reweights her integration (+0.7). However, the hum's mechanics do not constrain choice—it is a beacon, not a challenge. All three gates met (setup, development, payoff), eligible for ≥6.1; causal pressure is mild (guides rather than forces), and specificity is modest (any mystical signal could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tidal library is established early with vivid detail—floating island, shifting shelves, brass mechanisms, clouds below—and frames the entire journey (setup +0.8). The library "tests her worthiness" and reacts to her presence (mild pressure +0.5), and the shelves "rearrange themselves to accommodate the new balance" at closure, a functional response (+0.7). The library supplies the stone circle and door (two beats +0.9). However, the setting does not impose a meaningful constraint or force a trade-off; it provides atmosphere and stage. Specificity is strong, but swappability is moderate—any mystical repository could serve the arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the reincarnation memory" frames the inciting motivation—fragments surfaced, awakening her determination—but the timeframe is vague. No ticking clock or time-sensitive pressure shapes decisions; Elena's descent and integration occur at leisure. The memory is mentioned in backstory and does not return to constrain later choices. Present in setup (+0.3), but no middle or closure participation, capping at 4.6. Summary-only use −0.6, no time-based escalation −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To translate isolation into independence" is stated early as Elena's motivation and echoed at closure ("one where isolation could be transformed into independence"). The desire does not face friction or a competing want on the page; the orb grants independence without cost or sacrifice. No on-page choice tests this motivation; it remains an abstract goal rather than a dramatized conflict. Present in setup and payoff (two gates), but no middle development where isolation is challenged, capping at 6.0. Told rather than shown in choices −0.8, swappability (any self-actualization frame could replace it) −0.4.</comment>
