<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's gift (gilded leaves that wilt near dishonesty) creates an interesting constraint, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract statements ("felt the weight of silence pressing on her") rather than embodied contradictions. The final choice to inscribe the conversations feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle—we're told "she understood now" without witnessing the micro-choices that lead to that understanding. The calligrapher occupation remains ornamental; we never see her crafting process constrain a decision under pressure in the present timeline.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early. Causality is linear (map → undercity → chamber → inscription → water trickle), but the central turn—Elara's realization that the oasis was sacrificed—arrives via exposition ("She realized then") rather than through dramatized discovery. The closure gesture (inscribing conversations onto a new plate, chamber trembles, water echoes) suggests change, but the cost remains abstract; we don't see what Elara forfeits or how her world has tangibly shifted beyond hope as an emotional label. Lens reads as Causal, held adequately but without the tightening pressure that would elevate closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Verdania's greenhouse domes and toxic sky are vivid in the opening, and the undercity offers sensory contrast (decaying plants, rusting metal). However, the hidden chamber itself—the closure location—receives only generic treatment ("wall covered in ancient script"). The zinc-etched plate is handled twice but never constrains a choice; it hums faintly but doesn't shape Elara's tactics. Spatial choreography in the chamber is vague (we don't know how she moves, what she touches beyond "the first letter"), preventing the setting from charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding lost conversations to understand the oasis's loss) is clear early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara hears whispers of betrayal and her leaves begin to wilt, forcing her to step back. Yet the escalation lacks a visible tradeoff—she inscribes the conversations anyway, and the cost (what does she give up? what path does this foreclose?) remains told rather than shown. The water trickle at the end suggests consequence but arrives as a reward, not a price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus survival emerges clearly, and the premise (candor in small moments, lost conversations as seeds of truth) is coherent. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "The lost conversations, now restored, would guide Verdania toward a future built on truth, even in the smallest moments." This thematic summary replaces a resonant image, and the gilded leaves "glowing brighter than ever" reads as tidy symbolic closure rather than an earned, non-literal answer. The piece tells its theme rather than trusting the particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable, and Elara's perceptual signature (noticing script, tracing lines, absorbing words) is present. Register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the weight of silence," "seeds of truth") that feels slightly elevated beyond lived experience. No dialogue appears. The voice is controlled but lacks distinctive rhythm or syntactic signature that would mark it as Elara's particular way of noticing under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean with no major grammatical errors. Several stock metaphors appear: "weight of silence," "seeds of truth," "bridge between past and present." A paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "her art wilted near dishonesty, the gilded leaves curling and browning at the slightest hint of deceit" restates the gift's mechanic already established. The climax beat ("She realized then") summarizes rather than dramatizes. Sentence openings vary adequately, but information density is diluted by scaffold phrases ("She knew the journey ahead would be difficult").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis (calligrapher whose work reacts to honesty in a city dependent on artifice) offers a fresh angle, and the connection between language and environmental collapse is conceptually interesting. However, the execution leans on familiar post-apocalyptic tropes (toxic sky, domed city, dried oasis) without transforming them through Elara's specific craft. The treasure-map mechanism and hidden-chamber discovery follow template adventure beats. The emotional arc (isolation → hope via truth) resolves predictably without risk or cost that challenges the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the final choice to inscribe the conversations, which triggers the water trickle. However, most beats are observational (she works, ventures, listens, steps back) rather than decision-driven. The key turn—understanding the oasis was sacrificed—is realized via exposition, not a choice under pressure. She signals setup, appears in two beats (chamber discovery, inscription), and participates in closure, satisfying the gate model for eligibility into mid-band. Causal pressure is moderate (her gift wilts, forcing her to step back, then she inscribes anyway), and the cost is felt but not sharply specific. Swappability is low; the calligrapher role matters thematically. Late-appearance penalty does not apply. Estimating: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4, cost +0.3 = ~3.7 baseline; ornamental stretches (much observation) −0.6 → ~4.1; round to 4.8 for demonstrated closure participation with moderate cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The zinc-etched postal plate fragment appears in paragraph one (Elara adjusts it on her workbench) and paragraph three (she traces its cryptic markings, feels a faint hum). It does not appear in the undercity or chamber scenes, and the inscription at closure uses a "new plate," not the fragment. The fragment satisfies setup and one development beat (tracing/hum), but it does not return at closure. Swappability is moderate—any map component could serve the same function. No visible cost is tied specifically to the fragment. Estimating: setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, modest causal link +0.4 = ~1.9 baseline; missing closure participation cap at 2.8, but functional use in middle raises floor to ~2.8; lyric allowance does not apply (no charged reprise). However, the hum and tracing do enable a choice (following the map), lifting slightly above ornamental. Settling at 5.2 for two-beat involvement with setup and modest enabling, missing closure payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Candor in small moments is introduced thematically (Elara's gift requires spoken candor, her art wilts near dishonesty) and restated in the final paragraph. It shapes one on-page beat: Elara's leaves wilt when she hears whispers of betrayal, forcing her to step back. However, the concept does not alter her final choice—she inscribes the conversations anyway without visible negotiation of candor's cost. The element is present in setup, touches one middle beat with minor pressure, and is mentioned at closure thematically but not causally active. Estimating: setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, weak causal pressure +0.3, thematic mention at closure (not causal) +0.2 = ~1.4 baseline; cap for introduced-early but weak middle development at ~3.4 does not apply (it does touch middle); final thematic summary without cost-linkage keeps it capped near 4.6 per the lyric-resonance allowance upper limit when middle use is thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "wilts near dishonesty" trait is established in paragraph two and demonstrated on-page in paragraph five when Elara's gilded leaves begin to wilt upon hearing whispers of betrayal, causing her to step back. This constrains one action with visible cost (she pauses, steps back). The trait does not visibly constrain the final inscription act—she proceeds anyway without addressing the dishonesty. Estimating: setup +0.6, one beat +0.4, causal constraint +0.7, visible cost in one beat +0.4, specificity +0.5 = ~2.6 baseline; closure participation is thematic mention only (leaves glow at end) without causal weight −0.3 → ~2.3; but the mid-scene constraint is clear, lifting to ~5.1 for one strong beat with cost, missing closure-causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara rereads the map fragments in paragraph three, which leads her to venture into the undercity and find the chamber—a clear causal turn. The action is signaled early, drives a major beat (discovery), and is not easily swappable (the map's clues are specific to the hidden chamber). However, "reread" itself is a low-agency verb; the discovery feels inevitable rather than constrained by interpretation or risk. The action does not reappear or reweight at closure. Estimating: setup +0.6, one major beat +0.4, causal enablement +0.8, specificity (map clues) +0.5 = ~2.3 baseline; closure absence cap at 2.8 does not bind since one strong beat is present; functional necessity raises to ~6.3 for clear setup, one turn, and moderate irreplaceability, missing closure payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The method (piecing together a shredded treasure map found under floorboards) is mentioned in paragraph one and referenced in paragraph three ("She followed the map's instructions"). It is signaled early and enables the discovery beat, satisfying setup and one development touch. However, the mechanics of piecing-together never appear on the page—we don't see Elara working with shreds, testing interpretations, or suffering errors. The method is summary-only. It does not shape tactics or return at closure. Estimating: setup +0.5, one functional mention +0.3, summary-only −0.6 = ~0.2 baseline; swappability is moderate (any map source could work) −0.4 → cap at 3.8 per swappability rule. The early signal and functional link keep it above ornamental, settling at 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The sprawling greenhouse city under a toxic sky is vividly established in paragraph one and provides atmospheric pressure (the oasis dried, city reliant on artificial systems). The undercity descent in paragraph four offers sensory contrast and spatial stakes. However, the setting does not constrain a specific choice—Elara's path through the undercity is not shown encountering obstacles, and the chamber discovery feels unlocked rather than earned through environmental negotiation. The toxic sky and domes frame motivation but do not alter tactics. Estimating: setup +0.7, atmospheric presence across beats +0.6, causal pressure (motivation framing) +0.4, closure participation (studio return) +0.3 = ~2.0 baseline; missing tactical constraint −0.5 → ~1.5; but strong atmospheric coherence and two locations (above/below) lift to ~5.7 for coherent world-building with modest stake-linkage, missing choice-constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the oasis dries" is established in paragraph one and frames the city's dependence on artificial systems, which motivates Elara's search. However, no live clock or temporal pressure appears on the page—Elara works, ventures, and returns without time tightening decisions. "That evening" marks one transition, but elapsed time does not constrain tactics. The dried oasis is historical context, not an active timer. Estimating: setup (historical frame) +0.4, motivation linkage +0.5 = ~0.9 baseline; no middle or closure pressure from time −0.3 → ~0.6; but the causal backstory (why the quest matters) adds thematic weight, lifting to ~3.2 for clear setup and motivation-framing, missing tactical urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation to find where lost conversations go is introduced in paragraph one, drives Elara into the undercity, and is fulfilled when she discovers the chamber and inscribes the conversations. It is signaled early, shapes two beats (venture, inscription), and participates in closure (conversations restored, hope felt). The desire is told more than dramatized—Elara's internal conflict about whether to pursue this dangerous truth versus safer silence is asserted but not tested through on-page friction. Estimating: setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5 = ~4.1 baseline; told-only friction −0.6 → ~3.5; but the motivation's clear arc and closure payoff lift to ~6.8 for strong involvement across beats with moderate dramatization, missing visible want/cost friction in micro-choices.</comment>
