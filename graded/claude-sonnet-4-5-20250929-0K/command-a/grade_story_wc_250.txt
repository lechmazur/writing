<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The guardian operates primarily through label-only interiority ("spiralingly calm," "silent empathy") rather than embodied contradiction. The stranger's emotional arc—from despair to hope—unfolds through summary ("they spoke of loss, of regret") without dramatized micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final lightening reads as declared rather than earned through on-page cost; we see no specific path foreclosed or concrete price paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (cobalt dock, twilight, guardian role). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: the shutter-weaving and mirror moments build texture toward the stranger's verbal release and subsequent hope. However, the closure—"their heart a little less heavy"—relies on assertion rather than a specific image or action that makes the cost undeniable. No on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a path; the stranger's departure is lighter by declaration, not dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, and twilight establish atmosphere early. The dental mirror catches light in "fragmented bursts" and reflects the stranger's potential self, giving the object spatial presence. The shutter patterns create a visual constellation but remain decorative—they do not constrain the stranger's choice or alter available options. The body and immediate tools are present but do not pressure the final decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—releasing a "half-spoken secret"—is signaled but never tested on the page. The stranger arrives burdened, sits, speaks (off-stage summary: "words tumbling out"), and leaves lighter without a visible trade-off or narrowed option. The guardian's task is complete by fiat; coincidence (the mirror's reflection, the completed pattern) delivers relief rather than protagonist agency driving a turn with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The central metaphor—"teach darkness the value of stars"—is stated outright and echoed in the final mirror-and-constellation image, flattening subtext into overt symbolism. The stranger's hope flickers because the text declares it, not because prior particulars build toward an earned insight. Thematic closure arrives through summary ("a reminder that even in their darkest moments, there was light") rather than a non-literal image that reweights the question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("spiralingly calm demeanor," "stillwater tension") that reads more authorial than character-rooted. The guardian's perceptual signature—stillness, mirror-work, shutter adjustment—is consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the stranger's single question and the guardian's silence carry subtext but do not advance plot through pursuit or evasion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "Their stillness was their strength" echoes "unobtrusive as the shadows," and "a little less heavy" / "shoulders lighter" restates the same relief. Template cadence in the final paragraph: three sentences begin with "The guardian [verb]" or "The stranger [verb]." Figurative density ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "canvas for pain") clusters without clear pattern-teaching or payoff. Stock metaphor: "words tumbling out like pebbles into a stream."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The guardian-as-silent-healer and the transformative reflection in a mirror are familiar tropes executed without a fresh inflection. The shutter-weaving mechanic is specific but ornamental—it does not alter the stranger's options or introduce a non-obvious complication. The emotional arc (burdened → unburdened) follows a median template; swapping the dock for a different locale or the mirror for another reflective object would leave the arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The guardian is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or narrows options. Observation and pattern-weaving occur; the stranger's relief is delivered by the guardian's presence rather than a choice with cost. Introduced early, appears at closure, but remains passive—setup and closure participation without middle development.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dental mirror appears in three beats: initial description (catches light), mid-scene tilt (reflects the stranger), and implied presence at closure (reflects stars). Its mechanics—reflection—are used twice but do not constrain a choice or impose cost. The mirror is a vessel for the thematic metaphor rather than a tool that shapes the stranger's decision. Swappable with any reflective surface.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Silent empathy is named in exposition ("their greatest skill") and demonstrated through the guardian's listening silence. It shapes the encounter's tone but does not force a trade-off or narrow the stranger's options on the page. The concept is present and consistent but functions as theme-claim rather than a stake-altering force. No visible cost tied to empathy itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" appears as a repeated label ("spiralingly calm demeanor," "unbroken") without dramatized constraint or enablement. The trait does not prevent an action the guardian wants to take or allow one that would otherwise fail. Ornamental descriptor; no on-page tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Weave" is enacted through shutter adjustment across multiple beats and completed before the stranger's departure. The action is specific but does not drive a reversal or test; the pattern's completion coincides with relief by temporal proximity, not causal linkage. Removing "weave" and substituting another quiet task would leave the arc largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Creating patterns with shutters is signaled early, developed mid-scene ("each shutter adjusted with precision," "adjusted the final shutter"), and completed at closure. The method is visible but does not constrain the stranger's choice or alter available tactics. The pattern "seemed to mimic the night sky," offering metaphoric resonance without mechanical consequence. Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The cobalt dock is anchored early (wooden planks, rain-slick surface, twilight glow, proximity to water and shutters). It supplies the stage for all action and its features—shutters, water's edge—enable the guardian's method. The dock does not pressure a choice (the stranger could arrive anywhere reflective) but its specificity charges the final constellation image. Setup, middle use, and closure presence; causal role is ambient rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "within the edge of a half-spoken secret" appears as a metaphor for the stranger's burden but does not track elapsed time or tighten decisions. The encounter unfolds in a single twilight scene with no clock pressure; the stranger's speech occurs off-page in summary. Time is static backdrop, not a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach darkness the value of stars" is stated early and drives the guardian's shutter-weaving and silent listening. It shapes the guardian's method but is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. The guardian completes the task without friction or sacrifice; motivation is present and consistent but unopposed. Setup and thematic closure presence without middle friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is named and sustained through the guardian's silence, the stranger's hesitation, and descriptors like "thick with stillwater tension." Tone is coherent and modulates slightly (anticipation → release) but remains a single static register. The final image—hope flickering, lighter shoulders—softens tension without charging it; the tone supports atmosphere but does not transform under pressure.</comment>
