<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular in places (tracing the compass, kinship with poles), but the motivation shifts between internal reflection and action without micro-choices that visibly constrain later beats. The "align heart and actions" goal remains abstract; we see her paddle away, but the choice doesn't foreclose a path with felt cost—she simply tucks the compass into her pack and continues. Embodied emotion appears ("chest pressed," "legs wobbling"), yet the peak moment of releasing the compass dependency reads more as summary relief than as contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "merrily melancholic smile" acknowledges complexity, but the smile itself is labeled rather than enacted through specific gesture or bodily contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the compass–poles contrast reweights the dominant stake through reflection and a final image. However, the closure effect reads as Charged Poise rather than Decisive Change—Mara smiles and paddles on, crystallizing her new stance—but the cost is implied rather than undeniably legible on the page; she merely stows the compass without a scene-level forfeit or visible trade-off at the ending beat. The causality is motivation-driven rather than because/therefore linked, which fits the lens, yet the final reconfiguration lacks the sharp price that would anchor a higher score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The coastal kayak launch, utility poles, and kayak are concretely rendered and filter through Mara's priorities ("scarred hull," "predictable spacing"). The poles constrain her navigation method and are present in the opening and middle, reweighting her reliance on the compass. The final image—poles shrinking as she paddles, sun climbing—charges the ending with spatial movement and environmental shift. Sensory detail is selective (salt, seaweed, waves) and integrated into action. The micro-setting (body, tool, water) functions as a constraint and closure anchor, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear: restore navigation confidence and find purpose beyond regret. Pressure accumulates through reflection on the compass failure and the poles as a lifeline, but the escalation is textural rather than causal tightening—no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a visible trade-off. The ending reconfigures her stance (she no longer needs the compass), yet the cost is conceptual ("backlash still lingered") without a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift in the final beat. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening consistent with the Accumulative lens, but the price remains implied rather than dramatized at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—adaptation over perfection, moving forward despite brokenness—emerges from the compass/poles contrast and Mara's reflective arc. The final image (paddling toward the horizon, "merrily melancholic smile") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. However, the theme statement "navigation wasn't about perfection but about adaptation" is close to articulated thesis, and the ending leans toward summary reassurance ("flicker of hope," "slowly aligning") rather than a charged particular that reweights prior material with sharp cost. Subtext operates in the poles' utilitarian kinship and the compass as symbol, yet the emotional resolution is more declarative than earned through a final image with bite.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is character-specific (Mara notices poles as "sentinels," feels "kinship" with utility objects), and the internal texture is consistent. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during reflection, wider during scene-setting). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("melancholic echo," "threshold between known and unknown") that feels slightly imposed rather than organically Mara's idiom under stress. Free indirect style is clean; tense and stance remain stable. The voice is distinct and purposeful, with minor slips in register that don't touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong, and sentence rhythm varies. However, multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear: "to align her heart and her actions, to find a purpose" restates the same goal; "as if mocking her" / "as if it could cleanse" repeats the hypothetical construction; "one stroke at a time" / "where she'd been... where she could go" / "past while embracing the future" cycle through summary reassurance with stock phrasing. Filter verbs ("felt," "glanced") cluster without clear voice motivation. The figurative load is dense in places ("relic of a life," "candle in the wind," "golden light") without pattern-teaching or payoff, and some images verge on stock. These artifacts touch the final paragraph ("merrily melancholic smile," "embracing the future"), lowering the score and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "broken navigator" premise and compass-as-symbol are familiar; the transformation through utility poles offers a modest fresh angle. Emotional specificity is present (kinship with poles, wobbling legs), yet the arc follows a well-worn recovery template: loss of tool → improvised method → restored confidence. The poles themselves are a specific, non-obvious detail, but the thematic payoff ("adaptation over perfection") is close to articulated rather than earned through irreversible particulars. No bold structural risk or unconventional choice heightens stakes; the piece executes competently within genre but does not surprise or transform the template into something indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "broken navigator" trait is signaled early (compass failure, stranded physically/emotionally) and frames her reflective stance throughout. Mara's decision to paddle away and stow the compass occurs on the page at closure, altering her reliance, but the choice is more a confirmation of prior reflection than a turn that narrows options with visible cost. The trait is present in beats (compass handling, pole navigation, final paddle) and shapes the ending, but the final act is more symbolic release than a decision with tactical consequence. Setup, development (poles as method), and payoff (stowing compass) are all present, satisfying two-of-three gates and enabling mid-band scoring. Causal pressure is moderate; the trait constrains perception but not action with sharp trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The astronomical compass is handled in the opening (tracing, needle spinning) and at closure (glanced, tucked into pack). Its failure is the inciting condition, and the final act of stowing it marks a symbolic shift. However, the compass does not constrain a middle choice or enable a tactic under pressure—it is a passive symbol of loss rather than an active tool whose mechanics matter. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is absent. The reprise reweights meaning (she no longer needs it) with cost implied (forgoing the old method), but the cost is conceptual rather than visible in action. Early signal, two beats, closure linkage, but swappability (any failed tool could serve) and lack of middle causal involvement limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Backlash of regrets" is mentioned explicitly ("backlash of regrets that haunted her," "still lingered") and frames her emotional state throughout. It shapes the dominant stake (find purpose beyond regret) and is referenced at closure ("no longer defined her"), but it remains thematic rather than a tactical constraint that alters on-page choices. The concept does not narrow options in a middle beat or force a visible trade-off; it is a label for her condition rather than a mechanism that changes action. Setup, thematic presence, and payoff are all on the page, satisfying gates for mid-band eligibility, but the lack of causal pressure and the reliance on summary ("learning to move with it") keep the score below functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Merrily melancholic" appears as a label in the final paragraph ("merrily melancholic smile") and is implied earlier ("waves lapped merrily," "melancholic echo"), but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The trait describes tone rather than a character attribute that alters choice. The smile at closure acknowledges complexity, yet the duality is asserted rather than enacted through contradictory impulses in scene. Setup is weak (thematic seeding only), development is absent, and payoff is label-only. The attribute is ornamental, mentioned at closure but not integrated into the causal chain or choice mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Gravitate" appears once ("felt herself gravitate toward the water") as a metaphor for attraction rather than a discrete action that drives a turn. The verb is close to "move toward," which describes her entire arc (paddling out), but "gravitate" itself does not frame a beat or redefine options. The word is ornamental—easily swappable with "move" or "drift"—and does not return or accumulate pressure. Setup is present (mid-story mention), but no development or payoff; the action does not constrain middle tactics or shape the ending image. Late appearance (~50% mark), summary-only use, and high swappability cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Navigating by utility poles" is signaled early ("begun navigating by them," "using their predictable spacing") and described as her lifeline method, shaping her tactics after compass failure. The poles are mentioned again at closure ("grew smaller, their presence fading"), marking her departure from reliance on them. However, the mechanics of the method are never dramatized in scene—we do not see her use pole spacing to make a choice or adjust course under pressure. Setup and payoff are present; middle causal involvement is absent. The method shapes context but not a visible beat, and it is easily swappable with any navigation aid (stars, landmarks). Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is weak (fading presence rather than active choice).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The coastal kayak launch is anchored early ("sat at the edge," "carried her kayak to the water's edge") and is described as "a place of beginnings and endings, a threshold." It provides the physical stage for her departure and is referenced at closure ("behind her now"). The launch supplies the resource (access to water) that enables her final action (paddling out), and the spatial movement from shore to open water charges the ending. Setup, development (she pushes off), and payoff (launch left behind) are all present. The setting constrains her action (she must leave the shore to move forward) and contributes to the final image, but it is a functional stage rather than a micro-setting whose particulars alter tactics. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is clear.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"When expectations collapse" is implied thematically (compass failure, misjudgments) but not tracked as a live clock or temporal anchor that tightens decisions. The timeframe is backstory context ("after a series of misjudgments") rather than an on-page event that narrows options. The piece operates in a single present scene (dawn to paddling out) without urgency or countdown; the collapsed expectations are a condition rather than a moment. The phrase does not appear on the page, and the concept does not shape tactics in the middle or at closure. Setup is weak (implied only), development and payoff are absent. The timeframe is ornamental, a thematic label without causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To align heart and action" is stated explicitly ("to align her heart and her actions") and frames her motivation throughout. The goal shapes her reflective stance and is referenced at closure ("her heart and her actions slowly aligning, one stroke at a time"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted on-page choices—we do not see her want clash with fear or need in a beat that costs her something visible. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is weak (reflection rather than friction). The motivation is present across beats but lacks the causal pressure and visible trade-off needed for higher integration. Closure linkage is strong, but the cost is conceptual rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Flickering faith" is implied throughout ("faith flickering like a candle in the wind," "flicker of hope") and modulates with pressure: doubt in the opening, tentative hope at closure. The tone is coherent and charges the final image (small spark keeping her going). However, the metaphor is stock ("candle in the wind"), and the tone is more labeled than enacted through sentence rhythm or image specificity under stress. Setup, development (tone shifts with reflection), and payoff (hope rekindles) are all present. The tone supports the arc without contradiction, but it does not constrain a choice or create a felt cost at closure. Causal pressure is low; closure linkage is moderate (tonal payoff via summary).</comment>
