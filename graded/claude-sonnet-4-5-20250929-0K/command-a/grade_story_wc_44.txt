<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but interiority remains largely abstract ("quietly deliberate" is told repeatedly rather than shown through contradictory impulses). The final choice—activating the key—feels mechanically executed without embodied emotion or visible internal conflict during the climactic moment. Her mentor's disappearance provides backstory weight, but no on-page micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The workshop scene shows some embodied connection (fingers brushing the automaton), but peak beats lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive adequately (floating isle, observatory, Elara) within the opening. The closure—shadows absorbed by a void during sealed awakenings—occurs on the page, but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; the key "felt heavy" is the sole gesture toward price, and no live option is visibly foreclosed. The piece reads as Causal with some Accumulative layering (runes returning, loops closing), but the escalation is more procedural than pressure-driven. One meaningful tightening occurs (the void opens at noon), yet the final image does not reconfigure prior stakes with undeniable felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The floating isle, observatory, and workshop are anchored early with sensory specificity (star-charted ceiling, brass runes pulsing under moonlight, half-finished automaton). The setting shapes one key choice: Elara returns to the workshop to close the first loop, and the precipice at noon provides the stage for the void encounter. However, neither location constrains tactics with visible cost—Elara moves through them without spatial friction or environmental pressure altering her options. The micro-setting (the key in her pocket) recurs but functions more as talisman than constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when the void opens at the precipice, but the escalation is more procedural (relearn runes, activate key) than pressured by agency or trade-off. The key's activation resolves the mystery without dramatized cost or a live option foreclosed; Elara watches "in awe" rather than enduring visible sacrifice or choice under duress. The next awakening is "imminent" but never tests Elara's commitment with a competing good or unavoidable harm.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of rediscovery and loop-closing emerges through action (workshop return, rune relearning), but the final image—"her quiet deliberation guiding her every step"—feels like a thematic summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The mystery of shadows at noon is answered too literally ("absorbed by a void"), leaving little conceptual friction or ambiguity. The clockwork key and sealed awakenings remain more decorative than thematically charged; the piece gestures toward cycles and memory but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara with consistent distance. Voice carries some specificity ("spoons bent reality," "sealed awakenings"), but under pressure the prose flattens into summary ("she felt a surge of energy," "watched in awe"). Perceptual signature is present (runes "like echoes of a forgotten song") yet not character-particular enough to distinguish Elara's noticing from generic scholarly observation. No dialogue to evaluate. Peak beats rely on filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "realized") that dull immediacy when a more embodied register would sharpen the moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean, with no major loops or artifacts. However, runs of identical sentence stems in the opening ("Elara's fingers traced… This key… Her motivation… Elara's approach…") create template cadence that slightly dulls momentum (−0.4). Information density is adequate but not high; several beats paraphrase without added pressure ("the key in her pocket glowed brighter, as if approving her progress" restates prior content). The final paragraph summarizes rather than charging the image with concrete sensory weight. Overall functional but lacking the propulsion and texture required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—floating observatory, rune scholar, clockwork key, sealed awakenings—assembles familiar fantasy elements without a fresh synthesis. "Where shadows go at noon" offers a poetic question, but the answer (void that opens during awakenings) resolves it literally rather than through non-obvious moral or conceptual calculus. The "closing loops" method and mentor's disappearance evoke stock mentorship tropes. No bold structural or perspectival risk-taking; the piece follows a predictable scholar-quest template. Emotional specificity and lived detail are present but insufficient to transform the derivative frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes two key choices: returning to the workshop and activating the key at the precipice. However, these decisions feel procedural rather than pressured by competing goods or visible trade-offs. The character is signaled early and participates in closure, but her agency does not demonstrably narrow options or impose felt cost—she succeeds without sacrifice. Score reflects functional involvement across beats but lacks causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The clockwork key appears in the opening (early signal), recurs across multiple beats (workshop resonance, pocket mentions, activation at precipice), and is instrumental in the closure (activates to reveal the void). It is handled on the page and its glow changes state to signal progress. However, its use feels mechanical rather than tied to visible cost or constraint—Elara activates it without struggle or trade-off. The key shapes two beats and the ending but lacks the specificity and irreplaceability required for higher bands; a similar relic could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Sealed awakenings" are named early and framed as the premise (dormant magic surging, reshaping the world). The concept shapes Elara's research motivation and the timing of the void's appearance ("the next awakening was imminent"). However, it functions more as background lore than on-page constraint—no dramatized awakening alters Elara's tactics or imposes visible cost. The void opening at noon is tied to the concept, granting middle involvement, but the concept remains largely ornamental rather than mechanically essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" is stated multiple times ("Elara's approach was quietly deliberate," "her quiet deliberation guiding her every step") but shown minimally through action. The workshop scene demonstrates precision ("every stroke was precise"), and "slow" relearning implies deliberation, but no on-page moment dramatizes a trade-off where haste would have been easier or where deliberation imposed visible cost. The trait is present and consistent but functions more as label than constraint, capping the score in the lower-mid functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Relearn" is signaled early (runes faded from memory) and structures the middle (workshop scene, etching copper plates, runes returning "like echoes"). The action drives two beats and primes the key's activation at closure. However, the relearning process is summarized rather than dramatized with struggle or trade-off—Elara's "deliberate nature ensured every stroke was precise" by dawn, with no friction or cost. The action is essential to the plot but executed procedurally, limiting elevation into higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Closing loops" is named early as the method required to relearn runes. The workshop visit is framed explicitly as "the first loop" and the precipice as "the next loop," granting setup and middle involvement. The method shapes Elara's tactics (return to past places) and is referenced at closure ("With the loops closed"). However, the mechanics remain abstract—what constitutes a "loop" and how closure occurs are not dramatized with specificity or visible cost. Functional involvement across beats but the method is somewhat swappable with "retrace steps" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is anchored early with vivid detail (star-charted ceiling, enchanted tethers, dusty tomes). The setting supplies two key locations: the workshop for relearning and the precipice for the void encounter. The isle's lower drift and straining tethers add atmospheric pressure but do not constrain Elara's choices with visible cost. The setting frames the story and participates in closure (precipice stage), but it functions more as backdrop than tactical constraint. Solid middle involvement without higher causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After spoons bend reality" appears once as backstory flavor ("a time when spoons bent reality") but does not shape on-page stakes, tactics, or closure. The phrase is decorative worldbuilding without causal role or reweighting at the ending. The actual timeframe (tonight, dawn, noon) is tracked and shapes the void's appearance, but that is independent of the "spoons" element. The required element is effectively absent from the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To find where shadows go at noon" is stated early as Elara's singular motivation and drives her research and the precipice scene. The mystery is resolved on the page (shadows absorbed by the void), granting closure participation. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized with friction between want and cost—Elara pursues it without visible sacrifice or competing pressure. The motivation shapes the story's direction and ending but lacks embodied conflict or trade-off, placing it in the mid-functional band.</comment>
