<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to unravel the ghost's code is declared but never tested by meaningful friction or cost. Her transformation from musician to "conduit" feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses or sacrifice. The ghost functions as external guide rather than internal conflict, leaving Clara reactive throughout. Embodied emotion is largely absent; we get "breath caught" and "surge of inspiration" but no visceral contradiction that would make the final communion feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal lens (Clara finds program → decodes melody → summons ghost → achieves closure) but the final beat dissolves into pure atmosphere without visible cost. The program "fully dissolved" and the ghost "vanished" read as clean resolution rather than Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. Orientation is clear early (flooded opera house, Clara, present moment). The escalation from discovery to humming to connection follows because/therefore logic, but the ending offers emotional satisfaction without foreclosing a path or charging the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is vividly anchored with water, silt, flickering lanterns, and stage geography. The antique program constrains Clara's discovery and the water itself becomes instrumental (damage creating images). However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than forcing tactical choices; Clara moves freely without environmental resistance. The final beat where "water began to ripple in time with the melody" gestures toward setting-as-participant but arrives too late to shape prior pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling the ghost's code—is signaled early but never genuinely threatened. Clara encounters no wrong turns, no cost for her immersion, no trade-off between her identity as musician and her role as medium. The melody is "oddly familiar" and "somehow knew," eliminating discovery friction. The single tightening (ghost appears, Clara hums, connection achieved) proceeds without reversal or price. Coincidence governs: the water stains form notes, the ghost responds on c 
cue, and the program dissolves only after its purpose is served.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "in between spaces" motif recurs (gaps between notes, threshold, liminal) but trends toward label rather than constraint. Theme of music-as-bridge and silence-as-vessel emerges through imagery, yet the final paragraph moralizes: "she had finally found her place in the in between spaces, where music and memory intertwined." The ghost's "gift" and "closure" are stated rather than enacted through a charged image. The ending offers thematic summary in place of resonant ambiguity, and the "wordless conversation" remains asserted rather than dramatized through silence or gap.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with controlled psychic distance. Diction occasionally inflates ("inexplicable pull," "profound sense of peace") but remains mostly grounded in Clara's perceptual filter. The phrase "lately inspired" and "as if the music itself had been trapped" use filter constructions that suit the dreamy register. However, voice lacks strong perceptual signature—Clara's noticing (water, program, ghost) reads generically rather than musician-specific. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are not applicable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "The flooded opera house was not just a ruin; it was a threshold, a liminal space where the past and present collided" restates the prior paragraph's "in between spaces" claim without added pressure. Template cadence in the opening: "She picked it up… and noticed… It was as if…" Figurative density is high but mixed: "hush of unstruck chords" is evocative, but "water damage creating images" as both literal and metaphoric device muddies clarity. The final two paragraphs summarize emotional resolution rather than dramatizing it, applying −0.6 for scaffold and loop, −0.3 for closure-beat summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The haunted-opera-house premise and ghost-composer-seeking-closure are familiar templates executed without fresh inflection. The water-stain-as-sheet-music device is the sole inventive detail, but it arrives and resolves in two beats without complication. Clara's arc (musician discovers ghost, completes ghost's work, finds peace) follows a median path with no risk or counter-pressure. The story could function identically in a different flooded venue with a different artist, signaling high swappability. No bold structural or emotional choices elevate the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Clara is present throughout and her choice to hum the melody triggers the climax, satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, her role is reactive—she follows the program's cues and the ghost's guidance rather than making a trade-off or forcing a turn through internal conflict. Her occupation as "orchestra pit musician" flavors her perception but does not constrain her choices or enable unique tactics; any artist could fulfill this function. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, but high swappability −0.8, minimal causal pressure −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The antique opera program is handled in three beats: discovery, pattern-tracing, vibration/dissolution. It seeds the central mystery, delivers the melody, and dissolves at closure, satisfying all three gates. The object's state change (disintegrating, vibrating, fully dissolved) tracks causally and its final disappearance coincides with closure. However, the program does not constrain Clara's choices—she never risks misreading it or losing it prematurely—and its "secrets revealed" conclusion is told rather than shown. Early +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but ornamental handling (no tactical friction) −0.7, summary payoff −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"In between spaces" is named repeatedly (gaps between notes, pauses between acts, threshold, liminal space) but functions as thematic echo rather than on-page constraint. The concept does not narrow Clara's options or shape her tactics; she moves freely through the flooded house. The phrase is present in setup and payoff (final paragraph: "found her place in the in between spaces") but absent from the middle choice-making. Two gates only (setup + payoff) cap at ~6.0, but label-only use −0.3, no causal pressure −0.8, lyric reprise attempts lift +0.3 but cannot exceed swappability ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Lately inspired" appears once in the opening sentence and never recurs or alters Clara's behavior. The trait does not constrain a choice, enable a tactic, or impose cost. It reads as label-only setup without development or payoff. Present but ornamental, missing middle and closure gates cap at 2.8, with label-only −0.3, no causal link −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Disrupt" governs the ghost's coded program ("disrupt the silence and reveal something hidden") and Clara's humming that lifts "the hush of unstruck chords." The action is signaled in setup, enacted in the climax (Clara hums, silence lifts), and resolved at closure (silence replaced by resonance). However, the disruption is cooperative rather than conflictual—Clara faces no resistance or cost in breaking the silence. All three gates present, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but no friction or trade-off −0.6, summary resolution −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Water damage creating images is introduced early (program's water stains form patterns), recurs in the middle (patterns resemble musical notes), and culminates at closure (patterns shift to form sheet music as Clara hums). The method is specific and its mechanics—water and decay as compositional instruments—are signaled and repeated. However, the transformation is passive (Clara observes rather than manipulates) and the final shift is told ("began to shift, forming new patterns") rather than shown. All three gates, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, specificity +0.5, but passive use −0.6, summary climax −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is anchored early with water, silt, orchestra pit, stage, and flickering lanterns. The water provides the medium for the ghost's code (damage creating images) and responds to Clara's melody (rippling in time). The setting is present in all three gates and supplies the causal mechanism for both discovery and resolution. The lanterns brighten at the climax, reinforcing the environmental response. Early +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but the space does not force Clara to adapt tactics or choose between paths −0.5, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Amid the hush of unstruck chords" evokes stasis and suspension but does not function as timeframe. The narrative unfolds in continuous present with no clock, deadline, or temporal pressure. The phrase recurs once ("hush of unstruck chords seemed to lift") as atmospheric marker rather than constraint. Setup only, missing middle development and closure participation cap at 4.6, ornamental use −0.5, no temporal stakes −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to unravel the ghost's code is declared early ("Her motivation was clear"), drives her actions (tracing patterns, humming melody), and is fulfilled at closure (ghost vanishes, code revealed). All three gates are present. However, the desire is never tested by friction or cost—Clara encounters no wrong paths, no sacrifice, no competing want. The motivation proceeds unopposed from inception to satisfaction. Early +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but no conflicted choice −0.8, told rather than shown ("Her motivation was clear") −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Wordless conversation" is named twice (program "trying to communicate," ghost "guiding her hand"; later "wordless conversation that transcended words") and governs the story's register of silent communion. The tone is sustained through Clara's non-verbal interaction with program and ghost and modulates at closure (connection achieved, peace). However, "wordless" is asserted more than enacted—dialogue is absent, but so is charged silence or gap that would embody the concept. Setup and payoff present but middle development weak, two gates cap ~6.0, label-only in key beats −0.3, static mood until climax −0.4.</comment>
