<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lira's motivation (to share light without using fire) is clearly rooted in a childhood trauma and drives her present action. However, the character lacks meaningful internal contradiction—her calm focus on polishing never wavers, and no competing impulse tests her commitment. The final walk to the village feels like fulfillment rather than a choice with visible cost. The backstory exceeds ~30% of the text but remains anchored to present stimuli (the sea glass, the grotto's mist) and interleaves with micro-choices (beginning to polish, holding the glass up), so BRR does not cap here.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory density and memory fragments around the polishing ritual, culminating in the sea glass glowing and Lira stepping out. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image of her walking with glowing glass crystallizes her readiness to share light. However, the cost is implied rather than legible on the page: no visible trade-off, forfeiture, or consequence accompanies her departure. The orientation is adequate (grotto, Lira, sea glass by ~100 words), but the causality is thin—polishing simply succeeds, and the village arrival is asserted without obstacle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto with its luminescent moss and swirling mist is vividly rendered and sustains atmosphere throughout. The setting anchors the reflective tone and the sea glass's glow is amplified by moonlight, charging the final image. However, the grotto does not constrain a choice or alter Lira's tactics—she polishes undisturbed, and the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Spatial choreography is clear (grotto interior, then path to village).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and sustained. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Lira's options: the polishing proceeds smoothly, the glass glows as hoped, and she walks to the village without friction. Coincidence (moonlight arriving to amplify the glow) aids rather than complicates. The resolution lacks a felt trade-off; her peace and readiness are declared, not dramatized through a costly choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (light as gentle hope, healing through craft) emerges organically from Lira's polishing and her mother's quoted wisdom. The sea glass functions as a resonant object, reweighted from memory to present tool. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary—"zephyr bloom of her spirit" and "a quiet force in a world that needed her light" read as authorial assertion rather than earned image. The ending invites reflection, but the direct thematic claim weakens subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable, and the voice carries a lyric, meditative texture ("mist clung to the air like a whisper," "pearl of stillness"). Psychic distance is consistent, filtering all perception through Lira's reverence for light and craft. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"zephyr bloom of her spirit"—that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. No dialogue is present; interiority is clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with controlled rhythm and vivid imagery ("the heavens above shimmering like a thousand eyes"). Yet several lines loop or paraphrase: "The mist followed her, wrapping around her like a cloak" echoes earlier "mist…wrapping around her like a cocoon." Figurative density is high—nearly every paragraph features metaphor or simile—without always advancing pressure. The final paragraph stacks abstract phrases ("zephyr bloom," "quiet force") that blur rather than sharpen the image. Template stems appear: "She had been…," "She had sworn…," "She called it…"</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The core premise—an artisan who polishes sea glass to create gentle light as an alternative to fire—offers a fresh angle on the light-vs.-darkness motif. The grotto setting and the "pearl of stillness" concept provide specific texture. However, the arc (trauma → vow → fulfillment without complication) follows a familiar template, and the risk-free resolution limits ingenuity. The "star watcher" role and gem-polishing method are underexplored; their mechanics never constrain or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her identity as "earthbound star watcher" frames her reverence for starlight. She makes one on-page decision—to begin polishing—but it faces no resistance. Her walk to the village is assertion, not choice. The character shapes tone but not key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sea glass appears in at least four beats: cradled at opening, traced during memory, polished mid-story, held up glowing at the end. Its surface and colors evolve from "reflectively vibrant" to glowing mirror, and it charges the final image. Removing it would collapse the central ritual. Setup, development, and closure participation are all met.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" is named once mid-story as Lira's private label for the sea glass. It does not shape stakes or tactics; it functions as poetic descriptor rather than operative concept. The story would remain intact if the phrase were omitted.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Reflectively vibrant" describes the sea glass's surface at the opening. It is mentioned but never constrains or enables an action with cost. The attribute is ornamental; a near-synonym (e.g., "luminous") could replace it with no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Weigh" appears once: "She would weigh each piece of sea glass in her hands, feeling its weight, its story." This introduces her method but does not drive a turn or redefine options. The action is functional but replaceable with "examine" or "assess."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Gem polishing is signaled early ("a craft she had honed over years"), detailed in the central beat ("each stroke deliberate"), and produces the glowing result that enables the ending. The method shapes two beats (introduction, execution) and participates in closure. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no friction or cost attends the process.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto with mist is established early, sustains atmosphere, and the moonlight sliver amplifies the sea glass's glow at the end. It appears across setup, development, and closure. Yet it does not constrain a choice; Lira works undisturbed. The setting enriches mood but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"As memories resurface" is present in the opening and recurs mid-story. Time is vague—no urgency or deadline shapes decisions. The timeframe functions as thematic accent (reflection mode) rather than pressure device. Easily replaceable with "during an evening of reflection."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To share light without using fire" is stated early, tied to childhood trauma, and fulfilled at the end when Lira walks to the village with the glowing glass. The motivation drives the polishing action and frames the stakes. However, no friction between this want and a competing cost appears; the vow is honored without dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Zephyr bloom" appears only in the final sentence as a metaphor for Lira's spirit. It does not modulate with pressure or appear earlier to teach a pattern. Tone throughout is meditative and gentle, consistent but static. The late ornamental use prevents higher integration.</comment>
