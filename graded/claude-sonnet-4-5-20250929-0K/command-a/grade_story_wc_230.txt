<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias demonstrates consistent motivation (solitude, control) and his involuntary truthfulness creates genuine internal friction. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract formulations ("psychological safety," "fractured grace") rather than embodied contradiction, and the final choice to bury the eye feels more ritual-driven than earned by prior internal conflict. The progression from rational forager to superstitious participant needed sharper micro-choices that reveal cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the first paragraph (who, where, when). The causal lens holds: Elias finds eye → truthfulness curse → seeks cure → performs ritual → restoration. The closure (burying the eye at dawn, lifting the curse) is decisive and on-page, but the cost reads more as relief than foreclosure—no visible trade-off or price paid. The ritual resolution feels externally authored rather than emerging from protagonist agency, weakening the closure's felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is vividly rendered with storm-battered branches and damp air, and the ravine setting provides spatial coherence. The glass eye's physical properties (shifting colors, warmth/cold) are concretely tracked. However, the orchard functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice—Elias could perform the same actions in any isolated location. The first sunbeam's role in the ritual is the closest the setting comes to pressuring the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (escape involuntary truthfulness) is clear and the situation escalates from discovery to village consultation to dawn ritual. However, the escalation is more sequential than tightening—each step follows neatly without forcing trade-offs or narrowing options with visible cost. The ritual resolution arrives through external instruction (Mara's textbook) rather than protagonist choice under pressure, diluting agency at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of psychological safety and choosing which truths to carry emerges clearly. However, the final paragraph overtly articulates this theme ("psychological safety wasn't about avoiding truths, but about choosing which ones to carry"), crossing into explicit moralizing rather than letting the image resonate. The truffle discovery at the end gestures toward earned wisdom, but the didactic framing undercuts subtextual depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited focalization through Elias, and the prose maintains appropriate distance. Mara's brief dialogue carries distinct hesitance and reverence. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fractured grace," "occlude his control") that reads more authorial than character-particular for a truffle forager, especially under stress. The Latin recitation is voice-appropriate for the ritual moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong, but several patterns create drag: "fractured grace" appears three times as thematic scaffolding without evolving meaning; "psychological safety" recurs as an abstract label rather than embodied pressure; the opening's "deliberate precision" and "rational mind weighing the risks" are generic descriptors. The phrase "involuntarily truthful" appears twice in close succession. Rhythm varies appropriately, but information density suffers from conceptual repetition across paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise combines several prompt elements (post-virus world, cursed artifact, involuntary truthfulness) but the execution follows a familiar quest-for-cure template: discover cursed object → consult wise elder → perform prescribed ritual → restoration. The empathy virus and smuggled relic remain decorative rather than shaping unique moral calculus or world logic. No moment surprises or reweights prior material in hindsight; the arc is predictable from the village consultation forward.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's rationality motivates his initial hesitation and drives the choice to seek answers in the village, shaping two beats. However, his truffle-foraging profession remains ornamental—the story would function identically if he were any solitary worker. The rational trait contrasts with the superstitious resolution but doesn't constrain the final ritual choice, which he performs despite his stated skepticism.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass eye appears in four distinct beats: discovery, triggering the curse, consultation with Mara, and the dawn ritual. Its shifting colors and temperature changes are concretely rendered and its properties (holding truth, causing involuntary speech) drive the central conflict. The ritual of returning it creates the closure. Strong integration, though the eye's function as curse-object is somewhat generic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "smuggled relic" label appears early and contextualizes the eye within the post-virus world, but its smuggled status never materially affects stakes or tactics—no pursuit, no legal danger, no moral dilemma about possession. It functions primarily as worldbuilding flavor rather than shaping on-page choices or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness is dramatized on-page ("I don't want to keep this, but I'm afraid to leave it here") and creates genuine discomfort that motivates the village trip. Mara's explanation confirms the trait's mechanics. However, the attribute doesn't constrain later choices—Elias never faces a situation where forced honesty costs him tactically or relationally. The curse lifts cleanly without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Occlude" appears once as metaphor ("occlude his control") and once in the Latin recitation ("Occludo quod non est meum"). Neither instance drives a turn or alters options—the word functions as thematic echo rather than action. The actual resolution (burying the eye at dawn) could proceed identically without this specific verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Discredited textbooks are signaled early in Elias's recollection and appear concretely when Mara consults her yellowed volume to find the ritual. The method shapes the middle beat (village consultation) and provides the ritual's mechanics. However, the cure arrives as straightforward instruction rather than requiring improvisation or testing, reducing the method's pressure on protagonist choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The hanging orchard in the ravine appears in the opening, middle (as Elias leaves), and closing paragraphs, and the storm-battered branches contribute concrete atmosphere. The dawn sunbeam is essential to the ritual's execution. However, the orchard's specific features (hanging fruits, roots, ancient oak) don't constrain choices—the ritual could occur in any dawn-lit clearing. The ravine's depth and difficulty aren't leveraged tactically.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The empathy virus timeline ("years ago") provides historical context and explains humanity's wariness, but the timeframe never tightens present decisions. No clock pressure, no anniversary significance, no viral threat resurgence. The post-virus setting functions as static backdrop rather than shaping on-page stakes or urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Psychological safety" is stated as motivation in the opening and echoed in the final paragraph's explicit theme statement. It explains Elias's solitary foraging lifestyle and contextualizes his fear of the truth-curse. However, the motivation remains largely told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses—the journey to cure the curse is straightforward self-preservation without friction between safety and other wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fractured grace" appears three times (opening, middle, closing) as a recurring tonal marker for the orchard and Elias's internal state. The phrase charges the final image when the orchard's grace is "restored" after the ritual. However, the tone itself—melancholic resilience—remains static rather than modulating under pressure; the piece maintains one elegiac register throughout without tonal escalation or break.</comment>
