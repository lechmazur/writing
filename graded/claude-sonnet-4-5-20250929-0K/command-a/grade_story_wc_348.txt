<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority leans heavily on abstract processing ("symphonically attuned," "weave the pieces together") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The grief is declared and reflected upon but never dramatizes competing impulses in real time—she moves smoothly from observation to insight without friction. The final choice to "climb out" arrives as narrated summary rather than a moment where two wants collide with visible cost. Micro-choices are absent; the transformation is told rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is adequate by ~120 words. The story operates in a reflective-accumulative mode, but no on-page event narrows options or forecloses a path with felt cost; Elena's "shift within her" is an interior declaration, not a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights prior material through action or image. The ending summarizes her readiness without demonstrating what she has renounced or what price she has paid on the page. Cost is asserted ("no longer a weight") but not dramatized, preventing closure from landing cleanly under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ravine's jagged rocks, river foam, and twilight are vivid and selective. However, the environment remains backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Elena's tactics. The chrysalis is handled twice but functions as symbolic ornament rather than a tool or micro-setting that pressures action. Sensory detail is competent but does not reach the threshold where setting shapes the final image with causal force.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting after grief—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening choice. Elena observes, reflects, and decides internally; no external complication forces a trade-off or narrows her options. The "pieces fall into place" phrase implies easing rather than escalation. The resolution is her own declaration of readiness without a visible price paid or a path foreclosed, leaving pressure flat throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The separation-into-connection theme emerges clearly from the river-foam metaphor and polymer-bonding analogy. Yet the insight is stated rather than earned through a non-literal final image that reweights prior material. The chrysalis recurs but shifts meaning only via narration ("no longer felt like a relic of loss") rather than through action or perceptual surprise. The ending gestures toward complexity but resolves into a tidy epiphany without ambiguity or cost that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual filter (molecular bonds, structural harmony) is character-specific. However, register drifts into elevated diction ("symphonically attuned," "testament to the possibility of change") that reads more authorial than character-lived, especially in peak reflection. Psychic distance remains consistent but narrows into expository summary during the insight beat rather than letting perception do the work. No dialogue is present to evaluate voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "separation was not an end, but a step" is immediately echoed by "she needed to apply that principle to her own life," and "the world felt different—not perfect, but whole" restates the prior paragraph's thesis. Template cadence appears in the opening ("She was a polymer chemist... Yet, here... she sought") and recurs throughout. Figurative language ("whisper from the universe," "weave the threads of her life") stacks without adding pressure. The −0.8 accumulation for loops, scaffold, and stock metaphor strings lowers the score; artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The grief-through-scientific-lens frame and chrysalis-as-transformation symbol are familiar templates executed without a fresh inflection. The polymer-chemist detail functions as occupation label rather than shaping choices; her work remains abstract. The river-foam insight arrives as narrated epiphany rather than a turn earned by prior particulars. Transformation could occur with any profession or natural metaphor, signaling high swappability and low conceptual risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout but observation-only; her chemist lens colors metaphor ("molecular bonds," "structural harmony") yet never constrains a choice or enables a tactic under pressure. No on-page decision traces causally to her profession.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Handled in paragraph one and returned in the final section with reweighted meaning ("no longer felt like a relic of loss"). However, it is held and described rather than used; no action hinges on its presence. The reprise is narrated rather than charged through image or choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The divergent-path concept is thematized ("separation was not an end, but a step") but does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics. Elena's path choice is declared rather than dramatized; no moment shows her selecting one route over another with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Label-only: "symphonically attuned," "symphonically minded nature" appear as descriptor and summary. No scene demonstrates how this trait constrains action, enables a move, or costs her something on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Mentioned mid-story ("she had to atone") but not dramatized. No on-page act of atonement occurs; the concept remains abstract wish rather than enacted choice. Major turns do not trace to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Signaled early (river foam observation) and returned at the insight beat. However, the mechanics are narrated summary ("the insight came, as clear as the river itself") rather than shown through perceptual discovery. It does not shape prior attempts or later tactics; it arrives as convenient epiphany.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Present throughout; the ravine supplies sensory detail and houses the chrysalis discovery. Yet it does not pressure a choice or alter outcome—Elena could gain the same insight in any natural setting. The walk "deeper into the ravine" and climb out are narrated transit without tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The phrase "as the pieces fall into place" appears once, mid-story, as metaphor for internal readiness rather than a live temporal constraint. No clock tightens decisions; the sunset marks mood but does not alter Elena's options or pace.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stated clearly ("translate separation into connection") and present in the thematic arc. However, it is reflected upon rather than conflicted in choices. No on-page friction between the desire to reconnect and a competing cost or obstacle; the want is satisfied by interior declaration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Coherent throughout: "loosened grief," "quiet ache," and the gentle shift to "no longer just a polymer chemist" maintain tonal consistency. The tone modulates slightly from melancholy to tentative hope as pressure eases. It charges the final image by lending emotional color, though the modulation is narrated rather than embodied in gesture or rhythm.</comment>
