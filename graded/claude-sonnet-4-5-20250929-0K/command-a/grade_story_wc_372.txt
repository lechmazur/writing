<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—preservation driven by a need to conjure meaning—but the character remains somewhat static until the transformed slide forces a shift. The "gently meticulous" trait is told more than shown through specific micro-choices under pressure; her stepping closer "against her orderly nature" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final stance crystallization (preservation → connection) is legible but arrives through external revelation rather than earned internal conflict. Interiority leans toward abstract ("edge of oblivion") rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent. Orientation anchors (frozen library, Elara, records chief) arrive early. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the transformed slide and shifted inscription reweight Elara's role from preserver to conduit, and her renewed purpose forecloses passive archiving. Cost is felt—urgency clashes with meticulous nature—though the price could be more concrete. One meaningful deepening occurs when the slide's frequency spike and tremor force realization; escalation is modest but coherent under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frozen library above the clouds is vivid and establishes tone early: crystalline shelves, biting cold, misted breath, velvet casings. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara's professional attention. The magic lantern and measuring device constrain her process, and the tremor provides a physical beat. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the setting does not materially alter a choice at closure—it frames rather than pressures—so the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving luminous vows against oblivion—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the unusual slide's frequencies spike and the library trembles, forcing Elara's realization that slides are keys, not just records. Agency is present but largely reactive: the slide transforms and calls to her; she responds by working with renewed purpose. The final cost (clash of meticulous nature with urgency) is stated rather than dramatically tested. Escalation is one-step rather than compounding; no visible trade-off or loss shapes tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—meaning salvaged from oblivion, connection across time—emerges from the transformed slide and Elara's shift from archivist to conduit. The luminous vow passed through time is specific and resonant. However, the ending leans toward summary ("her heart alight with purpose") and mild moralizing rather than a non-literal final image. The inscription shifts feel symbolic but are delivered via direct statement rather than subtext. Thematic threads (hope, loss, resilience) are told in paragraph seven rather than embodied in scene particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited focalization. Voice is consistent and carries a formal, slightly elevated register appropriate to the archival setting. Diction ("quartz hush," "luminous vows") is purposeful and distinct. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is professional but generic—what a records chief notices is stated rather than shown through biased selection. Under peak stress (tremor, spike), syntax does not compress or fragment; the prose remains measured. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that harm immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean. Rhythm varies across paragraphs. However, several issues accumulate: paraphrase loops ("not just to preserve but to connect, to conjure meaning from fragments"), template cadence in paragraph eight ("sampling frequencies…uncovering hidden patterns…weaving together stories"), and stock metaphors ("edge of oblivion," "heart alight"). The phrase "quartz hush" recurs without reweighting. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized," "she understood") stack in paragraphs four and six, dulling immediacy at key beats. Applying the loop and artifact penalties: −0.6 for template runs and synonym churn, −0.4 for filter-verb clusters = baseline penalty −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds and magic lantern slides offer atmospheric specificity, but the core premise—archivist discovers transformative artifact and shifts from preservation to connection—follows a familiar template. The inscription's shift and the figure-as-guide are predictable symbolic moves. Emotional progression (meticulous → urgent → purposeful) is tidy rather than complex. The story does not take structural or perspectival risks; the ending moralizes gently rather than landing a non-obvious turn. Transformation test: swap "slides" for "scrolls" or "relics" and the arc holds unchanged, signaling insufficient freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara (orderly records chief) is present throughout and her final choice to work with renewed purpose and connect rather than merely preserve is signaled. However, the choice is reactive—prompted by the slide's transformation—and lacks visible cost or trade-off on the page. Setup ✓, middle involvement ✓ (extraction, measurement), closure participation ✓ (renewed purpose). Two-beat involvement +0.9, but late agency and no specific cost cap the score mid-band. Swappability: another archivist role would fit with minor edits −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide is introduced early, handled in beats two (extraction), three (placement into lantern), four (transformation), and returns in the ending (slides glow brighter). Setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. Three beats +1.4, causal pressure (frequencies spike, library trembles) +1.0, closure linkage (transformed slide charges Elara's purpose) +1.2, early signal +0.5. Specificity: the inscription and solitary figure are unique to this slide +0.6. Total strong integration; score lands high in the 7–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Luminous vows are named early and recur as a thematic label. They frame Elara's task but do not alter tactics or constrain choice on the page. The vows are objects of preservation, not active pressures. Setup ✓ (paragraph one), but middle development is ornamental (description, not decision pressure), and closure participation is summary ("resonating with new vitality"). Two gates only; lyric reprise without mid-scene causal use caps at ~6.0. Swappability −0.6 (near-synonym "sacred promises" would fit). Ornamental use −0.6. Score mid 4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Gently meticulous is named twice but shown minimally. Paragraph one: "moved with gently meticulous care." Paragraph six: clash with urgency is told, not dramatized through a specific choice or visible cost. No middle beat where the trait enables or constrains action. Setup ✓ (named early), but middle development absent, closure mention is summary. Missing middle dev → cap 3.4; late label-only use prevents upward movement. Label-only −0.3, no on-page cost tied to the trait −0.5. Adjusted score low 4s, capped near the missing-development ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Measure (via device) appears in beat two and is central when frequencies spike in beat four, forcing realization. Paragraph seven: Elara measures each slide to uncover patterns. Setup ✓, middle ✓ (spike triggers tremor and insight), closure ✓ (renewed precision). Two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure (spike changes options) +0.8, early signal +0.4. However, the measuring device is a tool that could be replaced with another diagnostic method (scanner, spectral analysis) with minor edits; swappability −0.5. Score upper 5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Sampling frequencies is named in paragraph two and recurs in paragraph seven. It describes the method but does not shape a turn or constraint—Elara measures, frequencies spike, she continues measuring. Setup ✓ (signaled early), but middle role is passive description, and closure participation is summary mention. Two gates met; lyric mention without causal pressure caps eligibility near 6.0. Swappability −0.7 (another technical method would fit). Ornamental in middle beats −0.5. Summary-only in closure −0.4. Adjusted score mid-3s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Frozen library above clouds is introduced in the opening line and anchors every scene. Crystalline shelves, biting cold, and misted breath create atmosphere. The tremor (beat four) uses the library's physicality, and the "quartz hush" recurs at closure. Setup ✓, middle ✓ (tremor), closure ✓ (library softens). Three-beat involvement +1.4, early signal +0.6, closure linkage (library acknowledges efforts) +0.8. However, the library does not constrain a choice; it frames action. Postcard-description penalty −0.3. Micro-setting (tool, body) would score higher if it altered tactics; here it charges mood more than decision. Score upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "while illusions fade to memory" appears in paragraph one and recurs as thematic phrasing ("fading to memory," paragraph one; "edge of oblivion"). It does not tighten decisions or create urgency on the page—no deadline, no race against decay. Setup ✓ (named early), but middle and closure involvement is ornamental theme-echo. Two gates barely met; no live clock or tactical pressure. Vague time −0.8, ornamental −0.6. Score low-mid 3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Motivation to conjure meaning from oblivion is stated in paragraph one and recurs when Elara realizes her role is "not just to preserve but to connect" (paragraph seven) and at closure ("meaning could be found and carried forward"). Setup ✓, middle ✓ (realization deepens motive), closure ✓ (heart alight with purpose). Two-beat involvement +0.9, early signal +0.5. However, the motivation is told and summarized rather than dramatized through friction or contradictory wants. Friction between wants and costs is absent; no visible trade-off. Told-only penalty −0.8. Score mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Quartz hush is named in the opening line and returns in paragraph eight ("quartz hush seemed to soften"). Tone is coherent—formal, reverent, slightly archaic—and modulates subtly when the tremor introduces urgency (paragraph four). Setup ✓, closure reprise ✓. The reprise reweights the tone from static silence to acknowledgment, a lyric shift that charges the final mood. Early seed → final return qualifies under the lyric-resonance allowance. Two gates (setup, closure) +lyric reprise +closure linkage +0.7. However, tone does not modulate sharply under peak pressure; the prose remains measured throughout. Modest modulation −0.3. Score low-mid 6s.</comment>
