<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to preserve ancient methods is stated but rarely tested in scene—he polishes the cog, clutches it, follows Lira, then collects more artifacts without meaningful internal conflict or cost. The "abrasive calm" and "rationally rebellious" labels are asserted repeatedly ("his abrasive calm," "rationally rebellious mind") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Lira appears functional but one-note; her scavenger role and "defiance" are told, not shown through distinct speech or pressure-driven choice. The final realization—"competing narratives…were not opposites but threads in the same tapestry"—arrives as an unearned epiphany, summarizing theme rather than emerging from prior dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph. The dominant stake—preserve relics versus move forward—is signaled but never concretely tested; Kael follows Lira to the collapse with minimal resistance, retrieves artifacts offstage ("carefully extracted artifacts"), and the ending offers only a vague insight without visible cost or change in options. The piece reads as two loosely joined shards (sewer dialogue, then ruins expedition) connected by summary transit, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under a Causal lens—Lira's news does not narrow Kael's choices, and the collapse itself is backdrop rather than pressure. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the "threads in the same tapestry" line, but cost remains conceptual and unfelt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The sewer and sunken city ruins are anchored with sensory detail ("scent of decay," "damp stone ledge," "flooded streets"), and the chronometer cog is handled across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is coherent but the ruins function primarily as atmospheric backdrop—Kael moves "through the sedimentary layers" without those layers constraining his choices or altering tactics. The collapse mentioned by Lira never materializes as an on-page obstacle; artifacts are "carefully extracted" in summary, so the environment does not pressure the final image or shape the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The declared stake—preserve the past versus embrace the future—is outlined in the Kael/Lira exchange but never escalates into a concrete on-page dilemma. Kael "hesitated" then "followed Lira" with minimal friction; the collapse is told second-hand and the artifact retrieval occurs offstage, so no reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The ending insight ("room for both") resolves the tension conceptually without visible cost, agency, or a choice that forecloses a path. No meaningful escalation under any lens—Causal linkage is weak (because Lira arrives with news, Kael follows without complication), and Accumulative pressure does not deepen or shift stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The competing-narratives theme is signaled early and recurs in dialogue, but the piece resolves it via direct statement in the final paragraph ("competing narratives…were not opposites but threads in the same tapestry") rather than through image or earned insight. The chronometer cog is present across beats but functions as a static symbol of "precision" and "order" without shifting meaning or constraining choice at closure. Subtext is minimal—Lira and Kael's exchange reads as thesis debate ("your narrative…is destroying us") rather than implication. The ending offers a tidy reconciliation without ambiguity or resonance beyond the stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Kael's interiority uses phrases like "his rationally rebellious mind" and "abrasive calm" that feel imposed rather than voice-particular, and his perceptual signature is generic—"fingers tracing," "grip tightened," "mind racing" are stock gestures without idiosyncratic texture. Dialogue is functional but Lira's and Kael's speech ("You're wasting your time down here" / "Because the past holds answers") lack distinct idiom or subtext; both sound equally articulate and thesis-driven. Filter verbs ("looked up to see," "found himself drawn") are present but voice-motivated enough to avoid heavy penalty. Distance is consistent and narration stays within Kael's plausible knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate and grammar clean, but the prose carries scaffold and loops: "his rationally rebellious mind" echoes "her rationally rebellious spirit"; "the thought of losing…was agonizing, but the thought of staying…was worse" is paraphrase churn; "abrasive calm" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment. Sentence openings vary minimally—multiple paragraphs begin with "Kael" or "The." Figurative language is sparse and functional; no mixed metaphors or density excess. Information density is low in transit beats ("Days turned into weeks, and Lira returned often") and the final paragraph summarizes rather than showing the realization through image or action. The cog-polishing and artifact-extraction beats lack propulsion; key moves are told ("carefully extracted artifacts") rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The setup—philosopher in sewer clinging to relics after plague—is a familiar post-apocalyptic premise without fresh angle; the competing-narratives frame is stated rather than dramatized through specific world logic or moral calculus. The chronometer cog functions as generic symbol of "precision" and "order" without irreplaceable specificity. The scavenger-meets-philosopher dynamic and the "past versus future" debate are stock; Kael's final insight ("threads in the same tapestry") is a tidy reconciliation indistinguishable from template resolutions. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the two-shard structure is conventional and the ending hedges toward safe middle ground rather than committing to a singular stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kael appears throughout and his philosopher identity is labeled, but his choices do not create key turns—he follows Lira's prompt without dramatized resistance and retrieves artifacts offstage. His sewer dwelling is backdrop; the location does not constrain his final action or charge the closure image. Present but largely passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The chronometer cog is handled in the opening (traced, clutched), returns in the dialogue beat (polished, gripped), and is present conceptually in the final paragraph ("preserve ancient methods"). The cog shapes Kael's stated motivation but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure; its meaning remains static (symbol of precision/order) without reweighting at closure. Setup and development present; closure participation is thematic mention only, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Competing narratives" is named explicitly in the opening ("competing narratives that plagued his thoughts") and dramatized briefly in the Kael/Lira exchange ("your narrative…is destroying us" / "your narrative…is a fantasy"), shaping one dialogue beat. The ending resolves the concept via direct statement ("competing narratives…were not opposites but threads") rather than through choice or image, so closure participation is thematic summary. Setup and one middle beat present; causal pressure minimal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Rationally rebellious" is labeled twice ("his rationally rebellious mind," "her rationally rebellious spirit") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The trait remains assertion without embodied tradeoff or micro-choice that reveals its operation under pressure. Present as label only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kael "agonized over the competing narratives" in the opening and "the thought of losing…was agonizing" before the ruins expedition. The action appears twice but does not create a turn—his agonizing does not alter his decision to follow Lira or shape the artifact retrieval. The verb fits his philosopher role but remains interchangeable with "worried" or "fretted" without unique causal work. Functional label use; no major turn traced to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Sedimentary layers" appears in the opening setup ("diving through sedimentary layers to uncover artifacts") and again in the ruins scene ("moved through the sedimentary layers"). The method is mentioned but its mechanics never matter—no on-page demonstration of how layering constrains his search or alters tactics. Present as descriptor; no causal or closure link.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The sunken city ruins are established early (opening paragraph, second paragraph detail), supply the collapse complication (Lira's news), and host the final artifact-retrieval scene. The setting provides atmospheric detail and a destination but does not constrain Kael's choices or alter tactics—he moves through it successfully offstage ("carefully extracted artifacts") without obstacle. Setup, middle beat, and closure scene present; causal pressure light. Two gates plus closure scene location; reach mid-5s on presence, but specificity and constraint are low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the plague ends" is stated in the opening ("after the plague had stripped the world") and referenced once more ("a time before the plague"), anchoring backstory context. The timeframe does not tighten present decisions or shape tactics; the plague is past and its aftermath is static backdrop. Present as setup only; no development or closure link.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's desire "to preserve ancient methods" is stated explicitly in paragraph two, dramatized lightly in his cog-polishing and Lira dialogue ("Because the past holds answers"), and returns in the final image as he "carefully extracted artifacts." The motivation drives his stated goal and his compliance with Lira's urgency, but friction between want and cost is minimal—he follows without visible sacrifice and the ending affirms rather than complicates his aim. Setup, middle beat, closure mention present; conflict and cost are told, not felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Abrasive calm" is labeled twice ("his abrasive calm often masked the turmoil," "his abrasive calm giving way to a flicker of hope") but the prose does not embody the friction—narration remains explanatory and emotionally even throughout. The tone does not modulate with pressure (the collapse news, the ruins expedition) or charge the final image; it functions as character assertion rather than a lived tonal texture. Label-only; no coherent modulation or closure charge.</comment>
