<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her relationship with the carving is embodied through physical work, but her interiority relies heavily on reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The shift from grief to peace feels more contemplated than earned through on-page struggle; her carving progresses smoothly without genuine setbacks or micro-choices that foreclose paths. The lion metaphor does accumulate meaning, but the final "resilience" realization reads as stated insight rather than dramatized discovery with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The accumulative structure gathers density through the carving process, and the final image offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara recognizing both Marius and herself in the completed lion). However, the closure lacks a felt cost—no path is foreclosed, no visible price paid; the ending delivers contemplative satisfaction without the friction required for high-band RR. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, and it holds, but the final beat doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight and the loft's tool arrangement create vivid atmosphere and the setting is filtered through Elara's grief-laden attention. The carving blank and tools constrain her work process across multiple beats, charging the final image when she holds the completed lion. Spatial choreography (rug, stove, skylight) remains coherent, and sensory detail (steam curling, rain tapping) modulates with the scene's rhythm. Minor deduction: occupational carving detail is light, but sufficient for this length and the tools do shape her actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming grief into meaning through the carving—is signaled early and maintained. However, escalation is minimal: Elara's work proceeds without resistance, the challenging mane is overcome with "renewed focus," and no live option is foreclosed. The concept "here and gone" is contemplated but doesn't tighten choices or create a trade-off. The ending satisfies thematically but lacks a visible or felt price that alters tactics or forecloses a path, keeping this below the 7.0 threshold for meaningful tightening with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the carving process and the "here and gone" concept, with the lion functioning as both transient and eternal. The mane's complexity mirrors Elara's emotional tangle, and the comparison of grief-taming to lion-taming offers specificity. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit thematic statement ("saw the here and gone of life itself"), and the wisdom feels slightly packaged rather than discovered. The piece invites reflection but the ending tilts closer to articulation than resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Elara's perceptions. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful modulation (the kettle's sharp whistle against "rust-hued peace"). Perceptual signature is present: she notices tool precision, the grain's stories, steam distorting light. Minor deduction: some phrasing edges toward elevated register that feels slightly external to a widow in a loft ("hauntingly practical arrangement," "crystallized time"), and a few filter verbs ("seemed to whisper," "seemed to say") slightly dull immediacy in peak carving moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with varied sentence structure and strong sensory specificity (rain tapping, steam curling, ash grain). Information density is solid and momentum generally sustained. However, several loops and scaffold patterns appear: "hauntingly practical" repeats across paragraphs, "here and gone" is stated multiple times without pressure escalation, and template stems recur ("She thought about," "Elara thought"). The phrase "through crystallized time" appears twice but remains abstract. Figurative density is high without always advancing pressure ("rust-hued peace," "time itself had crystallized"). Apply paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties totaling approximately −0.8 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lion-tamer premise offers a fresh angle, and the ash carving as grief-work provides concrete particulars. However, the core emotional arc—widow transforming loss into art—follows a recognizable template without a bold structural or perspectival risk. The "taming grief like taming lions" metaphor, while apt, is fairly direct. The piece commits to its premise but retreats from friction (the carving succeeds without setback, peace arrives without ambiguity). The proximity to "art heals grief" narratives and the median risk profile keep this in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decision to carve drives the story's arc. She makes micro-choices (pausing for tea, returning with renewed focus) and her final stance—holding the completed lion—closes the piece. However, these choices don't create reversals or alter tactics with visible cost; her carving proceeds smoothly. She is more observer of her own process than agent forcing trade-offs. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ash wood blank is handled across multiple beats: discovered in the opening, cradled and worked mid-scene, its grain "whispers" and yields to her touch, and the completed carving is held in the final image. The blank constrains her work (grain direction, mane complexity) and is reweighted at closure from "unmarred promise" to "hauntingly practical and deeply profound" lion. Strong setup, development, and payoff with specificity (ash grain, smooth texture). Minor gap: the blank's unique properties (why ash, not another wood) aren't leveraged for a visible cost or tactic shift.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is explicitly named and tied to Marius's philosophy and Elara's grief work. It frames her question (can she embrace impermanence?) and appears in the final image ("saw the here and gone of life itself"). However, it operates primarily as thematic echo rather than constraining on-page choices—Elara's carving tactics don't shift because of impermanence logic. Present in setup and ending with thematic charge, but lacks middle development that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" appears twice as a descriptor (tools arranged, lion form) but functions as atmospheric label rather than trait that constrains action. It doesn't enable or restrict a choice with cost; it's an adjective layered onto existing elements. The arrangement of tools is described as such, but no specific tool use is altered by this quality. Ornamental use trends low; swappable with "purposeful" or "austere."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Contain" is enacted through the carving—Elara attempts to contain Marius's essence in wood—and reappears in the resolution ("she had contained not just his memory, but her own resilience"). The action drives the middle beats (carving the lion) and is present at closure. However, "contain" could be swapped for "capture" or "preserve" with minor edits; the word itself doesn't carry unique mechanics that alter tactics. Functional across setup, middle, and ending, but replaceability caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Through crystallized time" appears twice as description ("time itself had crystallized," "through crystallized time, she was creating") but never as a method that shapes how she works. It reads as metaphor for suspended attention, not a mechanics-driven process. No signal of how crystallized time differs from ordinary focus, and it doesn't constrain or enable tactics. Present but ornamental; late and label-only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is established early and provides atmosphere, tools, and spatial grounding. The skylight casts diffused light that affects her perception, the bucket catches dripping water, the stove whistles, and the threadbare rug anchors her position. The setting participates in multiple beats and the final image occurs within it. However, the loft doesn't pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it's backdrop rather than constraint. Strong setup and presence, moderate payoff through atmosphere charging the ending, but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The kettle boils early and the story notes "she worked while the kettle boiled" as a ritual marker, but elapsed time is never tracked or used to tighten decisions. The rain tapers off by the end, suggesting duration, but no clock pressures her choices. The timeframe is mentioned but not enacted as a constraint. Present in setup, absent in middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To harvest lessons from loss" is stated clearly in paragraph one and drives Elara's carving project throughout. Her choices (selecting the blank, working through the mane's complexity, completing the lion) are motivated by this desire. The final image—seeing both Marius and her resilience in the carving—fulfills the motivation. However, the motivation is more told than dramatized in friction: no competing want creates tension, no visible cost tests her commitment. Present in setup, middle (carving as enactment), and ending, but lacks conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" is named once early ("the air was thick with rust-hued peace") and echoed in the final line ("rust-hued light of the loft"). The tone is quiet and contemplative throughout, modulating slightly when the kettle whistles but remaining serene. It charges the final image by recurring, but the tone doesn't shift with pressure—Elara's carving proceeds calmly without tonal friction. Purposeful setup and reprise reweights the ending modestly, but static mood through turns keeps this mid-band.</comment>
