<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("dimensionally homesick" / "make friends with uncertainty") reads as label-only rather than embodied contradiction. The closing choice to wait lacks visible cost on the page—no on-page forfeiture of an active opportunity, only a passive deferral. Interior monologue leans toward abstraction ("foggy lucidity of her thoughts settled into clarity") rather than concrete, character-specific perception under pressure. Emotional states are asserted ("sorrow," "ache") rather than shown through action or physical tell.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story presents a situation (Elara holds the pendant, the keeper explains the cost) but the climactic "I will wait" decision does not close a dramatized on-page choice with felt consequence—no path is visibly foreclosed, and the pendant simply dims passively. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, the ending reads as Earned Stasis without legible cost: waiting is announced, not enacted with sacrifice. The drive lens wobbles between situational pressure and thematic lyric; the closure does not tighten under either.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The frozen garden is vividly described with sensory detail (mist, ice-encrusted trees, cold). However, it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice—Elara moves through it without spatial friction. The pendant warms and glows, but its physical properties do not alter her tactics. The garden's "history, longing, fear" are told, not dramatized through obstacle or resource. No micro-setting element (tool, body limit, spatial feature) shapes the final decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (return home vs. protect the library) is declared but never tested through on-page choice with visible trade-off. The keeper's exposition delivers the conflict rather than Elara discovering it through action. The climax—"I will wait"—defers rather than decides, and no cost is enacted: the pendant dims, but Elara loses no resource, foregoes no concrete opportunity, and the garden remains unchanged. One situational pressure moment (the keeper's arrival) complicates but does not escalate agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Boundaries of light" and "make friends with uncertainty" are invoked as abstract theme-labels without being tested through specific scene pressure. The ending offers a mood statement ("a sentinel of light and shadow… exactly where she needed to be") rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The pendant's dimming suggests symbolic closure, but the conceptual cost is asserted, not shown. Thematic echo in the final paragraph ("she would find her place… in the space between") reads as prompt-fulfillment rather than earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Psychic distance is stable third-limited. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction inconsistent with feral urgency ("dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity," "make friends with uncertainty"). The keeper's dialogue ("I am the keeper of the boundaries of light") and Elara's reply feel expository rather than goal-driven. Dialogue subtext is minimal; lines explain rather than pursue or evade. Perceptual signature is generic—no character-specific filtering of the garden's sensory detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean with varied sentence structure and vivid images ("shards of obsidian," "mist seeped into her pores"). Figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. However, template openings recur ("Elara's…" x3 in close proximity), and several lines loop conceptually: "the garden's beauty both haunting and fleeting" mirrors "the garden remained frozen, the mist eternal." Stock phrases appear under pressure ("her heart quickened," "her mind raced"). The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("sentinel of light and shadow," "space between") without concrete image anchor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise (guardian torn between worlds, mystical pendant, choice between duty and longing) follows a familiar template without fresh transformation. The frozen garden and cultist's pendant are generic fantasy furniture. The keeper's arrival and infodump replicate standard mentor-confrontation structure. Elara's choice to wait rather than act defers rather than reimagines the dilemma. No detail or turn feels irreplaceable; names and setting could swap with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the final choice to wait, but her "feral" trait does not shape tactics or constrain action—she moves, pauses, and converses without animal urgency or sensory acuity distinct from a non-feral character. The guardian role is label-only; no library-protection action occurs on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The pendant appears early, is held and examined, hums in sync with heartbeat, grows warmer, glows, and dims at the end—multiple beats. However, it functions as a passive symbol rather than a tool Elara uses to alter tactics. Its "key" property is explained by the keeper, not discovered through Elara's action. The dimming at closure reweights meaning but does not drive the choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Boundaries of light" is mentioned twice—once in Elara's backstory and once in the keeper's self-identification—but does not constrain choice or alter tactics on the page. It remains thematic decoration rather than a rule or stake that shapes the conflict.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"Dimensionally homesick" is named early and motivates Elara's longing, but the trait does not force a visible trade-off on the page. The homesickness "clawed at her," yet she defers action without cost—no physical toll, no tactical error driven by distraction. The attribute is told, not enacted through choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Wait" is the climactic choice and final stance, signaled early ("urged her to wait"), practiced mid-story, and declared at closure. It frames the resolution. However, waiting is passive endurance without on-page cost—no forfeited opportunity, no visible consequence. The pendant dims as a result, but Elara does not act to make it so; the turn happens to her.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Interiorizing exteriors" is named and demonstrated once when Elara absorbs the garden's essence, feeling its history and connecting to the pendant. The method enables her conversation with the keeper but does not recur or constrain later choice. It appears in setup and middle but not in closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The frozen garden is present throughout, provides atmosphere, and is the site of all action. The mist and cold are absorbed via the interiorizing method. However, the setting does not constrain movement, supply a resource, or alter the final choice—Elara could wait anywhere. The garden's beauty influences mood but not tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Through the veil of sleep" is mentioned once as a metaphor ("as if the garden existed in a dream"), but no timeframe constrains the action. There is no clock, no deadline, no pressure from temporal limit. The phrase is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Make friends with uncertainty" is named as Elara's motivation and invoked at closure, but it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. The decision to wait aligns with this stated motivation without friction—no competing desire forces a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is named late ("the foggy lucidity of her thoughts settled into clarity") and describes the narrator's tone throughout—dreamlike yet precise description, abstract diction mixed with concrete image. The tone is consistent across beats and modulates slightly at closure (shift from questioning to resolve). However, it does not charge the final image with fresh pressure; the mood remains static.</comment>
