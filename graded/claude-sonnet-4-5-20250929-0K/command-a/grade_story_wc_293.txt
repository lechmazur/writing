<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Bridge-Song remains abstractly conceived—"dynamically observant" functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains choices. The fiddler's journey feels propelled by external clues (the glass flake, scaffold wraps) rather than internal contradiction or embodied struggle. Motivations are declared ("to sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") but never dramatized through competing impulses or visible cost. The hitchhiker exists only in summary, undercutting relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as weakly Causal with accumulative texture attempted. The Orientation Test passes by ~120 words (mountain pullout, fiddler, glass flake), but the closure—Bridge-Song raising the fiddle after discovering the sanctuary—lands as convenient arrival rather than earned transformation. The glass flake's "pixelated" images function as a vague treasure map; no because/therefore chain shows how observation narrows options or imposes a choice with visible cost. The final "gateway" and melody declare resolution without on-page reconfiguration of prior stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mountain pullout is visually sketched (peaks, railing, breeze) but supplies no spatial constraint or resource that alters tactics. The hidden clearing appears when the plot requires it; overgrowth and scaffold wraps are mentioned without showing how Bridge-Song navigates or uncovers them. The glass flake is handled repeatedly but never charges the final image through specific environmental interaction—it simply "feels warm" and then becomes "clear and whole" without materialized mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the hitchhiker's secret—is signaled early but never tightens through on-page reversal or trade-off. Bridge-Song's journey is a straight upward hike: each clue yields the next without misreading, dead end, or cost. The clearing's discovery and the sanctuary's revelation arrive as data downloads rather than pressure points that foreclose options. No visible price (stamina, resource, alternate path abandoned) shapes the final act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—"sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'"—is stated twice and never embodied in a concrete choice or image that reweights prior material. "Pixelated amnesty" floats as jargon; the sanctuary's meaning remains abstract ("a place for those who dare to defy fate") rather than grounded in particulars. The final fiddle melody asserts luminous possibility without showing what was risked or lost to arrive there. Thematic closure is told, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Bridge-Song; no head-hopping. Diction cycles through template phrases: "dynamically observant," "luminous disbelief," "scaffold wrap flutters." Perceptual signature is generic—what a fiddler notices versus what anyone would notice is indistinguishable. Psychic distance stays uniform; under urgency (the hike, the uncovering), syntax and rhythm do not tighten or compress. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy loop and scaffold debt: "dynamically observant" appears three times, "pixelated" four times, "luminous disbelief" twice; "scaffold wrap flutters" is repeated verbatim. Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening (glass flake description) and middle (recounting the hitchhiker's words). Key beats—finding the clearing, unraveling layers—are summarized in passive gerunds ("began to unravel") rather than dramatized. Template cadence runs appear: "Bridge-Song [verb]… the fiddler [verb]…" Figurative language ("melody of possibility") in the final line feels imposed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise—mysterious object leads protagonist to hidden sanctuary—is template-adjacent; the hitchhiker's vanishing and cryptic clue follow familiar treasure-hunt mechanics. "Pixelated amnesty," "scaffold wrap flutters," and the wet-plate glass flake read as prompt-generated curiosities rather than organically integrated inventions. The fiddler-as-seeker angle is underused; no musical perception or improvisation inflects the journey. No turn or final image surprises in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Bridge-Song anchors every beat but makes no meaningful choice—each step is observation → deduction → advance. The final act (raising the fiddle) declares transformation without prior conflict or trade-off that the character's decision altered. Present throughout but functionally passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The glass flake is handled in the opening, studied mid-story, held aloft at the end—three touches. Its "pixelated images" guide the map but mechanics remain vague; how fragments "align with the landscape" is asserted, not shown. It enables plot but could be swapped for any cipher object. No visible cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Pixelated amnesty" is named twice and explained as "liberation" and "a place." It never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page—it's a destination label, not a shaping stake. Ornamental concept use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Dynamically observant" is labeled three times but never enables or constrains an action with cost. Bridge-Song notices clues that always yield progress; no trade-off between careful observation and speed, no misreading that compounds. Attribute without friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Recount" appears once in mid-story: "Bridge-Song began to recount the hitchhiker's words." This beat is summarized rather than dramatized, and the recounting itself does not generate a turn—it transitions to the hike. Functional but replaceable with "remembered" or "pieced together."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Scaffold wrap flutters" is mentioned twice: as a phrase the hitchhiker used and as a gesture remembered. The method's mechanics are never shown—how wrapping layers encode a map is asserted at the clearing but not dramatized. It resolves a problem it did not help create earlier.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The mountain pullout anchors the opening and supplies the glass flake's discovery site. It does not constrain movement or provide a resource that alters outcome—Bridge-Song leaves it and it never returns. Setting as static backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the hitchhiker vanishes" frames causality but does not impose a time constraint. The hike and discovery occur in vague duration ("the sun climbed higher"); no deadline or clock tightens decisions. Timeframe as premise label, not pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"To sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" is stated twice and declared as Bridge-Song's motivation. It is never dramatized through a choice where possibility conflicts with cost or safety. Told desire without on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Luminous disbelief" appears twice as a label; tone reads as reverent/mysterious throughout without modulation under pressure. The final paragraph shifts to triumphant ("melody of possibility") but the tonal charge is asserted, not built from prior doubt or resistance. Static mood labeled rather than embodied.</comment>
