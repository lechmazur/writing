<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation remains entirely declarative—"to seek out the joy beneath anguish" is stated but never tested by contradictory impulses or difficult trade-offs. Her actions unfold as smooth discovery without genuine internal friction; she absorbs clues and advances without mistakes, hesitation, or cost that would reveal character under pressure. The mentor's death is mentioned but never dramatized as present grief that complicates her choices. Embodied emotion is absent: no sweat, tremor, or breath-catch when stakes should tighten.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by ~120 words (servant, spire, elevator, diary). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Elara collects diary pages and clues across floors without because/therefore causality or situational pressure forcing stance. Closure arrives as epiphany—"her quest had never been about solving a mystery but about understanding her own heart"—but this realization lacks on-page cost; no option is foreclosed, no tactical shift visible. The final paragraph asserts warmth and purpose without demonstrating what she renounces or pays.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire is vividly rendered with aurora light, frosted interiors, and thinning air by the fifth floor. Sensory detail (breath clouds, prism rainbows, scattered light) is purposeful and reflects urgency in mid-floors. However, spatial choreography within each floor remains vague—crates, clocks, portraits float without clear layout. The goggles and scattered light charge the final observatory image, qualifying the micro-setting function and lifting the score into the 6-band despite limited tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode the diary to understand the mentor's message) is signaled early but never tightens into a dilemma or trade-off. Elara collects clues in sequence without opposition, failure, or cost that alters tactics. The encryption dissolves conveniently when the key is found; no puzzle requires sacrifice or error. The ending asserts emotional warmth without demonstrating what she gave up or what path closed. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required—here, none narrows options or changes knowledge with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme ("joy is not the absence of anguish but the light that shines through it") emerges from the diary text itself, not from dramatized struggle or choice. The scattered light motif recurs but remains decorative—Elara never uses it to solve a problem or forgo an option. The ending epiphany is told rather than earned through on-page particulars: "she had found her purpose" summarizes rather than charges the final image. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into platitude without ambiguity or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filter is present—goggles amplify light, breath visible in cold—but diction lacks character-specific texture; phrases like "her resolve strengthening" and "her heart alight" read generic rather than voice-particular. No dialogue appears (appropriately, given solitary journey). Psychic distance remains consistent but the prose does not modulate rhythm or syntax under rising stakes; each floor receives similar syntactic treatment regardless of urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "unfolded" recurs (map, clock face, drawer, diary, elevator doors) without pattern payoff or varied meaning. Template cadence is evident—"She [verb], [gerund]" structures repeat across beats. Stock metaphors cluster: "heart quickening," "resolve strengthening," "warmly inquisitive," "heart alight." The final paragraph stacks four abstract assertions in succession without concrete image or action, flattening the closure beat. Applying cumulative artifact penalties (paraphrase loop −0.4, template cadence −0.4, stock metaphor −0.3, closure-beat summary −0.4) yields a baseline around 4.9 with −1.5 total non-closure debt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—servant climbs tower solving encrypted diary mystery—follows a familiar treasure-hunt template without transformation. The ten-floor elevator structure is mechanical rather than causally motivated; floors could be reordered without altering stakes. Scattered light and goggles recur but remain ornamental; removing them would not break the plot. The epiphany (quest was internal all along) is a well-worn reversal delivered without fresh particulars. No risk-taking in structure, voice, or thematic calculus distinguishes this from median fantasy-quest templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her "ascending servant" status is label-only; no on-page choice dramatizes her social position or tests her against a master, peer, or constraint tied to servitude. She collects clues without meaningful reversal. Ornamental presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The goggles appear in the opening, amplify light on floors 1, 5, and 10, and are mentioned in the portrait (floor 8) and final paragraph. However, their function is purely descriptive—they "catch" or "reflect" light without enabling a tactical choice or foreclosing an option. Swappable with any lens or heirloom object. Mid-band functional use but no causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is introduced in the opening, drives Elara's goal (decode it), and unlocks at the climax with the key. It shapes two major beats (floors 2 and 10) and provides the thematic epiphany. However, the encryption is never an on-page obstacle—she simply finds the cipher book and key without trial. Present across setup, middle, and closure but lacks felt cost or tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is asserted twice (opening and floor 2) but never constrains a choice or creates friction. Elara's curiosity operates without cost—no dangerous risk, no passed opportunity. Label-only trait without on-page tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Unfold" recurs across five beats (map, book pages, clock face, drawer, diary) but the action is interchangeable—opening, revealing, or examining would serve equally well. No single unfold moment drives a reversal or changes stakes. Template repetition without causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Scattered light" appears on floors 1, 2, 5, and 10 as ambient description (aurora through windows, stained glass, prism, observatory glow) but never functions as a method—Elara does not use light to decode, navigate, or solve a problem. Ornamental motif without mechanical role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The icebound spire is established early, supplies atmospheric pressure (cold, thinning air, frozen clocks), and frames the closure observatory scene where scattered light and goggles combine. Each floor provides a discovery site, and the vertical ascent structures the narrative arc. However, the setting does not constrain tactics—Elara faces no environmental obstacle or spatial puzzle. Present across all three gates with closure participation, earning mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ten-floor elevator climb is signaled in the opening, parcels the middle (floors 1, 2, 5, 8 named), and culminates at floor 10. The chime recurs to mark transitions. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Elara may linger or rush without consequence, and no clock forces trade-offs. Functional structure but passive; no tactical urgency tied to ascent speed.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To seek out the joy beneath anguish" is stated in the opening and echoed in the mentor's diary quote and final paragraph, but the motivation is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costly choices. Elara pursues the goal without friction, doubt, or sacrifice. Told motivation without on-page test.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is attempted through third-person distance and sensory focus, but the tone flattens into uniform reverence without modulation. No ironic tension, wry observation, or cooling distance at peak emotional beats. The final paragraph ("her heart alight") breaks into unearned warmth without the detachment the phrase promises. Static mood rather than charged interplay.</comment>
