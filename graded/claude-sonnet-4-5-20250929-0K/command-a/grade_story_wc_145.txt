<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistently pursued, but her "subtly confident" demeanor operates mostly as a label without on-page contradiction or cost. The final choice—kneeling by the stream and accepting the discovery—lacks earned tension; no previous action genuinely threatened her goal or forced a tradeoff. Interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("storm of thoughts brewing," "her heart quickened") rather than character-particular thought patterns. The tears "not of joy but of understanding" edge toward diagnostic self-awareness that no one has mid-crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph without penalty. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding replaces pursuit), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path appears on the page. The falcon's return and the condensation pattern function as coincidental clues rather than choices that narrow options. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern-driven discovery), held consistently, but the final image ("her new journey") resets rather than reweights prior stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and ice fissure are vivid and purposeful. The mist and condensation pattern anchor both perception and the discovery beat, fulfilling the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is clean—desk to window to lake's edge to fissure—with sensory detail filtered through Elara's cartographic lens ("veins of a map"). One deduction: the phrasebook's "dog-ear marking the page for 'source'" is told rather than shown in handling, and "worrying tranquility" as an atmospheric phrase feels imposed rather than emergent from concrete detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the river's origin—is signaled early and pursued on the page. However, escalation is flat: Elara walks, notices, kneels, and finds without genuine obstacle or reversal. The falcon, mist, and fissure guide her forward rather than forcing tradeoffs. The "faint vibration beneath" and "thinner ice" offer mild discovery beats but no pivot where agency forecloses an alternate path. Cost is claimed ("understanding") but not demonstrated; no visible price alters tactics or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—origin, convergence, the quest for source—emerges from imagery (condensation as map, rivers hidden beneath ice) and the phrasebook motif. The final image (adding a language "of the river itself") gestures toward non-literal resonance but edges close to overt symbolism. "Her new journey" in the closing line is a theme statement rather than an image that reweights prior material. Subtext is present in the falcon as herald and the "worrying tranquility" backdrop, though neither operates with enough tension to complicate the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and consistent with a cartographer's observational idiom ("dog-eared," "coordinates," "tributaries branching out in perfect symmetry"). Under stress, however, the prose does not compress or intensify—sentences in the discovery beat remain measured and explanatory. Filter verbs cluster without voice motivation ("felt a faint vibration," "noticed something unusual"). The phrasebook dialogue with self ("She added one more, in her own hand, the language of the river itself") feels expository rather than embodied action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean; no causality-breaking loops. However, paraphrase cycles appear: "the pattern of condensation" is described twice in adjacent beats (window glass, then "the pattern again" at the lake center) without added pressure. Stock metaphors recur: "storm of thoughts," "her heart quickened," "tears welled in her eyes." Register drifts slightly elevated in peak beats ("singular convergence," "defying the frozen stillness") without stress-driven motivation. Template cadence surfaces in "She knelt... She stood... She walked" sequences. Density is moderate; many sentences do double duty, but the closure paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the final moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cartographer seeking a river's source is a recognizable quest-archetype with mild specificity in the phrasebook and condensation-as-map motifs. The frozen outpost and falcon add atmospheric texture but do not transform the premise through non-obvious logic or moral calculus. The ending's emotional note—"not of joy but of understanding"—is asserted rather than earned through a surprising synthesis. The piece executes competently within genre but does not take structural or thematic risks that heighten stakes or offer fresh inflection beyond the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation (atlas editor) frames her perception. However, her choices are passive: she observes condensation, follows the falcon's return, walks toward mist, and kneels at the fissure. No decision alters tactics or forecloses an option. "Dry-witted" is claimed in the opening phrase but never demonstrated in speech or thought. The final act—adding a language to the phrasebook—is symbolic rather than a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in three beats: desk (dog-ear on "source"), closing it before the walk, and the final beat where she adds a language. The dog-ear is mentioned twice but never handled or used to solve a problem. The object seeds expectation and returns with mild reweighting (adding "the language of the river"), satisfying a lyric reprise. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; its role is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" is named twice: once as "a reminder of her lifelong motivation" and again in the penultimate paragraph ("the singular convergence she had sought"). It functions as a thematic label rather than a stake that shapes on-page tactics. The condensation-as-map and fissure discovery could illustrate convergence, but the concept itself does not change Elara's options or force a choice. Present but replaceable with "quest" or "discovery" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" is asserted in paragraph two ("Elara's subtly confident demeanor") and echoed in the closing line ("her subtly confident spirit now at peace"). No action demonstrates how subtle confidence constrains or enables a choice under pressure. The trait is ornamental, serving as a character label without visible cost or tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The falcon's return is mentioned in the opening paragraph and again when it lands beside her at the end. It marks turning points and prompts her to step outside, but the action does not drive a major turn—Elara was already searching for the source. The falcon functions as a herald (per the prompt's phrasing) but is easily swappable with another sign (weather change, dream) without redefining options. Present in setup and closure but causally soft.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"The pattern of condensation on glass" appears in paragraph one (window) and is reprised as mist rising from the lake's center ("the pattern again"). It cues her to follow the mist to the fissure, shaping one key choice. However, the mechanics are vague—how condensation mimics river veins is told rather than shown in functional detail. The method is signaled and returns, but its operation does not constrain attempts or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake anchor every beat: desk, window, walk, lake's edge, fissure. The thinner ice near shore and the fissure itself supply the discovery resource. "Rusted walls a reminder of the world she was leaving behind" adds mild thematic charge at the closure turn. The setting pressures movement (cold, snow, ice) and enables the find, satisfying setup, middle, and closure. Slightly below essential because the outpost interior (desk, floorboards) is postcard detail that does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the falcon returns" anchors the opening timeframe and Elara steps outside immediately after, but no live clock tightens decisions thereafter. The walk to the lake and discovery unfold without temporal pressure or urgency. The falcon's return marks a moment rather than a countdown that alters moves. Present in setup but does not constrain middle or closure choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To find where the rivers begin" is stated explicitly in paragraph one and drives every beat: tracing the phrasebook, following mist, kneeling at the fissure. The motivation is clear and consistent. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted—no cost or competing desire complicates the pursuit. The final tears and "understanding" assert fulfillment without on-page friction between want and price. Strong presence across beats but lacks the tension required for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Worrying tranquility" is named in the opening line and echoed in the closing paragraph ("the quiet, worrying tranquility of the frozen lake"). The tone—still yet unsettling—coheres through the falcon's silence, the "faint vibration," and the mist. However, it remains static; no modulation occurs under pressure, and the final image resolves to peace without tonal friction. Present in setup and closure with mild thematic charge but does not escalate or reweight the dominant stake through tonal shift.</comment>
