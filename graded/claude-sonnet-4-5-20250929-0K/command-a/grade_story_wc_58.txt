<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The traveler's interior work is present but remains abstract—"to write obituaries for the living" and "understand the geography of healing" function as declarative labels rather than embodied contradictions. The encounter with the elderly woman offers a glimpse of witness-as-action, but the traveler never faces a consequential choice that costs her something or forecloses a path; she observes, writes, and departs unchanged. The woman's transformation is told through tears and thread-exchange rather than dramatized through resistant micro-choices. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("geography of healing," "monument of hope") in reflective passages weakens specificity at key beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (traveler, shadowed garden, post-ship twilight) land early and remain stable. The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, the thread-as-talisman motif, and the final exchange aim to reweight meaning. However, closure lacks decisive cost—the traveler receives a second thread and leaves "her journey far from over," which gestures toward continuation rather than a foreclosed path or resonant reconfiguration with felt consequence. The obituary-reading beat offers a micro turn but doesn't narrow options or alter the traveler's stance in a way that charges the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "scent of fallen leaves and damp earth," "golden patches on the ground," "faint scent of woodsmoke." The garden's twilight atmosphere coheres and supports the tone of lonesome splendor. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, path, trees, horizon—and the thread objects are handled concretely. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the closure; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure that alters tactics or the final image, capping the score below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding "the geography of healing" through witnessing—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or tradeoff. The woman's waiting and weeping provide a passive tableau; the traveler's act of writing and reading the obituary aloud proceeds without friction, cost, or a choice that forecloses an alternative path. The thread exchange at the end is gifted without sacrifice, and the traveler's internal state does not visibly tighten or deepen. Under the Accumulative lens, one expects a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost; here the final image ("part of the same tapestry") declares synthesis without demonstrating it through on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images: threads, the ship, the obituary ritual, shadows as repositories of secrets. The obituary for "the version of herself that had waited in vain" offers a resonant idea, and the thread motif recurs with purpose. However, the final lines ("story of absences explained, of lives lived and remembered in their lonesome splendor") tip into thematic summary rather than letting the image speak. The piece invites reflection but resolves into a stated moral—connection through witness—rather than a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with ambiguity. Subtext in gesture and silence is present but undercut by expository declarations at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored to the traveler's perception. Diction is controlled and the prose has a distinct, literary texture: "her footsteps crunched softly," "the shadows held secrets waiting to be uncovered." The woman's sparse dialogue ("I've been waiting for the ship") carries naturalism and subtext. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("geography of healing," "monument of hope," "tiny obituaries for the day that had passed") that reads more as authorial reach than the traveler's specific perceptual signature under pressure. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is sharp in many beats: "her footsteps crunched softly," "the rustle of leaves that sounded like whispered conversations." Clarity and concision are generally strong. However, several lines loop or scaffold: "The thread was her talisman, a reminder of the intricate patterns people wove into their lives, only to see them unravel in moments of loss" paraphrases the concept rather than advancing pressure; "her silence a permission granted" and "a quiet hymn in the stillness" rely on stock metaphor. The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("tapestry," "lonesome splendor," "geography she sought") in a way that dulls propulsion. No egregious template cadence or filter stacks, but figurative density near closure reduces information density without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering a modest penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—writing obituaries for the living to witness and honor lost selves—offers a fresh angle on grief and witness. The thread motif and the ritual of reading the obituary aloud are specific and purposeful. However, the core scenario (solitary figure encounters grieving stranger, offers ritual comfort, exchanges symbolic object) follows a familiar template of redemptive encounter without a bold twist or non-obvious moral calculus that transforms the archetype. The emotional specificity is present but not deeply contradictory, and the resolution into "connections that bound people together" leans toward consensus wisdom rather than a singular, risky synthesis. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: the template is transformed through the obituary conceit but not fully personalized with lived friction or a destabilizing turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The traveler's profession and purpose frame the story and drive the obituary-writing beat. She makes micro-choices (approaching, sitting, writing, reading aloud) but none alter her tactics or foreclose a path with cost. Observation without consequential decision dominates; she functions more as catalyst than agent whose choices create reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The thread appears early (satchel), is handled and described ("relic from a life she had once known"), and returns with added meaning when the woman gives a second thread ("from the palace carpet where we danced"). Two beats, both with purposeful use, and the final image ("now part of the same tapestry") reweights prior material. However, the thread does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it accumulates symbolic weight without altering tactics, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Explained absences" is named in the opening and illustrated through the woman's vigil for her absent husband and the traveler's ritual of writing obituaries for "those who had lost themselves in the labyrinth of their own absences." The concept shapes the thematic lens and motivates the traveler's presence. However, it does not generate a tactical choice or on-page friction that narrows options; it remains an interpretive frame rather than a story-engine that alters what the protagonist can or cannot do.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" is demonstrated throughout: "golden patches on the ground," "rustle of leaves that sounded like whispered conversations," "the way the sunlight filtered through the canopy." The trait is enacted consistently across multiple beats. However, descriptive density does not constrain or enable a consequential action with cost; it enriches atmosphere but does not alter tactics or outcomes, keeping the score in the mid-6s despite strong execution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Intimate" appears in the traveler's approach ("her movements intimate, as though she were entering a sacred space") and the close, quiet exchange on the bench. The beat is present and fits tone. However, the action is not the turn-maker; the writing and reading of the obituary could proceed without the "intimate" quality explicitly shaping resistance or choice. Swappable with "gentle" or "careful" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Projecting presence" is named once ("She projected her presence gently, not as an intruder but as a witness") and the obituary-reading functions as a ritual of witness. The method is signaled but its mechanics—how projection works, what it costs, how it differs from ordinary listening—are not dramatized. It does not shape a visible attempt or constrain the traveler's options; it reads as thematic claim rather than a pressure-bearing method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The shadowed garden in autumn is anchored early, described with sensory specificity (fallen leaves, damp earth, fading light, longer shadows), and provides a coherent frame for the encounter. The setting supports tone and atmosphere across multiple beats and appears in the title image ("shadowed garden"). However, it does not supply a resource or constraint that alters the traveler's or woman's choices; it remains evocative backdrop rather than micro-setting that pressures tactics, just missing the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last ship sails" is established in the opening line and motivates the woman's presence ("My husband was supposed to be on it"). However, the "after" does not impose urgency or tighten decisions; time is atmospheric rather than a live clock. The scene unfolds "as the light faded" and "as the first stars appeared," but these markers do not alter tactics or constrain the traveler's ritual, keeping the score in the functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To understand the geography of healing" is stated as motivation and referenced in the traveler's reflection ("the geography of healing was not about distance but about the spaces we create"). The desire frames her purpose but is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. She pursues the goal without friction, temptation to abandon it, or a trade-off that tests commitment. Told motivation with thematic echo; lacks on-page tension between want and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is coherent throughout: the solitary traveler, the empty garden, the waiting woman, the vivid yet melancholic sensory detail. Tone modulates subtly (crispness of arrival, stillness of the bench scene, quiet intensity of the obituary reading, elegiac quality of the thread exchange) without breaking unity. The final image ("lonesome splendor") directly reprises the tone and charges the closure, meeting the three-gate test and contributing causally to the ending's resonance.</comment>
