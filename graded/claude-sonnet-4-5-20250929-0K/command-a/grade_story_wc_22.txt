<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The coachman remains a static symbolic figure rather than a character with contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict. His motivation is declared ("to let a garden reclaim a battlefield") but never tested or complicated by competing desires or tangible costs. The interiority consists entirely of abstract philosophical musing ("a bridge between the past and the present") without embodied emotion or character-particular thought patterns. No micro-choices under pressure reveal hierarchy of values; he simply executes his predetermined symbolic action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The piece lacks on-page closure with felt cost: the coachman plants seeds, surveys his work, and departs unchanged, with no decisive reversal, crystallized stance under pressure, or visible price paid. The narrative is purely sequential (and-then structure) without because/therefore causality or meaningful escalation. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive reasonably early, but the "after the reef died" timeframe and "gloom-hill" location remain abstract placeholders never concretized or used to constrain choice. The piece reads as a single illustrative tableau rather than a story with earned transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is present and occasionally vivid ("scent of salt and decay," "knees creaking like old hinges"), and the blooming jetty contrasts desolation effectively. However, the setting remains largely decorative: neither the jetty's structure, the twilight timing, nor the post-reef ecology meaningfully constrains the coachman's choices or alters his tactics. Spatial choreography is minimal (he kneels, stands, returns to carriage) but clear. The "gloom-hill" and reef-death frame are named but never dramatized as obstacles or resources.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The stated stake ("let a garden reclaim a battlefield") is declared early but never tested or tightened by opposition, resource scarcity, or competing priorities. The coachman encounters no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and experiences no reversal; he completes his planting and departs satisfied. There is no escalation under any lens: no causal narrowing of options, no accumulative density shift, no situational pressure forcing stance crystallization. The "spark of something new—possibility" is asserted rather than earned through dramatized cost or forfeited paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of renewal and healing emerges clearly from events and imagery (wildflowers defying desolation, seed pods releasing potential), avoiding direct moralizing until the final paragraph's summary ("not the size of his actions but the depth of his intention"). However, the ending paragraph becomes a thematic essay ("a lesson etched into the soil") that replaces scene pressure with explicit statement, triggering the penalty for final-paragraph moralizing. Subtext operates in the contrast between decay and bloom, but the piece never complicates its central question or offers counter-readings; the coachman's vision is validated without friction or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains consistent. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature: diction is elevated and literary throughout ("shrouded in twilight's embrace," "narrow vastness") without modulating under pressure or reflecting character-particular filters. Sentence rhythms are syntactically varied but tonally uniform. The coachman's "ancient" perspective is asserted but not enacted through specific idiom, bias, or selective attention. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Multiple line-level patterns accumulate: paraphrase loops ("a bridge between the past and the present, a way to honor what was gone while nurturing what could be"), template cadence in the opening ("His eyes… His voice… The coachman's words… The coachman's motivation"), stock metaphors ("canopy of green," "whispers of hope"), and figurative density in nearly every sentence without pressure variation. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("narrow vastness," "submerged concord") that clashes with embodied action. These artifacts cluster throughout including the closure beat, triggering the artifact-in-final-third disqualification and −1.4 baseline in Q7. Information density is low: many sentences restate the same thematic content.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise (solitary figure healing a ruined landscape through symbolic gardening) follows a familiar template without fresh transformation. The "speaks dead languages," "understands bird calls," and "after the reef died" elements remain ornamental labels rather than irreplaceable particulars that reshape the familiar frame. Emotional truth is sacrificed to symbolic convenience: the coachman's internal life is generic elevation rather than specific struggle. The piece reads as a response to prompt elements rather than an organic vision, and the final image (stars as benediction) echoes pastoral convention without surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The gloom-hill coachman is present throughout but makes no key turns or decisions under pressure; he executes a predetermined symbolic action (planting seeds) from beginning to end without complication, reversal, or trade-off. His "choices" are purely procedural (kneeling, placing pods, climbing into carriage) rather than stake-altering. He observes and philosophizes but never wrestles with competing options or pays a visible price. Late appearance avoided but ornamental use throughout: −0.8 for swappability, −0.7 for no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The seed pods appear in the opening paragraph and return in three beats: clutching them at the jetty, placing them in soil, storing them in the carriage. However, their use is static and procedural rather than evolving: they remain "dried," "brittle and hollow" throughout without reweighted meaning or tactical shift. They do not constrain choice or shape a reversal. Present in closure scene (stored beside him) but not causally active there: no cameo credit. Two-beat involvement +0.9, but ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Submerged concord" is mentioned twice as an abstract thematic echo ("a plea for submerged concord," "harmony… submerged concord rising") but never shapes on-page stakes, constrains tactics, or alters the coachman's options. It remains a decorative phrase rather than a concept that changes what he can or must do. Label-only trait −0.3, ornamental −0.8, no causal pressure −1.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Speaks dead languages" is mentioned once in paragraph two and once in paragraph six as a label ("a keeper of dead languages") but never enables or constrains an on-page action. The coachman "spoke in a language long forgotten" to spirits, but this has no dramatized consequence, cost, or tactical implication. The trait could be removed without altering any beat. Label-only −0.3, ornamental −0.8, swappability −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Fertilize" appears explicitly in paragraph two ("began to fertilize the soil with the seed pods") and is restated in the final paragraph ("fertilizing the earth… fertilizing the soul"). This action is central to the tableau and frames the coachman's purpose, but no major turn traces to it: he encounters no obstacle, makes no adjustment, experiences no reversal tied to the act of fertilizing. The action could be replaced with "plant" or "sow" with minimal structural change. Two-beat involvement +0.9, but no causal pressure tightening options −1.0, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Understanding bird calls" is mentioned in paragraph two ("guided by the understanding of bird calls") and paragraph four ("listened to the bird calls once more. They spoke of harmony"), but the mechanic is never shown or used: we do not see him interpret a call to choose a planting site, adjust his method, or make a tactical decision. The method is asserted but not dramatized. Present by first third +0.5, but summary-only −0.8, no causal work −1.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "blooming jetty at twilight" is established in the opening and returns in multiple beats: the flowers "seemed to defy the desolation," "grew taller" under his care, and the jetty "began to transform." Twilight deepens in paragraph four, modulating atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain the coachman's choices or supply tactical obstacles; it provides backdrop rather than pressure. Early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage (implicit in "blooming jetty" transformation) +0.4, but ornamental postcard use −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the reef died" is mentioned in the opening paragraph and implied in "a world after the reef died," but the timeframe never tightens decisions, creates urgency, or alters the coachman's tactics. No clock pressure is felt; the piece operates in an eternal, mythic present without time-driven stakes. The reef-death frame could be replaced with any other past catastrophe. Ornamental −0.8, swappability −0.7, no causal pressure −1.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To let a garden reclaim a battlefield" is stated explicitly in paragraph two ("His motivation was clear") and echoed in the final paragraph, but the desire is never dramatized through conflicted choice, competing wants, or trade-offs. The coachman pursues this goal without friction, cost, or obstacle; it is told rather than shown under pressure. Told-only use −0.8, no friction between want and cost −1.0, but early signal +0.5, closure echo +0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Narrow vastness" appears explicitly in paragraphs three and seven, and the tone is coherent: elevated, elegiac, mythic throughout. The tone does not modulate meaningfully with pressure (there is no pressure), remaining uniformly reverent and abstract from opening to close. However, the phrase "narrow vastness" does charge the final image by reappearing in the penultimate paragraph, reweighting the coachman's small acts with cosmic significance. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, but static mood −0.5, no pressure modulation −0.6.</comment>
