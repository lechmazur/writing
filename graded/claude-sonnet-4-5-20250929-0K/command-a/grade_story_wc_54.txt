<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is stated ("puzzle out new equations for hope") but remains abstract throughout; his choices—opening vents, propping mirrors—feel illustrative rather than pressured by internal contradiction. The "stoic wonder" and transformation proceed smoothly without visible cost or foreclosed paths. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("functionally creative mind began to turn") and the final realization arrives as an epiphany rather than through dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is present (abandoned terminal, Eli alone, post-carnival timeframe) but the closure unit—Eli's realization that the terminal is a story and his departure with the sextant—lacks on-page cost or a legible decision that forecloses options. The terminal's "response" to his tinkering is asserted rather than causally demonstrated; the leap from mechanical adjustments to "living exhibit of possibility" is told, not earned. The drive lens wavers between causal (adjustments → change) and accumulative (atmospheric buildup), but neither delivers a decisive shift or felt price at the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The terminal setting is vivid (cracked tiles, torn banners, broken vents) and Eli's manipulation of air and light mirrors his thematic work, lending mild constraint to his activity. Detail remains selective and atmosphere coheres, but the space does not pressure a key choice or charge the final image with cost—it serves as backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding hope equations through structural resurrection—is signaled early but never tightened by opposition or sacrifice. Eli's experiment proceeds without reversal, obstacle, or visible trade-off; the terminal "responds" conveniently. The ending declares transformation ("new equation for hope") without showing what was risked or lost, leaving escalation flat and cost asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (hope through reinvention, navigating intention) is woven through imagery (sextant, maze, flows) but the final paragraph delivers an overt thematic statement ("new equation for hope... resurrection and reinvention") rather than a resonant image. The sextant's symbolic function is explained rather than charged by the ending action, reducing subtext to exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice is stable and literary ("stoic wonder," "maze of intentions frozen in time") with consistent psychic distance. Some diction leans elevated ("relentless pursuit of hope," "testament to human ambition") in ways that feel imposed rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("began to notice," "felt a stoic wonder") are present but not obtrusive, and the perceptual signature remains coherent across the piece.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Syntax varies and clarity is maintained, but several phrases loop conceptually ("maze of intentions" appears three times; "puzzle out" and "equations for hope" recur without reweighting). The final paragraph stacks thematic summaries rather than propelling through image. Template cadence is mild ("He picked it up... noticed intricate engravings... felt like a key") and does not obscure causality, but density suffers from scaffold phrasing ("more than a relic," "not just a place").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—intern resurrects abandoned spaceport via systemic tinkering—is functional but the emotional arc and thematic payoff (finding hope through reinvention) are familiar templates executed without sharp particularity. The sextant and "maze of intentions" feel like decorative motifs rather than irreplaceable narrative engines; substituting them would leave the structure largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eli is present throughout and his curiosity drives exploration, but his role as "civil engineer intern" remains label-only; engineering knowledge does not constrain or enable a key turn with cost. His choices (opening vents, propping mirrors) illustrate theme but do not alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sextant piece is handled early (discovery, engravings noted), guides Eli's experiment thematically, and returns at closure ("in his pocket"). It appears in three beats but its specific properties (navigation tool, brass, engravings) do not mechanically constrain a choice or reweight the ending image with visible cost; swappable with another artifact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" is invoked three times as metaphor (corridors, kiosks, protagonist's inner state) but does not structure on-page stakes or force a tactical choice. It remains thematic label rather than a lived constraint that alters Eli's options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is mentioned once as a trait ("his functionally creative mind began to turn") but never demonstrates a tradeoff or enables a specific action with cost. No visible friction or constraint tied to this attribute on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Resurrect" shapes the middle action (redirecting air, light, speakers) and the ending declares success ("transformed the terminal into a living exhibit"). The action is central but the mechanics are summarized and the outcome lacks on-page consequence; swapping "revitalize" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" (air, light, memory) is signaled mid-story and executed in the climax, but the mechanics are told rather than shown in tactical detail. The method appears but does not constrain attempts or generate friction; it solves the problem it was introduced to solve.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal anchors all action, supplies the objects Eli manipulates (vents, mirrors, speakers), and its desolation-to-vitality arc mirrors theme. It pressures Eli's choices by providing both ruin and potential, and the final image (terminal "preparing for another day") depends on this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the carnival had packed up and left town" establishes a post-event frame but exerts no ticking pressure on Eli's choices. The timeframe is static backdrop; removing it would not alter tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated early and restated at closure, but remains abstract—no on-page friction between this desire and competing costs or fears. The motivation labels rather than drives conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is invoked explicitly ("Eli felt a stoic wonder") and the tone mixes contemplation with modest awe. It coheres across the piece but does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image with intensified resonance; one static register.</comment>
