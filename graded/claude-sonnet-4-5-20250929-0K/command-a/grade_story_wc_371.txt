<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to find the sacred in the ordinary") but her interior remains generic label-speak without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The planting action never encounters resistance or cost that would reveal character under pressure. Her emotional state is described ("sense of peace") rather than dramatized through perception shifts or bodily response. The discovery of the plaque feels convenient rather than earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes setting and protagonist adequately but lacks a causal arc. Elara's discovery of the plaque and the bread's appearance are coincidental plot furniture rather than motivated beats that narrow options. The ending offers mood ("deep sense of peace") but no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing that reconfigures prior material—just confirmation of her existing belief. Under an inferred Accumulative lens, the lack of meaningful tightening or pattern break at closure leaves the stakes unchanged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard is vivid and consistent, with sensory detail (damp earth, fading blooms, chamomile and jasmine) filtered through Elara's focus on restoration. The secret tea house provides spatial coherence across moves. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara encounters no locked door, rival gardener, or physical obstacle. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring beauty to the courtyard—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, complication, or tightening challenges Elara's methods or forces a trade-off. The plaque discovery and bread appearance affirm rather than complicate her quest, and no visible cost (time, resource, social friction) emerges on the page. Coincidence supplies solutions (bread, plaque) without protagonist agency driving escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of finding the sacred in the ordinary is woven through imagery (bread, plaque, garden) with some restraint. However, the plaque's inscription directly states the theme ("The sacred is found in the soil of the ordinary"), and the final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing resonance. The bread as recurring motif appears but never shifts meaning or constrains a choice; it remains symbolic furniture. The ending offers mood without a non-literal thematic answer that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The perceptual filter (Elara's focus on growth and restoration) is consistent but not distinctive—diction and syntax are competent yet generic, lacking idiosyncratic rhythmic signature. Filter verbs ("she thought," "she wondered") appear frequently without voice motivation. Under emotional peaks (the plaque discovery), the prose remains uniform in cadence and register rather than tightening or fragmenting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean, but information density is low: multiple sentences restate Elara's mission without advancing pressure ("Her method was as unconventional as her quest: guerrilla gardening" adjacent to "Her actions were heuristically gentle"). Template cadence appears in the opening ("a reminder that," "a woman who") and in the closing ("they were all pieces," "a reminder that"). Stock metaphors ("canvas for renewal," "ritual of restoration") and summary blocks ("As she ate, her mind wandered") slow momentum without payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise—guerrilla gardening in a palace ruin with mysterious bread—assembles familiar elements (urban restoration, quest for meaning, vanished place) without a fresh synthesis. The plaque conveniently confirms the protagonist's existing belief rather than challenging it. Emotional beats follow predictable arcs (discovery → affirmation → peace) with no risk or subversion. The "vanished bakery" bread is intriguing but underutilized, appearing only as inert symbol.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara notices shifts (bread, plaque) but her observations do not create key turns or alter tactics—she continues planting regardless. The "creeping normality noticer" title is declared but not dramatized through a choice that hinges on that perception.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The bread appears twice (wildflowers, tea house table) but remains static description. It is touched and eaten in one beat, yet its presence does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure. Swappable with any mysterious object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named and echoed thematically ("she felt a sense of tenuous absolution wash over her") but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. It remains an abstraction rather than a lived constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" is mentioned once as a label for her actions ("heuristically gentle, each movement calculated to minimize harm") but never constrains a choice or incurs a visible tradeoff. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears twice: once for beauty beneath decay (thematic claim) and once when Elara physically removes ivy to reveal the plaque. The second use drives the plaque discovery, a meaningful beat, but the action itself is easily swappable with "clear," "reveal," or "dig." Functional causal role in one beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is signaled early (satchel, trowel, planting seeds and lavender) and appears in multiple beats (wildflowers, ivy removal, lavender planting). The method shapes her physical actions across the courtyard. However, it does not face friction or constraint—no resistance, cost, or tactical adjustment—and the ending does not hinge on it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The secret tea house and overgrown palace courtyard anchor all action and provide coherent spatial choreography. The tea house serves as sanctuary and the courtyard as canvas. The setting appears in setup, middle (tea house reflection, ivy removal), and ending (return to tea house). However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics—postcard function elevated by consistent presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" is mentioned in the opening line as seasonal marker but does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or alter tactics. Time remains vague and untracked throughout. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the sacred in the ordinary" is declared early and drives her planting actions across beats. It appears in her thoughts and is confirmed by the plaque. However, the desire is never conflicted—no friction between this want and a competing cost or fear. Functional across beats but lacks dramatized tension.</comment>
