<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal life is largely absent; we see her positioned as defiant and determined but never experience contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her realization about the shell and synchronization arrives as declarative insight rather than embodied struggle—"It was then that she realized" bypasses the messy cognition of discovery. The statues crumble conveniently without forcing Elara to renounce anything or face a visible cost that forecloses a path. Motivation remains label-only: "beauty" and "defiance" are asserted but not dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. A decisive change occurs on the page—statues fall, orchard heals—but the closure lacks felt cost; Elara simply succeeds without sacrifice or foreclosed option. The causal chain from "shell pulses" to "roots attack statues" reads as convenience plotting: the shell's mechanics are never established, so the escalation feels authored rather than earned. The inferred lens is Causal but linkage is weak; the shell's signal property appears only when needed, not through motivated discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard and sky-bridge provide vivid spatial grounding; the statues and roots are concretely staged during the climax. However, most environmental detail remains postcard description—"tapestry of tarnished wonder," "iridescent surface"—rather than shaping Elara's choices. The locust shell constrains one choice (pressing it to her chest) and charges the final image (glowing, then inert), meeting the micro-setting test for the 9+ gate, but the orchard itself never limits tactics or resources during the confrontation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore the orchard versus statues' mechanical grip—is signaled early. One tightening occurs: Elara's realization about synchronization narrows her tactic from passive music to active heartbeat merging. Yet this turn is unmotivated by prior agency; she intuits the method without trial, error, or cost. The statues advance but dissolve without forcing a trade-off; roots solve the problem the protagonist did not help create. Escalation exists but the final act substitutes deus ex machina roots for protagonist-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—beauty reawakening a mechanical world—emerges through image (shell glow, orchard brightening) rather than sermon. However, the ending states its moral overtly: "beauty could be reawakened, even in the most mechanical of worlds" is thesis summary, not resonant particulars. The locust shell functions as symbolic convenience, introduced weeks ago but its key property revealed only at closure. The "gap between knowing and understanding" frame is asserted in exposition rather than enacted through Elara's struggle; no micro-choice dramatizes this gap with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is thin—Elara's way of noticing (musician, sky-bridge dweller) colors only a few beats ("resonantly soft melody," "bow moving with steady determination"). Diction occasionally inflates: "tarnished wonder," "forgotten dream," "beacon of hope" lean toward generic lyricism rather than character-specific texture. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "began to") appear frequently but remain voice-consistent. Under peak stress (statues advancing, roots erupting) the prose maintains rhythm without compression or collapse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no spatial confusion or pronoun ambiguity. However, paraphrase loops and stock phrasing recur: "delicate thread weaving through the silence" / "thread connecting the mechanical world to the beauty it had lost"; "fragile yet persistent" / "fragile space" / "fragile thrum." Template cadence: "She knew... She knew... But she didn't yet understand..." Figurative language saturates without pattern-teaching: "tapestry," "serpents awakened," "beacon of hope" stack without payoff. Sentence openings vary moderately but information density is low; many lines rephrase prior content. Apply −0.8 for loops and stock metaphor strings under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Core premise—artist's defiant music versus authoritarian statues—follows a familiar template (art awakens oppressed world). The locust shell as magical key and heartbeat synchronization as breakthrough method read as convenience magic rather than specific invention. "Tarnished wonder" and "mechanical rhythm" are evocative but not transformed through lived detail or moral calculus. The orchard's self-defense via roots is swappable with other nature-strikes-back devices. No fresh inflection; emotional arc (lone defiance → triumphant restoration) proceeds without surprise or non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Sky-bridge violinist establishes identity and defiance in paragraph one; her music is present in all five paragraphs. However, Elara's choices are limited: she plays, realizes, places the shell, and continues playing. The key turn—shell synchronization—is intuited rather than decided under competing options. Present across beats but decisions do not meaningfully alter tactics; the roots act autonomously.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Locust shell appears in paragraph two (found weeks ago), returns in paragraph four (pressed to chest), and is mentioned at closure (glowing, then inert). Three beats. Setup is late (second paragraph, ~20% in); middle beat (pressing to chest) enables the climax. Closure participation is passive—it glows as marker, not causal agent. Swappable with another keyed object; its iridescence and pulse are descriptive rather than mechanically specific.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Breaking free is the stated goal (paragraph three: "how to break free from the suffocating grip") and the outcome (paragraph eight: "She had broken free"). The concept frames stakes but does not shape tactics on the page; Elara never attempts and fails a lesser escape. Present thematically throughout, but tactics (synchronize heartbeat, let roots act) are convenient rather than constrained by the breaking-free problem.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" describes the violin's melody in paragraph one. It recurs as "melody softened" in the final paragraph. Label-only; the softness never constrains action or enables a choice with visible cost. If loudness or harshness mattered, the adjective could swap without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Uproot appears in paragraph six: "roots began to uproot themselves, twisting and writhing... wrapping around [statues'] stone forms and pulling them into the earth." This action directly causes the statues' defeat and the orchard's reclamation, the story's decisive change. Setup is implicit (orchard's magic, paragraph three); payoff is unambiguous. The verb "uproot" is essential; "entangle" or "ensnare" would not carry the same self-liberation resonance. However, the action is performed by the environment, not the protagonist, limiting integration with her agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Heart rhythm signaling is introduced in paragraph four ("her heart beat in sync with the rhythm of her music, a steady pulse that seemed to resonate with the shell") and enacted in paragraph five ("her heartbeat merging with the rhythm of the orchard"). Setup and payoff are present. However, the mechanics are never tested or constrained; Elara succeeds on first attempt without cost or friction. The method resolves a problem (statues) that it did not help create earlier. Cap at 4.6 per late introduction (~50% in) and resolution-without-complication.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Enchanted orchard policed by living statues is established in paragraph one, grounds all five paragraphs spatially, and directly shapes the climax—statues advance, roots counterattack. The setting supplies the antagonist (statues) and the decisive resource (roots). Setup, development (statues scan and advance), and payoff (roots pull statues into earth) are all present. The orchard's "heartbeat" (paragraph four) becomes the synchronization target. However, the orchard itself is reactive; it does not constrain Elara's choices until she activates it. Strong causal role but protagonist interaction is one-way.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"The gap between knowing and understanding" is declared in paragraph three as "where Elara lived, her existence suspended in that fragile space." It recurs obliquely in the final line: "her music a beacon of hope in the gap between knowing and understanding." Present as thematic frame but never tightens decisions or tactics; no clock or live deadline pressures Elara's synchronization attempt. Timeframe is abstract rather than durational.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>To reawaken beauty in a mechanical world is stated in paragraph three ("how to restore the orchard's glory") and the ending ("beauty could be reawakened"). The motivation frames the goal but is not dramatized through conflicted choices; Elara never faces a trade-off between beauty and another want. Present across beats (music as defiance, synchronization attempt, orchard's color return) but told more than tested. The final success lacks friction or cost tied to the motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Tarnished wonder" appears in paragraph one ("tapestry of tarnished wonder") and recurs implicitly in the ending ("tarnished wonder of the trees began to shimmer, their colors brightening"). The tone—faded magic under mechanical oppression—is coherent through the rising action. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure; the prose remains elevated and lyrical even during the climax. The final image restores brightness but the tarnish metaphor is not charged with cost or ambiguity, trending toward decorative symmetry.</comment>
