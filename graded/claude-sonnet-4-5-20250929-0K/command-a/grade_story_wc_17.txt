<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Echo Cartographer's motivation is stated but not contradicted in action; her "sensitively perceptive nature" remains label-only without embodied cost or tradeoff. The protagonist's choices (sifting diaries, following the map, pressing the wall) are functional but lack internal conflict—she moves from clue to clue without genuine struggle. The final realization ("the walls didn't dream of the past; they dreamed of being remembered") arrives as epiphany rather than earned insight, and the burden's transformation ("it no longer felt heavy. It felt like purpose") resolves tension without visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive early (ivy passage, waterfall, climate-shifted world) and the lens reads as Causal with mosaic undertones. The closure unit—placing the film strip on the pedestal and receiving the window's validation—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt: Echo gains purpose without paying a legible price on the page. The scholar's vanished fate seeds stakes, yet Echo's path to the chamber (map appears clear in firelight, wall gives way) progresses through convenient revelation rather than motivated struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, waterfall, and hidden chamber are vivid and consistent. The film strip catching light to reveal the map is a strong micro-setting moment that constrains Echo's next move. However, the passage functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active pressure: the ivy "seems to watch" and "parts for her," but these gestures remain metaphorical rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discovering what walls dream about) is signaled early but remains abstract; no immediate cost or opposition tests it until the final chamber. The diaries provide a warning ("To listen is to lose oneself") that could deepen jeopardy, yet Echo reads them without consequence. The wall's yielding and the pedestal's acceptance of the film strip resolve the quest through revelation rather than a choice that forecloses options or exacts visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme—walls dream of being remembered, and the cartographer honors rather than maps—emerges through image (the mirror-window, the ivy parting) without overt statement. The "legacy's burden" shifts to "purpose" in a way that feels thematically coherent but lacks ambiguity or counter-reading: the ending grants validation without complicating Echo's mission. The film strip and diaries function as motifs but do not accumulate charged meaning across beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction ("ivy-veiled," "serpent," "her sensitively perceptive nature") leans elevated and occasionally generic ("the faint hum of history, the sigh of forgotten stories"), but voice is consistent and legible. Free indirect style is clean; perceptual filtering is reliable. No dialogue present to assess, and the prose remains functional without a distinct rhythmic signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean; no pronoun drift or tense breaks. Minor paraphrase loop: "she thought she glimpsed something—a flicker of light, a shadow of movement. But when she blinked, it was gone" offers image without advancing pressure. Stock metaphors ("twisted like a serpent," "fingers," "pulse") appear in succession without fresh inflection. The final paragraph's transformation ("the burden remained, it no longer felt heavy. It felt like purpose") uses tell-efficient summary rather than embodied change, flattening the closure beat's charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—cartographer seeking walls' dreams through climate-shifted ruins—combines familiar elements (ruin exploration, legacy quest, symbolic map) without a fresh synthesis. The scholar's vanished fate and the diaries provide setup, but the map-as-key and mirror-window resolution follow expected genre moves. The final insight (walls dream of being remembered) is thematically coherent yet predictable, lacking the non-obvious turn or moral calculus that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Echo Cartographer is present throughout and her decisions (entering the passage, reading diaries, following the map, placing the film strip) drive the plot. However, her choices do not face meaningful opposition or cost; she observes and follows clues rather than making trade-offs. The role is functional but replaceable with any explorer archetype without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The film negative strip appears in three beats: carried as talisman, slips near fireplace and reveals the map, placed on pedestal at closure. Its transformation (damaged outline → clear map under light) shapes the middle turn and participates in the ending. However, it resolves a problem (finding the chamber) it did not help create earlier, and swapping it for another map artifact would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" is stated in paragraph one and reprised in the final paragraph ("the burden remained, it no longer felt heavy"). It frames Echo's motivation but does not constrain on-page choices or create visible friction. The transformation from burden to purpose is asserted rather than earned through cost, leaving the concept thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is introduced early ("allowed her to hear what others couldn't") but remains label-only. It enables Echo to hear the walls' dreams and catch faint diary writing, yet no tradeoff or cost is shown—other explorers could perform the same actions without the trait. The attribute is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Glimpse" appears in two beats: Echo glimpses a flicker in the wall crack (paragraph two) and glimpses the scholar's life through diaries (paragraph four). The second use drives a key revelation and links to the film strip's clarity. However, the action is passive observation rather than a choice that redefines options, and swapping "glimpse" for "see" or "perceive" would not alter structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are found in the fireplace (paragraph four), sifted through, and read to reveal the scholar's fate and the walls' riddle. This discovery enables Echo to understand her mission and primes the film strip's reveal. The method is signaled, dramatized, and shapes middle escalation, but it does not participate directly in the closure unit (the pedestal and mirror-window).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is anchored early, revisited throughout (ivy curls, walls close in, passage narrows, ivy parts at the end), and supplies the hidden chamber. It provides atmospheric pressure and the film strip reveals its pre-ivy state, yet the passage does not impose a tactical constraint or alter Echo's choices—she moves through it without obstacle or cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"After the climate shifts" is mentioned once in paragraph two as world context. It explains the waterfall's presence and the passage's state but does not create urgency, tighten decisions, or constrain tactics. The timeframe is ornamental rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To discover what walls dream about" is stated in paragraph one and resolved in the final chamber ("the walls didn't dream of the past; they dreamed of being remembered"). The desire drives Echo's entry and shapes the thematic closure, but it is not tested or conflicted on the page—no friction between this want and another cost appears. The motivation is functional but not dramatized with visible trade-offs.</comment>
