<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's phobias are stated but never shown embodying her choices under pressure. The "trembling certainty" oscillates mechanically rather than creating genuine contradiction in action. Her adaptive skill is asserted ("firmly adaptive, a skill honed from years") but remains label-only; the decryption sequence lacks visceral struggle or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final mirror-room epiphany arrives as therapy-speak ("You are not what they made you") rather than earned through dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but lands as assertion: mirrors crack into light without legible cost or tactical consequence. Causality is thin—the seashell "guides" and "glows" without established rules, the key appears conveniently in a hidden compartment, and the final voice delivers the thesis rather than letting image do the work. The Orientation Test passes (library, Elara, post-discovery timeframe by ~80 words), but escalation reads as spatial relay (shelf→cast→door→mirrors) rather than because/therefore pressure. The drive lens wobbles between Causal (decrypt notes→find key) and Accumulative/Textural (symbolic objects) without cohering at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is vividly anchored early with "iron beams groaning," "rust and old paper," and starlight through roof gaps. The seashell and cast function as micro-setting objects that constrain the search sequence. However, spatial choreography inside the library remains vague—shelves, a table, a back door, a mirror room—without clear distances or access logic. The stars watch but do not pressure choice; the setting provides atmosphere more than tactical constraint, though the locked door and key do gate progress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaim identity, expose betrayal—is signaled early but remains abstract. The decrypt-notes beat offers one tightening (pattern emerges, key found), yet the cost is invisible: no failed attempt, no trade-off, no live option foreclosed. The seashell's increasing glow and the unlocked door provide spatial progression but not escalating pressure; Elara's phobias "recede" without on-page struggle. The mirror-room moment attempts a turn but resolves via voice-over epiphany rather than protagonist agency with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme ("vulnerability is power," identity reclamation) is stated in the final paragraph rather than arising from particulars: "She had outwitted the betrayal, not with strength, but with vulnerability." The mirrors-as-selves and seashell-halves function as symbolic tokens without constraining prior choice. The closing voice delivers thesis ("You are not what they made you. You are what you choose to be") in place of a resonant image. No counter-reading or ambiguity invites reflection; the moral is telegraphed rather than earned through embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—"her heart pounded," "her breath catching"—lacking character-specific filter. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("timeless embrace," "coalesced into a single, clear voice") that sits uneasily with stunt-double pragmatism. The seashell's whisper as "a language she couldn't understand but felt in her bones" gestures toward interiority but remains vague. Voice is competent but lacks the rhythmic control or embodied specificity that would elevate it under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Multiple template cadences and loops lower momentum: "trembling certainty" appears three times, "vulnerability" and "outwit" recur without reweighting, and phrases like "her phobias warring with her determination" restate rather than advance. Stock metaphors ("shadows deepening as if acknowledging her resolve") and filter stacks ("she felt," "seemed to") dull immediacy. The decrypt sequence is summarized ("Slowly, a pattern emerged") rather than shown with concrete notation. No single artifact obscures closure, but cumulative scaffold drag applies −0.6 in Q7; pervasive loops and unlanded figurative language ("whispers coalesced," "mirrors...shattering into light") add another −0.4, total −1.0 within the non-closure accumulation cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—identity-fraud mystery in a fantastical library—combines familiar elements (magical archive, talking artifact, mirror revelation) without fresh synthesis. The decrypt-notes method and seashell-half motif feel ornamental rather than inevitable; substituting a different cipher or talisman would require only surface edits. The mirror-selves and "vulnerability is power" thesis echo template empowerment arcs. No risk-taking or non-obvious moral calculus distinguishes the execution; the story reads as checklist synthesis rather than singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her profession is stated, but her stunt-double skills and phobias do not constrain on-page choices. The decryption and key-use beats could be performed by any puzzle-solver; no moment turns on feigned bravery or calculated risk specific to stunt work. Label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The seashell appears in three beats: initial mention, pressed to ear during decryption, placed beside its other half at closure. Its whisper guides spatially but the mechanism remains unexplained; its glow in the final third is late and convenient. The closure reprise reweights meaning (reunion of halves = wholeness) but the cost tied to the object itself is abstract. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with lyric reprise, but swappable with another artifact of reunion.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal is named in the notes ("a life stolen and rewritten") and frames Elara's motivation, but the betrayal itself remains off-page and vague—who betrayed her, when, and how are never dramatized. The concept shapes the search stakes but does not create on-page tactical friction or visible cost. Functional presence in theme, not in pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" is asserted twice but never shown. The decryption sequence does not demonstrate adaptive problem-solving with visible trade-offs; Elara traces symbols and a pattern "slowly" emerges without iteration, failure, or constraint. Label-only mention; the trait could be removed without altering any beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Outwit" is claimed in motivation and resolution ("she had to outwit her unseen enemy," "She had outwitted the betrayal") but the on-page action is solve-and-proceed: find cast, trace notes, discover key, unlock door. No feint, misdirection, or tactical cleverness is shown. The verb is swappable with "uncover" or "solve" without structural change. Functional but generic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The cast with smudged notes appears once, in the second beat. Elara traces symbols and a pattern emerges, but the decryption mechanics are summarized ("a mix of symbols and letters, some smeared beyond recognition...Slowly, a pattern emerged") rather than shown. The method does not constrain tactics—no wrong turns, no legibility struggle, no cost. Present but ornamental; introduced ~30% in, capped at 4.6 for late setup, lowered further for summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The library is vividly anchored early (rust, stars, iron beams) and houses all action. The locked door gates the climax and the mirror room provides the closure setting. However, the setting supplies atmosphere more than tactical constraint; Elara moves freely without environmental friction (e.g., unstable shelves, darkness, cold). Three-gate presence (setup, middle, payoff) but causal pressure is modest; the library could be swapped for another archive with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The discovery ("after discovering she wasn't who she thought she was") is stated in the opening and frames motivation, but no on-page action dramatizes the discovery itself or its immediate aftermath. The timeframe does not tighten decisions—no urgency, no deadline, no mounting external pressure. Time within the library is elastic ("Hours passed, or perhaps minutes"). Present as backstory frame, not as live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To prove that vulnerability is power" is stated explicitly in paragraph three and again in the resolution. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice; Elara's vulnerability (phobias, trembling) is mentioned but does not create on-page friction or cost. The mirrors moment delivers the thesis via voice-over rather than embodied proof. Label-only presence; the motivation could be replaced without altering action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Trembling certainty" recurs three times and colors descriptions ("trembling certainty," "unshakable"). The tone blends fear and resolve, matching Elara's stated duality. However, the tone remains static rather than modulating with pressure; the final beat shifts to triumph without intermediate destabilization or cost. Present and consistent, but does not charge the closure image with fresh intensity or reweighted meaning.</comment>
