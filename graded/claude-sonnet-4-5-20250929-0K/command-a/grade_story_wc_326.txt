<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The "heartbeat counting" habit is mentioned but never constrains a choice or reveals character in action. Interior voice relies on therapy-speak ("anxiety of her uncertain existence," "survivor of an error") and the final emotional arc feels declared rather than earned through prior causality. The digital ghost interaction lacks embodied tension—no micro-choices show her wrestling with fear, doubt, or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: patterns in ink align with screen data, leading to a voice that confirms her erasure. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elara "smiles" with a "steady heartbeat" after the revelation, soft-resetting the anxiety established earlier. The defragmentation process and ghost's materialization happen mostly off-stage; the voice's wisdom arrives without forcing a trade-off or foreclosing a path. The final image reweights the shard and observatory but without undeniable pressure or felt loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow is vividly established with sensory detail (frosted dome, aged wood, visible breath). The porcelain shard and inkblot function as micro-setting anchors that charge the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara's keyboard work proceeds unimpeded, and the snow serves atmospheric function rather than pressure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the death certificate error—is signaled early but remains abstract. The defragmentation sequences as a single extended action without reversals or meaningful tightening; luck and the ghost's voice resolve the mystery without protagonist agency forcing a trade-off. The ending declares wisdom "fetched from failure" but no on-page choice forecloses a path or pays a visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is required; the inkblot-to-data alignment offers pattern intensification, but the closure lacks felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of fetching wisdom from failure is overtly stated in both opening and closing paragraphs rather than emerging from particulars. The porcelain shard shifts from "broken promise" to "reminder of fragility and strength" via assertion, not earned scene work. The final paragraph moralizes: "She was a survivor, not of death, but of the system"—thematic echo that replaces resonance. The digital ghost's voice offers platitudes about "choices, paths untaken," without specific grounding in Elara's prior actions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filtering is present (breath visible, heartbeat counted) but diction frequently shifts into elevated register inconsistent with the moment: "ephemeral patterns," "defragment the data," "echo of what might have been." No dialogue to assess. The heartbeat motif is mentioned repeatedly but does not modulate with scene pressure—it "quickens," then "steadies" in summary fashion. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew") appear frequently in the final third, dulling immediacy at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The ghost was tied to the shard, to the ink, to her very being. It was as if the universe was trying to communicate..." Adjacent sentences restate without added pressure. Template cadence in paragraph four: "She worked through the night... The observatory's ancient computers whirred... As the defragmentation progressed..." Metaphor density spikes without payoff: "swirling like galaxies," "danced like fireflies," "glistening like a thousand opals" in quick succession. Stock phrases abound: "her heart quickening," "the first light of dawn." These artifacts cluster near closure, dulling the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—digital ghost accessed through inkblot patterns and defragmentation—gestures at originality but executes through familiar "error in the matrix" and "lost timeline" tropes without transformation. The death certificate mistake, porcelain shard, and opal observatory feel ornamental rather than organically synthesized. Emotional beats follow a template arc: confusion → investigation → revelation → acceptance. The ending's "sanctuary" and "bridge between physical and digital" reads as conceptual assertion rather than earned synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her choices do not create key turns. The death certificate error motivates investigation but she does not face a dilemma or make a decision that alters tactics. The story happens to her via the ghost's voice; she listens and accepts. Setup present, but no middle choice constrained by this attribute, and closure is receptive rather than active.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The porcelain shard appears in three beats: opening (traced, "jagged like a broken promise"), middle (glows during defragmentation), and end ("remained on the desk, a reminder"). Early signal strong, middle participation functional but passive (it glows without Elara using it), and closure reprise reweights it from "broken promise" to "fragility and strength." Two-of-three gates met, charged reprise present, but the object does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The digital ghost is introduced early ("after the radio static cleared"), drives the defragmentation investigation, and materializes at closure via the radio voice. Setup and payoff gates met. It shapes stakes (understanding the erasure) and the ending image ("a part of her future"). However, it does not narrow options or force a trade-off; Elara receives wisdom rather than wrestling with the ghost's implications. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Mentioned three times (opening, mid-investigation, ending) but functions only as label-only descriptor. The heartbeat counting never constrains a choice, reveals character under pressure, or alters tactics. "Her heartbeat quickened... steadied" summarizes emotional state without demonstrating how the habit matters. No cost tied to this attribute on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Defragmentation is the central action, introduced early and occupies the middle investigation sequence. It enables the ghost's voice and data alignment, participating in closure. However, the mechanics are vague—Elara's "fingers flew across the keyboard" without obstacles or reversals. The action could be swapped for "decode," "reconstruct," or similar with minor edits. Two gates met (setup, payoff) but middle involvement lacks specificity and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The inkblot patterns appear early (paragraph two) as "ephemeral patterns, swirling like galaxies" that "were data." This method seeds the defragmentation investigation and returns when "the inkblot began to shift, its patterns aligning with the data." Setup and middle development present; the means shapes her investigation approach. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how ink patterns become data is asserted, not demonstrated—and the method does not impose a cost or constraint. Late penalty avoided; swappability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow is established immediately with vivid detail and returns in the final image ("snow outside glistening like a thousand opals"). Setup and closure reprise strong. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome—Elara's investigation proceeds unimpeded by cold or isolation. The observatory transforms from "forgotten relic" to "sanctuary" via assertion in the final paragraph. Lyric resonance present but no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the radio static clears" anchors the opening and the radio returns at closure with the ghost's voice, creating setup and payoff. However, time is vague in the middle—"She worked through the night" compresses investigation with no clock pressure or tightening. The midnight/dawn framing is atmospheric rather than tactical; no decision is forced by elapsed time. Two-of-three gates barely met; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to fetch wisdom from failure" is stated in paragraph one and restated at closure ("she had fetched wisdom from failure"). Early signal present and closure callback strong. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized—no on-page moment shows Elara wrestling with failure or choosing wisdom over another want. The ghost's voice delivers wisdom to her; she does not struggle for it. Lyric reprise without friction between wants and costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Midnight solace is coherent throughout: cold observatory, "thick with... forgotten secrets," "alone with her thoughts," closing on "the first light of dawn" and "midnight solace" explicitly named in the final paragraph. Tone is stable rather than modulating with pressure—the investigation passages carry the same reflective register as the opening. The tone charges the final image by naming itself, which weakens organic emergence. Setup, middle consistency, and closure all present; modulation under pressure weak.</comment>
