<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("cartography of scars") is told rather than dramatized through choices under pressure. The final decision to write "uncensored" arrives without visible cost or a prior scene showing what censorship actually foreclosed. Interior states are labeled ("furiously tranquil," "fear, hope, regret, all dissolving") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The envelope-opening beat lacks agency—Elara passively receives and reads rather than making a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The closure lacks visible cost: Elara begins to write with "freedom," but no prior scene establishes what was risked or lost by remaining censored, so the transformation reads asserted rather than earned. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and basic situation require assembly across the first two paragraphs without early anchoring (−0.4). The causal link from envelope arrival to "call to return" to writing is summarized rather than shown through on-page choices that alter tactics. The lens reads Causal by intent but executes as static revelation without because/therefore pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory supplies vivid atmosphere and the glass dome reflects Elara's shadow at a key beat, creating spatial presence. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara could perform the same envelope-opening in any isolated space. The storm functions as mood amplifier rather than tactical pressure, missing the micro-setting constraint needed for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—confronting the past via the map—is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; the envelope simply confirms what Elara "knew" it contained, and the storm "pauses" conveniently at the moment of clarity. The final act (beginning to write) lacks visible cost because no prior scene shows what censorship protected or what "uncensored" writing will forfeit. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of scars-as-truth emerges through the map conceit and is pursued with consistency. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("each word was a scar, each scar a story") rather than letting the image resonate, and Elara's smile and "peace amidst chaos" resolve complexity into tidy satisfaction without ambiguity. The cartography motif recurs but does not accumulate pressure—it is introduced, explained, then celebrated without friction or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, and the prose attempts an elevated register ("rarefy," "stormlit," "vigil in pause"). However, diction drifts into abstract constructions ("furiously tranquil gaze," "storm-kissed wonder") that feel ornamental rather than voice-motivated. The darkroom timer "ticked softly, its rhythm a counterpoint" and similar phrasing reads as authorial decoration rather than Elara's perceptual signature. No dialogue is present to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy appear throughout: "a vigil for the truths they were about to unearth" / "when masks slip, when the world reveals its raw, unfiltered self" restate the same idea; "fear, hope, regret, all dissolving into a singular clarity" is immediately followed by "They understood now why…" (−0.6 for loops). Stock metaphors ("lightning cracking like a whip," "storm's fury mirrored") and elevated register ("rarefy," "cartographer of scars") pile up without clear propulsion (−0.4 for density without payoff). Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "As [clause]" without variation (−0.3). The final paragraph summarizes the entire arc in tell rather than showing a single decisive image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—poet confronts past via mysterious map—follows a familiar template (symbolic object prompts epiphany in isolated setting). The "map of scars" conceit is visually interesting but not transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; the envelope conveniently contains exactly what the protagonist needs for closure without complication. The storm, darkroom timer, and bus timetable feel like checklist symbols rather than organic elements. No meaningful risk or subversion of expectation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics. The "censored poet" label is told in exposition; we never see a prior poem or a moment where Elara chose to censor versus reveal. The final act (beginning to write) is summary rather than a dramatized decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The darkroom timer is set early, ticks as atmosphere, and reaches "its final click" at the midpoint, plunging the scene into silence. However, it does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning—it functions as mood device rather than causal lever. Two beats (setting, final click) but no pressure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"A vigil in pause" appears twice as thematic label ("vigil for the truths," "The vigil in pause was over") but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The concept is echoed rather than dramatized: no scene shows Elara choosing to pause or the cost of resuming. It remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is applied once to Elara's gaze in the opening but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. The oxymoron is decorative rather than functional—no beat shows the tension between fury and calm altering a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Rarefy" appears once ("something rarefy within them—fear, hope, regret, all dissolving") as a synonym for "dissolve" or "clarify." It does not drive a turn or redefine options; easily swappable with "clarified" or "distilled." Ornamental vocabulary rather than plot-active verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The sealed envelope wedged in the bus timetable is present early and handled on-page (breaking the seal, unfolding the map). The bus timetable is noted as "a relic from another life" but its mechanics—why the map was wedged there—are not explained or used to shape attempts. The method is functional but not causally indispensable; the map could arrive any way.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is established early, supplies vivid atmosphere, and the glass dome is used in the final third to cast Elara's shadow. The setting shapes tone and provides isolation but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The storm "pauses" conveniently rather than forcing adaptation. Present across beats but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"When masks slip" appears once in exposition ("moments like these—when masks slip") and is not dramatized as a time constraint or decisive window. No on-page clock or urgency tied to this timeframe; it functions as thematic flavor rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To understand the cartography of scars" is stated as Elara's lifelong quest and the map literalizes it. However, the motivation is told rather than conflicted in choices—no scene shows Elara weighing the cost of understanding versus remaining ignorant. The map confirms rather than complicates the goal. Present in setup and closure but without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" is used once in the final act ("their pen moving with a storm-kissed wonder") as a tonal label. The storm is present throughout but the "wonder" register is not modulated under pressure—tone remains elevated and declarative rather than shifting with stakes. Static mood rather than charged progression.</comment>
