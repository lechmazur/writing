<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eli's gift of recognizing walks is label-only; it identifies Mira but never constrains a choice under pressure. The motivation "to prove whispers travel farther than shouts" crystallizes mid-story but remains abstract—no visible micro-choice trades subtlety against force. Mira's walk descriptions ("confident, almost taunting," then "softening") substitute for embodied contradiction. The key-turn at the wall is unmotivated by prior interiority; Eli's hesitation dissolves without cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph. The causal lens wobbles: the map "unfolds itself" and containers "groan as if alive" without taught rules, yet closure depends on a mechanical lock-and-key. The wall of containers appears suddenly with no prior setup, and Mira holding the matching lock is coincidence that resolves rather than complicates. Closure lands—passage opens, whispers validated—but cost is asserted ("the weight of the moment") rather than demonstrated through forfeited options or visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The port-city labyrinth is vivid early ("salt and rust," "metal corridors"), and the geomagnetic storm pulses through walls to raise atmospheric pressure. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. The key grows warm and the map shifts ink, but neither object physically constrains Eli's route or alters a tactic—they guide without friction. The storm intensifies at the climax but does not force a trade-off; it remains scenic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers outlast shouts—is signaled at the Mira encounter but never dramatized as a forced choice between subtlety and force. The wall of containers and matching lock arrive abruptly with no prior complication; coincidence (Mira holding the lock) solves rather than tests. One reversal occurs (blocked passage → key opens it), but agency is thin: Eli hesitates, inserts key, passage opens. No visible cost narrows later options; the storm subsides without price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emerged: "whispers held power" and "the quietest voices resonate the deepest" are thesis sentences, not scene-derived insight. The zodiac coin and folded map are tools-as-symbols without specific thematic friction; their meanings are declared ("all tools to uncover this truth") instead of discovered through contradictory choice. The final paragraph moralizes directly, replacing resonance with summary. No non-literal image reweights the premise; the "otherworldly light" passage is described, not charged by prior cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with good perceptual control: "whose job was to ensure the pathways remained navigable," "Eli realized." Diction is consistent and clean, avoiding filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: Mira's "Prove it" drives the beat. However, sentences share template stems ("The labyrinth seemed," "The key... felt," "The map was"), and the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature under pressure—interior texture remains neutral rather than character-particular. No mid-paragraph head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies adequately; no egregious loops. "The labyrinth seemed to resist... containers groaning... shadows stretching" stacks three simultaneous participial clauses in one sentence, blurring sequence. "The coin felt warm... almost alive" / "the key... felt heavy with purpose" / "the air thick with anticipation" recycles "felt/thick" constructions. Figurative density is moderate: "shadows stretching unnaturally long," "the labyrinth's whispers growing louder" remain legible but lean atmospheric. Opening and closing lines anchor adequately, though "the quietest voices resonate the deepest" is thesis rather than image. Clarity remains high; no major propulsion stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The labyrinth-as-test premise and mysterious-map-with-key plot follow familiar template arcs without fresh synthesis. The geomagnetic storm, zodiac coin, and walk-recognition gift are additive genre markers rather than integrated necessity. Mira conveniently holding the matching lock and the "otherworldly light" passage resolve via coincidence, not character-driven transformation. The thematic turn—whispers over shouts—is told rather than discovered through specific risk or embodied trade-off. Adequate execution within convention, but no bold angle that reweights expectation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eli is present throughout and makes the final key-turn, but the choice is reactive (Mira holds the lock; Eli inserts key) rather than altering prior tactics. The maintenance role frames setting familiarity but does not constrain a beat. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) without middle development cap at ~6.0; swappability and reactive agency lower to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The zodiac coin is found early, slipped into pocket, never handled again or returned with reweighted meaning. It does not constrain a choice or appear at closure. Ornamental mention; missing middle development and closure gates cap at 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The folded map appears early, "unfolds itself" to reveal paths, and guides Eli to the core—three beats. It enables navigation but does not narrow options or impose cost; any magical guide would serve equally. Setup, development (middle guidance), and closure participation (leads to wall) meet all gates, eligible ≥6.1, but swappability and lack of cost lower to low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Eli's walk-recognition identifies Mira and provides exposition ("a skill honed from years"), but it never enables or constrains an on-page action under pressure. Label-only trait; setup present, no middle or closure use. Cap 3.4 for missing development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's "Prove it" and the key-lock challenge drive the climax beat and gate the resolution. The challenge is present at closure and shapes Eli's final choice. Setup (Mira's desperation), development (encounter), and payoff (key-turn) are all present. Causal pressure is moderate—Eli hesitates, then acts—but cost is thin and the challenge could be swapped for any test-of-resolve without major rewrite. Mid-6s for solid presence across gates with modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The key is found early, noted as "heavy with purpose," and used at the climax to unlock the passage. Three beats: discovery, pocket carry with warming cue, final use. Setup, development (warming = rising relevance), and payoff gates are met. Causal: enables resolution. Specificity is moderate—Mira holds the matching lock, so the key's unique shape matters. Cost connection is weak; inserting the key incurs no visible price. Mid-6s for solid gate coverage and causal role, capped by low cost and moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is established early with vivid detail ("salt and rust," shifting corridors), frames all action, and the final wall of containers blocks progress at closure. Setup, development (navigational pressure), and payoff (wall obstacle) gates are met. Spatial choreography is coherent. However, the setting does not impose a specific tactical constraint or cost—any maze would serve. Swappability and lack of micro-setting friction (body, tool, or environment altering a choice) hold the score in mid-5s despite strong presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm is introduced early, "intensified" during the journey, and "reached its peak" at the climax, then "subsided" at closure. Three mentions across setup, middle, and ending meet all gates. However, the storm raises atmospheric pressure without tightening a decision—it does not force Eli to choose faster, sacrifice accuracy, or alter tactics. Swappable with any ambient crisis. Functional across beats but no cost linkage; mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The whisper-vs-shout motivation "crystallizes" when Eli hears Mira murmur and is validated in the final paragraph: "whispers held power." Setup (loneliness, Mira's murmur), development (crystallized motivation), and ending (thesis statement) are present. Yet the motivation is never dramatized as a conflicted choice—Eli does not trade stealth for speed or subtlety for force under pressure. Told desire with closure participation but no on-page friction or visible cost. Low-5s for gate coverage without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Calculated spontaneity" is referenced once in the phrase "With calculated spontaneity, Eli inserted the key," but the tone is not taught early or modulated across beats—the narration remains steady and descriptive throughout. The single mention at the climax does not reweight prior material or charge the final image. Late appearance, ornamental use, missing setup and development gates. Cap 4.6 for late intro; label-only execution lowers to low-4s.</comment>
