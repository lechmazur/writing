<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is articulated through abstract label-speak ("gentle radical," "retrocognitively trapped") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivation "to cradle empathy in arms of steel" reads as thematic declaration rather than embodied want/fear conflict. The mosaic work proceeds without visible internal friction or cost that would make renunciation credible. Interiority remains high-level summary ("she felt compelled," "she believed") instead of particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes plaza, mosaic, and Elara's reflective task by ~15% (orientation anchored). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density of reflection on mercy builds toward the final mosaic image. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options—Elara begins rearranging tesserae and completes the image without friction, obstacle, or a moment where cost forecloses a path. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt (the plaza "had become a beacon of hope"), but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized on the page. The "first step" framing defers closure rather than landing it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The plaza, minaret, shattered sky, and mosaic are vividly rendered and remain spatially coherent throughout. The tesserae constrain Elara's method (she traces, brushes, rearranges) and the mosaic charges the final image as the transformed canvas. Sensory detail is selective (acrid tang, ash, faint gleam) and filtered through Elara's retrocognitive focus. Micro-setting (the single gleaming tessera) briefly pressures her choice to rebuild, lifting the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—renaming their world through the mosaic to make mercy essential—is signaled early. However, the work proceeds without on-page opposition, resource constraint, or a moment where a live option is foreclosed. Elara rearranges tiles "guided by the chipped patterns" with no friction, error, or tactical adjustment. The piece asserts transformation ("the plaza began to take on a new life") but no cost or trade-off is dramatized. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift would suffice, but the final paragraph only declares hope without a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of aberrant mercy is articulated clearly and recurs across beats. "Aberrant mercy" and "renaming" function as motifs that accumulate meaning, and the mosaic's transformation from loss to hope offers a resonant image. However, the final paragraphs state the theme overtly ("she knew that mercy… would one day be the norm") rather than letting the mosaic image answer the question non-literally. The closing warmth "both gentle and unyielding" gestures toward the concept but remains abstract. Mid-band: theme present and coherent, but declared more than charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and consistent perceptual anchoring (Elara's retrocognitive drift, her hands on the mosaic). Diction occasionally slips into elevated register ("aberrant mercy," "cradling empathy in arms of steel") that reads prompt-adjacent rather than character-particular under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Reflection dominates but remains anchored to present stimuli (tessera, mosaic, wind). Voice is competent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or sentence rhythm that differentiates Elara's interior texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean and spatially coherent. However, template cadence pervades: multiple paragraphs open with "Elara's [noun]" or "The [noun]," and synonym loops recur ("renaming" appears eight times, often in adjacent sentences). Stock metaphors ("beacon of hope," "seeds of what she hoped to cultivate") and therapy-speak labels ("gentle radical," "retrocognitively trapped") cluster in reflective passages. Information density is moderate; many lines paraphrase the renaming project without advancing pressure. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for template cadence and synonym churn combined.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—rebuilding through metaphorical renaming via mosaic repair—reads as a standard post-apocalyptic hope motif without a fresh angle. "Aberrant mercy" is articulated but not dramatized in a choice that reveals non-obvious moral calculus. The mosaic rearrangement unfolds without surprise, friction, or a turn that reframes prior material. Elara's "gentle radicalism" is declared rather than shown through risky, specific action. The transformation test fails: swapping names and setting would leave the emotional arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara ("gentle radical") is the protagonist and on the page throughout. She makes one key choice—to rearrange the mosaic—but the decision occurs without visible friction, cost, or a trade-off that alters later tactics. The element is functional but her choices do not create turns; the arc is linear acceptance of a pre-existing motivation. Caps: missing middle development friction and missing closure cost tied to the character trait → cap 3.8 (swappability).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mosaic and tessera appear in setup (first paragraph), middle (Elara traces, brushes, rearranges), and ending (final image as "testament to aberrant mercy"). The tessera enables her method and the mosaic charges the closure image. However, the object's use remains consistent across beats without reweighted meaning—it is the canvas for her project from start to finish. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but no evolving significance: solid mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named four times and frames the thematic question, but it does not shape an on-page tactical choice or constrain options. The concept remains at the level of reflection and assertion ("mercy should not be a rarity"). Setup and thematic payoff are present, but middle development—a moment where aberrant mercy forces a trade-off—is absent. Functional but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is labeled in paragraph one and paragraph four, where Elara drifts to the moment the fire began. The trait enables her vision of past acts of mercy, which seed her project, but it does not constrain a present choice or impose a cost on the page. The element is present in setup and middle but does not visibly alter tactics or foreclosure. Label-only use and missing cost → cap 3.4 (missing middle development with cost).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Rename" and "renaming" appear eight times; the action is Elara's method and frames the entire arc. She renames by rearranging the mosaic, and the final image declares the plaza renamed. The action is present in setup, middle, and ending, but its execution is linear—no reversal or reweighted meaning. The element is essential to premise but the mechanics are repetitive assertion rather than evolving pressure. Solid presence across beats and closure, but swappable with "rebuild" or "reimagine" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Chipped patterns" appear in paragraphs two, four, and five. Elara traces them, is guided by them, and rearranges tesserae accordingly. The method is signaled early and shapes her attempts, but the patterns themselves do not impose friction or cost—they are a constant resource. Setup, development, and closure participation are present, but the element is a conduit rather than a constraint. Mid-band: one key beat involvement and closure linkage without unique causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ancient plaza and shattered sky are established in the opening line and recur throughout. The plaza is the sole location and the mosaic at its center is the locus of action. The shattered sky mirrors and then "seemed to soften" as Elara's work progresses, charging the final image. The setting does not constrain tactical choices (no access or resource pressure), but the spatial anchoring is strong and the sky's transformation in the ending contributes resonance. Two gates (setup, closure) with lyric reprise and closure linkage → eligible for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"After the great fire" anchors the story in a post-disaster timeframe. The fire recurs in reflection (paragraph four) as the pivot event that made mercy aberrant. However, the fire does not create a live ticking clock or pressure present decisions—it is historical context rather than an active constraint. The element is present in setup and middle reflection but does not tighten tactics or alter the ending. Functional but replaceable with "after the war" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated in paragraph one and echoed in paragraph five ("cradling empathy in arms of steel"). The motivation drives Elara's mosaic work and frames the thematic question. However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through a choice that reveals friction between want and cost. The element shapes the arc at the conceptual level but does not force an on-page trade-off. Setup and closure echo present, middle development with cost missing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is gestured at in "a heart both warm and cold" (paragraph one) and "a warmth spread through her, a warmth that was both gentle and unyielding" (final paragraph). The tone is coherent across the piece—reflective, elegiac, quietly determined—but it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image beyond assertion. The paradox is present in setup and ending but remains static; no tonal shift deepens the stakes. Lyric reprise without development → cap 4.6 (missing middle modulation).</comment>
