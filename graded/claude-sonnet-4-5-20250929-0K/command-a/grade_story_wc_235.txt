<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to distill chaos into narrative is clear, but her internal contradiction—envying past selves while seeking integration—resolves too smoothly without genuine cost. The epiphany ("You just forgot how to see it") arrives via dialogue oracle rather than earned struggle; the shift from jealousy to gratitude lacks the friction of a difficult choice. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The final writing moment feels declarative rather than a choice that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates dream-state images toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors by ~100 words (mountain cabin, Elara, scroll). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara moves from envying past selves to accepting continuity—but the cost is asserted ("weight lifting") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible price. The birch bark scroll's revelation ("The story is not in the past or future—it is now") lands as thematic statement rather than a constraining realization that alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin is anchored with sensory detail (pine-scented walls, kerosene lamp, sea of clouds) and the birch bark scroll is handled across multiple beats. However, setting remains largely atmospheric; the cabin does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. The scroll's glow and shifting markings charge the final image but remain decorative rather than mechanically integral to Elara's shift. Micro-setting criterion is partially met but the environment does not pressure the protagonist's options in a way that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—integrating fragmented selves—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Elara unrolls the scroll and drifts into the dream expanse, but the escalation is contemplative rather than driven by agency under duress. The past selves' dialogue ("You just forgot how to see it") resolves the conflict externally rather than through Elara's difficult choice. No visible price is paid; the "weight lifting" is told rather than shown as a forfeited path or tactical shift. One meaningful deepening occurs but lacks the felt cost required for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of self-continuity emerges through the birch bark scroll's shifting markings and past-self dialogue, but the final insight ("The story is not in the past or future—it is now") is stated overtly rather than earned through image and particulars. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration but leans on abstract philosophizing ("grateful for them, for they had led her to this moment") instead of a non-literal answer rooted in concrete action. Subtext operates in the scroll's glow and the past selves' appearance, yet the resolution feels tidied rather than ambiguous with lingering cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single first-person-limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric register ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder," "fingers brushing against eternity") that is consistent but edges toward elevated diction not fully rooted in the focalizer's lived idiom under stress. Dialogue, when present, functions to deliver theme ("Why do you envy us?") rather than advancing goal-driven subtext. Perceptual signature is poetic but generic; the scroll's "markings resolved into a language she didn't recognize but somehow understood" is convenience rather than character-particular cognition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but several phrases loop conceptually: "feral nostalgia" and "jaded wonder" recur as labels without evolving meaning; "chronologically confused thoughts swirling like leaves in a storm" and "fragments of her memories aligned" restate the same arc. Template stems appear: "She remembered—or thought she remembered" and "She felt herself lift off the ground, her body weightless, her spirit unbound" lean on stock interiority. No egregious clarity breaks, but figurative language in peak beats (scroll "pulsing," stars, mirages) accumulates without tight payoff. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double work but many serve atmosphere over propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lucid-dream-chronicler premise and the grave-with-own-name setup echo familiar portal-fantasy and existential-reflection templates without transforming them through non-obvious world logic or moral calculus. "Getting jealous of past selves" and the birch bark scroll as map-of-mind are conceptually interesting but executed with abstract labels rather than lived friction. The resolution—accepting continuity via dialogue oracle—follows a predictable arc from fragmentation to integration. Emotional truth is present but the synthesis feels median-safe rather than boldly particular to this voice and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara the lucid dream chronicler is present throughout and her role frames the stakes, but her key "choice"—opening her eyes and beginning to write—is not a decision that alters tactics under pressure; it is a post-epiphany action. She observes, drifts, and receives insight from past selves rather than making a difficult choice that forecloses a path. Setup and closure gates are met; middle development is observational rather than causal. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll appears early, is unrolled and traced mid-scene, floats in the dream expanse, and rests in Elara's lap at closure—three distinct beats. It shifts from "faint markings" to glowing map to legible sentence, reweighting from artifact to guide. However, removing the scroll and replacing it with any similar object (amulet, mirror, journal) would not break the story's logic; the mechanics are not specific to birch bark. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is moderate. Strong integration but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" is named early and described as "longing for moments she couldn't remember but felt deeply," shaping Elara's internal stakes. It drives her jealousy of past selves and the desire to integrate them. However, the concept functions more as thematic label than a mechanism that constrains on-page choices; Elara does not make a tactical decision forced by the nostalgia's wildness. Setup and thematic payoff gates are met; middle development is reflective rather than causal. Functional but not action-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is present in one line ("her chronologically confused thoughts swirling like leaves in a storm") but does not constrain or enable a visible action with cost. The trait labels her state rather than altering her options or forcing a tradeoff. Setup gate is met; middle and closure gates are absent. Ornamental use without mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Soaring appears in two beats: Elara remembers "soaring through a sky painted in hues of amber and violet" and later "felt herself lift off the ground" in the dream expanse. The action is central to the lyric reconfiguration but is a meditative drift rather than a choice that redefines options. Removing "soar" and replacing with "descend" or "float" would not break the story's logic. Setup, middle, and closure gates are met; causal pressure is moderate. Integral to tone but swappable in function.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Getting jealous of past selves" is signaled early ("a habit, a poison seeping into her veins") and drives Elara's internal conflict across the piece. The jealousy shapes her motivation and the dialogue with past selves addresses it directly. However, the method is resolved via external dialogue ("Why do you envy us?") rather than through a choice-driven mechanic that Elara enacts. Setup and thematic payoff gates are met; middle development is reflective. Shapes stakes but does not constrain attempts with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin is anchored early with vivid detail (pine-scented walls, kerosene lamp, window overlooking clouds) and brackets the story—Elara begins and ends there. However, the cabin does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome; it is atmosphere and frame rather than constraint. The cabin's isolation or altitude never alters Elara's tactics. Setup and closure gates are met; middle development is absent. Postcard use without mechanical integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After seeing your own grave" is established early ("Since then, her dreams had been plagued") and primes the stakes, but the grave visit itself is backstory and the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page. No live clock or deadline alters Elara's moves; time is untracked. Setup gate is met; middle and closure gates are weak. The element frames causality but does not constrain present tactics with urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To distill chaos into narrative" is stated early ("Elara's motivation was clear") and bookends the story—she seeks order and ends by writing "with a certainty she hadn't felt in years." The motivation shapes her journey and the final act, but the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting costs; no friction between wanting and price is visible on the page. Setup, middle reflection, and closure gates are met; causal pressure is moderate. Essential to stakes but under-dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Jaded wonder" is named twice and coloring throughout: Elara's past selves have "eyes filled with a jaded wonder" and it "bloom[s] in her chest" at closure. The tone modulates from weary fragmentation to tentative integration, coherent across turns. However, the phrase itself is abstract label rather than embodied in specific perceptual habits or diction shifts under pressure. Setup, middle, and closure gates are met; tone charges the final image but remains somewhat static in texture. Functional reprise without distinct modulation mechanics.</comment>
