<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's jitteriness is asserted rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. The final shift—accepting the pendant's attunement—arrives via the scholar's exposition rather than earned on-page struggle. Internal contradiction is minimal; she simply moves from courier to chosen carrier without visible cost or foreclosed path. Alaric's absence is told as loss but never complicates a present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately within the first third. The closure unit—Elara accepting that the pendant has "germinated within" her—lands on the page but cost remains abstract; no concrete option is foreclosed, no tactic altered. The scholar's reveal ("It's been waiting for you") replaces causality with exposition. Drive lens reads Causal-Situational hybrid but the turn is told rather than earned through prior agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid and consistent, sensory detail ("breath visible in the cold air") anchors perception. However, setting remains postcard backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The pendant's hum syncs with the aurora in one beat but this moment carries no consequence. The scholar's cottage appears late and functions only as a destination.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—delivering the pendant—is signaled early but pressure flatlines. The pendant's hum intensifies across beats yet Elara's options never narrow; she walks forward without obstacle or trade-off. The scholar's reveal substitutes for earned escalation. No on-page cost: Elara gains purpose without visible sacrifice, and the fade "calls to her" as bonus rather than price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of relics as "seeds of stories waiting to germinate" emerges through image and recurrence. The pendant's sympathetic vibration offers a concrete metaphor for connection. However, Alaric's lesson "to coax wonder from the routine" is stated twice without tension or counter-pressure. The ending reconfigures Elara's role but the moral—"relics choose their carriers"—is delivered as exposition rather than discovered through struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("dragonfly-wing pendant," "fade from memory to myth") is consistent but leans toward elevated fantasy register without variation under stress. Elara's perceptual signature is generic—"thoughts drifted," "mind raced"—rather than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the scholar's lines carry subtext but Elara's responses are passive affirmations.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean with no typos or grammar breaks. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates adequately. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the pendant's hum" recurs in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure (−0.2). Filter-verb reliance ("She thought," "She felt") softens immediacy in several beats. Stock metaphors ("living tapestry," "spirits") appear without transformation. Information density is moderate; no major scaffolding but some lines restate without advancement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The relic-courier premise is familiar fantasy infrastructure. The sympathetic-vibration mechanic and absent-mentor frame follow genre templates without fresh synthesis. The scholar's cottage revelation—"It's been waiting for you"—echoes chosen-one tropes. Elara's arc from courier to carrier is structurally predictable. The aurora-lit ridgeway offers vivid texture but not a conceptual surprise. No transformation test failure, but specificity remains within expected bounds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her jitteriness is mentioned in the opening and midpoint. However, her choices are minimal: she walks forward, pauses twice, and hands over the satchel. The final "decision" to accept the pendant's attunement is told by the scholar rather than enacted by Elara. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development lacks a constraining choice. Swappable with a generic courier without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dragonfly-wing pendant appears in paragraph one, hums in three distinct beats (adjusting satchel, ridgeway ascent, scholar's cottage), and reappears in the final paragraph with reweighted meaning ("steady rhythm, a heartbeat she now shared"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the pendant's mechanics (sympathetic vibration) are described rather than shown constraining a choice. It charges the ending image but does not alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Alaric is named in paragraphs two and three; his teachings are echoed ("seeds of stories," "coax wonder"). The scholar references him at closure ("Your mentor's lessons were not in vain"). Setup and payoff gates are met. However, Alaric's absence never constrains an on-page choice or creates friction. He functions as exposition-delivery device rather than shaping present stakes or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Extends brief encounters" is attributed to Alaric in paragraph two but never demonstrated in Elara's behavior. She has one extended encounter (the scholar) but no brief encounters are shown on the page, nor does this trait enable or constrain a choice. Label-only mention without action pressure or visible cost. Missing development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Germinate" appears in paragraph two (Alaric's lesson) and returns in the scholar's line ("germinated within you") and Elara's final realization ("coaxed wonder from her routine"). Setup and payoff are present. However, the germination is told rather than shown; no on-page transformation dramatizes the process. The element reweights meaning in the ending but does not drive a middle turn or choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Vibrating sympathetically" is named in paragraph one and demonstrated in three beats: the pendant hums, syncs with Elara's heartbeat, intensifies at the cottage, and becomes "a steady rhythm" in the final paragraph. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The mechanics matter thematically but do not alter tactics; Elara does not use or resist the vibration to solve a problem. Present across beats but swappable with another magical attunement method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is named in paragraph one, described in paragraph two, and reappears in the final line. Setup and closure participation are met. However, the ridgeway does not constrain movement, supply resources, or pressure a choice. It functions as vivid backdrop without mechanical consequence. Missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"The fade from memory to myth" is introduced in paragraph one as a boundary "only the relics could bridge" and reappears in paragraphs three and seven ("fade now called to her"). Setup and payoff present. However, the timeframe is spatial-metaphysical rather than temporal; no clock tightens decisions. The fade does not constrain or enable action. Missing causal development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To coax wonder from the routine" is Alaric's lesson in paragraph two and returns verbatim in the final paragraph ("the pendant had coaxed wonder from her routine"). Setup and payoff are present. The motivation is told twice but not dramatized in conflicted choices; Elara does not struggle between wonder and routine. The ending claims transformation without showing friction or cost. Lyric reprise without middle development.</comment>
