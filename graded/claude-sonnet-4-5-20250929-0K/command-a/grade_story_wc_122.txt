<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to overcome numbness is clear, but her interiority relies on abstract labels ("emotional numbness," "raw, aching aliveness") rather than embodied contradiction. The tear at climax feels declared rather than earned through micro-choices showing contradictory impulses in scene. Her decision to use backward songs lacks dramatized internal conflict—desperation is told, not shown through competing wants that act simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elara embraces silence rather than escaping it—with felt cost visible in her tears and the discarded needle. However, the causal chain from backward songs to emotional breakthrough is asserted more than dramatized; the "changes—subtle at first" passage summarizes transformation rather than showing specific micro-turns that narrow options or alter knowledge on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cavern is vividly established with torches, stone walls, and vibrations, and it returns meaningfully at closure when Elara picks up drumsticks. The phonograph and records function as tools that constrain her method. However, the environment largely serves as backdrop; spatial details don't pressure choices during the backward-song process, and the "faint rustle of turning seasons" remains atmospheric rather than a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara commits to the backward-song experiment. The reversal (colors brighten, emotions surface) deepens her condition but is summarized across "hours turned to days" rather than shown in a single pressurized beat. The tear and discarded needle at closure provide felt cost, but the escalation mechanism (how reversed songs physiologically alter her) remains abstract, weakening the causal link between her agency and the outcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—finding wholeness by embracing silence rather than fleeing it—emerges organically from the backward-song experiment and the cavern setting. The final drumbeat image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "filament of hush" and "mirrored hush" gesture toward depth without grounding abstraction in concrete particulars, and the closing reflection ("by finding the music within the hush") edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (vibrations through feet, hands, core), and free indirect style is generally clean. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("raw, aching aliveness," "symphony of existence") that feels authorial rather than character-particular for a deaf drum maker. Filter verbs ("felt," "noticed," "realized") cluster in the transformation passage without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy at a peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and rhythm generally supports scene needs. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "silence not of her choosing but of her own making" and "emotional numbness had become her constant companion" restate the same concept; "the songs, once familiar, now sounded alien" is immediately echoed by "their melodies distorted yet hauntingly beautiful." The closing beats stack abstract noun phrases ("a space where all possibilities resided, a place where she could finally be whole") that summarize rather than propel. Figurative density in non-peak passages (e.g., "filament of hush, a whisper of possibility") adds texture but occasionally slows momentum. Applying paraphrase-loop penalty (−0.2) and template-cadence issues (−0.4) totaling −0.6 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—deaf music teacher uses backward songs to reverse emotional numbness—offers a fresh synthesis of sensory deprivation and auditory manipulation. However, the backward-recording method closely echoes well-known cultural tropes (backmasking legends) without a sharp transformation, and the emotional-numbness-to-aliveness arc follows a familiar recovery template. The cavern and phonograph needle provide specific texture, but the core journey from numbness to tears via reversed music does not surprise or reweight expectations in hindsight. The transformation test reveals that substituting different sensory methods or different numbness triggers would leave the emotional arc largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara (deaf music teacher) is present throughout and makes the key decision to reverse songs, then picks up drumsticks at closure. Her deafness shapes how she experiences vibrations but does not constrain a tactical choice with visible cost—she could perform the same experiment hearing or deaf. Setup and closure gates are met; middle development is observation-driven rather than decision-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The broken phonograph needle appears in paragraph two, is turned over in Elara's hands, and is "discarded on the floor" at closure after serving as "catalyst." Setup and payoff gates met, but middle development is absent—it is not handled or used in a second distinct beat. Its "shattered tip" and "jagged edge" are described but never constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it functions as symbolic trigger rather than mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"A filament of hush" appears once in paragraph two as a metaphor for possibility and is echoed in "mirrored hush" at closure. The concept is present but ornamental—it does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics. Removing the phrase would not break story logic; the core conflict (defeating numbness via backward songs) proceeds independently. Label-only use without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" appears once in the middle section describing the backward songs' tones. The attribute is mentioned but does not constrain or enable an action with cost—Elara's process and outcome are unchanged whether the tones are muted or loud. No setup, no payoff, replaceable with any adjective. Ornamental description.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Enthrall" appears in paragraph three referencing legends of backward songs' power. The concept is setup only; the story does not dramatize Elara being enthralled or show the songs peeling back layers in a specific beat. The transformation (colors brighten, emotions surface) is summarized rather than shown as enthrallment. Swappable with "transform" or "heal" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are signaled in paragraph three, executed across the middle ("each note reversed with precision"), and their effects (vibrations, color shifts, tears) drive Elara's transformation. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The method's mechanics (reversing notes, twisted lyrics) matter to her process and appear in multiple beats. However, the causal link from reversed audio to emotional breakthrough is asserted rather than shown with specific cost tied to the reversal itself, preventing highest-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern is established in the opening, recurs as workspace during the backward-song experiment, and Elara returns to it at closure to play drums. Setup and payoff gates met. The cavern provides atmosphere (torches, stone walls, vibrations) and workspace, but does not pressure a choice—Elara could reverse songs anywhere. The environment's specificity (half-finished drum, dusty shelf) enriches texture without altering tactics. Early signal and closure presence lift the score, but lack of tactical constraint keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"The faint rustle of turning seasons" appears in paragraphs one, four, and six as atmospheric backdrop. The timeframe is mentioned but does not tighten decisions—"hours turned to days" is vague duration without a live clock that alters Elara's moves. No setup anchor (seasons are not specified), no development constraint, ornamental payoff. Swappable with any seasonal phrase.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation to defeat emotional numbness is signaled in paragraph one, drives Elara's backward-song experiment (middle), and is resolved at closure when "the numbness was gone." Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The desire is dramatized through her painstaking work and physical responses (tear, warmth). However, the friction between wants and costs is told ("desperation fueled her curiosity") rather than shown through conflicting micro-choices, and the transformation is summarized across days rather than tested in a single pressurized beat. Strong causal role but limited on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears explicitly only at closure; "hush" recurs in "filament of hush" (paragraph two). Tone throughout emphasizes quiet, vibration, and muted sound, creating coherent atmosphere. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure—reflective and elevated diction remains constant from opening through transformation. The final image charges the hush concept thematically but tone itself does not shift to heighten the closure beat. Functional coherence but static affect; setup weak, payoff present.</comment>
