<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is declared ("to catch that echo") but never tested by a meaningful choice with visible cost. His "cool-headed" trait is label-only; no on-page contradiction or stress reveals interior complexity. The goddess arrives without Kael making a single decision that narrows his options, and the rail spike's "purpose now clear" epiphany is unearned exposition. Interiority relies on therapy-speak abstractions ("emotions transliterated") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph one, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, no causal linkage drives the plot: Kael stands, walks in a zigzag, and the goddess simply appears without any decision or action from him altering the outcome. The ending asserts restoration ("whole again") but no on-page cost is visible—the rail spike glows, constellations resume, problem solved. Under a Causal lens (the only lens the setup implies), coincidence resolves rather than protagonist agency, violating closure requirements.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly described with layered sensory detail (silence with voice, feral-yet-soothing atmosphere), and spatial choreography remains coherent. However, the setting does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics; Kael's walk and the goddess's arrival occur independently of environmental pressure. The rail spike and pool are mentioned but never used as resources that shape outcome, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("catch the echo") is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Kael performs no reversal, makes no trade-off, and faces no escalating pressure—he walks, the constellations freeze, the goddess appears. The resolution is entirely coincidental: the rail spike's function is revealed by assertion, not by Kael's agency or a visible price paid on the page. No meaningful escalation or cost legibility under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>A theme of harmony between wildness and stillness emerges through the garden's silence and the goddess's "feral lullaby," and the rail spike functions as a tether motif that recurs with shifted meaning. However, the ending's epiphany ("found something far greater") is stated rather than earned through scene pressure, and the phrase "to be both wild and still" trends toward prompt-echo abstraction. The final image reweights prior material weakly; no visible stance or cost accompanies the thematic claim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the prose carries a consistent lyric texture ("silence had a voice," "symphony of silence"). Dialogue with the goddess feels stylized but goal-driven. However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific: Kael's way of noticing reads as authorial landscape rather than fisher-inflected observation, and the diction ("transliterated," "ethereal," "feral lullaby") drifts into elevated register without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but scaffolding and paraphrase loops appear frequently: "silence had a voice"/"absence of noise created its own symphony," "breaking their own patterns"/"paths unpredictable," "both wild and still"/"untamed and soothing." Template cadence runs in paragraph two ("It was a place where… where…") and five ("she said, and the garden erupted… a lullaby that was…"). Stock metaphors ("light and shadow," "flame in the wind") and the phrase "emotions transliterated" (repeated thrice) dull line-level propulsion. Deductions total approximately −1.4 in Q7 for paraphrase loops, template stems, and synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "sound wave garden" and "sleepwalking constellations" offer surface novelty, but the core plot (seeker finds mystical figure who explains everything) is a well-worn template executed without transformation. The rail spike as "key/bridge" and the goddess as exposition-giver are stock roles. No bold risk-taking or specific lived detail personalizes the premise; the ending's "harmony that would guide him" is a generic median resolution that avoids commitment to cost or consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his role as fisher is mentioned, but "cool-headed" remains label-only and he makes no key choices. His actions (sitting, standing, walking) do not create turns; the goddess arrives independently. Cap at 2.8 for presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The rail spike appears in three beats: found (para 1), held during the walk (para 3), and glowing at closure (para 6). Its "purpose now clear" reweights meaning at the end, satisfying setup and payoff gates. However, middle development is summary-only ("felt heavier, as though it held a secret"), and the mechanics by which it functions as a "tether" are asserted, not dramatized. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but swappability (any talisman) −0.5, summary-only middle −0.5, and ornamental handling −0.4 yield mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations are vividly described in para 1 and return at closure (para 6: "resumed their sleepwalking"), satisfying setup and payoff. However, they do not shape stakes or constrain tactics on the page—Kael's actions are unaffected by their movement, and they freeze/resume by off-page force. Lyric-resonance allowance permits mid-3s for early seed and charged final reprise without middle beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Transliterates emotions" appears three times (para 1, 2, 3) but remains label-only abstraction without visible mechanics or cost. No on-page action is enabled or constrained by this trait; it functions as thematic ornament. Cap at 2.8 for missing all three gates, further reduced for label-only usage to 1.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Zigzag appears in two beats: constellations zigzag (para 1, 2) and Kael mirrors them (para 3: "his movements… mirroring the zigzag"). Setup and middle development gates are met. However, the action does not create a turn—Kael's walk does not alter the outcome, and the constellations' movement is cosmetic. Swappable with "spiral" or "drift" without structural impact. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, but swappability −0.6 and ornamental use −0.6 yield mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Voicing silence" is seeded early (para 2: "learned to listen to this silence, to hear the whispers") and returns at closure (para 5: "words shaped by the silence he had learned to voice"). Two-gate reprise qualifies for low-5s ceiling, but the method's mechanics are never shown—Kael's speech does not dramatize how silence becomes voice. Summary-only −0.7, late payoff without middle demonstration −0.5, and label-only trait −0.5 lower to 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Sound wave garden is described throughout (para 1–6) and provides vivid atmosphere. Setup, middle presence, and payoff gates are all met. However, it does not constrain choice or supply tactical resources—Kael's walk and the goddess's arrival are unaffected by environmental pressure. Postcard-description mode: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure presence +0.4, but ornamental use −0.8 and no causal pressure −0.9 yield high-4s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"When patterns break themselves" is signaled in para 1 ("stars… breaking their own patterns") and referenced at closure (para 6: "no longer chaotic but purposeful"). Two-gate reprise, but time does not tighten decisions—no clock pressures Kael's actions, and the pattern-break is cosmetic backdrop rather than a live constraint. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.5, but vague tracking −0.6 and ornamental use −0.7 yield mid-3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to catch the echo" is declared in para 2 and repeated in para 4 dialogue. Setup and middle gates met. However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicted choice—Kael's actions do not test the motive, and the goddess appears without friction. Told-only dominates; no visible cost or trade-off tied to this want. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.3, but told-only −0.7 and no friction −0.8 yield mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Feral lullaby" is seeded in para 3 ("feral, yet soothing… lullaby sung by something untamed") and returns emphatically at closure (para 5: "feral lullaby," para 6: "its silence singing"). Tone is coherent across beats and modulates with the goddess's arrival, charging the final image. All three gates met. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure charge +1.2, but static mood without escalation −0.4 and label-reliance −0.3 yield high-5s.</comment>
