<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated ("to discover the texture of connection") but remains abstract and never dramatized through contradictory impulses or cost. Her journey through sounds is entirely passive—she listens, feels, realizes—with no on-page choices that forfeit anything or test competing values. The climactic moment ("felt a sense of purpose") is a label-only epiphany delivered via summary rather than embodied action. Interior voice relies on thesis-like abstractions ("balance between innovation and humanity") that feel imposed rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The Orientation Test is satisfied (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story layers fragments of sound to build toward thematic reweighting. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elara ends "enlightened" and "ready to propel the world forward" without forfeiting a live option or facing friction. The "artificial pilgrimage" and sound discoveries happen entirely off-conflict; no stake narrows or deepens on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails: no sentence in the ending beat shows price paid or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lab setting is anchored with vivid, selective details ("cluttered shelves," "golden shadows," "ruins of an old industrial district") and sensory filtering through Elara's auditory focus. The carbide lamp lens acts as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and constrains her methodology. However, the lab itself does not pressure any choice—it remains a static backdrop rather than a spatial or resource constraint that alters tactics. The coal town and factory are purely summary recall, not grounded present environments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering connection through lost sounds—is signaled early but remains conceptual and never tested by opposition or trade-off. Elara's "work" consists of passive listening; no reversal, tightening, or live cost appears on the page. The sounds she hears (child's laughter, factory hum) are summarized reflections, not obstacles that force tactical shifts. The ending declares enlightenment and purpose without showing what she sacrificed, refused, or lost to reach it. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight; here it stays rhetorical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (connection vs. progress, past vs. future) emerges organically from the sound fragments and is explored through concrete imagery (carbide lamps, factory hum). The lens as symbol of "balance" and "powerfully gentle light" charges the final image without overt moralizing. However, the ending paragraph tips into thesis statement ("not by abandoning the past, but by embracing it") and Elara's realizations are articulated in prompt-like language ("texture of connection," "propel forward") that reads as thematic echo. The thematic question is present but answered through summary rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is auditory-focused and consistent (Elara notices sounds, light, and texture). However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions during peak beats ("duality of progress," "erosion of human connection") that feel authorial rather than character-particular. The prose carries a distinct lyric rhythm, but Elara's interior voice converges with the narrator's thematic voice in the final third, reducing specificity. Filter verbs ("realized," "felt," "wondered") cluster without purpose-driven urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and the prose is legible, with vivid images (the lens "faintly luminous," "whispers of ancient machinery"). However, paraphrase loops appear: the lens is described as both a "key" and a guide through "the labyrinth" and later again as revealing "the path to understanding"—three adjacent metaphors restating the same function. Template cadence runs in the sound-fragment paragraphs ("The first sound was… Next came… As the sounds continued"), each following identical stem structure. Figurative language density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff (prism, compass, symphony, spectrum, waves). Register drifts into academic phrasing ("mechanization," "duality of progress") during Elara's interiority. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: −0.8 in Q7 for loops, template cadence, and register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—exploring lost sounds to rediscover human connection—synthesizes familiar "archives of memory" and "past-as-guide" templates without transforming them through specific lived conflict or non-obvious moral calculus. The carbide lamp lens is a purposeful historical anchor, but its symbolic function (light in darkness, balance) is conventional. The "artificial pilgrimage" offers a fresh label but operates identically to standard reflective journeys. Emotional truth is present in the sound fragments (coal town laughter, factory despair), but the arc could run unchanged with different names and setting. Derivative premise adjustment: −0.7 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as "prism-song bell ringer" frames the premise. However, she makes no on-page choices that turn the plot—she activates her device, listens, reflects, and arrives at enlightenment without opposition or cost. Setup is early, but development and payoff consist of passive observation. Functional presence without decision-making agency. Two gates (setup, closure cameo), but no causal pressure or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lens is introduced midpoint ("One evening…"), used to amplify sounds in a single extended beat, and returns in the final image as a symbol of balance. It constrains her method (acts as a prism) and charges the closure image ("powerfully gentle light"). Three gates present (setup at midpoint, development in one beat, closure reprise). Late introduction (−0.3) and swappability (a generic prism or amplifier could function similarly with minor edits, −0.4) limit the score. Two beats, closure linkage, and symbolic reweighting place it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The "artificial pilgrimage" is named in paragraph two and briefly described as "a journey… through layers of forgotten auditory history." It does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics—Elara's sound exploration would proceed identically if called a "project" or "research." Mentioned but ornamental; no causal pressure. Setup only; missing development and payoff gates. Cap at 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" is attributed to the lamp's light twice (paragraph three and final paragraph) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It functions as a thematic label rather than a trait that forces trade-offs. Label-only use; no causal work. Cap at 2.8 for missing development and payoff; apply label deduction (−0.3) and ornamental friction (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Propel" appears three times: in paragraph two ("propel it forward by questioning"), paragraph four ("propelled into the depths"), and the final line ("propel the world forward"). Each use is metaphorical summary rather than a physical action that turns the plot. The word is present in setup and closure but swappable with "drive," "guide," or "push" without structural change. Two gates, but no causal pressure or irreplaceability. Cap at 3.8 for swappability; apply summary-only deduction (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Questioning assumptions" is signaled in paragraph two ("by questioning assumptions about progress and loss") and returns twice in Elara's reflections on the coal town and factory sounds ("She questioned her assumptions about progress"). It shapes her interpretive stance in two distinct beats and contributes to the ending's thematic charge. Three gates present; method is dramatized through specific sound-driven reflections. However, the method does not alter tactics or impose cost—she would reach the same insight regardless. Causal pressure is weak (−0.6), but early signal, two-beat involvement, and closure linkage place it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The laboratory is established in the opening paragraph with vivid detail ("ruins of an old industrial district," "cluttered shelves") and houses Elara's device, grounding all on-page action. It appears in setup, middle, and closure. However, the lab does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome—it is a static stage. Three gates, but no causal constraint. Functional backdrop without tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the power grid stabilizes" appears only in the opening phrase and is never referenced again. It does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or affect the story's timeline. Mentioned once; ornamental. Missing all three gates. Cap at 2.8; apply late/ornamental friction (−1.0).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the texture of connection" is stated in paragraph one and returns in paragraph four and the ending. It frames Elara's goal across the entire arc and shapes her interpretive lens in two sound-fragment beats. Three gates present. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible cost—Elara's desire faces no friction or trade-off on the page. Told-only friction (−0.8) and lack of cost (−0.6) prevent mid-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" appears once in paragraph three ("as golden shadows stretched across the lab's cluttered shelves") and sets a warm, contemplative tone that holds through the piece. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly as Elara moves through heavier reflections (factory despair) without jarring shifts. Setup and coherence are present, but the tone does not charge the final image or shift meaningfully under pressure. One gate (setup); missing development and closure reprise. Functional but static.</comment>
