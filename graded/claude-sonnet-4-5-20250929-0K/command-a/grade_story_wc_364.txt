<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses. The "awakening" bargain—trading something he "didn't fully understand"—is abstract label-speak that never translates into embodied cost or micro-choice. The stranger's arrival and Eli's acceptance follow a linear path without internal friction. The final "caught between understanding and confusion" is asserted rather than shown through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal but linkage is weak: the silk's mechanics (how weaving into runes heals the planet) are unexplained, and the "awakening" trade has no on-page consequence. Orientation anchors who/where by paragraph one, waiving that penalty. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("more and less himself") but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what Eli lost or gave up at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and molten core are vivid and recur across beats. The mine shafts constrain Eli's descent tactically (crumbling walls, calculated steps). However, the orchard planet's healing is told in summary ("blossoming," "vibrant") rather than shown through specific sensory shift. The arches "hum with life" and gain "blooming vines" in the final paragraph, charging the closure image modestly and meeting the 9+ gate prerequisite.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—planetary renewal—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Eli accepts the bargain despite fear, but the descent and weaving face no reversals or escalating costs; the silk "guides him" passively. The ground trembles, light explodes, and the planet heals without tactical sacrifice or visible price. Escalation under the Causal lens requires narrowing options; here coincidence (the silk's inherent power) resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience emerges through the orchard's renewal and Eli's internal change, but the final paragraph moralizes: "coaxed resilience from rubble" and "stood defiant" are thematic summaries rather than earned images. The "awakening" concept remains abstract—no concrete answer to what was traded. The silk's disappearance and the blooming arches offer some resonance, but the closing "his journey was far from over" is a stock deflection that avoids closing the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries some texture ("jagged teeth," "liquid light") but leans on generic fantasy diction ("quietly determined," "unyielding," "elusive"). The stranger's dialogue ("Your awakening") and Eli's acceptance lack subtext or evasion—goals are stated plainly. Perceptual signature is weak: Eli notices setting details equally whether calm or under stress, without professional blacksmith filtering.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings show some variety, but several beats recycle scaffold: "The air was thick," "The ground trembled," "a surge of energy coursed." Paraphrase loop in paragraph one: "quietly determined" / "fragile hope" / "sought resilience" restate resolve without added pressure. Mixed metaphor: arches "like jagged teeth" later "hum with life"—teeth don't hum. Filter-verb stack in paragraph four ("moved," "pressed on," "Unfurling") dulls immediacy. Figurative density is moderate and mostly coherent; line-level clarity holds but lacks propulsion in key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise—blacksmith quests into planetary core to weave magical silk—follows a familiar hero's-journey template without transformation. The "awakening" trade is abstract and unresolved, offering no fresh moral calculus. Floating rock arches and magician's silk are vivid but not integrated into unique world logic. The emotional arc (fear → resolve → ambiguous change) could transfer to many fantasy frames unchanged, failing the Transformation Test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eli's meekness is mentioned but does not constrain his acceptance of the bargain or his descent. His blacksmith role appears in the opening but never shapes tactics (no forging, no tool use). He makes one decision—accepting the trade—but subsequent beats show him guided by the silk rather than choosing under pressure. Closure credits his "quiet pride" but does not tie it to a meek-specific cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The silk appears in three beats: stranger's arrival, Eli's descent (it glows and guides), and the weaving into runes at the core. Its properties (vessel for awakenings, glowing brighter) evolve somewhat. Weaving is shown on-page and triggers the climax. However, the silk's disappearance is told in summary ("gone, its purpose fulfilled") and does not return with reweighted meaning in the final image. Closure participation is functional but not charged.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Bartered awakenings" is declared in the stranger's offer and mentioned in Eli's hesitation, but the mechanics and cost remain abstract. No on-page scene shows what an awakening entails or what Eli loses. The ending asserts he feels "more and less himself" without dramatizing the trade's consequence. The concept echoes as theme rather than shaping tactics or choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Quietly determined" is stated in the opening and restated as "quiet but unyielding" and "quiet pride." It does not constrain action—Eli's resolve is uncontested throughout. No moment shows quiet determination enabling a tactic or incurring a visible cost. The attribute is label-only and could be removed without altering plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Deliberate" appears in paragraph two ("deliberate in his movements") and paragraph four ("deliberate care"). It characterizes Eli's caution in the mines, shaping his descent tactically (calculated steps to avoid disaster). However, the major turn—weaving the silk—is not marked as deliberate; it proceeds smoothly with "precision born of years." The action is present and functional but not indispensable to the turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The mine shafts are signaled in paragraph two and provide the method for reaching the core. Paragraph four shows crumbling walls and Eli's calculated movement, giving the method on-page mechanical presence. However, the shafts do not alter outcome—any route to the core would serve. They shape one beat (the descent) but are not causally essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating rock arches frame the opening, recur as "looming overhead" during the descent, and return in the ending image ("hum with life," "blooming vines"). The core chamber (molten lava, ancient runes) provides the climax location. The arches charge the final image with "azure" hues, reprising the opening. However, the setting does not constrain Eli's choices—he moves through it without resource or access friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Between understanding and confusion" appears only in the ending as an abstract description of Eli's state. It does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. The story tracks elapsed time vaguely ("hours turned into days") without urgency or countdown. The element is ornamental and does not shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To coax resilience from rubble" is declared in paragraph one and restated in the closing ("coaxed resilience from rubble"). The motivation drives Eli's acceptance of the bargain and the descent. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—Eli's suffering and fear are mentioned but never tested against a competing desire. The motivation is functional but lacks on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Azure defiance" is attempted through "azure sky," the stranger's "azure defiance in their eyes," and the "blinding azure glow" at the climax. The tone recurs but does not modulate—defiance is asserted in labels rather than shown through stance under pressure. The final image uses "azure" to color the arches but does not crystallize defiance as an earned posture. Tone is present but static.</comment>
