<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains a static archetype—the contemplative artist—without contradiction or vulnerability that complicates her stance. Her "seasonally mute" trait is mentioned but never constrains an on-page choice or creates friction. Interior life consists of abstract belief statements ("she believed it contained the purest form of truth") rather than embodied thought under pressure. The final choice to descend is unmotivated by prior struggle; she simply completes her task and leaves.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure with cost. Elara begins tuning, completes the sculpture, witnesses a beautiful moment, then wraps up and departs—a sequence without reversal or stakes that narrow options. The "moment of wonder" arrives as spectacle, not as a consequence of her struggle or sacrifice. Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after extensive mood-setting (~160 words), and the delay does not pay off at closure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no density increase or pattern break reweights the dominant stake with visible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The Whispering Bluff is vividly described—clouds, thin air, cerulean sky—but never constrains a tactic or complicates Elara's work. The iceberg fragment is handled across two beats (carving, spinning) and charges the final image with its dimming light, meeting basic object-as-setting criteria. Spatial choreography is clean, though the bluff functions more as backdrop than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to preserve the color of wonder"—is declared but never tested. No on-page obstacle or cost threatens her goal; the sculpture succeeds without friction, the bells chime, and she departs satisfied. Coincidence does not complicate; nothing does. The piece lacks escalation or a meaningful tightening under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than earned: "the color of wonder was preserved, not in permanence, but in the act of creation itself" arrives as authorial summary. The iceberg fragment and bells function as symbolic tokens without accumulating pressure or charging the final image through contradiction. The ending offers a thesis ("symphonies of truth would endure") instead of a resonant reconfiguration rooted in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains consistent—close enough to track Elara's beliefs, distant enough to aestheticize the scene. Diction slips into elevated register ("cerulean expanse," "ethereal glow") that reads ornamental rather than character-particular. Sentence openings vary, but rhythm does not modulate with pressure because no pressure appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "Her task was not merely to tune bells but to capture the essence of truth" is restated in varied terms across three paragraphs. Template cadence: "She felt... She knew... She looked..." structures multiple beats. Stock metaphors cluster in the opening third ("earth kissed the heavens," "clouds draped like a soft, gray blanket"). Figurative density in non-pressured beats triggers −0.6; loops and stems add −0.5; total −1.1 from a mid-5s base.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The bell-tuner archetype, the quest to preserve wonder, and the frozen-tears-of-gods iceberg fragment read as familiar fantasy furniture. No on-page turn or reconfiguration transforms these elements; the premise plays straight without surprise. Elevated diction and abstract stakes ("symphonies of truth") substitute for specific human complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or stakes. She completes her task as planned; the sculpture succeeds without adjustment. Observation and execution dominate; agency is absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment is handled in two beats (carving, spinning) and returns with dimmed light at the end, signaling transience. However, it does not narrow options or create friction; it simply enables the spectacle. Swappable with any other magical material.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" is invoked as theme and backdrop but never constrains a choice or tactic. It functions as ornamental language rather than a stake-shaping concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"Seasonally mute" is mentioned in the opening paragraph and never revisited or constrains an action. Label-only; no visible cost or tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Glisten" appears in the setup (iceberg fragment) and recurs when the fragment spins and fractures light. The glistening enables the visual climax but does not redefine options or create a turn; it decorates rather than drives.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kinetic sculpture is introduced early and executed mid-story. Its mechanics (balance, precision, motion) are described but do not shape attempts or complicate the work; Elara succeeds on the first try. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The Whispering Bluff is present from the opening and supplies the stage for the action (above clouds, stone table). It does not pressure choices or alter tactics; it provides atmosphere. The bluff's "whisper" is metaphorical and inert.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>0.8</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" frames the opening ("words had long faded into silence") but never tightens decisions or tactics. Time is vague; no clock or deadline alters moves. Ornamental worldbuilding.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder" is stated as motivation early and reiterated at closure, but no on-page conflict tests this desire. Told-only; no friction between want and cost dramatized in scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Muted vigor" describes Elara's working style ("hands moved with muted vigor") and her silence, establishing a quiet, deliberate tone. The tone is stable but does not modulate with pressure—because no pressure appears—and does not charge the final image beyond maintaining consistency.</comment>
