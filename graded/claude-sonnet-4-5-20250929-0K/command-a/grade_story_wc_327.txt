<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and stated early, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("her heart filled with a sense of accomplishment") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The copper veins function as visual ornamentation without constraining a choice. The final collapse reads as physical consequence rather than an earned internal shift with visible cost; the character endures drain but makes no difficult trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with lyric aspirations. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit—diamond shatters, language saved, Lira emerges changed—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("her copper veins faded") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or reweighted image. The because/therefore chain from humming → diamond glow → language preserved lacks intermediate resistance; the solution feels convenient rather than earned by prior constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The towers of bone, canyon moss, and tunnel walls supply vivid anchoring detail and appear in the final paragraph with softened edges, creating a lyric reprise. However, the environment does not constrain a tactical choice during the peak beat; Lira's path through the tunnel is unobstructed. The flock of birds remains external observation rather than a spatial or sensory pressure that alters her actions in the moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—save the language—is signaled early and drives the sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the diamond begins draining Lira, but this cost arrives late and does not force a mid-scene trade-off; she presses on without a visible renunciation of an alternative path. The flock's "flight patterns mirroring the rhythm of her song" introduces a guiding mechanism at the climax without prior setup, weakening causal escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus personal cost emerges through concrete action (entering the tunnel, speaking the language aloud). The final image—"stories of her people would live on, their textures translated into sound"—edges toward thesis statement rather than non-literal resonance. The phrase "no longer just a storyteller; she was a guardian" in the closing paragraph is explicit role-articulation, reducing subtext and triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative voice carries a distinct elevated register ("the towers of bone that rose like jagged teeth"). However, diction at peak beats leans abstract: "a sense of accomplishment," "profound silence," "spirit unbroken" are label-only emotional claims rather than embodied perception. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt a surge") cluster in high-pressure lines, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear, but several template-cadence runs appear: "She was searching… She was no longer… She knew…" Stock metaphors ("jagged teeth," "wings beating in perfect harmony") and synonym loops ("echoes grew louder, each one a fragment of a story, a memory, a plea" followed by "echoes around her began to coalesce, forming words, phrases, entire sentences") reduce propulsion. The phrase "the flawed diamond was indeed cursed" mid-story is expository confirmation rather than discovery. Apply −0.8 for patterned artifacts (template stems, stock metaphor strings, paraphrase loop).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller and bone towers supply vivid visual detail, but the core premise—magical artifact drains hero to save dying language—follows a familiar quest template. The "flock of birds in flight" as guiding mechanism and the shattered-gem climax feel archetypal rather than transformed through specific character logic or world rules. Emotional specificity is present in Lira's determination, yet the resolution (language saved, hero survives weakened) avoids bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira appears in every beat and makes the choice to enter the tunnel and to continue speaking despite drain. However, key turns (diamond activates, language is saved) result from her endurance rather than a decision that alters tactics or forecloses an option. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is present but passive. The character drives the sequence but does not face a micro-choice with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The flawed diamond is introduced in paragraph one, handled ("clutched tightly," "raised the flawed diamond"), glows in response to her song, and shatters at the climax—three distinct beats. Its cursed nature drains Lira, linking cost to the object. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the diamond's mechanics (why it responds to song, why it shatters) are asserted rather than constrained by prior world rules, limiting irreplaceability. Still, the object is causally active and shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes is the spatial setting for the entire middle sequence and supplies the language fragments Lira deciphers. It shapes her goal (find a pattern) and the closure image (echoes stilled). Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development occurs when she hears the recurring melody. The tunnel does not constrain a tactical choice (she encounters no obstacles within it), but it is essential to the story's logic and reappears in the final silence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" is mentioned once in paragraph one ("her voice a soft murmur") and does not recur or constrain an action. When Lira speaks aloud to harness the canyon, her voice is "steady and clear," contradicting the quiet attribute. The trait functions as label-only character color without on-page cost or tactical consequence. Missing middle and closure gates; ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Harness" appears explicitly: Lira seeks to "harness the power of the canyon," begins to hum "creating a symphony," and "the diamond responded… drawing energy from the tunnel itself." The action drives the climax and links to the closure (language saved via harnessed echoes). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The method is specific enough that removing "harness" and substituting "absorb" or "channel" would require rewriting the song-and-energy sequence, demonstrating causal centrality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The flock of birds is introduced in paragraph three ("faint, recurring melody, like the rustle of leaves… sound of a flock of birds in flight"), returns in paragraph five ("flock of birds outside… their flight patterns mirroring the rhythm of her song"), and appears in the final image ("flock of birds soared above her, their patterns a testament"). Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is thin (the birds guide her energy but the mechanics are vague). The method is asserted late in the climax rather than established early as a constraint or resource, and could be replaced with any ambient rhythm. Introduced in second third but not developed until final third; cap 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The towers of bone and canyon of endless echoes frame the opening and close the story with a lyric reprise ("towers of bone seemed to loom less ominously"). The setting supplies the luminescent moss (visual anchor) and the tunnel (action space). Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is spatial (Lira moves deeper into the tunnel). The setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource under pressure (no blocked path, no environmental hazard), but the final image reweights the towers' menace, achieving resonance. Lyric early-seed/final-reprise use with thematic reweighting; score in 6.0–6.5 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across the death of a language" is referenced as backstory ("dying language of her people," "language began to die") and as the closure outcome ("language was safe now"). The timeframe is conceptual rather than tactical; no live clock tightens Lira's decisions within the tunnel sequence. The language's death operates as motivation and thematic backdrop but does not impose a felt deadline or alter her moves under pressure. Setup and closure participation present; missing middle constraint. Swappable with "to preserve a language" without structural loss; cap 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lira's desire to "translate texture into sound" is stated in paragraph one, restated in paragraph two, and achieved at closure ("their textures translated into sound, their language saved"). The motivation drives her entry into the tunnel and her persistence despite drain. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the motivation is declared rather than conflicted; no on-page moment shows friction between this want and an alternate desire or fear. The cost (physical drain) is tied to the method, not to a trade-off within the motivation itself.</comment>
