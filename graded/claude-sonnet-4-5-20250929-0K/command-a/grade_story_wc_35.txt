<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's gift (tasting memories) is established but never forces a difficult choice or visible trade-off. Her motivations are declared ("to sandpaper rough memories") yet her actions in the pavilion flow smoothly without internal contradiction or genuine struggle. The final moment dissolves the shard without depicting cost beyond tears, and no prior path is foreclosed with felt consequence. Interiority leans toward summary and elevated diction ("her tone was sturdy brittle") rather than embodied particulars under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately early. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Elara descends, encounters memories, absorbs them, reaches the central shard, dissolves it. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the pavilion melts, her heart is lighter), but the cost is asserted ("a piece of her own sorrow") rather than shown through a specific forfeited option or visible consequence on the page. The pattern of descent → touch → dissolution is legible, yet the final image lacks the sharp before/after that would charge it decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The coral icebound pavilion is vividly described and its structure (frozen corridors, etched walls) is clear. The body (Elara's palms on walls) and recurring objects (the shard) appear across beats and shape the final image. However, the desert fortress and tidal pools remain largely ornamental; they do not constrain choices or alter tactics in a way that would elevate the score into high bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (confronting stored remorse) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the sequence of memories, but no reversal or meaningful tightening narrows Elara's options; each memory is smoothed without visible cost or trade-off until the final shard. The shard's dissolution is presented as a triumph without depicting what Elara forfeits or how her later choices are constrained. Under an Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification is sufficient, but the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (memory, remorse, transformation) emerges through the pavilion's structure and Elara's gift. The final image (pavilion melting, dawn breaking) attempts a non-literal answer, but the thematic payoff is weakened by the explain-everything final paragraph ("The unspoken dream was over, and a new one had begun"). The recurring motif of "unspoken dream" bookends the piece but does not accumulate pressure or charge the closure with fresh meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable. Diction is elevated and consistent but trends toward generic literary register ("forgotten secrets," "wondrous and burdensome") rather than character-particular perception. No dialogue is present. Some filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt") dull immediacy in peak beats. The voice remains coherent under pressure, but perceptual signature is not sharp enough to reach high bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate and sentences mostly advance. However, the piece exhibits template cadence ("She was no ordinary chef," "She knew," "She reached out"), stock metaphors ("mirage," "labyrinth"), and paraphrase loops (the pavilion's beauty and danger are restated without added pressure). The final paragraph's explain-everything summary ("for remorse was eternal, but for now, it was gone") flattens momentum. Figurative language is frequent but not always purposeful; "sturdy brittle" as tone descriptor is vague. No single artifact obscures closure, but accumulated minor issues prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise (chef who tastes memories, hidden pavilion of remorse) is imaginative but executed through familiar beats: descent → trials → central object → dissolution. The emotional arc and resolution feel predictable; removing Elara's specific gift would not fundamentally alter the plot. The piece does not take bold risks or offer a non-obvious synthesis that reweights prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Present and functional. Elara's gift is used to taste memories in the pavilion, but it does not drive a key choice or reversal. She never faces a moment where tasting a memory forces a trade-off or alters her tactics; the gift is an observational tool rather than a constraint or enabler of decisive action. Swappable with another sensory ability without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pavilion is introduced ~20% in, structures the middle sequence (multiple beats of touching walls), and its dissolution provides the final image. It appears across three beats (entrance, interior exploration, central chamber) and shapes the ending. However, the pavilion does not narrow options or impose a felt cost; it is a stage for Elara's journey rather than a constraint that alters her tactics. Strong presence, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stored remorse is the premise and is mentioned throughout. It shapes the stakes (Elara confronts it) and provides the thematic core. However, it does not constrain a specific on-page choice or force a trade-off; Elara absorbs each memory without depicted difficulty or consequence. The concept is functional but could be replaced with a similar emotional burden (grief, regret) with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The attribute is mentioned once in exposition ("emotionally contagious through touch") and referenced in the flashback ("a fleeting brush against a stranger's hand"). It does not enable or constrain any on-page action in the present timeline; Elara touches walls and the shard without depicted contagion or cost. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elara subsumes memories repeatedly in the pavilion and the final shard. The action is present across multiple beats and provides the closure mechanism. However, the mechanics are vague, the cost is asserted rather than shown, and the action could be replaced with "absorb," "neutralize," or "transform" without altering the structure. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Analyzing tidal pool formations is signaled early (~15%) and shown in one concrete beat (Elara kneeling, tracing patterns). It enables her to locate the pavilion, thus shaping one key turn. The mechanics are described with specificity ("Each line told a story, each curve a memory"). However, it does not constrain later choices or reappear at closure. Solid single-beat integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain is mentioned in the opening and closing but does not shape choices or supply resources. The damp sand and storm's aftermath provide atmosphere but remain ornamental. The pavilion itself functions as the active setting; the broader desert does not constrain tactics or alter outcomes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The phrase "at the close of an unspoken dream" appears in the opening and is echoed in the final paragraph. No clock or deadline tightens decisions; the timeframe is abstract and does not shape Elara's tactics. Ornamental thematic tag.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early and drives the plot (Elara seeks the pavilion to smooth memories). However, it is not dramatized through conflicting desires or visible friction; Elara's actions flow smoothly without depicted want-versus-cost tension. The motivation is functional but told rather than embodied in on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The phrase "sturdy brittle" appears once mid-story as a descriptor of Elara's resolve. The tone does not modulate with pressure or reappear at closure. The piece's actual tone is consistent (elevated, earnest) but does not match the paradoxical "sturdy brittle" label. The specified tone is present as a label but not executed on the page.</comment>
