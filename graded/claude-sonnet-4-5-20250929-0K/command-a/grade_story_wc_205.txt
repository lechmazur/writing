<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated ("temporal plasticity," redemption) but her choices feel pre-ordained rather than pressured. The night-infiltration unfolds without genuine internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. Her tears at the vision read as label-only emotion ("burnished sorrow") rather than embodied contradiction. The triumph-as-bittersweet coda tells us wounds remain unhealed without dramatizing what she renounces or what path closes with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors WHO/WHERE/WHEN early enough. The closure unit—Elara emerging with holographic evidence and whispering a poem—gestures toward Conceptual Repricing but the cost remains abstract ("wounds unhealed"). The causal chain from shard-ritual to vision to evidence feels telescoped; the Empiricists' concession and Visionaries' acclaim occur off-page in summary, undercutting the weight of the turn. One meaningful tightening is present (sneaking into the Hall) but the final image doesn't reconfigure prior stakes with undeniable on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Zahir-7's gilded spires, obsidian canals, and light-storms supply vivid sensory anchors. The Hall of Reflections and covered mirrors add atmospheric specificity. However, spatial choreography inside the Hall is vague—how Elara arranges the shard, where she stands, how the mirrors interact with the storm—and the environment doesn't constrain her choices or complicate the ritual. Setting enriches mood but remains largely postcard backdrop rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove temporal plasticity and redeem her reputation—is signaled early. The night infiltration provides one beat of escalation, but the shard's success arrives without cost or complication: no Empiricist discovery mid-ritual, no vision that challenges her theory, no trade-off between vindication and something she must sacrifice. The final "triumph was bittersweet" is asserted rather than earned through a visible forfeiture on the page. Agency reads passive; the shard does the work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of reimagining and flux versus permanence is articulated through the civilization's "temporal plasticity" and Elara's own need for redemption. The crystal shard recurs but functions more as a plot device than a charged motif that reweights meaning at closure. The final whispered poem and "enduring power of reimagining" land as summary-statement rather than resonant image. The Empiricists' forced concession and Visionaries' acclaim resolve the professional conflict too neatly, undercutting thematic ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("baroque," "burnished sorrow," "ethereal radiance") in ways that strain naturalism but remain internally consistent. Filter-verb density is moderate. No dialogue appears on the page, so subtext and character-voice distinction are not tested. The perceptual signature lacks idiosyncratic bias—Elara's noticing reads generic-scholarly rather than character-specific. Register stays consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is mostly maintained, though several sentences loop conceptually: "reimagining" recurs four times, "temporal plasticity" twice in exposition without fresh pressure. Figurative density is high ("labyrinth," "shimmering ribbons," "torrents of luminescence," "burnished sorrow") but metaphors remain decorative rather than propulsive. "Burnished sorrow" in particular is strained—burnished implies polished metal, not emotion. Paragraph rhythm is uniform; no sentence-level acceleration during the Hall infiltration. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The baroque-asteroid archaeological-site premise offers surface novelty but executes familiar beats: disgraced scholar, ritual-at-night, vision-as-vindication, bittersweet triumph. "Temporal plasticity" and "covering mirrors during storms" read as prompt-fulfillment rather than organic world-building—neither constraint meaningfully complicates Elara's success. The Empiricists-versus-Visionaries dispute is sketched but never pressures a hard choice. Emotional arc (redemption via external validation) follows a conventional template without transformation or fresh moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Defunct revolutionary" appears twice as a descriptor but Elara's choices aren't revolutionary—she infiltrates, uses the shard, succeeds. The trait could swap for "disgraced scholar" with no structural impact. Present in setup and thematic color, but does not constrain tactics or create a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The shard is introduced early (setup), carried as talisman, and used in the Hall ritual (development), then becomes "a symbol of her achievement" (payoff). It drives the central beat and charges the final image. However, its function is largely passive—a key that unlocks visions—and could be replaced by another artifact (fragment, lens, crystal) with minor edits. Two beats and closure presence lift it to mid-6s, but specificity and irreplaceability are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Archaeological dispute" frames the Empiricists vs. Visionaries factions and motivates Elara's need for proof (setup and thematic backdrop). The dispute does not pressure an on-page choice or complicate the ritual; the Empiricists seal the Hall but don't guard it or discover her. Resolution happens off-page in summary. Present and functional but replaceable with any professional schism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" is mentioned once ("a poetically inclined scholar") and paid off when she "whispered a poem" at the end. The trait does not constrain or enable any choice; removing it would change only flavor. Label-only, no visible cost or tradeoff tied to the attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Devise" anchors Elara's plan to use the shard and mirrors (setup), and the ritual she devises is the story's major turn (development and payoff). The action is signaled and executed, driving the central beat. However, the plan unfolds without complication, and "devise" could swap for "attempt" or "perform" with minimal rewrite. Present across beats and shaping closure, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Covering mirrors during storms" is introduced as Elara's "unorthodox method" (setup), mentioned in the Hall scene where mirrors are covered with silken cloths (payoff), and rationalized as synchronizing her mind with temporal currents. The method appears but does not constrain—she covers the mirrors, the storm comes, the shard glows, visions flood. The mechanic is passive; removing the covering would not break the sequence if the shard alone triggered the visions. Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Zahir-7 is introduced early with vivid detail (gilded spires, obsidian canals, light-storms) and houses the Hall of Reflections where the climax occurs. The asteroid's temporal-visibility phenomenon supplies the story's premise. However, the baroque aesthetic and specific features (spires, canals) do not constrain Elara's actions or alter tactics; the ritual could occur on any ruin-world with similar edits. Setting shapes atmosphere and stakes but not choices. Two gates (setup, payoff) with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After time became visible" is announced in the opening and supplies the world-rule that makes archaeological work possible (setup). The timeframe does not create urgency, tighten a deadline, or alter Elara's tactics; she infiltrates "one night" without time pressure. The phenomenon enables the visions but is not a constraint. Present and functional, but replaceable with any archaeological-discovery rationale.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to reimagine an entire civilization" is stated early and motivates her work (setup). The visions she receives confirm temporal plasticity (development), and the final image mentions "reimagining" again (payoff). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no scene shows her wrestling with doubt or choosing between reimagining Zahir-7 versus her own life. The goal drives plot but lacks on-page friction or visible cost tied to competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" appears once as a label for Elara's tears during the vision. Tone remains elegiac and melancholic throughout (bittersweet triumph, "wounds remained unhealed"), coherent but static. The phrase itself is metaphorically strained (burnished = polished metal, not an emotion), and tone does not modulate with pressure—the infiltration and vision receive the same wistful register. Present in setup and ending with thematic consistency, but lacks dynamic charge or intensification at closure.</comment>
