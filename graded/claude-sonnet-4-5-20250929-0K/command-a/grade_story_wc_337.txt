<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to ground spirits is clear and her internal restlessness creates some tension, but her emotional arc proceeds smoothly without genuine contradiction—she moves from task to resolution without internal conflict forcing difficult trade-offs. The backstory about her mother's broken mask (~15% of text) anchors in the present but doesn't tilt a live choice; it contextualizes rather than complicates. The final "mending herself" realization feels asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle. Interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("heart heavy but at ease") and the spirits' resistance dissolves without forcing Elara to sacrifice anything concrete on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: silence accumulates, knots unravel in sequence, and the final stillness reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (spirits find peace, Elara finds solace), but the cost remains abstract—no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid; the net simply "sagged" and whispers "faded." The tightening (stubborn knot → whispered plea → breakthrough) provides one pressure point, but it resolves through persistence rather than a choice that narrows options. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at the ending ("profound stillness") reconfigures the opening hush, yet the conceptual cost is implied rather than made undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is vividly established with stained glass, starlight, and shifting prismatic shadows; sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. However, the setting remains largely decorative—it doesn't constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics. The net and needle are handled, but the sanctuary itself functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The micro-setting (body, tool) does more work: the needle's resistance and the net's worn fibers engage tactilely, though neither forces a trade-off that changes the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stubborn knot refuses to yield, forcing Elara's whispered plea, but this resolves immediately without altering tactics or foreclosing an option. The spirits' resistance is told ("tightening as if unwilling to let go") rather than dramatized through a choice that costs Elara something concrete. The resolution arrives through endurance rather than a decision with visible price; Elara sits back "heavy but at ease" without a trade-off legible on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens but does not visibly narrow options or impose cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—honoring stories, mending the broken—emerges through images (net, mask, whispers) and is tied to Elara's arc. The final realization ("in mending the broken, she was also mending herself") leans toward explicit statement rather than non-literal answer, though the prism-of-light final image adds resonance. The net's unraveling and the accumulated silence function as purposeful motifs that shift meaning at the end. Subtext operates in gesture (needle pressing, breath catching) and the hush deepens without overt moralizing, though the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary. The piece resists simplistic resolution—spirits are honored rather than fixed—but the emotional epiphany feels slightly over-articulated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person close on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("interlaced hush," "lucid unrest"), though some phrasing borders on elevated abstraction ("restless spirits," "communion"). Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices texture, resistance, whispers—but under peak stress (stubborn knot) the voice remains steady rather than compressing or degrading. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture, and the narrative stance modulates with emotional intensity (opening calm → deepening pressure → final stillness). Minor register drift into abstraction ("profound stillness," "restless energy") at closure slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is moderate—some sentences double-job (e.g., needle glinting while Elara studies the knot), but others restate ("accumulated silence" appears three times, "restless" recurs without added pressure). Paraphrase loops are minimal but present: "silence accumulated" / "accumulated silence pressing heavier" / "accumulated silence had been lifted" cycles the same concept. Template cadence in the middle section ("She pressed... She closed... She knew...") flattens propulsion slightly. Figurative language is controlled and legible ("bridge between worlds," "prism of light on her path"), though "tapestry needle... glinted" and "sharp tip ready to sever threads of time" lean decorative in a high-pressure beat. No major artifact touching closure; deductions remain within non-closure range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The broken-mask-restorer premise and spirit-grounding plot follow a recognizable template (wounded healer mends others to mend self). The prism sanctuary and fisherman's net add specific texture, but the emotional arc—restless → communion → peace—proceeds along expected lines without a non-obvious turn. The knot-unraveling method is fresh in detail, yet the stakes and resolution align with standard restorative-healing narratives. Elara's arc could transplant to other objects and settings without fundamental change. The synthesis is competent and the voice is distinct, but the piece does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes beyond the familiar.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara (broken mask restorer) is present throughout and her choices shape key beats: pressing the needle, whispering the plea, placing the net on the altar. Setup is immediate; middle development includes the stubborn-knot choice; closure participation is clear (she rises, places the net, walks into dawn). However, her choices do not create reversals—pressure arises from the net's resistance, and Elara's responses are tactical adjustments (persistence, plea) rather than decisions that alter tactics or impose trade-offs. Her occupation is thematically charged but not mechanically indispensable; a spirit mediator or healer could fulfill the same beats. Cost is emotional ("heart heavy") rather than a concrete forfeiture tied to her restorer identity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears in three beats: glinting under light (paragraph 2), pressed into the weave to loosen the first knot (paragraph 2), and breaking through the stubborn knot (paragraph 6). Setup is early; middle and closure participation are present. However, the needle's specific properties—sharpness, tip—are described but do not constrain or enable choices; Elara could use any fine tool. The needle does not return with reweighted meaning; it performs the same function in each beat. Its role is functional but swappable without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" appears once in the opening paragraph as atmosphere ("seemed to hum with an interlaced hush"). It is not defined, does not shape stakes or tactics, and does not recur or evolve. The concept of accumulated silence is present throughout, but "interlaced hush" itself remains ornamental description. No middle development or closure participation; the phrase does not change options or create pressure. Present but inert.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Accumulates silence" is signaled early ("silence that accumulated with every passing moment") and recurs across beats: "letting the silence accumulate around her" (paragraph 3), "accumulated silence pressing heavier" (paragraph 5), "accumulated silence had been lifted" (paragraph 8). Setup, middle development, and closure participation are all present. The attribute shapes atmosphere and deepens pressure (heavier on her chest), but does not constrain a concrete choice—Elara does not trade silence for action or forgo an option because of it. The cost is emotional weight rather than tactical limitation. The lyric reprise in the ending reweights the opening, pushing the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Exhume" appears once: "she would exhume the secrets of the net by unraveling its knots" (paragraph 1). Setup is early, framing the task as uncovering buried stories. Middle development is implicit in the unraveling beats (paragraphs 2, 5, 6), and closure participation is clear when the last knot unravels and the secrets are revealed (paragraph 6). The action defines Elara's method and drives the central beats, but the verb itself is not mechanically indispensable—"uncover" or "reveal" could substitute with minor edits. The lyric charge of "exhume" (death, burial, spirits) adds thematic weight and ties to the closure image of spirits finding peace, elevating the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method—unraveling knots in a centuries-old fisherman's net—is signaled in paragraph 1 and drives all major beats: loosening the first knot (paragraph 2), grappling with stubborn knots (paragraph 5), the final knot unraveling (paragraph 6), and the net sagging loose at closure (paragraph 7). Setup, middle development, and closure participation are all strong. The mechanics matter: each knot is a story, resistance reflects spirits' reluctance, and unraveling is the visible means of grounding them. The method is irreplaceable—changing it to, say, repairing tears would fundamentally alter the story's logic. The cost (spirits' sorrow, Elara's effort) is tied directly to the method's difficulty.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary under starlight is established immediately and recurs across beats: starlight filtering through stained glass (paragraph 1), starlight shifting as night deepens (paragraph 5), prismatic shadows on walls (paragraph 6), starlight bathing the sanctuary at closure (paragraph 8), and the final prism of light on Elara's path (paragraph 9). Setup, middle, and closure participation are present. However, the setting does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The stained glass and prismatic light add thematic resonance (fragmentation, refraction) but do not shape Elara's decisions. The final prism image charges the ending lyrically, preventing a lower score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>0.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across sharing a secret" does not appear on the page in any form. The story tracks time vaguely ("hours passed, the starlight shifting as the night deepened") but does not dramatize secret-sharing or use it to tighten decisions. The net's secrets are exhumed rather than shared collaboratively, and no temporal pressure tied to secrecy constrains Elara's choices. The required element is functionally absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to ground restless spirits—is stated in paragraph 1 ("to ground those spirits, to give them peace") and dramatized across beats: unraveling knots to release whispers (paragraph 2), grappling with spirits' resistance (paragraph 5), understanding her purpose to honor their stories (paragraph 6), and achieving peace at closure (paragraph 7). Setup, middle development, and closure participation are all present. The motivation shapes her actions and the ending's meaning. However, it is not conflicted—Elara never questions or pays a personal price for grounding the spirits; her own "restless spirit" finds solace without friction between wants and costs. The desire is told and enacted but not tested by trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is signaled in paragraph 1 ("her own heart carried its own lucid unrest") and modulates across beats: steady breath and precise task (paragraph 2), mind "grappling with the weight" (paragraph 3), "accumulated silence pressing heavier" and "breath catching" (paragraph 5), profound stillness at closure (paragraph 7), and "heart steady, spirit grounded" in the final paragraph. Setup, middle, and closure participation are present. The tone shifts from restless clarity to earned stillness, charging the final image. However, "lucid unrest" as a specific phrase does not recur or constrain a choice; the tonal modulation is atmospheric rather than tactical. The coherence across turns and the closure reweighting push the score into mid-high band.</comment>
