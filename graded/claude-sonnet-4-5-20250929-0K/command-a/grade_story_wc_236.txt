<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is present but skews toward label-only emotion ("trembling calm," "deep-seated motivation") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The core choice—reaching for the screw and offering interpretation—lands without visible cost or foreclosed path; Mira's tears and Elara's smile feel like therapeutic validation rather than a decision under pressure. Backstory (loss of smell) is integrated but remains abstract; the trait doesn't constrain a concrete on-page micro-choice that alters present options. Mira is functional but passive, serving as a delivery mechanism rather than applying immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly by the opening paragraph; no penalty. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: fog lifts, screw is handled, interpretation offered, final image reconfigures Elara's stance. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elara "finds her own ordinary miracle" by accepting her altered navigation—but the cost is declared rather than dramatized; no specific on-page action or forfeiture makes the "before/after" viscerally legible. The final paragraph summarizes realization instead of letting the image do the work, weakening closure immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The water clock shop is vividly anchored (fog, brass gears, drip echoing heartbeat) and the screw is handled across multiple beats, satisfying micro-setting and object-as-setting criteria. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's compensatory senses. The screw constrains Elara's attention and charges the final exchange, nudging the piece toward the 9+ gate, but spatial choreography during Mira's return is compressed and the shop's physical layout doesn't alter tactics or constrain choice in a high-pressure beat, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elara's search for solace and meaning through the screw—is signaled early but never tightens into a live choice with competing costs. The piece deepens understanding (she "understood" the screw's meaning) without a reversal or decision that forecloses an option. Mira's arrival and the screw handoff are beats of exposition and validation, not escalation. No visible price paid; Elara's final stance is presented as arrival rather than renunciation or trade-off, keeping the piece in mid-band under Accumulative pressure logic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme—finding miracles in the ordinary through occluded perception—emerges from particulars (lost smell, screw as relic, water clock) rather than assertion. The final paragraph over-articulates the thematic answer ("she had learned to navigate it differently," "to see what others could not"), shifting from image to meta-commentary. The screw accumulates meaning across beats and the fog-to-light transition supports the arc, but the closing lines state the theme rather than letting the screw and Elara's gesture carry it, preventing entry to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (Elara's heightened non-olfactory senses) is present but not deployed under peak pressure—her "closing her eyes" moment tells rather than shows sensory compensation through concrete, character-specific detail. Dialogue between Elara and Mira is functional and advances plot, but both speak in similarly elevated register ("testament to the quiet strength," "miracles were in the ordinary"), reducing voice distinction. Diction remains controlled; no filter-verb stacks or register drift, keeping the piece in solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs lower momentum: "loss and resilience" / "gift—or curse"; "occluded views, piecing together fragments" / "to navigate it differently"; repeated "She [verb], [object]" stems across paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("breath of ancient mechanisms," "bridge between generations") and therapy-speak ("maps emotional terrain," "trembling calm") appear in peak beats without fresh embodiment. The closing paragraph is expository summary rather than image-driven propulsion, triggering artifact penalties. Information density is adequate early but flattens at closure, capping the score below 6.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aromatherapist-who-lost-smell paired with water-clock-repair and birthing-clamp-screw is a purposeful synthesis of sensory loss and time/life motifs. The execution, however, leans on familiar beats: protagonist seeks solace in quiet space, receives symbolic object from client, offers interpretation, client cries, protagonist finds renewed purpose. The emotional arc (loss → acceptance → renewed vision) is a well-worn template; no sharp turn or non-obvious moral calculus transforms it. The screw's symbolic role (life-bringing tool) is stated rather than dramatized through unexpected cost or complication, keeping originality in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her loss of smell frames perception, but she makes no key on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her actions—adjusting gears, reaching for the screw, offering interpretation—are observations and validations rather than choices under competing pressure. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is passive (she "realized"), capping the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The screw appears in three beats: introduction on workbench, Mira's backstory, Elara's handling and interpretation. It is handed, turned, and described with evolving meaning (tool → relic → testament), satisfying setup, development, and closure gates. The screw enables Elara's final insight and charges the Mira exchange, but it does not constrain a choice with visible cost—Elara's handling is reflective rather than decisive—keeping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Reading between lines" is named in the opening and echoed thematically ("to read between the lines of what was left unsaid," "unveil the miracles hidden in plain sight") but does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. Elara interprets the screw's meaning for Mira without a cost or competing reading, making the concept ornamental rather than causal. Setup and closure mention are present; middle development is absent, capping below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Maps emotional terrain" is introduced as a trait sharpened by Elara's loss ("teaching her to listen to the silence, to see the unseen") and invoked at closure ("navigate it differently"). It frames her approach but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible trade-off; the trait is label-heavy and summary-driven rather than dramatized through a micro-choice under pressure. Setup and closure gates met; development absent, capping at 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Humanize" appears as Elara's stated motivation ("to humanize the forgotten") and is enacted when she offers interpretation to Mira, but the action is validation rather than a turn that redefines options or forecloses a path. The piece could function with "understand" or "honor" in place of "humanize" with minimal edit, indicating mid-band replaceability. Present across beats but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Through occluded views" is introduced early ("forced to navigate life through occluded views, piecing together fragments") and reprised at closure, but the method does not shape Elara's tactics or constrain her choices in scene. The phrase remains metaphorical label rather than a dramatized mechanic—Elara does not enact "occluded" perception in a way that alters her handling of the screw or Mira. Setup and closure mention present; middle development absent, capping below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The water clock repair shop is vividly established in the opening (fog, brass gears, drip) and frames the entire scene, satisfying setup and continuous presence. The shop supplies the workbench and the "sanctuary" atmosphere but does not pressure a choice or alter tactics; Elara's actions would function identically in any quiet workspace. One causal beat (shop as gathering place for Mira's return) and strong sensory grounding earn mid-band, but lack of tactical constraint prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Hush of morning fog" opens the piece and the fog lifts by Mira's departure, creating a before/after atmospheric bracket. Time is not tracked as a live constraint—no clock pressure or urgency tightens decisions. The timeframe supplies mood and lyric symmetry but does not alter Elara's tactics or force a choice under temporal pressure. Setup and closure gates met; development (time as tactic-shaper) absent, capping below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To unveil ordinary miracles" is Elara's stated motivation, introduced early and echoed at closure ("she found her own ordinary miracle"). The desire drives her engagement with the screw and Mira, shaping two beats (investigation, interpretation). However, the motivation is not conflicted or tested—Elara does not face a cost or competing want that would reveal friction between desire and price. All three gates present; lack of dramatized conflict caps below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Trembling calm" is introduced as Elara's defining state ("trembling with a calm born of both loss and resilience") and echoed when she describes the grandmother's steadiness ("a trembling calm, a balance between fear and faith"). The tone is coherent and purposeful, modulating from quiet observation to charged interpretation without rupture. The phrase charges the Mira exchange and the final image, but the tone does not escalate under pressure—it remains steady throughout—preventing entry to higher bands. Strong lyric reprise and closure linkage earn mid-6s.</comment>
