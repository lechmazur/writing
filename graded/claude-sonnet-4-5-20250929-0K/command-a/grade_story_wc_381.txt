<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("profound sense of peace," "weight of her responsibility") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. Her motivation to "smooth the hush" is declared but never tested by a credible on-page obstacle that forces a trade-off or reveals internal contradiction. The summoner's competence proceeds without genuine struggle or blind spots; she completes the ritual smoothly, and no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The ending's sense of accomplishment is asserted rather than earned through causality that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present early (who, where, when), avoiding the Orientation Test penalty. However, closure relies on assertion: "she smoothed the hush, sealing the prophecy within a silent void" summarizes the climactic act rather than dramatizing a decisive change with on-page cost. The story teaches an accumulative/textural lens through ritual description, but the final image ("the crane's wing glowed brighter… she felt a profound sense of peace") does not reweight prior material or crystallize a new cost—it simply declares success. The prophecy's threat is told, never tested, and the resolution lands off-page in summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven, brook, and moss-covered stone are vividly rendered with sensory detail ("scent of damp earth and pine," "gentle gurgle of water"). The brook's rhythm mirrors Elara's internal state and the crane's wing casts "intricate shadows," but these details remain atmospheric rather than constraining a choice or altering tactics. The setting does not pressure the ritual's outcome or supply a resource that changes the ending. Spatial choreography is clear, and the environment evolves ("the brook's flow seemed to pause"), but this is decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early but never faces a credible on-page obstacle. Elara's ritual proceeds without reversal, tightening, or visible trade-off; the prophecy "resists" in metaphor ("thrashing like a trapped animal") but no action or choice changes tactics or forecloses an option. The piece teaches an accumulative lens through ritual texture, yet pressure remains static: Elara focuses, the wing glows, success is declared. No meaningful escalation or deepening narrows her path, and coincidence does not complicate—the ritual simply works as planned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of silence-as-weapon emerges through the ritual's imagery, and the crane's origami wing recurs with shifting light, but the final image does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer. Instead, the ending states the theme directly: "silence was both weapon and shield," "the tranquil blaze of her determination illuminated her path." Prompt-language labels ("terrestrially cosmic," "tranquil blaze") intrude without dramatized cost. The prophecy remains a shadow, an abstraction never tested, so thematic resonance stays decorative rather than earned through causal pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction is controlled within Elara's perceptual frame. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction during key beats ("terrestrially cosmic origin," "smoothing the hush," "tranquil blaze") that feel prompt-imposed rather than character-particular. The narration occasionally explains what has just been shown: "She felt a profound sense of peace, knowing she had averted a catastrophe" summarizes rather than trusts the prior image. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs, but the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence appear across multiple beats: "The haven fell into an even deeper quiet, the brook's gurgle now a distant memory" restates the prior paragraph's "pause" without added pressure. Stock metaphors cluster in the climax: "weaving threads of moonlight," "mist in her mind," "trapped animal." Figurative language appears in most sentences of the ritual sequence without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity. Sentences often do more than one job, but scaffold phrases ("she knew," "she felt") dull immediacy. The final paragraph stacks summary and abstraction, flattening the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—summoner performing a ritual to seal a prophecy—follows a familiar fantasy template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The crane's origami wing is a decorative prop; its "terrestrially cosmic origin" is told, not integrated into the world's logic or Elara's stakes. Prompt elements ("smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "mapping silence") appear as labels rather than organic synthesis. The emotional arc and ritual beats could transfer to any summoner/prophecy story with minor edits. No bold risk-taking or fresh inflection elevates the execution above median genre conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her choices do not create key turns. She decides to perform the ritual, then executes it without altering tactics or facing a choice that narrows options. The summoner role is label-only; observation and internal narration dominate, and the final "work was not done" is a declared intention rather than a decision with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears in three beats: Elara clutches it at opening, it vibrates and glows during the ritual, and she tucks it in her cloak at the end. The wing's "glow dimmed" signals fragility, adding a charged reprise, but its use remains largely static description. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress; Elara simply holds it while the ritual proceeds. The wing's presence shapes atmosphere but is not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" is mentioned as a technique Elara must master and appears in the climactic sentence, but its mechanics are told in metaphor ("drawing silence into a cocoon") rather than dramatized with on-page stakes. The concept does not alter tactics or force a trade-off; it is the goal of the ritual, achieved without visible cost. The phrase recurs but remains thematic rather than operational.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears once as a label for the wing's origin and is never operationalized. It does not constrain or enable an action, impose a cost, or shape a choice. The attribute is ornamental exposition that could be removed without affecting the ritual's logic or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Flow" recurs as the brook's rhythm and Elara's mental alignment ("her thoughts becoming as fluid as the water"), shaping the ritual's atmosphere. The brook's pause mid-ritual adds texture, but flow does not create a major turn or redefine options. Elara could achieve the same result through stillness or breath; the element is thematically present but causally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is introduced as a method taught by Elara's mentor and signaled in paragraph two. She "focused on the brook" and "began to shape the silence," but the mechanics remain metaphorical. The method does not visibly alter her attempts or impose a cost; it is the ritual's frame, present but not tested or developed across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the brook is vividly rendered and recurs across all three sections. The brook's rhythm anchors Elara's focus, and its "pause" mirrors the ritual's climax. However, the setting does not pressure her choices or supply a resource that alters tactics. The haven is described as a sanctuary at the end, charging the final image, but it does not impose a constraint or enable a solution. Present in setup, middle, and payoff, but its role remains atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" appears in the final paragraph as a summary phrase rather than a tracked timeframe. The story unfolds in one continuous ritual with no clock or deadline that tightens decisions. "Whispered secrets" are mentioned as fragments of the prophecy in paragraph two but do not impose temporal pressure or alter Elara's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to hush the prophecy is stated early and drives the ritual, satisfying setup and development. The prophecy "threatened to unravel the balance of her world," providing external stakes, but her desire is not dramatized through friction or a conflicted choice. She proceeds without internal resistance or a trade-off that reveals competing wants. Present across beats and linked to closure, but the cost is told rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" appears as a phrase in paragraphs two and eight, labeling Elara's determination. The tone remains calm and descriptive throughout, with no meaningful modulation under pressure; the ritual beats are textured but emotionally static. The phrase does not charge the final image or create a tonal shift that reweights the stakes. Present in setup and ending, but its integration is thematic rather than tonal.</comment>
