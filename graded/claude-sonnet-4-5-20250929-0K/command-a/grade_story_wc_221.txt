<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior is abstract and label-heavy throughout ("gift that had branded them an outcast," "heart heavy with purpose"). The motivation to "turn confusion into exploration" is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. No meaningful choice or renunciation forecloses a path with visible cost; the final stance—"quiet resolve" and "calling"—arrives as assertion rather than earned transformation. Embodied emotion is sparse; much of the interiority reads as summary or therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who, where, and when by the end of paragraph one, meeting orientation thresholds. However, no on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs; the ending offers only declaration ("her journey had only just begun") without visible cost or a crystallized choice that forecloses a path. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with felt consequence. Closure form fails the core requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observation deck is described vividly with "sleek, metallic surfaces" and "faint patina of neglect," but remains static postcard setting. The gilded compass rose appears twice yet never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, but the environment does not pressure decisions or charge the final image; Elara could sketch anywhere without structural impact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—navigating temporal chaos to find "true north"—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; sketching proceeds without complication or cost. The shutdown and temporal anomalies remain abstract backdrop rather than forces that compel trade-offs. Agency is observation and declaration, not decision or renunciation with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly: "to turn confusion into exploration" and "true north" appear as prompt-label echoes rather than emergent particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("not a curse, but a calling"), replacing scene pressure with thematic summary. The compass rose and stars are ornamental symbols that do not reweight prior material or constrain choice. No resonant, non-literal answer arises from concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and psychic distance is consistent. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("monument to humanity's fleeting grasp of eternity") that reads generic rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is weak; Elara's noticing lacks selective bias. Sentence stems repeat across paragraphs ("Each stroke," "Each line," "It was as if"), creating template cadence that flattens voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops appear: paragraph two ("The compass rose was more than a decoration; it was a key") restates without adding pressure. Template cadence runs through the final two paragraphs with "each" anaphora. Stock metaphors ("ancient dance," "threads that connected these moments") cluster without fresh inflection. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to hum") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Prose artifacts touch the closure scene, disallowing 9+ globally per the rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise—temporal anomaly grants perception of "true north"—follows familiar outcast-with-gift templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious stakes. The blessed-pariah trope, sketching ritual, and compass rose remain generic markers. No bold risk or fresh synthesis; plot and arc would function unchanged with different proper nouns. Proximity to template writing and lack of specific human calculus keep this firmly derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no choice that creates a turn. Observation and declaration dominate; sketching is uncontested. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The compass rose appears in paragraphs two and five. First mention is static description; second claims it "hums with energy" but this does not enable or constrain action. No evolving use or reweighted reprise at closure; ornamental across both beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"True north" is referenced repeatedly but remains abstract theme claim. It does not change options or tactics on the page; Elara's perception of it is told rather than demonstrated through a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" describes the cosmos and observation deck but imposes no on-page constraint or trade-off. Label-only mentions in paragraphs one, three, and six without visible mechanical pressure on action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Glimpse" recurs as Elara's perceptual gift but does not drive a turn. It frames her ability but remains static; easily swappable with "perceive" or "sense" without altering structure or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The family custom is mentioned in paragraph two and executed in paragraphs three through six. It provides the frame for the night's activity but does not shape attempts under resistance or constrain choices. Present in setup, development, and ending, but mechanics remain inert.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The observation deck is named in the opening and closing paragraphs and frames the entire scene. It provides locale but does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome; postcard function with closure mention but no causal participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" establishes backstory context in paragraph four but does not function as a live timeframe tightening decisions. The shutdown is past event, not a present clock; time remains vague and untracked across the sketching.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To turn confusion into exploration" is stated in paragraph one and echoed at closure. It frames desire but is never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between want and cost; told motivation without on-page test.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" appears in paragraphs three, five, and six, establishing a consistent mood. Tone is static rather than modulating with pressure; no cadence shift charges the final image. Coherent but does not intensify or reweight stakes.</comment>
