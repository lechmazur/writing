<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to find where stories begin—is declared but never tested by on-page friction or cost. Her "quantifying absence" method and her years-long quest are told, not dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The vial retrieval is mechanical; no forfeiture or micro-choice alters her stance. Interiority reads as abstract summary ("her heart quickened") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words with no anchoring "who" or grounding action; the opening prioritizes atmospheric description over spatial clarity. The closure—moonlight spilling onto blank pages, the library aligning—lacks visible cost or a legible before/after in Elara's options or knowledge; the transformation happens to the setting, not through her agency. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught only in retrospect and does not cohere with the causal setup of the vial quest. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the library "awakens" off-stage while Elara descends.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and swirling clouds supply vivid visuals but remain postcard description; no environmental constraint shapes Elara's choices or tactics. The vial's ledge location and the incision task read as conveniences rather than earned spatial pressure. Micro-setting (the blade, the vial) is handled but does not charge the final image or foreclose an option.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the place where stories begin"—is declared but never tested by a live trade-off or narrowing choice. The vial retrieval and incision proceed without complication or reversal; no on-page obstacle forces Elara to alter tactics or pay a visible price. The library's transformation is coincidental, not driven by protagonist agency under the chosen lens. Escalation is absent; the story moves through declaration rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of "integrated fragmentation" is stated in the moonlight-spilled text rather than earned through image or choice. The piece leans on meta-commentary ("the place where stories begin") and prompt labels ("glimmering parole," "clean slate vendor") in place of subtext. The final paragraph moralizes ("the first day became the first page") rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The blank-page-filling moment could land thematically but is undermined by expository summary of what the tale "spoke of."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent in register and distance but lacks a distinct perceptual signature; Elara's way of noticing reads as neutral catalog rather than character-particular bias. Diction tilts elevated ("repository of narratives in flux," "quantifying absence") without grounding in her idiom or occupation. No dialogue appears to test for subtext or goal pursuit. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose does not modulate under pressure; the incision scene and descent carry identical syntactic rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in paragraph three ("This was no ordinary library; it was a repository of narratives in flux, a place where beginnings and endings blurred") and five ("The story it contained was not yet written; it was hers to craft") reduce density. Template cadence: "She believed… She knew… She placed…" across multiple beats. Stock metaphors ("heart quickened," "hold its breath") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "knew instinctively") dull immediacy in peak moments. The final paragraph over-explains closure rather than trusting the image. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—a vendor seeking story origins in a fragmented library—feels derivative of meta-fiction templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Elara's method ("quantifying absence") is named but never visualized or constrained by cost. The blank-page reveal and patron chorus are convenient rather than inevitable in hindsight. "Glimmering parole" and "bottled moonlight" read as quirky ornament rather than organic synthesis. No bold risk-taking or perspectival surprise elevates the familiar arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara (clean slate vendor) is named and present throughout but makes no key choice that alters tactics or options. Her ascent, incision, and descent proceed without friction or reversal; the vial and blank book are retrieved by rote. She observes the library's transformation rather than causing it. Closure participation is ornamental—she "placed the now-empty vial back in her cart"—without agency or cost tied to her vendor role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Bottled moonlight appears in three beats: cart description, ledge retrieval, and spilling onto pages. The retrieval is mechanical; the spilling triggers off-stage transformation rather than on-page cost. The vial's "pulsating rhythm" is noted but does not constrain choice or enable a tactic under pressure. The final "glow dimmed" mention is ornamental. The object is present but swappable for any magical catalyst with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Glimmering parole" is coined and defined ("unspoken promises and regrets") in paragraph two but never shapes stakes or tactics. Patrons carry paroles, yet no scene dramatizes how they constrain or enable action. The concept is theme decoration, not a causal force. Closure does not hinge on parole; it could be excised without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Mindfully scattered" modifies the vial's placement but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The term appears once, describing location rather than a trait with visible trade-offs. No choice hinges on this attribute; it reads as ornamental phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Incise" appears in paragraph four as the method to retrieve the vial; Elara traces and frees the ledge. The action is functional but easily swappable (lift, pry, unlock) with minor edits. No major turn traces uniquely to incision; the library's transformation follows spilling moonlight, not cutting glass. The blade hums and the library holds its breath, yet no cost or reversal is tied to the incision itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>0.9</grade><comment>"Quantifying absence" is named as Elara's method ("measuring the spaces between words, the silences") but never demonstrated in action. The incision scene describes tracing an outline, not calculating voids or applying the method's mechanics. The concept is summary-only; removing it would not alter the scene's outcome or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The glass orchard library floating on clouds is vividly described but supplies no resource or constraint that alters Elara's choices. The fragmented shelves and hovering books are atmosphere; Elara's ascent and incision proceed unimpeded. The library's alignment at closure is off-stage transformation, not a setting feature that charges the final image or shapes tactics. Setting is postcard rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"The lull between dawn's bustle and the expected crowd" and "the store's very first opening day" frame the scene temporally but do not tighten decisions or tactics. No live clock pressures Elara's retrieval; the patrons arrive when the plot requires them. Time is static backdrop rather than a constraint that alters moves. Late in the story, "the lull… had passed" is told, not demonstrated through urgency or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To find the place where stories begin" is stated as Elara's motivation in paragraph one and restated at closure. No on-page friction tests this desire; no competing want or fear creates tension. The blank book fulfills the quest without cost or complication. Motivation is told-only; removing the phrase would leave the vial-retrieval plot intact.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Integrated fragmentation" as tone is declared in the moonlight-spilled text and mentioned again at closure, but the prose itself does not embody fragmentation through syntax, rhythm, or perspective. The narrative voice remains smoothly expository throughout; no modulation occurs under pressure. The concept is theme claim rather than tonal execution that charges the final image.</comment>
