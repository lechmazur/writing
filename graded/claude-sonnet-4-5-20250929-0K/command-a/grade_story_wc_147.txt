<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("unexpected connection," "deep motivation") rather than embodied contradiction. The shift from survival to discovery at the end feels asserted rather than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclose a live option. Her agency remains passive—visions flood her mind, the temple transforms around her—without genuine struggle or visible cost that would make the renunciation of the distress signal meaningful. The piece tells us she "let go of her fears" without dramatizing what that costs in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn Maya is trapped only after introductory description, and "limited oxygen" appears once then vanishes as a constraint. The closure unit—Maya's shift from survival to discovery—lacks visible cost; the distress signal becomes "unnecessary" off-page, and her safe return is summarized without obstacle. Causality is thin: the vial "touches memories" through passive reception, the temple walls shift by themselves, and no protagonist choice meaningfully narrows options or changes knowledge in a way that forecloses a path. Under an attempted Causal lens, the because/therefore linkage is missing at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The underwater temple is described in generic terms ("stone walls," "intricate carvings," "hidden passages") that could fit any forgotten ruin. Spatial choreography is vague—Maya moves through shifting walls and discovers chambers without clear navigation or cost tied to the environment's constraints. The crystals in the heart chamber are vivid but ornamental; they emit glow and energy without altering Maya's tactical options. The setting does not meaningfully constrain the final choice or charge the closure image, capping high-band eligibility per Q3's 9+ test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—survival via limited oxygen—is signaled early but then abandoned without dramatization; Maya's shift to "discovery" happens by assertion rather than through a tightening choice that forecloses survival. No meaningful reversal or escalation occurs: the vial passively delivers visions, the temple obligingly reveals passages, and the distress signal is dismissed off-page. Coincidence resolves the problem (walls shift, chambers appear) without protagonist agency or visible cost. The piece declares escalation ("time running short," "weight of time") but never dramatizes a moment where that pressure forces a trade-off or narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated in the final paragraph ("lonesome splendor," "beauty that lay just beyond the edge of everyday life") rather than emerging from concrete image and action. The concept of harnessing the ephemeral is discussed in backstory visions but never tested on the page through Maya's own choices. The vial and crystals remain symbolic conveniences without forcing a thematic trade-off. The ending summarizes meaning rather than offering a resonant final image that reweights prior material, triggering the penalty for final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third limited, but narrative distance wavers between close interiority and detached summary. Diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("lonesome splendor," "harness the ephemeral," "transcended time and space") that feels imported rather than character-particular. The piece uses heavy filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "could feel") in peak moments, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic—Maya notices what the plot requires rather than filtering detail through a marine biologist's priorities or urgencies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "unsnarl the secrets" appears three times with minimal variation; "lonesome splendor" recurs as a stock phrase without fresh context. Template cadence dominates the middle section ("She had to let go… to trust… to embrace"). Metaphors clash: the vial "emanates" glow, memories "flood," the temple "holds its breath"—mixed vehicles that obscure rather than sharpen. The prose summarizes key beats ("As she worked, the temple began to transform") instead of dramatizing them, and the final paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("peace," "wonder," "beauty") without concrete image. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack and loop check triggers cumulative deductions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—trapped explorer uses mystical artifact to unlock ancient secrets—is a well-worn template executed without fresh inflection. The vial's memory-touch ability and the self-rearranging temple are stock fantasy conveniences. Maya's marine biologist background is mentioned but never constrains her choices or colors her perception in discipline-specific ways. The piece hedges every risk: Maya survives, unlocks the temple, and returns safely to "share her story with the world," delivering symmetric satisfaction without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Maya sends a distress signal early and dismisses it late, but the signal itself does not create turns or constrain choices. She is present throughout but her role as "sender" is ornamental—removing this label would not alter plot logic. Setup and closure gates are nominally met, but no middle beat hinges on this identity, and the final dismissal is told rather than dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The vial appears early in an alcove, delivers passive visions in the middle, and is "safely tucked away" at the end—three beats, but none involve active use that alters tactics. It is described and held, not wielded in a way that forecloses options or charges the closure image with visible cost. The vial's memory-touch function is told rather than shown through specific, costly application. Swappable with any mystical key object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" appears twice as atmospheric description ("symbols of a gathered hush," "gathered hush of the temple") but never shapes stakes or alters tactics on the page. It functions as a mood label rather than a constraint or resource. No cost or choice is tied to this concept; removing it would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The vial's attribute—"to touch memories"—delivers visions passively to Maya without requiring her to do anything or pay a cost. It appears in the middle section but does not constrain choices or enable a trade-off; the memories simply arrive. Label-only trait usage without visible friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" is named three times and described as both physical and mental, but the actual process is summarized ("began to unsnarl the complex web") rather than dramatized. No specific turn traces to this action; Maya looks at symbols and the temple obligingly transforms. Easily swappable with "decode," "unlock," or "solve." Setup and closure gates are met, but middle development is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Override her instinct to flee" is mentioned once in the middle section as a requirement but never shown as a method that shapes attempts or costs. Maya simply closes her eyes and works; no moment dramatizes the override or its friction. The method is declared, not used.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The underwater temple is present throughout and provides the frame for all action—setup, middle, and closure gates are met. However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint: walls shift to help Maya, chambers reveal themselves, and no environmental cost (oxygen depletion, navigation hazard) alters her tactics. The temple's "forgotten" status and specific features (crystals, alcoves) are described but do not force choices. Present in closure but not causally shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Time runs short" is declared twice but never tracked or dramatized. The oxygen limit is mentioned once at the start and then forgotten; no ticking clock forces Maya to choose speed over thoroughness or drives a tactical trade-off. Time does not tighten decisions on the page. Vague, untracked timeframe that does not alter moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation "to harness the ephemeral" is attributed to the ancient priestess in a vision, then claimed to resonate with Maya's own desire, but never dramatized through Maya's on-page choices. Her shift from survival to discovery is told rather than shown through conflicting wants or costs. The motivation is a thematic label, not a lived friction. Told-only with no on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears three times as a repeated phrase describing the priestess's voice, Maya's solitude, and the final mood. The tone is asserted through the label rather than built through image, rhythm, or modulation under pressure. It remains static across beats and does not charge the final image in a way that reweights prior material. Present at closure but ornamental.</comment>
