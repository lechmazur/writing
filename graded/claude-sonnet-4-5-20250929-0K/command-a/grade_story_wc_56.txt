<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("understand the architecture of lies") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her walk along the canal and discovery of the journal unfold without internal conflict or embodied stakes—she simply finds what she seeks. The final moment ("stood tall") asserts transformation without showing what path was foreclosed or what competing desire she renounced. Interiority relies on generic phrasing ("her heart ached," "felt it in her bones") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early, but "when" remains vague ("quiet hours before dawn" becomes "first rays of sunlight" with no dramatized passage or pressure from elapsed time). The closure unit—Elara standing with journal and sundial as sunlight breaks—offers no decisive change, visible cost, or tactical foreclosure; she has salvaged a truth but the story does not show what she sacrificed, refused, or must now confront differently. Under a causal lens, the discovery sequence (walk → find barge → open chest → read journal → sundial glows) reads as linear acquisition without reversal or narrowing of options. The "warning, call to action, and promise of clarity" remains abstract assertion rather than on-page reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal supplies vivid atmospheric detail (damp earth, distant machinery hum, rotting barges, moss-covered names) and the decaying barge functions as the discovery site. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or complicate her goal—she walks, finds the exact barge she needs, and opens the chest without spatial friction. The sundial's glow and the canal's "serene upheaval" charge the mood but do not alter her tactics or enable a trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (uncovering hidden truth) is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or choice with visible cost. Elara encounters no meaningful resistance: the barge is there, the chest intact, the journal legible, the sundial obligingly glows at the needed moment. No reversal narrows her options; the walk from canal edge to barge to journal to dawn proceeds as acquisition without escalation. The stated "warning, call to action" at the end does not alter her stance on the page or foreclose a path—she stands tall with both objects, stakes unchanged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme (truth beneath layers of deception) is stated multiple times rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The sundial and journal function as symbolic keys to truth without thematic friction or counter-reading. The final image (standing tall with both relics as sunlight breaks) gestures toward transformation but offers a tidy affirmation rather than a non-literal reweighting of prior material. The captain's confession and Elara's "hindsight clarity" remain abstract; no specific detail or choice complicates the thematic premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is mostly consistent but leans toward elevated/literary register ("errant legend seeker," "serene upheaval," "thoughtfully clear and deliberate") that occasionally feels imposed rather than voice-organic. Elara's perceptual signature is generic: she notices atmosphere and mood but her way of filtering detail does not reveal character-specific priorities. Psychic distance stays mid-range throughout without modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean and mostly clear, but suffers from decorative density without propulsion: "the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and the faint hum of distant machinery, a reminder that even in stillness, life persisted" front-loads atmosphere that does not drive action. Sentence openings show some variety, though several paragraphs begin with "Elara" or "She" in succession. The sundial's "energy pulsing in sync with her heartbeat" and "the weight of his words pressing down on her" are stock embodiment. Minor paraphrase loop: "The sundial in her hand felt warm" followed two beats later by "The sundial in her hand began to glow" repeats structure without advancing pressure. No major loops or template cadence, but information density remains low across discovery beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise (relic-seeker finds truth via magical sundial) follows a familiar quest-artifact template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The twilight barge canal supplies atmospheric texture, but the core sequence—seek, find, decode, stand transformed—proceeds along well-trod paths. Elara's "errant legend seeker" role and the sundial's convenient glow at the pivotal moment rely on genre convenience rather than fresh synthesis. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as "errant legend seeker" frames the setup. She makes low-stakes decisions (walk along canal, stop at barge, open chest, read journal) but these choices do not create reversals or narrow options—each step confirms her goal without complication. The label "errant legend seeker" appears once and is not dramatized through her tactics or worldview. Swappable with "seeker" or "explorer" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The antique pocket sundial appears in setup (clutched in hand, described as key), recurs mid-scene (feels warm, pulses with heartbeat), and returns at closure (glows, rearranges markings, held in final image). However, its function is passive revelation—it glows when the journal is read—rather than constraining a choice or imposing cost. Removing it would require rewriting the revelation mechanism, but its specific properties (brass, etched patterns, glow) do not shape Elara's tactics or force a trade-off. Present across three beats but ornamental in mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Hindsight clarity" is named in the opening ("a promise of hindsight clarity") and implied at closure when the sundial reveals "a message that only she could understand." The concept does not shape on-page tactics or create a choice; it remains thematic echo rather than actionable stake. Elara does not wrestle with incomplete knowledge or make a decision that hindsight later reweights—she simply receives clarity as gift. Mentioned but not dramatized as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" appears once as descriptor ("her movements thoughtfully clear and deliberate") during the salvage beat. The trait does not constrain or enable a choice with cost; it labels her manner without altering tactics or options. Swappable with "careful" or "methodical." Label-only mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Salvage" is signaled in setup ("to salvage what was lost"), dramatized in the middle beat (she salvages debris, finds chest, retrieves journal), and echoed at closure ("she had salvaged more than a relic or a story"). The action drives the discovery sequence and the resolution hinges on what she salvaged. However, the salvage is effortless—no competing priorities, no cost, no tool constraint—so while causally central, it does not impose friction or deepen stakes. Present across all three gates with clear causal role but low cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Training instincts" is mentioned in one paragraph: "Her method was simple yet profound: to train her instincts, to trust the quiet voice within." The method is declared but not shown shaping her tactics—she walks, finds the barge "instinctively," but no prior beat demonstrates how training manifests under pressure. The sundial's glow and the journal's clarity do the revelatory work; instinct does not narrow her options or force a trade-off. Summary-only use, late functional claim, minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal is anchored in setup, supplies the discovery site (decaying barge), and recurs in the final image ("once a symbol of decay, now felt alive with possibility"). The setting provides the chest and journal; removing this exact location would require rewriting the discovery logic. However, the canal does not constrain Elara's choices—she moves freely, finds what she needs without spatial friction. Present across all three gates with clear causal role in discovery, but does not impose cost or alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"The silence of morning radio" appears once in the middle: "The morning radio, usually a source of comfort, was silent today, its absence adding to the stillness." The radio's silence contributes to atmosphere but does not tighten decisions or create time pressure. The timeframe spans "quiet hours before dawn" to "first rays of sunlight" without a ticking clock or deadline that alters Elara's moves. Ornamental mention; no causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To understand the architecture of lies" is stated in paragraph two and echoed at closure ("a truth that would change everything"). The motivation frames Elara's quest and drives the discovery sequence, but it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between wants and costs—she pursues truth without obstacle or trade-off. The journal's confession and sundial's message deliver the understanding she seeks without on-page tension. Told motivation that shapes setup and closure participation but lacks friction or cost across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is named once ("there was a serene upheaval in the air") and the tone balances calm description (stillness, quiet footsteps, slow decay) with hints of transformation (something about to change, canal alive with possibility). The tone is coherent but static—it does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image with contradiction. The ending maintains the same tranquil-transformative register without tonal turn. Functional but replaceable with "quiet transformation" or "calm anticipation."</comment>
