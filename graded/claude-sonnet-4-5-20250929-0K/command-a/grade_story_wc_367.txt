<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The Herald remains a cipher throughout—motivation ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. "Accidentally prophetic" and "shadowed elation" are labels never embodied in action or embodied perception. The final choice to steer the beam lacks visible cost; the Herald simply does what they wanted with no foreclosed path or felt price. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("Their heart swelled") rather than character-particular perception or internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn "emerald lighthouse" and "stars" immediately but the Herald's name and role arrive mid-paragraph; who/where/when cohere only by ~150 words. The piece infers a Hybrid lens (causal setup yields to accumulative fog-reveal), but closure lacks felt cost—the Herald achieves their goal with no visible trade-off, and the "gateway" resolves rather than reconfigures. The final image (beings bowing, green dawn spreading) declares success without on-page price or a legible before/after in options or stance. A Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing requires undeniable pressure at closure; here the text asserts triumph without demonstrating friction or loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vivid (emerald beam, glass walls, stars) and the wick's material ("shimmered with its own light") returns at the climax to steer the beam, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (lantern room, railing, horizon fog). However, "total internal reflection" remains a physics label without tactile constraint—we never see how the wick's mechanics limit or enable a choice. The "after the last print newspaper" anchor is ornamental, never pressing tactics. Body and tool engage the ending, lifting the score into mid-6s despite the passive postcard fog description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("shape a new dawn") is declared but never tested by a credible obstacle. The beam "no longer under their control" moment promises escalation, but the Herald grasps the wick and succeeds without visible struggle or trade-off. The fog "resisted, twisting and churning" is told, not dramatized as a constraint that narrows options or forces a choice between competing goods. Closure grants the Herald exactly what they sought with no felt price—the beings bow, the dawn arrives, and the Herald laughs triumphantly. No meaningful tightening or deepening that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the wick, fog, and dawn images, but the final paragraph ("their work was far from over") pivots to sermonizing rather than a non-literal answer. "Ancient shadows" and "new dawn" remain abstractions, never grounded in a specific action or image that reweights prior material. The piece gestures toward complexity (accidental prophecies, bridging worlds) but resolves into tidy satisfaction—no ambiguity, no cost, no residue that invites reflection. The Herald's realization ("It had been a bridge between worlds") is an explanatory claim, not an earned insight from concrete struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the Herald with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak—diction ("shadowed elation," "ethereal green") is elevated and generic rather than character-particular. The Herald's laughter recurs but never modulates under pressure in a voice-specific way; it remains a repeated gesture without embodied variation. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "understood") cluster at key beats, dulling immediacy. The final shift to direct address ("their voices a chorus") imports exterior certainty the POV cannot plausibly access with that precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops: "The Herald's laughter grew louder" / "laughter carried an edge" / "laughter faltered" / "laughter returned" / "laughter grew louder" recycles the same beat across five iterations without new pressure (−0.4). Template cadence: "They knew... / They understood. / They knew what they had to do" stacks identical stems in the climactic sequence (−0.4). Stock metaphor: "sword of light" and "battle cry against the unknown" are generic high-register phrases. Figurative density in the fog passage ("shapes moved—shapes that should not exist," "swirling light," "deep, ethereal green") blurs specificity without pattern-teaching. Sentence rhythm is serviceable but lacks propulsion; many lines do one job only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse-keeper premise is familiar; the "otherworldly routine" and "accidentally prophetic" traits are labels without on-page transformation. "Total internal reflection" imports physics vocabulary but is never dramatized as a constraint or tactic—swappable with "magic beam control." The fog-gateway-beings sequence echoes portal-fantasy templates without a fresh moral calculus or lived detail. The Herald achieves their goal with no visible trade-off, risk, or complication, yielding a safety-middle arc. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece moves through expected beats (disruption → investigation → triumph) without synthesis or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The Laughing Storm Herald is named early and adjusts the wick (first third), grasps it to steer the beam (climax), and remains on-page throughout. However, most beats are observation ("leaned over the railing, peering") or reaction ("panic flickered... replaced by curiosity") rather than decisions that alter tactics. The climactic steering is frictionless—the Herald does what they intended with no visible cost or trade-off. Beat count: adjust wick (setup), grasp wick to steer (climax)—two functional beats, but the second lacks genuine choice or constraint. Swappable with "lighthouse keeper" or "beacon tender" without breaking logic. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure weak +0.2, closure linkage +0.7, swappability −0.6, label-only trait (accidentally prophetic) −0.3, summary triumph −0.4. Start 3.0 + 1.9 − 1.3 = 3.6, round to 4.1 for active presence across beats despite low agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glass lantern wick appears early ("adjusted the glass lantern wick"), described as shimmering material that channels energy (first third). Returns at climax when the Herald grasps it to steer the beam, with warmth "coursing through their fingers" charging the action. Two beats: adjust (setup), grasp to steer (climax). However, the mechanics ("total internal reflection") are told, not shown—no on-page demonstration of how the wick's properties constrain or enable the steering. Closure linkage is functional but not irreplaceable; "ancient control rod" could swap with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6 (enables steering), closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4 (shimmering material, warmth), swappability −0.5, told mechanics −0.4. Start 3.0 + 3.1 − 0.9 = 5.2, lift to 6.2 for charged reprise and tactile final use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Otherworldly routine" is named in the second paragraph ("The Herald's routine was otherworldly") but functions as atmospheric description rather than shaping stakes or tactics. The routine (adjusting the wick) is ordinary on-page; the "otherworldly" label is not dramatized through impossible physics, alien logic, or a trade-off unique to this routine. No middle beat where the routine's nature constrains a choice. At closure, the routine is reframed as "a bridge between worlds," but this is a thematic claim, not a causal force. Setup present +0.4, middle development absent, closure participation weak (thematic echo only) +0.2, ornamental use −0.7, theme-only −0.3, told-only −0.5. Start 3.0 + 0.6 − 1.5 = 2.1, lift to 3.8 for setup presence and final reframe despite low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is named once ("their movements accidentally prophetic, each twist of the wick aligning with the shifting winds") in the first third but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The trait is not tested: no moment where a prophecy proves true with a visible trade-off, no friction between intention and outcome. At closure, "Their accidental prophecies had been guiding them here" is a retrospective claim, not a dramatized mechanic. Setup present +0.4, middle development absent, closure participation weak (summary claim) +0.1, label-only −0.6, summary-only −0.5, resolves problem it didn't create −0.7 (guides to triumph without prior friction). Start 3.0 + 0.5 − 1.8 = 1.7, round to 2.4 for setup mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Steer" is the climactic action: "Steering the beam with careful precision, they directed it deeper into the fog." This beat is the story's peak, shaping the gateway reveal and the beings' arrival. However, the steering is frictionless—no visible constraint, trade-off, or failed attempt that tests the action's difficulty. The Herald grasps the wick and succeeds; "the fog resisted" is told without on-page demonstration. Early signal weak (not set up as a challenge until late), two beats (mid-turn "the beam was no longer under their control" + climax steer) +0.9, causal pressure +0.8 (defines climax), closure linkage +1.2 (action produces gateway), swappability −0.5 ("guide" or "direct" would serve), summary triumph −0.6. Start 3.0 + 2.9 − 1.1 = 4.8, lift to 5.9 for climactic centrality despite lack of visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Through total internal reflection" is named once in the fourth paragraph ("channeled the lighthouse's energy through total internal reflection") and mentioned again at climax ("using the principles of total internal reflection to carve a path"). However, the mechanics are never shown—no on-page demonstration of bending light, no constraint tied to angles or material, no choice shaped by the method's limits. The phrase is a physics label that could be swapped for "with ancient magic" without altering tactics. Late first appearance (after 25%) −0.4, middle development absent, closure participation weak (mentioned but not shown) +0.2, ornamental −0.8, swappability −0.7, label-only −0.3. Start 3.0 + 0.2 − 2.2 = 0.8, round to 1.8 for dual mentions despite zero causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse under stars is anchored immediately and returns throughout: lantern room, glass walls, railing, beam, horizon fog, waves. The setting supplies the wick and beam as tools that enable the climax, and the elevated vantage ("High above, in the lantern room") positions the Herald to observe the fog. However, the lighthouse itself never constrains a choice—no moment where height, isolation, or the beacon's range narrows options. The stars "seemed brighter" but do not press tactics. Early signal +0.8, three beats (setup, mid-observation, climax) +1.4, causal pressure +0.7 (provides tools), closure linkage +0.9 (beam shapes gateway), specificity +0.5 (emerald, glass, green glow), postcard fog description −0.6. Start 3.0 + 4.3 − 0.6 = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"After the last print newspaper had been delivered" anchors the opening but never returns or shapes a decision. The phrase establishes a vague "quiet hours" timeframe but does not create urgency, constrain tactics, or participate in closure. No live clock, no deadline, no temporal pressure. The Herald's adjustments occur "tonight," but duration and pacing are untracked. Setup present +0.3, middle development absent, closure participation absent, ornamental −0.8, vague-only −0.5. Start 3.0 + 0.3 − 1.3 = 2.0, drop to 1.2 for zero causal work and missing closure participation cap at 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated in the sixth paragraph as the Herald's motivation and returns at closure when "the new dawn they had sought" arrives. However, the desire is never dramatized in friction—no moment where shaping the dawn costs the Herald something they value, no trade-off between ancient and new. The motivation is achieved without visible price; the beings bow, the dawn spreads, and "their work was far from over" extends the goal rather than confronting its cost. Early signal weak (stated after ~20%) −0.3, two beats (statement + closure) +0.9, causal pressure weak +0.3, closure linkage +0.8, told-only −0.6, no friction −0.7. Start 3.0 + 2.0 − 1.6 = 3.4, lift to 4.9 for presence at closure despite lack of dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Shadowed elation" is named once ("the Herald's laughter carried an edge of shadowed elation") and recurs implicitly through laughter beats that shift (faltered, returned deeper, grew louder, triumphant and tender). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure, though the specific phrase "shadowed elation" is label-only and never embodied in contradictory perception or action. At closure, the tone charges the final image ("triumphant and tender") with layered emotion, but "shadowed" remains asserted rather than shown through a visible cost or dark undercurrent. Early signal +0.5, three beats (mid-turn, climax, closure) +1.4, causal pressure +0.4 (laughter modulates with beam crisis), closure linkage +0.9, label-only −0.4, told emotion −0.3. Start 3.0 + 3.2 − 0.7 = 5.5, round to 5.6 for coherent modulation and closure charge.</comment>
