<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection ("gaps—unexplained absences, missing pieces") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The stranger's borrowed memories are told rather than dramatized through Elias's choices; his investigation yields discovery (journal, boot print) but no micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final "strange sense of peace" arrives without internal friction or trade-off, reading as resolved epiphany rather than earned endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (lighthouse keeper, opal dock, nautical twilight). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elias observes traces, finds the journal, pieces together the stranger's quest, and accepts stewardship of borrowed memories. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the boutonnière shifts from relic to trust), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path on the page. The journal's appearance is convenient rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse beam establish vivid atmosphere through selective sensory detail (weathered planks glistening, mist as "living thing"). The boot print and journal anchor micro-setting participation. However, environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as backdrop and symbol rather than spatial pressure that shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the stranger's gesture—is signaled early but never tested by a dilemma or cost. Elias's investigation yields clues without reversal or narrowing of options; discovering the journal solves rather than complicates. The final acceptance of stewardship arrives without visible trade-off (time, social cost, foregone clarity), making escalation feel more like accumulation than tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of borrowed memories and witnessed isolation emerges through the journal's fragments and Elias's recognition of shared solitude. The boutonnière's shift from relic to trust offers a subtle reweighting. However, "The memories aren't mine" and the final paragraph's summation ("filling the gaps as best he could") edge toward explicit statement rather than image-driven resonance, weakening the non-literal answer test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present (Elias notices gaps, imprints, scent traces) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("witnessed isolation," "softly persistent reminder") that feels more authorial than character-specific. The "strange sense of peace" at closure is asserted rather than shown through embodied perception, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and controlled rhythm. Repeated phrase structures appear ("The mist shifted," "The stranger had been," "Elias felt") and some paraphrase loops (the boutonnière described three times in similar terms: "relic," "token," "trust"). Filter verbs ("thought he saw," "felt a pang") cluster in high-pressure beats, reducing immediacy. No severe artifacts touch closure, so non-closure cap applies (−0.4 from base 6.5).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper studying a stranger's traces is a familiar frame; borrowed memories and a journal discovered on a dock in mist follow recognizable lyric-mystery templates. The Edelweiss boutonnière and "Remember" whisper add specificity, but the emotional arc (solitary keeper accepts another's burden) does not transform the premise through non-obvious causality or risky choice. Transformation test: swapping names and setting leaves the arc largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias appears throughout and frames the investigation, but his choices are observational rather than decisive. He kneels, reads, turns toward the lighthouse—actions that discover rather than narrow options. The final acceptance is internalized without visible cost, capping the score below functional necessity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dried Edelweiss boutonnière is seeded early (stranger's gift), returns mid-story with a scent trace, and anchors the final line ("still pinned to his lapel"). It moves from relic to trust, reweighting meaning, but does not constrain a choice or impose cost. Three-gate presence with lyric reprise qualifies for mid-6s; lack of causal pressure prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Borrowed memories shape the stranger's backstory (journal entries: "The memories aren't mine") and the thematic question. Elias's final acceptance echoes the concept, but it does not narrow his options or force a trade-off on the page. The concept functions as theme rather than stake-altering mechanism, limiting integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" appears twice as descriptor (habits, reminder) but does not constrain an action or enable a visible choice with cost. It labels rather than dramatizes a trait that alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Investigate" drives the middle: Elias examines the dock, finds the boot print, discovers the journal. These beats advance knowledge and structure the accumulative arc. However, the investigation does not redefine options or impose a meaningful reversal; it solves rather than complicates, capping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" is signaled early (gaps between planks, gaps in memory) and recurs as method. Elias notices the boot print and scent trace through this lens. However, the method does not shape a tactic or impose a constraint; it describes his approach without altering the outcome or cost, placing it in the functional but replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal dock in mist anchors all beats: Elias stands at its edge, kneels at the imprint, finds the journal near the railing, turns back toward the lighthouse. Mist recurs as sensory pressure and metaphor. Setting supplies the journal (a resource) and frames the final image. It does not constrain a choice with visible cost, but closure participation and beat involvement push it into the essential range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Nautical twilight is named once in the opening and supplies dim glow. Time does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or track across beats. It sets atmosphere but remains static, placing it in the functional but replaceable band with a small deduction for minimal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to decode the stranger's gesture is established early and drives Elias's investigation. The journal's discovery partially fulfills this motive, and the final acceptance ("carry his story forward") converts it into stewardship. However, no friction or competing want tests the motive on the page; cost is asserted rather than dramatized, limiting the score to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Witnessed isolation is coherent throughout: Elias's solitary lighthouse duty, the stranger's "loneliness born of disconnection," and the final scene where Elias internalizes the stranger's burden. Tone modulates from wary observation to quiet acceptance, charging the final image. The ending reweights the boutonnière and lighthouse beam under this tonal lens, qualifying for the essential band.</comment>
