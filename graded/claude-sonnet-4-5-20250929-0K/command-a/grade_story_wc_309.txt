<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is declared but never internally complicated. His "longing" for the keystone and desire to prove manual magic's worth remain static labels rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The keystone's touch delivers an unearned epiphany ("the sacred could be found in the simplest of acts") that reads as thematic summary, not a discovery earned through prior causality. No visible cost forecloses a path; he simply returns to "a world where his methods would still be considered outdated" with newfound belief—Earned Stasis requires on-page sacrifice or renunciation, which is absent here.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Eli is (underachieving mage), where (icebound spire), and the stakes (find keystone to prove manual magic) arrive piecemeal across the first third without a concrete anchor by ~120 words, triggering a −0.4 deduction. The closure unit—touching the keystone and feeling "clarity and purpose"—lacks visible cost; the trap stops "as if the spire itself acknowledged his effort," a passive coincidence that resolves rather than complicates. The drive lens is ambiguous (part quest-causal, part lyric meditation on creativity) and never coheres at closure, warranting an additional −0.3. One tightening (walls closing) occurs but is externally solved by a conveniently functional harness rather than protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire is vividly sketched with "frozen corridors," "shimmering chambers," and "lingering luminance," establishing atmosphere effectively. However, the environment remains postcard-static: ice outcropping appears only when needed for the harness, and the closing walls serve plot convenience without altering Eli's tactics in a character-specific way. The "garden folly keystone" as micro-setting object appears late and is described ("impossible geometry") but never handled or constrained by Eli in a meaningful choice. The spire "awakens" at the end as thematic flourish, not dramatized consequence of prior interaction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove manual magic's worth by retrieving the keystone—is signaled early but never tested by on-page trade-offs or narrowing options. The closing-wall trap introduces a beat of pressure, yet the harness resolves it without cost: Eli activates it, steps into mist, and emerges at the pedestal with no forfeited resource, injury, or moral calculus. The keystone's touch grants "clarity and purpose" but no visible price is paid—no renunciation, no lost alternative, no stamina or social credit spent. Escalation stalls after one reversal (trap triggers) with no deepening or second tightening before closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—"the sacred in the simple," heart versus efficiency—is overtly stated in paragraph two and again in the keystone epiphany, reducing emergence to assertion. The lingering luminance recurs as motif but never constrains a choice or accumulates pressure; it functions as atmospheric label. The final image ("brilliance dimness stayed with him") attempts resonance but arrives as summary rather than a non-literal answer earned from prior particulars. The piece avoids false binary only slightly; Eli's manual methods are valorized without genuine friction or cost, and the ending moralizes ("the power of the human spirit") rather than dramatizing transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Eli's perceptual signature shows some selectivity ("breath crystallized," "footsteps echoing") but lacks character-particular bias; the prose could describe any cautious explorer. Diction remains consistent in mid-register fantasy idiom without jarring shifts. However, filter verbs cluster in peak beats ("he felt a pull," "he felt weightless," "filling him with a sense") that dull immediacy during the harness activation and keystone touch, the story's two highest-pressure moments. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph shifts into summary reflection ("he knew he would return") that externalizes rather than inhabits the closure moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and no major grammatical errors. Paragraph structure varies purposefully across expository setup, action, and reflection. However, paraphrase loops appear: "lingering luminance" recurs five times without reweighting meaning, and synonym churn ("brilliance dimness," "brilliance of the spire's glow") pads texture. Template cadence runs in paragraph four: "he felt…," "as though…," "as if…" stack across three sentences during the mist-walking beat. Stock metaphors ("sea of brilliance dimness," "surge of energy") appear in the closure beat, reducing specificity when precision matters most. Applying −0.6 for loops and template cadence, −0.3 for stock phrasing in peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—manual mage in automated-creativity world seeks artifact to prove heart over efficiency—closely matches template "underdog artist in commodified world" plots without fresh inflection. The icebound spire and mist-walking offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc (doubt → effort → unearned clarity) follows a predictable path. The keystone's "impossible geometry" is described rather than explored through specific interaction that would make it irreplaceable. The ending hedges risk: Eli returns to "a world where his methods would still be considered outdated" yet now possesses belief, a safety-middle resolution that avoids genuine social or tactical cost. No bold perspectival or structural choice elevates the familiar material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Eli (underachieving mage) is present throughout and makes decisions—venture into spire, use harness, touch keystone—but these choices do not create reversals or narrow options with visible cost. His "underachieving" trait is label-only; no on-page failure or skill deficit alters his path. He succeeds at every beat (navigates maze, activates harness, claims keystone) without dramatized struggle tied to his supposed limitations. Present in closure (touches keystone) but the touch grants reward without agency-driven transformation. Setup and payoff gates met; development exists but swappable. Functional but replaceable: −0.4 swappability, −0.3 label-only trait, +0.4 one beat, +0.3 early signal, +0.7 closure linkage = base ~5.0, rounded to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Garden folly keystone introduced late (paragraph three, ~60% mark), violating early setup; apply −0.5 late penalty. Mentioned in three beats (arrival in chamber, approach during trap, touch at closure) but handled only once (touch). The touch is pivotal to closure but the keystone's "impossible geometry" and "accommodate impossibilities" claim remain decorative labels that do not constrain Eli's tactics or choices earlier. Resolves the quest it did not complicate; apply −0.7. Setup missing (late intro cap 4.6), development weak, payoff strong. Late intro −0.5, ornamental middle −0.5, resolves without prior complication −0.7, closure linkage +0.9, one beat +0.4 = base ~4.6, closure lift +1.3 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lingering luminance appears in five mentions across the story but functions only as atmospheric label and thematic echo. It does not shape stakes, alter tactics, or create a visible constraint or opportunity in any beat. The spire's glow dims when Eli ventures deeper and brightens when he descends, but these changes have no causal pressure—no choice depends on luminance level, and no cost is tied to its presence. Setup early +0.5, ornamental use −0.8, swappable with "magical glow" −0.6, label-only −0.3, no causal pressure = base ~2.8, small closure mention +0.4 = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Accommodates impossibilities is attributed to the keystone in paragraph one but never demonstrated on the page. The keystone's "impossible geometry" is described, yet no impossibility is accommodated in scene—Eli's mist-walking succeeds via the harness, not the keystone's power. The trait remains a thematic claim disconnected from dramatized action. Label-only −0.6, ornamental −0.5, no causal work, no cost, no beat involvement beyond mention. Base ~2.0, small mention +0.1 = 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Unstrap (the harness) occurs in paragraph four and is the mechanical pivot that allows Eli to bypass the closing walls via mist-walking. This action is causally central to reaching the keystone, but it resolves a problem (trap) that the harness did not help create; the harness appears conveniently when needed. The action could be swapped for another magical tool (wand, amulet) with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability. Setup weak (harness mentioned paragraph two as carried tool but not primed), development strong (one key beat), payoff indirect (enables success but does not itself close). Early weak signal +0.3, one critical beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, resolves without prior complication −0.7, swappable −0.5, closure linkage indirect +0.4 = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mist walking is mentioned in paragraph two ("a technique he'd read about in ancient tomes but never mastered") and executed in paragraph four. The mechanics matter (Eli steps into mist, becomes weightless, emerges at the pedestal), and the method enables the key turn. However, it appears only in one beat and is not signaled with enough specificity earlier to build expectation or constraint—"never mastered" implies risk, but the execution is flawless without cost. Early signal weak +0.3, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage indirect +0.4, swappable (teleportation spell) −0.5, no cost −0.3 = base ~5.1, small lift for mechanical necessity +0.2 = 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Icebound spire above the clouds is introduced early (paragraph one) and structures the entire narrative arc. The labyrinth, frozen corridors, closing chamber walls, and ice outcropping all supply setting-driven pressure. The ice outcropping provides the anchor point for the harness, a micro-setting detail that enables the key action. The spire's "lingering luminance" recurs but without tactical constraint. Postcard description dominates over lived-in interaction until the trap beat. Early signal +0.7, two beats (maze navigation, trap chamber) +0.9, causal pressure (ice outcropping enables harness) +0.8, closure linkage (spire brightens as Eli descends) +0.4, postcard tendency −0.5, partial swappability (any tower/dungeon) −0.4 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>When creativity gets automated is established in paragraph one as world context but never tightens decisions or tactics on the page. Eli's manual spellcasting and the automated looms remain background exposition; no automated system pressures his choices inside the spire, and no temporal urgency (must act before automation spreads, before peers arrive) shapes his moves. The timeframe functions as thematic set-dressing rather than a live constraint. Setup early +0.5, no beat involvement, no causal pressure, ornamental −0.8, swappable with "bygone era" −0.6, label-only −0.3 = 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>To find the sacred in the simple is stated explicitly in paragraph two and reiterated at closure ("the keystone's power wasn't in its ability to accommodate impossibilities but in its reminder that the sacred could be found in the simplest of acts"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices; no on-page beat shows Eli forsaking efficiency for heart with visible cost. The desire drives the quest structure but remains abstract. Setup early +0.5, one beat (keystone touch interprets motivation) +0.4, told-only −0.6, no friction or cost −0.5, closure linkage (thematic summary) +0.4, ornamental −0.3 = 4.6, cap at 4.6 for missing setup gate (motivation as label not choice-driver).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Brilliant dimness appears as phrase in paragraphs four and six, pairing "brilliance" with "dimness" to suggest paradox, but tone itself does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. The prose maintains a single register of reverent wonder throughout; no tonal shift marks the trap's danger or the keystone's touch. The phrase functions as decorative motif rather than a coherent tonal architecture. Two mentions, no causal work, no pressure modulation, ornamental −0.7, swappable with "mystery" or "contrast" −0.5, label-only −0.3, small closure mention +0.3 = 3.8.</comment>
