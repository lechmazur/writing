<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but never tested by a concrete choice with cost. Her "gift to heal with words" remains entirely label-only; no scene shows her using it, failing at it, or paying a price for it. The epiphany "about acknowledging the burdens she had carried in silence" arrives without prior dramatization of those burdens or any micro-choice that earns the shift. Interiority relies on therapy-speak ("fractured memories," "shared vulnerability") without embodied contradiction or a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (midnight, observatory, Elara). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: star patterns accumulate meaning until the final realization. However, no on-page closure with visible cost occurs—Elara "closes her eyes," writes, and "steps out into the dawn" without forfeiting an option, enduring a loss, or crystallizing a stance that forecloses a path. The "understanding" is told, not shown through a decisive image or renunciation. Routing −0.6 for missing felt cost at closure under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The observatory is vividly anchored (dome, telescopes, cool air) and the daylily-pressed telegram gains tactile presence ("edges frayed"). The variable stars constrain Elara's method: she must align telescopes and decode rhythms, which shapes her tactics across multiple beats. The final dawn image charges the closure moment, lifting the score into mid-6s despite some decorative star-gazing that does not alter choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the inscriptions—is signaled early but never escalates through a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. Hours pass, a pattern "suddenly" emerges, and Elara gains understanding without visible cost, risk, or sacrifice. The "plea for unity" revelation does not foreclose a path or test her commitment. No reversal, no price paid, no agency-driven turn that alters tactics or consequences on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The shared-burdens theme is stated outright ("no burden was meant to be carried alone") rather than rising from concrete choices. The daylily telegram shifts from object to symbol without a final image that reweights it through cost. The ending delivers an expository capsule ("she had found not just answers but a way to carry her own burdens with grace") that tells theme instead of embodying it in a resonant, non-literal moment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. However, diction drifts into abstraction ("mender of broken narratives," "tapestry of hope") that reads above Elara's immediate lexical register under pressure. Filter verbs cluster in the final third ("she felt," "she realized," "she knew") without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is faint; her way of noticing does not carry character-specific bias or idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "not just to record but to understand, to witness" echoes "not just knowledge but a way to heal" and "not just decoded inscriptions but unlocked a truth" without added pressure. Template stems recur ("The observatory, once…had become"; "Her gift…was not just about…but about"). Stock metaphors ("river of light," "threads…into a tapestry") lack fresh angles. Information density is low in the final paragraph, which summarizes rather than propelling. Routing −0.8 cumulative for loops and scaffold that dull the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—decode ancient inscriptions via variable stars—feels assembled from a checklist rather than organically synthesized. The emotional arc (solitary chronicler finds solace by acknowledging shared burdens) follows a familiar template without fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis. The daylily telegram and star-mapping method do not transform the stock "healing through understanding" resolution. No bold risk or specific lived detail distinguishes this from median submissions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She observes, scribbles notes, and arrives at understanding without agency-driven turns. Her role as chronicler is stated but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The daylily-pressed telegram appears early (setup gate) and returns in the final paragraph (closure gate). However, it is handled in only one beat—Elara holds it while observing stars—then described again at the end without reweighted meaning or causal pressure. It does not constrain a middle choice (missing development gate). Its "message of shared burdens" is told, not shown through evolving use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Shared burdens" is declared as the inscriptions' theme and echoed in Elara's realization, but it does not shape tactics or narrow options on the page. It remains thematic commentary rather than a stake that alters choices. The concept is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Heals with words" is mentioned twice as a label ("Her unique ability," "Her gift") but never demonstrated, constrained, or paid for in scene. No on-page action shows her using the trait, failing at it, or facing a cost tied to it. Pure ornament.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Witness" appears in two beats: the stars "seemed to witness her journey" and "The stars had witnessed her" at the end. This lyric reprise reweights the closure image with undeniable pressure, charging Elara's sense of solace. However, the action does not drive a major turn or constrain a middle choice. Early signal and closure linkage lift it into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Variable stars are signaled early (telescopes align, Elara observes pulsing rhythms) and shape her method across two beats: matching star pulses to symbols and discovering a constellation mirroring the temple. The mechanics matter—she must decode patterns—but the final understanding arrives without the stars imposing a cost or enabling a difficult trade-off. Early signal, beat involvement, and causal pressure present; missing tight closure linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The celestial mapping observatory is anchored early (dome, telescopes, machinery) and pressures Elara's method by requiring telescope alignment and star observation. The setting supplies resources (telescopes, star charts) that affect her decoding process across multiple beats. The final dawn over the observatory charges the ending image. Strong setup, development, and payoff gates; causal pressure and closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When understanding dawns" is literalized by the arrival of dawn at story's end, but time does not tighten decisions. Hours pass in summary ("Hours passed") without a live clock that alters tactics or forces a choice under pressure. The timeframe is descriptive, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The desire to decode temple inscriptions is stated early and pursued on the page through telescope observation and note-taking. However, it is never conflicted—no friction between this want and a competing cost or fear. Elara succeeds without visible sacrifice or trade-off. Early signal and beat involvement present; missing friction and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" is anchored early ("midnight hours," "observatory's atmosphere, cool and serene, mirrored the midnight solace she felt within") and modulates at closure when dawn brings renewed purpose. The tone coheres through turns and charges the final image ("In the celestial mapping observatory, under the watchful gaze of the stars, Elara had found…her solace"). Strong setup, development, and payoff; tone shift supports pressure.</comment>
