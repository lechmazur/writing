<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "midnight pattern seeker" remains abstract throughout—no biographical anchors, no embodied contradictions, no micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority consists of stock phrases ("attentively inventive mind," "unwavering focus and creativity") without character-particular texture. The seeker's climactic understanding arrives as assertion rather than earned through visible struggle or trade-off. Muscle memory and the parachute buckle are told as important but never dramatized in a choice that costs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who the seeker is, why they're climbing, and what "restore order" means remain vague past the 120-word mark (−0.4). The "pattern finally revealed itself" at climax is pure assertion—no on-page sequence shows what changed or what the seeker did differently. No visible cost: the arbor "celebrates," dawn arrives, burden remains "a silent companion." Drive lens appears Causal but linkage is absent; under Accumulative/Textural the piece never teaches its pattern or delivers a cadence shift that reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor supplies vivid imagery ("branches twisting like silent guardians," "leaves rustled softly") but remains postcard description—no environmental constraint shapes a tactic or alters a move. The parachute buckle "clinked softly" but its physical state or mechanics never pressure a choice. Clouds "forming shapes that mirrored the seeker's thoughts" is symbolic convenience without spatial grounding. The arbor's glow "intensifies" at triumph, a visual reward rather than a setting element that constrained or enabled the solution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("decipher the chaos and restore order") is declared early but never tested on the page—no live option is foreclosed, no tactic forced by rising cost. The "pattern finally revealed itself" bypasses protagonist agency; the seeker "pauses," "recalls," then succeeds without a visible trade-off or price. "Radio static had finally cleared" implies off-page progress. The arbor approving and celebrating deflates rather than escalates pressure. No meaningful tightening or deepening under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"The watcher's burden" and "preserve trust under pressure" are named repeatedly but never embodied in a specific dilemma or image that forces competing goods. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "testament to the power of perseverance and trust," "strength to carry the burden with grace." The parachute buckle as "symbol of resilience" is spelled out rather than earned through reweighted material. No thematic friction—the seeker succeeds without compromise, and the theme is declared rather than invited through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Generic narrative voice: "shimmered with an ethereal glow," "silent vow," "eerie silence," "newfound confidence"—stock fantasy-register diction without perceptual signature. No dialogue to test. The seeker's interiority toggles between determinations and recollections with identical syntax ("their mission was clear," "their gaze fixed," "their hands moved"). Psychic distance is stable but lacks character-particular filtering—any guardian-figure protagonist could narrate this way. Under peak pressure the prose remains tonally uniform, missing the modulation called for.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "not just a duty but a silent vow," "not just a tool…a reminder," "not just a recollection but a guide," "not just a solution but a lesson" (−0.6). Template cadence: "Every step was deliberate, every decision weighed." Filter-verb stacks in the climb paragraph flatten immediacy. Stock metaphors: "weight of responsibility," "testament to the power of perseverance." The final paragraph summarizes meaning already declared, adding no new pressure. Clarity is maintained but density is low—many lines restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Core premise (lone seeker deciphers pattern, arbor rewards triumph) follows template quest structure without transformation. The parachute buckle and muscle memory are named as important but never leverage specific, irreplaceable properties that shape tactics. "Nocturnal arbor above the clouds" supplies visual novelty but no fresh angle on the guardian-figure archetype. The ending's dawn and celebration are comfort-genre conventions executed without subversion or lived detail that would make them particular to this voice and world.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; the seeker observes, recalls, and climbs, but no on-page decision alters tactics or costs options. The character's "attentively inventive mind began to work" is asserted; the "pattern finally revealed itself" rather than being decoded through visible choice. Functional label, no causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Appears in three beats: attached to belt (intro), fingers brush it (mid), clinks as gear adjusted (climb). Each mention is descriptive or reflective—"reminder of survival," "symbol of resilience"—but the buckle's mechanics or state never constrain an action or enable a solution. Lyric reprise (intro → ending "rested quietly") reweights minimally but lacks cost linkage. Swappable with any talisman.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Named four times; described as "not just a duty but a silent vow" and "pressed heavily." Functions as thematic label without shaping an on-page tactic or forcing a trade-off between competing duties. The burden "remained" at the end, a static companion rather than a cost paid or path foreclosed. Present and coherent but ornamental to the stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Attentively inventive" appears once as a label when the seeker's mind "began to work." No on-page demonstration: the pattern reveals itself rather than being constructed through inventive trial. No visible trade-off where attentiveness costs speed or where inventiveness clashes with protocol. Mentioned, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The seeker is told to "revise their understanding" and "revise their approach when the path ahead seemed uncertain." Both uses are summary; no on-page sequence shows revision altering a prior plan or tactic. Swappable with "reconsider" or "reassess." Does not drive a turn or participate in closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Appears twice: "fingers remembering through muscle memory" (early) and "Remembering through muscle memory, they recreated the movements" (climb). Both are asserted; the text never shows which gestures or what the body recalled that differed from conscious thought. Not tied to cost or a visible action sequence. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Present throughout; described vividly ("branches twisting," "leaves rustled," "glow intensified"). The arbor responds to the seeker's success ("approving their efforts," "celebrating their triumph") but never constrains a move or supplies a resource the seeker must work around. Atmospheric backdrop, not micro-setting that alters tactics. Strong setup and closure presence, minimal causal middle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the radio static clears" anchors the opening moment. No further time pressure: the seeker climbs "higher," pauses, recalls, and succeeds without a ticking clock or deadline that narrows options. Dawn arrives at the end as reward, not as a boundary the mission raced. Present as setup, absent in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"To preserve trust under pressure" is stated as the vow and echoed at the end ("trust, once preserved, could never be broken"). No on-page beat dramatizes a friction between preserving trust and another competing want or cost. The seeker succeeds "without compromise," so the motivation never forces a trade-off. Told as important, not tested in choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Soundless echo" appears twice: as descriptor after radio static clears and in the final image ("The soundless echo of their journey lingered"). Tone is consistently ethereal and hushed—no modulation with pressure. The phrase itself is evocative but does not constrain voice or charge the closure with undeniable cost. Coherent mood, minimal functional integration.</comment>
