<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to belong is clear and sustained, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract longing rather than embodied contradiction. The "boldly sympathetic nature" remains a label without on-page cost or friction—no moment dramatizes what she sacrifices or misreads through excessive sympathy. The final belonging feels declared by Echo's pronouncement rather than earned through a visible choice that forecloses an alternative path. Interiority often summarizes emotional states ("luminescent ache," "quiet warmth") instead of showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is prompt: who, where, when land early. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens—pressure builds through the shared search, broadening community ties—but closure depends on Echo's off-page validation rather than Lira's on-page agency reweighting prior material. The final arbor moment offers a resonant image, yet the cost is conceptual and oblique; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift marks a before/after boundary. The hunt for Echo functions as a linking device but does not narrow options or force a renunciation with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered and return at closure, charging the final image. However, the setting remains largely backdrop; spatial details do not constrain Lira's search tactics or alter her choices under pressure. The arbor's shifting patterns are described but never handled or leveraged as a resource. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) opportunities—reed-sculpting gestures, tactile engagement with materials—are summarized rather than woven into action beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—grafting into community—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation occurs through the broadening search and orchard residents' gradual opening, but this is accumulative rather than a tightening that forecloses options. No on-page reversal forces Lira to trade one goal against another or pay a visible price; the resolution arrives through Echo's external pronouncement. Agency at closure is passive reception, not a decision or renunciation that narrows her path with cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—belonging as an act of weaving rather than grasping—emerges organically from Lira's search and is embodied in her reed sculptures incorporating community stories. The piece avoids overt moralizing until the final beat, where Echo's line "what you've found is yourself" edges toward thesis statement. The arbor's shifting patterns and Echo's tags function as motifs that accumulate meaning, though their final charge feels more asserted than earned through a non-literal image. Subtext operates in the tag-as-invitation and the web metaphor, but the ending explains rather than resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the attention to light, refraction, and craft detail, but diction often drifts into elevated register ("luminescent ache," "boldly sympathetic") that feels writerly rather than character-bound. Echo's dialogue—"You've been searching for me, but what you've found is yourself"—reads as thematic pronouncement rather than naturalistic speech. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she felt") cluster in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. Voice is consistent but lacks the rhythmic modulation or compression under peak pressure that would signal mastery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and free of major grammatical errors. However, template cadence appears in several stretches: "Her motivation was clear," "Her sculptures, her search, her boldly sympathetic heart—they had all been threads," and repeated "she [verb]" constructions. Stock metaphors—"web of kinship," "thread by thread," "luminescent ache"—recur without fresh inflection. The final paragraph stacks abstract summary ("they had all been threads") where a concrete image would deliver higher density. No loops or scaffolding obscure causality, but figurative density in reflective beats (metaphors in most sentences of the second and third paragraphs) flattens momentum without pattern-teaching or payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The street-artist-as-guide premise and the search-for-belonging arc follow familiar templates. Lira's craft and the crystalline setting offer specific texture, but the core emotional journey—outsider finds community through questing for a mysterious artist—does not transform the archetype through non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that shifts expectations. Echo's revelation and the final arbor moment feel predetermined rather than inevitable in hindsight. The piece commits to its premise but does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes or yield fresh insight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira is on-page throughout and her sculpting is mentioned in the opening and final beats, but her role as marsh-reed sculptor does not create key turns. The sculptures begin to incorporate community stories in summary, not through a dramatized choice with visible cost. The final sculpture adorned with Echo's tag is a passive reception, not an action she initiates. Setup present, closure cameo present, but middle development (a choice driven by her craft) is absent. Swappable with "artist" or "weaver" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The obsidian arbor appears in the opening (Lira works near it, notices the tag on its base) and returns in the final paragraph where her sculpture of it bears Echo's mark. It is described vividly but never handled or used; it functions as backdrop and symbolic anchor rather than a tool or constraint. Two-beat presence (opening and closure) with charged reprise, but no middle development where it narrows options or alters tactics. Lyric-resonance allowance applies, but lack of causal pressure or cost linkage limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Webs of kinship" is named explicitly and drives Lira's motivation, but it remains thematic rather than tactical. The story illustrates the concept through her gradual inclusion, yet no on-page scene shows kinship as a living constraint that forces a choice or trade-off. It shapes the dominant stake but does not change options in a beat. Present throughout as theme, but ornamental to the mechanics of escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" is stated once in exposition ("Lira's boldly sympathetic nature had drawn her to the orchard") and echoed in the final paragraph as a listed thread. No on-page moment dramatizes a cost or constraint arising from this trait—no scene where her sympathy drives a risky choice, misreads a signal, or forces a sacrifice. Label-only use without visible tradeoff or enabling action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Dedicate" appears explicitly when Lira decides to find Echo, and her months-long search structures the middle. However, the search itself is summarized ("weeks turned into months") rather than shown through key turns. The final belonging is granted by Echo rather than won through a dedication-driven choice with cost. One-beat signal (the decision) but swappable with "pursue" or "commit" without major edits; causal role is present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The shared search for Echo's tag motivates Lira's inquiries and bridges her to the community. It is signaled early (the tag discovery) and recurs across the middle (questioning residents, finding tags in settlements), but the mechanics remain vague—how she tracks, what resources she uses, what obstacles force adaptation are all summarized. The method shapes the arc but does not constrain a specific choice or tactic on the page. Present in setup and middle; closure participation is passive (Echo finds her).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and crater edge are vividly described in the opening and anchor the setting. The orchard's inhabitants and the arbor provide context, but the setting does not pressure choices—Lira's search extends beyond the orchard without spatial constraints affecting her tactics. The environment is postcard-present but does not function as a resource or obstacle. Setup strong, middle and closure participation weak; swappable with other artisan communities.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears once in exposition as a time-frame descriptor for the arbor's secrets. It does not tighten decisions, create a clock, or alter tactics. The story tracks "weeks turned into months" in summary, but no urgency or deadline arises from this temporal setting. Ornamental mention without causal or tactical function; easily removed.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation to graft into community is signaled early ("her motivation was clear") and sustained across all beats—questioning residents, incorporating their stories, the final recognition. It drives the dominant stake and shapes the search for Echo. However, the motivation is told more often than dramatized in conflicted choice; no on-page moment shows her weighing the cost of belonging against another want. Strong setup and closure linkage, but middle friction is summarized rather than enacted with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is named twice (opening and midpoint) and the tone of longing-suffused beauty is coherent through the piece. Modulation occurs—ache "began to soften, replaced by a quiet warmth"—but the shift is asserted in summary rather than charged through image or rhythm at closure. The final arbor moment carries some tonal weight, but the phrase itself does not recur to reweight the ending. Lyric seed and one reprise, but the final image does not maximally exploit the tone to charge closure.</comment>
