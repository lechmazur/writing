<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Zara's motivations are clear—she seeks peace and processes trauma through art—but her internal experience leans heavily on therapy-speak labels ("somatic markers" as survival mechanism, "pearl of stillness") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic slip on the cliff offers a genuine physical stakes moment, but her epiphany ("quiet strength within her") arrives through assertion rather than a dramatized micro-choice that forecloses a path. The final sketching scene shows agency, yet the weight of her decision feels predetermined rather than earned through visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (arboretum, seaside cliff, Zara's backstory). The photograph rescue on the cliff edge functions as a reversal that tightens stakes, and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Zara shifts from survivor-seeking-refuge to artist-capturing-resilience—with felt emotional cost. However, the lens wavers between Causal (photograph retrieval) and Accumulative (grief processing through art), and the cost at closure is more asserted ("weight lift from her shoulders") than shown through a concrete forfeiture or visible change in her options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliff setting provide strong sensory grounding (salt, jasmine, waves crashing) and spatial choreography is clear throughout. The cliff edge constrains Zara's photograph retrieval choice with physical danger, and the setting's legacy (lighthouse keeper's dedication) charges the final thematic realization. However, the arboretum functions more as backdrop than active constraint after the cliff scene; the bench where she sketches could exist anywhere without altering her options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retrieving the irreplaceable photograph—is signaled early and escalates to physical danger at the cliff edge, creating one meaningful tightening. The slip ("her foot slipped on a loose stone") raises cost and narrows options in the moment. However, the resolution relies on convenience (she catches herself and the photograph "just as it began to fall") without a visible tradeoff, and the transition to the sketching epiphany feels like a separate emotional arc rather than a causally linked consequence of the retrieval.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of resilience amid trauma emerges through concrete particulars (the photograph, the arboretum's legacy, Zara's art), and the final image of sketching avoids overt moralizing. The "pearl of stillness" recurs with shifting weight, moving from memory to realization to artistic capture. However, the ending paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("a testament to endurance," "anchor optimism in realism") and the thematic question—how to carry grief without being consumed—is more announced than earned through ambiguous, resonant closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited, filtering setting and memory through Zara's trauma-marked perception. Diction is mostly consistent, though occasional register drift ("somatic markers—a survival mechanism honed by years of trauma") reads clinical rather than character-particular. The narrative distance handles reflection competently, but peak moments rely on stock embodiment ("her heart slow, her muscles tense") and the final smile feels like authorial positioning rather than an earned perceptual signature shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful sensory detail and clean choreography. However, the text carries paraphrase loops ("She wasn't healed, not entirely, but she had found a way to carry her pain without being consumed by it" restates the prior paragraph's arc) and template cadence in reflection-heavy passages. The phrase "pearl of stillness" appears three times with identical framing, and the final paragraph stacks summary statements ("not as a survivor seeking refuge, but as an artist capturing the resilience") that tell rather than show the shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—trauma survivor finds solace in art and nature—follows a well-worn template without significant transformation through specific world logic or non-obvious moral calculus. The arboretum's lighthouse keeper backstory and "somatic markers" concept add texture but remain ornamental rather than driving fresh turns. The photograph retrieval offers a solid physical beat, but the arc from grief to hopeful artist proceeds predictably without risk-taking structural choices or a perspective that feels singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Zara's identity as a drone strike wedding survivor frames her grief and shapes her visit to the arboretum, but the backstory remains static exposition rather than creating key pressure points. Her trauma influences her emotional state throughout, yet no on-page choice hinges specifically on her survivor status versus generic grief; the arc would function identically if she were any bereaved character seeking peace.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The photograph appears in three distinct beats: opening (clutched, traced), cliff retrieval (snatched by wind, teeters precariously, rescued), and sketching scene (laid beside her, "immortalized in her art"). It drives the central escalation when endangered and returns with reweighted meaning at closure—no longer just a relic but a source for creative resilience. The cost of nearly losing it shapes her final stance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" appears three times as a thematic label: describing her parents' wedding photo, the realization during the cliff slip, and the artistic subject. It names the concept but does not constrain tactics or alter on-page options; Zara would make the same choices without the phrase. The integration reads as prompt echo rather than pressure device.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Zara's artistic talent is mentioned twice—"quietly talented, her artistry a secret" in paragraph two and "sketches felt hollow" immediately after—but functions only as character detail. The sketching at the end demonstrates the talent but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost; she could process her epiphany through any reflective medium without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Freeze" appears in two contexts: the paragraph describing somatic markers ("she felt her heart slow, her muscles tense") and the realization that "she could also freeze time to appreciate the stillness within the storm." The action shapes her cautious approach to the photograph and charges the thematic insight, but the freeze response itself is not the pivot—the slip and catch are. Swappable with "steady herself" or similar with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Through somatic markers" is explained in one paragraph ("a survival mechanism honed by years of trauma") during the cliff approach and briefly reprised in the resolution. The mechanism is told rather than shown shaping her tactics; we see her move cautiously, but the label adds no specific constraint or method that another fear response would not provide.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The arboretum is established early with vivid detail (lush greenery, winding paths, jasmine scent) and the cliff provides the key physical constraint for the photograph retrieval scene. The lighthouse keeper's legacy primes the thematic closure. However, after the cliff beat, the setting becomes a neutral stage for reflection; the bench could exist in any tranquil location without altering Zara's final choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper" is mentioned once as backstory context ("maintained by the last lighthouse keeper, a man who had tended the grounds until his dying breath") and reprised thematically near the end ("why the last lighthouse keeper had dedicated his life to this place"). It establishes the arboretum's legacy but does not create temporal pressure or constrain Zara's present-tense decisions; the timeframe is setting flavor, not a ticking clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to anchor optimism in realism" appears explicitly late ("a refuge for those seeking to anchor optimism in realism") and shapes the thematic resolution when Zara finds "a way to carry her pain without being consumed." However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted on-page choices; we do not see her wrestle with competing wants or costs tied to this specific framing of hope versus despair.</comment>
