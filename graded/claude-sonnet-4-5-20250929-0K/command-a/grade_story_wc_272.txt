<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her interior arc tracks through metaphor-laden reflection, but her transformation relies heavily on telling rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The grandmother's wisdom is invoked as external validation rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Emotional progression leans on therapy-speak constructions ("luminescent ache," "necessary darkness") that abstract rather than embody. The final ascent reads as resolved insight without visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph; the lighthouse library setting is stable. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Elara gathers cards, reinterprets symbols, and ascends with renewed purpose. However, closure lacks on-page cost—she smiles, feels possibility, and climbs with hands steady, but no live option is foreclosed and no felt price is paid in the final image. The transformation is declared ("her art...would never be the same") rather than demonstrated through a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library and lighthouse are vividly anchored with sensory detail (aged paper, salt air, groaning walls, roaring sea) and mood. The tarot cards function as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charged in the final assembly. Spatial choreography is clear from library floor to spiral staircase to lantern room. The environment does not constrain a key choice—Elara's gathering and reordering happen without external friction—but the recurring card imagery and ascent structure the final reconfiguration, elevating the score to mid-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara seeks to reclaim creativity by confronting despair. Pressure accumulates through card-gathering and reinterpretation, a single meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Yet no live option is foreclosed and no visible trade-off occurs—she simply decides darkness is "where the light begins" and ascends with steady hands. The ache shifts from burden to guide through assertion, not dramatized cost. One tightening is present but the price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through darkness emerges from the card motifs and lighthouse setting, but the final paragraph moralizes directly: "Maybe the darkness isn't something to escape...Maybe it's where the light begins." The Tower card is labeled as "renewal" rather than showing its cost. The grandmother's wisdom ("Art is not about perfection; it's about truth, even when it hurts") reads as thematic echo rather than dramatized truth. The ending offers a tidy epiphany with no resonant ambiguity or non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Elara's interiority dominates. Diction favors elevated metaphor ("luminescent," "spectral presence," "tapestry") that occasionally drifts from immediate embodiment but remains consistent as lyric voice. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during card-handling and reflection. The rhetorical questions feel purposeful rather than filter clutter. However, register remains uniformly poetic without modulation under peak pressure, and some constructions ("the ache remained, but it was no longer a burden") lean toward summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice effectively. However, pervasive figurative density ("luminescent ache," "threads of despair," "tapestry," "portal to stories") without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers −0.5. Paraphrase loops appear: "Maybe the darkness isn't something to escape...Maybe it's where the light begins" restates the concept twice in adjacent lines; "no longer a burden—it was her guide, her muse, her truth" stacks synonyms without added pressure. Template cadence in the penultimate paragraph ("its shelves whispering encouragement...her hands steady, her heart alight") applies −0.4. Total −0.9 from high-6 baseline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The artist-in-crisis-finds-renewal arc and lighthouse-as-beacon metaphor are familiar; specificity of tarot cards and library setting provide texture but the transformation path (despair → card reordering → epiphany → ascent) follows a well-worn template. The rhetorical questions and light/dark dichotomy lean on stock philosophizing. The Tower card's shift from destruction to renewal is asserted, not earned through an unexpected synthesis. Derivative premise and middle-ground choices without bold risk keep this in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her actions (gathering cards, tracing edges, sorting, ascending) drive the sequence. However, her choices are reflective and arranging rather than creating key turns with cost. She decides to "redesign her approach" and "no longer needing the broken box," but these shifts are told rather than tested. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal pressure is mild and swappability is moderate (another artist role would function similarly).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken tarot box appears early, is handled when Elara gathers scattered cards, and returns in the ending as "a relic of who she had been." It frames her transformation and its brokenness symbolizes fragmentation. However, the box itself does not constrain a choice—the cards do the work—and the ending mentions it only as abandoned scaffolding. Setup, middle touch, ending reprise with thematic reweighting but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fragmented reality" is signaled early (cards as "shards of a shattered mirror," "fragmented reality she couldn't reassemble") and shapes Elara's tactic of rearranging disorder to reveal new order. It is named and thematized consistently. However, it functions more as metaphor than as a stake that alters tactics under pressure. The concept charges the ending image (disorder woven into wholeness) but does not create a visible cost or choice point.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara asks two rhetorical questions on the page: "What happens when the light you seek is the very thing that blinds you?" and "Is destruction the only path to creation?" Both frame her interior debate but do not constrain action or create trade-offs. The attribute is present and thematic but does not enable or prevent a key turn. Label-level integration without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Redesign" appears as stated intent ("began to redesign her approach") and manifests in card-rearranging and perspective shift. It drives the middle gathering sequence and connects to the ending ("redesigned reality"). However, the action is primarily cognitive and metaphorical—she sorts cards by symbols and colors—without a specific, irreplaceable mechanic that another verb (rethink, reinterpret) couldn't approximate. Setup, middle, ending participation, but moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is named twice: "untangling the threads of her own despair" and "she was untangling them...to weave something new." It describes her method of sorting and reordering cards. However, the mechanics are vague—she sorts by symbols, colors, stories—without showing how threads are literally or tactically untangled. The method charges thematic resonance but does not shape a middle choice with cost. Setup and thematic payoff but weak development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a lighthouse is anchored early, provides spatial structure (floor to staircase to lantern room), and the setting's isolation and decay mirror Elara's state. The library shelves supply the cards and space for her work; the lighthouse's groaning walls and roaring sea externalize pressure. The ascent to the lantern room crystallizes transformation. The setting constrains movement and supplies resources, participating in all three gates and charging the final image with moderate causal force.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" appears once in the first paragraph as immediate sensation: "the walls seemed to close in around her." It establishes the oppressive timeframe. However, time does not tighten—Elara's card-sorting is described as "slow, painful," and later "time felt fluid." The walls later "seemed to recede" without causal shift. The timeframe is mentioned but does not create urgency or alter tactics. Setup present, weak development, no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To descend into necessary darkness" is stated directly: "she needed to descend into the necessary darkness, to confront the shadows." It motivates her gathering and reinterpretation of cards. The motivation is told and repeated thematically ("Maybe the darkness isn't something to escape") but not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. She pursues it without friction. Setup, middle drive, ending resolution, but the desire is asserted rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" recurs across the story: "luminescent...faint glow in the ache of her heart," "luminescent pulse, guiding her," "luminescent ache that no longer felt like pain but like possibility," and "The ache remained...it was her guide, her muse, her truth." The tone is coherent and modulates from burden to guide, charging the ending. However, the phrase is repeated rather than varied, and its abstraction (what does "luminescent" ache feel like?) limits embodied resonance. Purposeful early–final reprise with thematic reweighting but static repetition.</comment>
