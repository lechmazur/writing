<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness is stated but never constrains a live choice—she simply "focuses on intent" without dramatized cost. The methodical trait appears as label rather than embodied tradeoff. The figure encounter generates no micro-choice that tests her stated motivation; she kneels and sketches without internal friction. The final "shift" and "lighter heart" are asserted emotional payoffs unearned by prior struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens (mist, ribbon fragments, the portrait as closure image), but the final reconfiguration lacks undeniable cost: Elara leaves "lighter" after sketching, with no path visibly foreclosed or tactic altered. The ribbon fragments "seem to merge" and "intertwine" through assertion rather than causal pressure. Cost is gestured at ("far from solved") but not felt in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quarry's mist and jagged edges are vividly rendered and purposefully atmospheric. However, the environment remains postcard-like: no physical constraint (gravel, cold, sight-lines) alters Elara's tactics or the mysterious figure's approach. The lancing tool is mentioned but never used to test spatial pressure. The final dawn-lit path is symbolic flourish rather than micro-setting that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving Lila's disappearance and awakening empathy—is signaled early but never tightened by an on-page choice that forecloses an option. The figure's appearance could generate escalation but Elara simply watches it vanish; no trade-off or cost follows. The portrait act is contemplative mood rather than a move under pressure. Closure declares "a way to see beyond the void" without dramatizing what was risked or lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The unifying-opposites theme (chaos/order, absence/presence) is repeatedly stated rather than earned through scene pressure. "Empathy could be awakened" and "bridging gaps" remain abstract motifs; the portrait does not embody a non-obvious synthesis. The quarry-as-chasm metaphor is declared outright ("now she realized the quarry itself was a metaphor"), violating the no-sermonizing standard. The ending whispers Lila's name and asserts thematic victory without letting image alone do the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person close maintains stable distance and the diction fits Elara's artistic perspective. However, peak-stress moments default to elevated register ("jagged edges softened by the mist, its darkness pierced by a single beam") that reads more like art-catalogue prose than urgent interiority. Filter verbs ("seemed to echo," "seemed to merge") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice-motivated purpose. Perceptual signature is consistent but lacks character-specific bias beyond generic artist observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically varied. Multiple instances of paraphrase loops and template cadence weaken momentum: "The ribbon, now crumpled… felt like a fragile thread" adjacent to "traced the ribbon's frayed edge, imagining the hands"; "Her methodical mind raced" echoes "Her methodical nature had led her"; "furrowed concentration" recurs as "furrowed" motif. Stock metaphor ("ghostly shroud," "clockwork mechanism," "fragile thread") appears in three of the first four sentences, reducing specificity. The closure paragraph stacks figurative language without fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist is a fresh premise, but the story executes it as convenient label rather than constraint-driven plot engine. The cold-case + empathy-through-art combination leans on familiar "artist solves mystery" and "art heals" templates without a non-obvious moral calculus. The mysterious figure, vanishing evidence, and ribbon fragments gesture toward noir tropes but deliver no earned surprise. The unifying-opposites method is announced rather than demonstrated through tactical choices that risk failure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Face blindness is seeded early and mentioned when the figure appears ("Her face blindness became a shield"), but it never constrains a choice or generates cost. Elara's decisions (stepping back, gripping the tool, sketching) would play identically for a sighted artist. The trait is ornamental framing rather than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment appears in three beats: opening (crumpled in hand), mid-scene (tracing its edge), and closure (merging with the second fragment). It seeds expectation and returns with symbolic weight, but its "intertwining" is metaphorical assertion rather than a physical or tactical constraint. Scores mid-band for spaced presence and thematic reprise, but lacks irreplaceability or cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Cold cases frame the backstory and motivate Elara's presence at the quarry. The concept does not shape on-page tactics—no investigative choice tests her methodology, and the case remains "far from solved" at closure without altering her approach. Functional setup, but replaceable with any unsolved mystery.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Very methodical" is declared twice ("Her methodical nature," "Her methodical mind") but never demonstrated through a visible tradeoff. Her actions (deliberate steps, sketching) could equally represent calm focus. No cost or constraint tied to methodicalness appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The lancing tool is mentioned as "weapon, both literal and metaphorical" and Elara grips it when threatened, but she never uses it or faces a choice where its presence matters. It could be any carried object. Introduced mid-scene, no closure participation, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Unifying opposites" is seeded early ("chaos and order, absence and presence") and invoked at closure ("a unification of opposites"). The method does not shape Elara's process on the page—her portrait emerges without visible attempt, failure, or technique that depends on opposition. Thematic framing without mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The shadowed quarry in mist is established immediately and sustained throughout. It provides atmosphere and spatial staging (gravel crunch, mist parting) and charges the final image (dawn light, retreating shadows). However, the environment does not constrain a tactic or force a trade-off; Elara moves freely. Strong closure participation lifts the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"After the evidence disappears" motivates Elara's visit but does not create time pressure on the page. No clock tightens her decisions; the encounter and sketch unfold without urgency or deadline. Functional setup, minimal development, absent from closure decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To awaken dormant empathy" is stated early and returns at closure ("the dormant empathy she sought had begun to stir"). The motivation frames her goals but is not tested by friction—she never confronts a choice where empathy competes with self-protection or investigative rigor. Told desire without on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" is coined early ("The quarry's hush seemed to echo her own furrowed concentration") and sustained through quiet, tense description. Tone modulates subtly (quickened heart, steady voice, lighter heart at close) and the final whisper into hush charges the motif. Coherent and purposeful, though static across the middle beats.</comment>
