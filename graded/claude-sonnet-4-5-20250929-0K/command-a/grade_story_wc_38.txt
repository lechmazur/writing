<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is presented through abstract labels ("lyrical code breaker," "calm defiance") rather than embodied choices under pressure. Her interior life remains opaque; we see choreographed movements but no contradictory impulses or stakes-driven decisions that foreclose options with visible cost. The dice and journal function as props she manipulates, not constraints that force her into dilemmas. Her triumph is declared ("surge of triumph") rather than earned through a choice that reveals her hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past the first third: who Elara is, what specific knowledge she seeks, and why liberation matters remain vague. The "dance unlocks passages" beat reads as convenient rather than causal—no prior setup explains why dance decodes the journal or what cost she pays to perform it. The ending offers a declaration of mission completion ("would rise again") without an on-page decisive change or visible sacrifice; the closure is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is rendered through atmospheric generalities ("shadows danced," "moss-covered surfaces," "scent of decay") without spatial grounding or object-level specificity that constrains choice. The glowing journal and shifting walls provide set-dressing but do not limit Elara's options or force tactical adjustments. Micro-setting detail (water dripping, humming chamber) does not tie to her decisions or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("liberate knowledge") is abstract and never tested on the page by a choice that costs Elara something tangible. Pressure does not escalate through because/therefore linkage; the dance simply succeeds without complication. No reversal narrows her options, and the final "passages now open" is a convenience gain rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path or forces a stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Encrypt vulnerability as strength" is stated as motivation and echoed in narration ("transform the fragile into the unbreakable") but never tested through a particular on-page choice that reveals cost or ambiguity. The theme is told rather than discovered through events. The spider/web metaphor and "dance as translation" motifs are decorative; they do not reweight prior material or offer a non-literal answer to a central question at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains stable distance and a consistent elevated register, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—diction and imagery (e.g., "breadcrumbs in a forest," "beacon in the darkness") read as generic rather than filtered through Elara's specific expertise or worldview. No dialogue appears. Elara's interior access is shallow; we are told her feelings ("trembling," "surge of triumph") rather than shown contradictory thought under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "to liberate the knowledge buried here, to free it from the clutches of obscurity" and "She was not here to mourn the past but to resurrect it, to breathe life into the echoes" are synonym pairs without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("breadcrumbs in a forest," "beacon in the darkness," "as a spider spins its web") appear in multiple sentences without fresh specificity. Template cadence runs: "Her fingers brushed… She carried… She worked… She moved…" across adjacent paragraphs. The closure paragraph stacks abstraction ("symbol of loss," "secrets liberated," "wisdom shared") instead of concrete image, dulling the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise (code breaker in sunken lab unlocks secrets via dance) gestures at novelty but executes through familiar beats: mysterious artifact, glowing journal, convenient unlocking mechanism. The "hangman's dice" and "explains through dance" elements feel ornamental rather than transformed into story-specific constraints. Emotional and thematic territory (resilience, turning vulnerability into strength) is rendered in abstract, interchangeable language. The spider/web timeframe appears only as simile in the final line without structural integration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no key decisions that narrow options or alter tactics. She moves, observes, opens a journal, dances; the narrative declares her success without showing a choice under pressure. Label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dice appear twice: once as carried object (paragraph 1) and again during the dance (paragraph 5), where they "seemed to pulse" but do not constrain or enable a specific action. Swappable with any symbolic object; no visible cost or causal pressure tied to their use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Calm defiance" is stated in narration ("her calm defiance had become a force") but never dramatized through a choice where serenity costs her or enables a tactic. Theme-only presence; does not shape stakes or options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Explains through dance" appears once in the middle when Elara interprets the journal's movements (paragraph 4–5). The dance unlocks passages but no cost or constraint is shown—she simply succeeds. Functional but late (second third) and swappable with any decoding method.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"Liberate" is the stated mission and closure declaration ("secrets liberated"). The action itself is abstract and uncontested; no on-page obstacle requires her to choose what to free or pay a price. Summary-only integration at the end.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Coded journal entries are mentioned as her method (paragraph 2) and reappear as "her map" (final paragraph). The journals describe rather than constrain; their mechanics do not shape a middle choice or force a tactical adjustment. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory frames the setting throughout and its passages shift at the climax, but the environment does not pressure a choice—Elara moves freely without resource limits or spatial constraint altering her options. Atmospheric presence without tactical integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The spider/web timeframe appears only as a simile in the opening and final paragraph ("As the spider completes its web, so too would Elara complete her mission"). No temporal constraint or progression on the page; vague metaphor without clock pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"To encrypt vulnerability as strength" is stated as motivation (paragraph 2) and echoed thematically but never forces a conflicted choice. Told-only; no on-page moment where Elara's vulnerability creates friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is evoked through the dice's "whispered secrets" and the journal's "movements" but the tone remains static—elevated and atmospheric throughout without modulation under pressure. Does not charge the final image with cost or recognition.</comment>
