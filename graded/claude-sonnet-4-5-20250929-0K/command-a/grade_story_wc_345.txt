<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but never tested by contradiction or cost; she orchestrates from a distance without friction or sacrifice. Kael and his allies remain undifferentiated stock helpers—botanist, sculptor, musician—whose micro-choices are entirely cooperative. The closing glow-and-fade bypasses any renunciation or visible price; Elara "completes her task" without forgoing anything on the page, leaving agency ornamental.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with heavy atmospheric description that delays anchoring who acts and when; Kael's entry arrives well past the first third. The plot moves through declarative summary—"they ventured," "they worked to clear"—without dramatized reversals or tightening choices. Closure is a convenience cascade: the bell rings, nebula returns, butterflies emerge, everyone gathers; no prior constraint is tested, no path foreclosed. No visible cost or renunciation lands on the page; the ending asserts miracle and unity without dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet, floating arches, and butterfly garden are richly described but function as painted backdrop. The watering bell is handled once at the climax; no earlier constraint from environment or tool shapes a tactic. Spatial choreography during the garden work remains vague—"footsteps crunching" and "shadows" without tactical use or proximity pressure. Sensory detail is present but ornamental, not filtered through urgency or character priority.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore the nebula—is declared early but never tightens or forces a trade-off. Kael gathers allies without friction; the clapper is remembered and shaped without cost or setback. No reversal narrows options; the bell simply rings and the nebula conveniently returns. Agency is collective assembly, not a choice under competing pressure, and the resolution grants symmetric satisfaction without visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" and "strangers become family" are asserted in frame language but not built from concrete choice-pressure. The butterflies and nebula return as symbolic reward without thematic friction or ambiguity. The final image—Elara glowing then fading—gestures toward sacrifice but is told, not felt, and the group's unity is declared rather than earned through conflicting values. No resonant question lingers; the ending summarizes the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single third-person distant POV holds stable with no head-hopping, but voice remains generic high-fantasy register without character-specific perceptual signature. Elara "glided," hope "brambling," the nebula "cascading like a waterfall of stars"—elevated diction throughout flattens urgency. No dialogue appears. The prose serves atmospheric catalog more than interiority or pressure, and the closing paragraph's "their hope no longer brambled but blooming" lapses into thematic echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Opening paragraph front-loads metaphor—"brambled hope," "fragile blossom," "ancient guardians"—without teaching a pattern or paying off at closure. Paraphrase loops: "her motivation was clear" followed by a colon restating the motivation; "the butterfly garden was a forgotten sanctuary, overgrown...its center stood the bell...had not rung in decades" chains exposition without propulsion. Template cadence in the gathering sequence: "Mira discovered...Jorin remembered...Lira's songs seemed." Synonym churn: "glided," "shimmering," "pulsing," "resonant," "iridescent" stack without clear stakes. The final paragraph's "strangers who had become family stood united, their hope no longer brambled but blooming" is a thematic echo that summarizes rather than charges. Artifacts touch closure, triggering the Q7 disallow-9+ global cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—ghost orchestrates collective quest to restore celestial phenomenon—follows familiar template without fresh moral calculus or constraint. The floating arches and chalk-message mechanic are vivid but ornamental; no lived detail or specific cost transforms the frame. The bell's repair and the nebula's return proceed without surprise or hindrance, and the ending's "miracle" language signals reliance on stock wonder rather than earned particularity. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the familiar arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara appears in opening and closing frames, chalks one message, and watches from offstage. She makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path; her "task complete" fade is asserted, not dramatized with cost. Missing middle development and closure agency; ornamental presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bell is described in paragraph three, its clapper noted as lost. Jorin shapes a replacement and Kael strikes it at the climax, triggering the nebula's return. Two-beat involvement (setup, climax use) with causal link to resolution, but the mechanics of restoration are told in summary and the bell does not constrain an earlier choice. No visible cost tied to the object itself; it enables the miracle without friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The nebula is named in paragraph one as a faded memory and returns in the climax as cascading light. It frames the dominant stake but does not shape on-page tactics or choices—characters work to restore it without the nebula's absence creating a mid-scene constraint. Present at setup and payoff, absent in middle development; functions as goal-object rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is declared in paragraph two but never tested or constrained. Elara's messages are accepted without skepticism; no scene shows her earning trust through a trade-off or visible cost. Label-only attribute with no on-page friction or enabling choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears once when Kael recalls his grandmother's stories, priming his quest motivation. The action does not recur or constrain a later choice; easily replaceable with "remember" or "consider." Functional setup but lacks middle or closure participation; minimal causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Chalk messages are described in paragraph two and one message is quoted. The mechanic appears only at setup; no second message or mid-scene complication tests the method. Elara communicates this way once, then vanishes from the narrative until the close. Ornamental detail without development or payoff beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Orchard planet and floating arches frame the opening and cast "long shadows" during the garden work. The arches echo the bell's sound at climax but do not constrain movement or supply a resource that alters tactics. Vivid postcard setting present at setup and closure mention, but lacking middle pressure or micro-constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"After strangers become family" is stated in Kael's paragraph but remains abstract past-tense context. No on-page moment dramatizes the transition or uses the established bond to force a present choice. Timeframe label without tactical or closure integration; purely background exposition.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "orchestrate collective effort" is declared in paragraph one and realized when Kael gathers allies. The motivation drives the setup and is fulfilled at closure, but no friction or competing want tests it; everyone cooperates without cost. Present in setup and implicit payoff, but one-note execution without visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs as a metaphor for tangled-then-blooming potential. Tone remains uniformly lyric and elevated throughout, without modulation under pressure or a cadence shift that charges the final image. Static mood with bookend repetition; the return does not reweight prior material with new cost.</comment>
