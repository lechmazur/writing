<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her determination is embodied through movement ("sharp yet deliberate"), but interiority trends abstract with therapy-adjacent phrasing ("strange kind of closure," "heavy yet strangely at peace"). The memory sequence shows embodied contradiction—burying a memory then standing in it—but the final renunciation feels asserted rather than dramatized through visible cost on the page. Internal voice remains consistent but leans toward elevated diction that doesn't always feel character-particular under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (terrace), and when (after butterfly effect) within the opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the terrace shifts, memory surfaces, the code appears, and understanding accrues without causal linkage. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara leaves the logbook and gains "quiet clarity"), but the cost—what she forecloses by leaving the book—remains abstract and not visibly priced on the page, weakening the closure band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (glass groaning, colors washing over her, fractured hush) and modulates with the scene's pressure. Spatial choreography is clear and the terrace constrains her movement physically. However, the terrace does not force a choice or charge the final image decisively; she leaves the logbook on it, but the setting remains backdrop rather than crucible at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through the prism's shift and the memory surfacing, but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a visible trade-off. The resolution (leaving the logbook) is renunciation, but the cost of what she forecloses by walking away is asserted rather than felt or seen in lost opportunity or consequence on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the thresholds/distances motif and the memory of her father's words. The ending offers a resonant answer—"sacred thresholds weren't about the places they led to, but about the parts of ourselves we left behind"—without overt moralizing. However, the final lines tilt toward summary ("she knew she had found what she was searching for") rather than image, and the father's insight arrives too neatly without friction or counter-pull.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent focalization. Diction is elevated and lyric ("featherly determined," "fractured hush"), establishing a distinct texture. However, register drifts into abstraction under pressure ("strange kind of closure," "quiet clarity") rather than remaining character-particular. Free indirect style is clean, and the voice modulates with the terrace's shifting atmosphere, but peaks lack rhythmic tightening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean with varied syntax and clear action sequencing. Information density is uneven: early sentences do multiple jobs ("She was the corn maze architect's lost child, though she had long since stopped searching for him"), but the ending paragraph loops conceptually ("sacred thresholds," "distances," "closure") without advancing image or pressure. Paraphrase appears in the final two paragraphs ("understood now" / "found what she was searching for"), dulling propulsion. Figurative language is heavy throughout ("featherly," "fractured hush," "butterfly effect") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density and coherence concerns in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The combination of prism terrace, weather codes, and corn maze architect has surface novelty, but the emotional arc—searching daughter finds abstract peace—follows a familiar template. The thresholds-as-leaving insight is earned in hindsight but not transformed through lived complication; swapping the terrace for another liminal space would not fundamentally alter the arc. The lyric frame and accumulative design show craft, but the ending retreats to safe abstraction rather than bold specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is the corn maze architect's lost child, identified early and present throughout. She pursues the question about thresholds and makes the final choice to leave the logbook. However, her choices do not create reversals; the terrace shifts on its own, the memory surfaces unbidden, and the code "she hadn't noticed before" appears without her agency driving discovery. The character is essential to the premise but does not drive key turns through decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pilot logbook appears early (setup), is opened and traced mid-scene (development), and is left on the terrace at closure (payoff). It is handled across three beats and its final relinquishment carries symbolic weight. However, the "weather codes" themselves are never decoded on the page; Elara intuits they "weren't just about the weather" but the specifics remain abstract, making the object's mechanics replaceable. The logbook matters as her father's relic, but the weather-code detail is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is named explicitly and woven through the middle: "codes weren't just about the weather; they were about necessary distances—between people, between moments, between lives." It shapes Elara's understanding and recurs in the ending reflection. However, it operates as theme rather than constraint; it does not narrow tactical options or force a visible trade-off on the page. The concept articulates meaning but does not alter action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears twice as descriptor ("featherly determined woman," "featherly, light yet unyielding"). It establishes tone but never constrains or enables a visible choice with cost. The trait is label-only and could be replaced with "quiet resolve" or similar without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Intuit" is named explicitly: "She closed her eyes, letting the prism's colors wash over her, and began to intuit." It is the method by which Elara processes the codes, and the realization about distances follows. However, the mechanics are vague—she feels rather than decodes—and the action could be swapped for "meditate," "reflect," or "sense" with minor edits. It shapes one key turn (the understanding) but is not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Analyzing the grain in wooden furniture" is mentioned in backstory ("She had spent years analyzing the grain in wooden furniture, searching for patterns, for clues") but never appears in present action. It is told-only, past-only, and does not shape on-page choices or the ending. The method is ornamental, setting up her pattern-seeking tendency but not enacted.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace anchors the setting early and is present throughout. The terrace shifts and "rearranges itself" mid-scene, pulling Elara into memory; it is the site where closure occurs. However, it does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter tactics; Elara's actions (opening the logbook, closing her eyes, leaving it) would read the same in any liminal space. The setting charges atmosphere but does not pressure the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" is named in the opening as timeframe context but never tightens decisions or alters tactics. The phrase is decorative backstory; the butterfly effect itself is not dramatized or causally connected to the present-scene stakes. Time is vague (no clock, no deadline) and does not constrain Elara's choices. The timeframe is present but inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to discover why some thresholds feel sacred"—is signaled early and pursued across beats. She opens the logbook, intuits, and arrives at understanding. The motivation is tested through memory and embodied choice (leaving the logbook), but the final understanding is asserted in reflection rather than forced through visible cost or friction. The desire is dramatized but the stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is named repeatedly ("fractured hush," "the fractured hush around her deepened," "the fractured hush gave way to a quiet clarity") and establishes atmospheric coherence. It modulates slightly (deepens, gives way) with scene pressure and charges the final shift to "quiet clarity." However, the tone is static across most beats, and the shift at the end is told rather than embodied in rhythm or image. The tone is purposeful but does not decisively elevate the closure.</comment>
