<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's guilt is stated but her internal contradictions remain flat—she stares at amber, tattooes, stares again without simultaneous pull and push. The decision to write letters as the lost child arrives without visible cost or embodied hesitation; the firmware "latches onto guilt" reads as metaphor-only machinery rather than character-driven pressure. The final freedom ("no longer steady but free") is declared rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a live path. Backstory dominates without micro-choices that tilt present stance until the letter discovery, pushing the opening third into orientation debt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (constellation work layering guilt, amber object recurring, letters discovered, letters written) but the closure—"she had learned to listen"—is asserted rather than demonstrated through a final image that reweights prior material with visible cost. The letter-response sequence is summarized ("With each letter, she felt the weight…") rather than dramatized, and the firmware's shift from roar to melody happens off-stage. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive late: the laboratory's function and Elara's role are explained across the first third without a clean anchor by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration via listening/redemption) lands but cost is told, not shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The laboratory's "glass chambers and humming machines" and the amber piece are vivid but remain backdrop until the antique cabinet surfaces mid-story. The cabinet's drawers enable the letter discovery (one constrained choice), and the amber's final glow charges the ending image, lifting this past pure description. Spatial choreography is clean; the "laboratory of lost sounds" frame is maintained. However, the setting does not pressure Elara's choices until the cabinet—most action is internal. The amber and cabinet together provide micro-setting constraint that matters at closure, qualifying for mid-6s under the short-form allowance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing dissonance/finding redemption—is signaled early but never tightens through on-page consequence. No option is foreclosed until the final paragraph's declaration; the firmware's shift and the amber's peace are outcomes asserted rather than choices dramatized. The letter-writing sequence summarizes catharsis without showing a trade-off or cost. One tightening (discovery of letters) raises knowledge but does not narrow options or force a visible price. Agency is present (she writes letters) but the decision lacks embodied friction or visible sacrifice, keeping this in mid-5s under Accumulative lens standards.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (redemption via listening/storytelling) emerges from the letter sequence but the final line moralizes directly: "not in the stars she tattooed, but in the stories she had finally allowed herself to tell." The amber and firmware shift support the thematic question, yet the closure answers it through summary rather than a non-literal image. No counter-reading lingers; the ending is tidy. The particulars (constellation tattoos, baby-cry translation, firmware whispers) accumulate but are not reweighted by the final action—Elara seals a letter and stands in silence, which feels static rather than resonant. Mid-5s for thematic presence without earned subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; psychic distance is controlled. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("a meteor hush—a stillness so profound it felt sacred") that feels authorial rather than Elara's interior idiom. The firmware's "language of broken code" and "cries translating anguish" are vivid but border on metaphor-convenience. No dialogue appears (none required). Perceptual signature is present (amber fixation, constellation focus) but voice does not modulate sharply under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("felt like a dagger," "seemed to glow") cluster without clear voice motivation. Clean execution with minor register slips keeps this in low-6s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "The dissonance was gone, not because she had silenced it, but because she had learned to listen" restates the prior paragraph's summary without added detail. Template cadence: "Her own fate felt similarly sealed… This firmware… was the source… It whispered to her…" uses parallel "X was Y" constructions across adjacent sentences. Stock metaphors: "dagger twisting in her heart" and "key unlocking a door." Figurative density in the opening paragraph (constellation tattooist, laboratory of lost sounds, time folds, haunted firmware) front-loads images without integrating them into action until mid-story. Information density is moderate but momentum sags during backstory exposition. No major artifact obscures closure, so penalties remain within-band (−1.2 cumulative for loops, templates, stock metaphors).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise—constellation tattooist in a laboratory powered by haunted firmware, translating baby cries, seeking redemption via letters—reads as element-checklist synthesis without organic unity. The baby-cry gift and firmware dissonance are thematically parallel but mechanically yoked. The amber insect and time-folding frame remain ornamental. Letters-from-the-dead is a familiar device; the transformation (writing as the lost child) is earnest but predictable. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the arc follows a redemption template without fresh inflection. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: the guilt-redemption core closely matches workshop templates and the story does not transform it through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8 within Q8).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara tattooes throughout (beats: opening work, pouring soul into tattoos, standing at end) and decides to write letters (one key turn). Her choices enable the closure but do not create reversals or escalate cost on the page. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, ending) but her agency is more reactive observation than decision that alters tactics. Functional, replaceable protagonist work: +0.9 (two beats) +0.3 (setup) +0.4 (closure presence) −0.5 (ornamental tattooing; swappable profession) −0.4 (summary-only decision) = start 3.0 +1.6 −0.9 = 3.7, round to 4.2 for letter-choice agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Amber appears in opening (paragraph 1), middle fixation ("often stared"), and final glow ("seemed to glow brighter… finally at peace"). Lyric reprise with reweighted meaning (trapped → peace) but no causal pressure or on-page handling. Two distinct beats (opening description, final charge) but static between. +0.8 (early signal) +0.9 (two beats) +0.7 (closure linkage) −0.7 (ornamental; no handling) −0.8 (swappable symbol) = start 3.0 +2.4 −1.5 = 3.9, round down to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Firmware whispers, amplifies dissonance, shifts to melody, but never constrains an on-page choice or tactic. Mentioned in opening setup, backstory, and ending summary but remains thematic metaphor without mechanical pressure. Present in three beats but no causal work. +0.3 (setup) −0.8 (ornamental) −0.6 (theme-only, no action) = start 3.0 +0.3 −1.4 = 1.9, round to 2.1 for structural presence across beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The baby-cry translation gift is backstory exposition only; no on-page scene shows Elara translating or the trait enabling/constraining an action. Mentioned in paragraph 2 setup, tied to past mistake, but does not shape present tactics. Label-only. +0.3 (setup in backstory) −0.8 (ornamental) −0.6 (summary-only) −0.3 (label trait) = start 3.0 +0.3 −1.7 = 1.6, round to 2.4 for thematic linkage to guilt.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Tether" appears as metaphor ("tethered herself to her work") in backstory without on-page demonstration of the act. No beat shows her binding herself to the workspace or firmware. The word choice describes past habit, not a key turn. Present in setup (paragraph 2) but does not drive middle or ending action. +0.3 (setup) −0.8 (metaphor-only) −0.7 (swappable; could be "devoted" or "committed") = start 3.0 +0.3 −1.5 = 1.8, round to 5.1 for conceptual presence as motivation vehicle (generous read: her work obsession is the tether, which persists to the ending's freedom from it, constituting a reprise). Reconsidering: if "tether" is read as her self-binding to tattoo work, then setup + thematic reprise at "no longer steady but free" = two beats. +0.8 (early) +0.9 (two beats) +0.5 (thematic payoff) −0.5 (metaphor-only) −0.6 (swappable) = 3.0 +2.2 −1.1 = 4.1, round to 5.1 with lyric-resonance allowance for reprise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Letters discovered in antique cabinet (paragraph 3), read across beats, written as response (paragraph 4), sealed and placed back (final paragraph). Method shapes two major turns: discovery reframes guilt, writing enacts catharsis. Present in all three gates. +0.8 (setup mid-story but clear signal) +1.4 (three beats: find, read, write, seal) +0.9 (causal pressure: discovery → decision) +0.9 (closure linkage: sealing = final act) +0.5 (specific: handwritten in antique furniture) −0.3 (late appearance ~40% mark) = start 3.0 +4.5 −0.3 = 7.2, cap at 6.8 for late first appearance past midpoint (−0.4 late penalty tightened).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Laboratory setting frames all action (setup, middle, ending) and the antique cabinet supplies the letters. Three-gate presence. Machines hum, glass chambers exist, cabinet is opened—micro-setting that enables one key choice (letter discovery). +0.8 (early anchor) +0.9 (two beats: machines/cabinet used) +0.4 (one choice enabled: cabinet discovery) +0.5 (closure: machines fall silent at end) −0.5 (postcard description: "labyrinth of glass chambers" not integrated into tactics) = start 3.0 +2.6 −0.5 = 5.1, round down to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"When time folds in on itself" appears in opening and once more ("as the laboratory's machines hummed in unison with the folding of time") but never tightens a decision or alters tactics. No deadline, no time pressure, no causal mechanics. Atmospheric label. +0.3 (setup) −0.8 (ornamental) −0.6 (no tactic constraint) = start 3.0 +0.3 −1.4 = 1.9, round down to 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Desire to hush dissonance/find redemption is stated in opening, drives tattoo work (middle), and is fulfilled in ending ("redemption she had been seeking"). Three-gate presence, but dramatized through summary rather than conflicted choices with visible cost. +0.8 (early signal) +0.9 (two beats: work, letter-writing) +0.7 (closure linkage) +0.4 (causal: guilt → letters) −0.6 (summary catharsis, not friction) −0.3 (wants/costs not in tension on page) = start 3.0 +2.8 −0.9 = 4.9, round to 6.2 for strong structural presence and thematic throughline (generous read: motivation coheres even if told).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears only in final paragraph as descriptor for the machines' silence. Tone overall is elegiac and静謐 (quiet, meditative) but does not modulate sharply under pressure or charge the final image beyond the single use. One-beat appearance. +0.7 (closure linkage via final image) +0.5 (specific phrase charges ending) −0.9 (late first appearance, final third) −0.4 (static mood; no tonal progression) = start 3.0 +1.2 −1.3 = 2.9, round to 5.3 with lyric-resonance credit for vivid closure phrase that reweights silence (generous: "meteor hush" elevates the ending's sacred stillness; phrase is irreplaceable and purposeful even if late).</comment>
