<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (the overdue apology) is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses during the key beat. The grandmother relationship exists only in memory; no on-page friction tests commitment. The "induced currents" method and metaphor-advising trait are labels without visible constraint or cost. Internal state relies on abstract phrasing ("threads fraying," "weight of an overdue apology") instead of specific, embodied choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the perfume bottle accumulates sensory and memory weight across three touches (opening, middle channeling, shelf return). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara places the bottle back, her heart "lighter," reconnection achieved—but cost is asserted ("imperfect miracle") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. The orchard's fate and her grandmother's presence remain abstract; no on-page decision narrows options. Orientation anchors (archive, Elara, perfume bottle) land early, so no penalty there.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archive is anchored early (aged paper, shelves, flickering lamp) and the perfume bottle's tactile presence (ridges, scent) recurs. The orchard outside supplies atmospheric pressure but does not constrain a choice. The bottle's hum and scent at closure charge the final image, qualifying as micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clean, though the archive's transformation ("sheet music glowed faintly") reads decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnect with grandmother, deliver apology) is signaled early but remains internal and told. The single tightening—holding the bottle, channeling currents, feeling forgiveness—lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. No reversal tests commitment; coincidence (grandmother's presence arriving via the bottle's "currents") resolves the apology without protagonist cost. The orchard's impending loss adds atmospheric weight but does not alter Elara's tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme ("imperfect miracles," cracks letting light in) emerges from the bottle and orchard imagery, but Elara voices it directly in a thesis line: "Miracles aren't perfect... They're cracks in the glass, letting the light in." The final paragraph moralizes: "even the most imperfect miracles could mend the cracks in our lives." The perfume bottle's scent and the orchard's roots supply a resonant image, but the stated moral undercuts earned subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; voice carries a lyric register ("whispered secrets of centuries past," "ethereal grit"). Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue appears, so the dialogue policy does not apply. Elara's perceptual signature (tracing ridges, feeling currents) is consistent, though diction occasionally elevates into detached narration ("the hush before the orchard's trees were cut down") where her urgency would compress syntax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting debt: figurative language in most lines of the closure beat ("currents of memory," "ghostly flower," "beacon of memory") without pattern-teaching; mixed vehicle ("currents" both electrical and fluid). Template cadence in paragraph three: "The orchard outside was doomed... The air was thick... Elara's grandmother had loved..." Stock metaphor strings ("threads fraying," "smoke," "held breath") cluster without fresh specificity. Paraphrase loop: final paragraph restates the orchard's persistence three ways. Baseline −0.9 in Q7; artifacts touch closure, so 9+ disallowed globally and high-band capped at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Premise combines "grief + object + archive setting" in a familiar template; the gossip-column exorcist title promises quirk but does not shape tactics. The apology-via-mystical-object frame and orchard-as-living-archive are stock. "Induced currents" and "imperfect miracles" supply concept labels without transformation through lived detail or moral calculus. No fresh inflection at closure; the grandmother's forgiveness arrives without friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role ("gossip-column exorcist") frames the setup, but her choices do not create turns. The key action—holding the bottle, channeling currents—is passive reception; her grandmother's presence arrives without Elara's decision altering tactics. The label "advises through metaphors" appears once (middle) but does not constrain a beat. Present across the text but ornamental to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The perfume bottle appears in three distinct beats: opening (Elara traces its ridges), middle (she channels currents, it trembles, scent blooms), and closure (she places it on the shelf, scent lingers). It enables the reconnection and charges the final image. Swappability: a locket or letter could serve the same function with minor edits. Causal pressure is moderate; no visible cost tied uniquely to the bottle's properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Imperfect miracles" is seeded early ("things mended but never quite whole") and voiced mid-story ("Miracles aren't perfect... cracks in the glass"). The concept names the theme but does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. Final paragraph moralizes it directly, reducing it to a thematic claim. Present in setup and closure as label; does not constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Advises through metaphors" is told once in paragraph two ("her reputation had been built on her ability to advise through metaphors") and demonstrated once mid-story when Elara voices the "cracks in the glass" line. No on-page cost or constraint; the trait does not alter a tactic or create friction. Label-only mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reconnect" is the dominant stake, signaled early and resolved at closure when Elara feels her grandmother's warmth and forgiveness. The action drives the arc but is executed passively—Elara receives the connection via the bottle's currents without a decision that trades off another path. Swappability: "forgive" or "remember" could replace it with minor edits. Causal role in setup and closure; moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Induced currents" is mentioned twice: paragraph four ("through induced currents, she channeled the energy of objects") and paragraph five (the apology "formed... as a current"). The method is named but its mechanics do not matter—no failed attempt, no cost tied to the technique. It resolves the apology without prior friction. Present in middle and closure as label; does not shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sheet music archive anchors the scene early (aged paper, shelves, lamp) and reappears at closure ("sheet music on the shelves glowed faintly"). The orchard outside supplies atmospheric urgency. Neither location constrains a choice or alters Elara's approach. The archive's transformation is decorative. Setup and closure participation via imagery; functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "hush before the orchard's trees are cut down" is signaled in paragraph two and recurs in paragraph three and the penultimate paragraph. It adds atmospheric pressure but does not tighten Elara's decision—no clock forces her to act now versus later. The orchard's imminent loss contextualizes her urgency but does not alter tactics. Present across the text; thematic accent without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The overdue apology is the dominant stake, signaled early ("the weight of an overdue apology") and resolved when Elara forms the apology as a current and feels forgiveness. The desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicting wants. No friction between apology and another cost on the page. Drives setup and closure; moderate causal pressure without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" names the intended tone—lyric imagery ("ghostly flower," "currents of memory") paired with tactile anchors (ridges, soil-stained hands). The tone is consistent but static; no modulation under pressure. The final image ("scent lingering on her skin") maintains the register. Coherent across the text; does not heighten at closure. Mid-band for presence without dynamic charge.</comment>
