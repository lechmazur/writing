<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason") is presented as label rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. His "peripherally focused" trait and locksmith occupation appear as told attributes without constraining choices or revealing hierarchy of values through micro-decisions. The "years of practice" and humming tune function as generic competence markers rather than embodied particulars that emerge under the specific stress of this repair. Emotional progression remains smooth and declarative ("felt a sense of peace") rather than layering contradictory states through credible irrationality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the opening paragraph; marble cavern and Elias establish cleanly. The closure attempt—timer repaired, echoes harvested, peace achieved—reads as Decisive Change, but the causal chain compresses: "noticed that the broken timer's gears were aligned with the angles of reflection at dusk" is asserted discovery rather than earned through prior failed attempts or visible tradeoffs. Cost at closure is conceptual (wonder preserved) but not felt on the page as forfeiture or narrowed future; "knowing that wonder would never truly be lost" declares resolution without visible price. The drive lens reads Causal but linkage loosens at the pivotal breakthrough.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern supplies vivid sensory anchors—"shimmered with ancient veins of silver and gold," "faint glow of twilight seeped through a crack"—and its reflective surfaces tie directly to Elias's method (studying reflection angles). The timer's alignment with dusk angles at the breakthrough moment demonstrates setting constraining choice. Spatial choreography remains coherent (crouched, buried depths, ceiling crack). However, the cavern does not evolve causally; it remains static witness rather than a dynamic pressure that alters tactics or raises cost across the sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair the timer to harvest echoes) is signaled early. The story offers one meaningful turn: the dusk-angle discovery that enables repair. However, this breakthrough arrives without visible prior failure, constraint, or tradeoff; Elias "noticed" rather than tested and sacrificed. The resolution—timer hums, echoes converge, peace follows—proceeds without legible cost: no omission, no foreclosed path, no tactical price paid on the page. Agency reads as observation ("closed his eyes, listening") rather than decision under narrowed options. The ending declares fulfillment ("wonder would never truly be lost") without dramatizing what was risked or renounced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (preserving fleeting beauty, holding the intangible) emerges from the core concept and Elias's motivation, but it resolves into an affirming platitude: "wonder would never truly be lost." The marble cavern's reflective properties and the dusk-alignment discovery function as plot mechanics rather than image-patterns that reweight prior material with non-literal cost. The ending offers summary of emotional state ("sense of peace") instead of a resonant image or action that invites ambiguity. Prompt-like phrasing—"store wonder in the cellar of reason"—appears as thematic echo rather than dramatized pressure, and the final paragraph moralizes fulfillment without complexity or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("peripherally focused," "reverse-engineering," "store wonder in the cellar of reason") mixes register: technical locksmith language, poetic abstraction, and philosophical framing coexist without clear perceptual signature that unifies them as Elias's specific idiom. Perceptual selection (gears, reflections, angles) aligns with occupation, but interior voice ("felt closer than ever," "imagined filling jars") flattens into generic longing rather than character-particular syntax or rhythm. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance remains consistent, though elevated ("the whispers of the past and future converged") during peak beats where compression might anchor more urgently in body and tool.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean; no pronoun confusion or tense drift. However, the prose carries template-cadence runs: "Days turned into nights, and nights blurred into days," "It was warm, like sunlight on skin, and fragile, like the first snowflake of winter." Paragraph structure varies but several blocks paraphrase without adding pressure—paragraphs 2 and 4 restate the harvest-of-echoes concept and Elias's motivation with synonym churn ("promise," "way to hold onto," "store wonder") rather than advancing situation. The breakthrough paragraph ("One evening...") delivers information efficiently but leans on "with trembling hands" and "alive once more" as stock embodiment. Figurative density in the final two paragraphs ("air shimmered with the presence of echoes," "warm, like sunlight") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure cost. Apply template-cadence and paraphrase-loop penalties: −0.6 baseline, escalated to −0.9 for artifact spread across closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Core premise (locksmith repairs mystical timer to harvest echoes) merges occupational specificity with fantastical concept, offering mild freshness. However, the emotional arc—solitary artisan seeks to preserve beauty, succeeds, feels peace—follows a template path without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The reflection-angle method and marble-cavern setting supply visual particularity but do not subvert or deepen the "capture the intangible" trope. The ending affirms the quest without complication, cost, or counter-reading: Elias achieves his goal cleanly, and the narrative offers no friction between success and price. Prompt elements (peripherally focused, wounded season, cellar of reason) appear as labels rather than synthesized into an inevitable, character-driven design.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his profession (locksmith) is stated, but his key choice—the dusk-angle discovery—reads as passive observation ("noticed") rather than decision that narrows options. Setup: early. Development: work described but no conflicted micro-choice shown. Payoff: repairs timer, but the act is told summary. Swappability moderate; another artisan role could replace locksmith with minor edits. Two beats (crouched over mechanism, breakthrough evening) but neither imposes visible tradeoff. Reflective trait told, not dramatized as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timer appears in three beats: opening (broken, crouched over), breakthrough (gears aligned, pieced together), closure (cradled, activated). Setup early. Development: Elias works on it but no failed attempt shown. Payoff: timer hums, activates harvest. However, its broken state does not constrain tactics—no parts shortage, no wrong move penalty—and repair success arrives without visible cost or tradeoff. Swappability: another mechanism (compass, lens) could serve similar function. Charged reprise absent; it ends functional but not reweighted in meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Harvest of echoes is explained as concept in paragraph 2 and declared achieved in closure ("echoes converged," "felt the wonder"). Setup present. Payoff: mentioned. Development: does not constrain middle choices; Elias's work on the timer proceeds without on-page attempt to harvest or test echo-capture mechanics. The concept frames theme but does not shape tactics or narrow options. Swappability high; "capture memories" or "preserve moments" would function identically. Told as outcome, not dramatized as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Peripherally focused appears as label in paragraph 1 ("Elias was peripherally focused") and is restated ("drawn to the peripherally focused, the details others overlooked"). No on-page action where this trait constrains choice or imposes cost. Setup: mentioned early. Development and payoff: absent. The trait could be removed without altering plot or closure. Ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Reverse-engineer is named in paragraph 2 and paragraph 6 ("began to reverse-engineer the mechanism"). Setup present. Development: mentioned as method but no failed attempt or iterative process shown. Payoff: the action succeeds in breakthrough beat. However, it arrives as told summary ("piecing it back together with a new understanding") rather than dramatized steps with visible tradeoff. Swappability: "repair" or "reconstruct" would serve near-identically. One key turn tied to it but causality is asserted, not earned through prior pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Studying reflection angles at different times is stated in paragraphs 2 and 5 as Elias's method and appears at breakthrough ("gears were aligned with the angles of reflection at dusk"). Setup: present. Development: described as ongoing habit but no middle scene shows a failed angle or iterative test. Payoff: the dusk-angle insight enables repair. Swappability moderate; another observational method could replace it. One beat involvement (breakthrough) but mechanics remain abstract; no on-page demonstration of how angles constrain or guide choices before the final discovery.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Marble cavern anchors setting early with vivid sensory detail ("walls shimmered with ancient veins of silver and gold") and its reflective surfaces tie to the method (angles of reflection). Setup strong. Development: cavern remains "constant" and "silent witness" rather than evolving or pressuring choices. Payoff: "marble walls seemed to breathe" at closure supplies atmospheric charge but does not alter outcome or impose cost. Swappability moderate; another reflective space (crystal hall, mirrored chamber) could serve similarly. The micro-setting (body, tool) does not further constrain; gears and timer do the causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Wounded season is named in paragraphs 2 and 5 ("across the lull of a wounded season"). Setup present. Development: time passes ("Days turned into nights") but no deadline, clock, or season-driven pressure narrows choices. Payoff: closure occurs within the season but season does not tighten or enable the breakthrough. Swappability high; the label could be any timeframe. Ornamental use; the season provides thematic coloring (stillness, sorrow) but does not function as tactical constraint or cost lever.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Motivation stated explicitly in paragraph 1 ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later") and restated in paragraphs 4 and 8 ("preserving them for a future," "wonder would never truly be lost"). Setup: early and clear. Development: desire guides the repair goal but no on-page friction between want and cost—Elias does not sacrifice present wonder or confront a trade-off that tests commitment. Payoff: goal achieved without visible price. Told motivation rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. Swappability: "preserve beauty" or "capture fleeting moments" would function identically.</comment>
