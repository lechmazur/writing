<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to interpret silence with empathy") but never tested by a competing impulse or dilemma on the page. Her "methodically curious nature" and "shielded openness" read as static labels rather than traits that collide under pressure. The discovery sequence shows competence without genuine struggle—she digs, strikes wood, and finds the chapel intact with no setbacks or trade-offs. The final paragraph asserts reverence and guardianship but offers no micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Orientation Test fails: who Elara is (map framer), where she stands (vault vs. henge proximity), and when this occurs remain vague past 120 words; "at the spot where a map tears" is poetic but spatially opaque. Drive lens is ambiguous—opening suggests Causal (video comparison should narrow options), middle drifts Accumulative (layered imagery), ending lands on summary reverence without a decisive change or felt cost on the page. The chapel discovery is recounted rather than dramatized, and the final image ("stood as a testament") abstracts rather than charges prior material. Apply Orientation Test penalty −0.4 and lens ambiguity −0.4; Q3 cap at 7.0 applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault and henge are described vividly but remain postcard details—neither constrains Elara's choices nor supplies resources that alter her tactics. The video footage on the tablet and excavation tools are mentioned but never depicted in use with spatial consequence. The chapel's wooden beams and altar appear only in the final summary, untouched and unexplored. Sensory detail (frescoes, shadows, rain) is filtered through generic poetic diction rather than Elara's professional map-framer bias. Spatial choreography is vague: is she inside the vault, beside the henge, or moving between them?</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to reopen… the doors to understanding"—is declared but never pressured by a live obstacle or competing goal. Elara's work proceeds smoothly: she compares footage, notices a discrepancy, digs for days, and strikes the chapel without setback or tactical adjustment. No reversal or tightening occurs; the misalignment in the 2023 footage is raised as a question ("had the henge moved, or had the world around it changed?") but never answered or leveraged to narrow her options. The ending summarizes future scholars arriving but offers no on-page consequence or choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The whispered chapel and "silence" motif are stated repeatedly ("interpret silence with empathy," "silence was profound, yet it spoke volumes") rather than embodied in concrete action or image. Thematic statements dominate the final paragraph: "a testament to the power of curiosity and empathy," "a way to heal the divide between what is known and what remains to be discovered." These assertions replace scene pressure and earned resonance. The frescoes "seemed to glow… revived by the light of understanding" is metaphorical convenience, not a particular that reweights prior material. The ending moralizes rather than offering a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly with no head-hopping, but the narrative voice relies on elevated, abstract diction that does not track a map framer's professional perceptual signature: "methodically curious," "shielded openness," "the weight of the chapel's absence." Filter verbs ("seemed to hum," "seemed to hold its breath," "seemed to glow") stack across high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Elara's interiority alternates between poetic abstraction and label-only emotion ("her heart heavy with reverence") without embodied contradiction or micro-choice. The voice reads as a committee consensus rather than a singular, character-particular perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "whispered of a chapel lost to time" / "whispered chapel, as it was called in ancient texts"; "her methodically curious nature drew her" / "Her methodical curiosity led her to wonder." Template cadence runs across adjacent sentences: "Her gaze shifted… Her methodical curiosity led… Her empathy guided…" Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle: "like the rings of a tree," "like a puzzle solver," "like a detective." The final paragraph stacks abstract noun phrases ("the power of curiosity and empathy," "a bridge between the past and the present") that replace concrete image. Apply scaffold and loop penalty −1.0; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—archaeologist uses old footage to discover a hidden structure—is a widely used template, unaltered by lived professional detail or unexpected moral calculus. The henge/chapel pairing and "silence with empathy" framing read as prompt compliance rather than organic synthesis. Elara's "shielded openness" and "map framer" title are mentioned but never leveraged for fresh perspective or specific worldview. The video comparison is declared but not dramatized with particulars of light, shadow, or technical analysis. No turn or intensification feels inevitable in hindsight; the chapel discovery could swap "henge" for any ruin and "map framer" for any scholar without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara (perceptive map framer) is present throughout but her profession is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates map-framing skill constraining or enabling a choice. She observes, compares footage off-page, and digs—generic actions swappable with "archaeologist" or "historian." Her "perceptive" nature is asserted, not dramatized in a decision that alters tactics. Late first-beat penalty −0.5; ornamental profession −0.8; swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ancient henge appears in opening, middle (video comparison), and final paragraph, but its function remains static description. It "seemed to hum," stones are traced, alignment is mentioned—all observational beats without mechanical consequence. The henge does not constrain Elara's excavation choice or charge the final image with reweighted meaning; the chapel beneath is the true discovery. Three-beat presence +1.4; no causal pressure −1.0; closure cameo without transformation −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The whispered chapel is the discovery goal, signaled early and present at closure, but it functions as a treasure-hunt object rather than a concept that shapes on-page stakes or tactics. It is found intact with altar and beams—no mystery reweighted, no silence interpreted through action. The chapel's "whispered" quality is told, not dramatized. Setup +0.5; closure presence (cameo) +0.4; ornamental/thematic claim without causal work −1.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is stated twice but never constrains a choice or enables a tactic with visible cost. Elara's approach is patient and deliberate, but the trait could be swapped for "determined" or "careful" without changing any beat. Label-only −0.8; swappability −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Reopen" governs the discovery arc: Elara reopens footage frame-by-frame, reopens excavation, and the chapel itself is a reopening of lost history. The action is signaled early and shapes the middle and ending. Yet the mechanics are summarized ("frame by frame") rather than dramatized, and the excavation involves no setback or trade-off that "reopen" uniquely enables. Setup +0.6; two beats +0.9; summary-only use −0.6; swappability (could be "uncover" or "reveal") −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Silent video footage from decades apart is introduced early (1953 vs. 2023) and used in the middle beat to notice a misalignment. The method shapes one key turn (the discrepancy in light) but its mechanics are not detailed—no frame-by-frame dramatization, no technical specificity that ties the means to the outcome. The footage does not appear at closure. Setup +0.6; one beat +0.4; causal involvement (weak) +0.4; summary-only −0.5; missing from closure −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault is established early and described across multiple beats, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The vault "seemed to hold its breath" during excavation—metaphorical, not mechanical. The frescoes glow at the end, a thematic echo without tactical pressure. Setup +0.6; two descriptive beats +0.9; no choice constraint −1.0; ornamental closure reprise −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"At the spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown" is poetic framing, not a functional timeframe. It appears in paragraph one and final paragraph but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed hours/days in a way that alters Elara's moves. The excavation "hours turned into days" is summary without on-page clock pressure. Lyric seed +0.3; closure reprise +0.4; no live clock or tactical constraint −1.4; ornamental metaphor −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To interpret silence with empathy" is declared early and repeated at closure ("the silence was profound, yet it spoke volumes"), but it is never dramatized in a conflicted choice. Elara's empathy "guided her, urging her to listen"—passive construction without friction between want and cost. The motivation is told, not tested. Setup +0.5; closure statement +0.4; told-only with no friction −1.2; label-repetition artifact −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" is stated once ("Her shielded openness allowed her to approach the mystery without preconceptions, yet with a protective layer of skepticism") but never modulates under pressure or charges the final image. The tone remains uniformly reverent and poetic throughout; no shift occurs when Elara strikes the chapel or steps inside. Setup (weak label) +0.2; static mood with no modulation −1.0; closure tone (generic reverence) does not reweight prior material −0.8.</comment>
