<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve lost songs is clear, but her character remains largely abstract—"courier pigeon trainer" and "reinventing personal history" function as labels without forcing contradictory impulses into scene work. The final moment of rediscovery reads as summary ("she had preserved herself") rather than a visible choice with cost. Interiority leans heavily on stock phrases ("fragmented thoughts," "blooming and withering parts of her soul") that flatten particularity. The pigeons and dust-mapping occupy her time but never pressure her into a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (attic, bookshop, Elara) land early. The story attempts an Accumulative lens: dust-mote mapping seeds early, the letter arrives as a complication, and the final paragraph offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis or Charged Poise). However, the closure unit remains tellingly abstract—"she had preserved herself" asserts transformation without showing a visible or felt cost on the page. The letter's arrival and the weeks of renewed mapping compress causality into summary ("Slowly, the songs began to return"), weakening the tightening required even under an accumulative design. Cost is conceptual at best, not legible in a specific action or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The attic, skylight, and meteorite chip anchor setting with sensory detail (musty air, crumbling books, velvet pouch). The meteorite recurs but never constrains a choice—it is held, clutched, rested on her palm without altering tactics or shaping the closure image's pressure. The dust motes function thematically but do not supply a resource or obstacle that changes Elara's options. Spatial choreography is clear; the setting supports atmosphere but remains postcard-level rather than micro-setting that drives action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving lost songs—is signaled early but never faces a concrete on-page test that narrows options. The letter ("The songs are in the dust") arrives as an external gift rather than a reversal earned by Elara's prior action. The "following weeks" summarize escalation ("Slowly, the songs began to return") instead of dramatizing a tightening choice. No visible price is paid; the resolution blooms without forfeiture or trade-off, undercutting the cost clarity required for higher bands even under an Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—loss, rediscovery, the interplay of blooming and withering—emerges through recurring images (dust motes, meteorite, pigeons, songs). However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("a symphony of blooming and withering, of loss and rediscovery") and then explicitly moralizes ("she had preserved more than the echo of lost songs—she had preserved herself"), replacing earned resonance with assertion. The meteorite and dust motes recur but their meaning does not shift through action; they remain symbolic conveniences. Subtext is thin; interiority leans on abstract philosophizing rather than concrete struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Distance is consistent, though narrative certainty sometimes exceeds what Elara can plausibly know ("their patterns now seeming deliberate, as if guided by an unseen hand"). Diction leans elevated ("extraterrestrial origin," "symphony of blooming and withering") in ways that feel imposed rather than character-specific. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is moot. Perceptual signature is generic—dust motes, skylight, pigeons—without idiosyncratic filtering that reveals how this mind notices under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stock metaphors proliferate without fresh inflection: "paper trail of half-truths," "blooming and withering parts of her soul," "void," "symphony." Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "preserve the echo of lost songs" / "songs she had thought lost forever" / "songs she had found" / "echo of lost songs." Template cadence runs: "She [verb], her [noun]" structures repeat across multiple beats. The final paragraph front-loads figurative language ("symphony of blooming and withering, of loss and rediscovery") that obscures rather than sharpens the closure image. Sentence openings vary minimally; paragraph rhythm is uniform. Information density is low—many lines restate prior content without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—courier pigeon trainer rediscovering lost songs via dust-mote mapping—gestures at whimsy but executes as a template: isolated protagonist, symbolic object (meteorite), abstract quest (lost songs), tidily resolved epiphany. The meteorite, pigeons, and dust motes are present but interchangeable; removing any would require only minor adjustments. The letter's arrival and the weeks of renewed purpose follow familiar beats. Emotional arc (fragmentation → rediscovery) is generic. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece hedges toward safe lyricism without the specificity or cost that transforms familiar material into singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara's role as courier pigeon trainer is setup (attic, training sessions) and middle-mentioned (training balanced with dust study), but her occupation does not drive a key turn. The pigeons carry messages and "whispers of songs," yet no training decision alters tactics or stakes. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The Mars meteorite chip appears early (velvet pouch, gift from a lost friend), recurs in the middle (held while watching dust), and is present at closure (resting on her palm). However, it never constrains a choice or evolves in use—it is held, clutched, rested, always as a static symbol. Two-gate presence (setup, closure cameo) with no causal pressure caps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Paper trails" is signaled early (Elara's life as "a paper trail of half-truths," notes on margins of old books) and the letter's arrival invokes the concept. Yet it remains thematic rather than tactical—no decision hinges on tracing or constructing a paper trail. The dust becomes "a paper trail of its own" via metaphor, not through choices the concept enables or constrains. Functional metaphor, replaceable mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Reinvents personal history" is told early ("half-truths, each carefully constructed") and mentioned again ("notes were a fragment of her reinvented history"), but no on-page scene shows her constructing a lie or paying a cost when truth emerges. Label-only; no visible tradeoff. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Balance" is seeded early (balancing past and present in the attic), recurs in the middle (balancing training, dust study, meteorite moments), and is claimed at closure ("the balance she had achieved"). However, no turn shows her actively choosing to balance competing demands with a visible sacrifice. The action is asserted rather than dramatized. Present across beats but swappable with "reconcile" or "integrate" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Mapping dust motes under the skylight is introduced early (afternoons spent mapping swirl of dust), tested in the middle (letter clue: "The songs are in the dust"), and executed over weeks ("began to map the dust motes with renewed purpose"). The method shapes her attempt and is present at closure. However, the mechanics remain vague—what does mapping entail?—and the method does not narrow options or impose a cost. One clear causal beat (letter prompts renewed mapping) plus closure presence, but lacking specificity and pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The vintage bookshop attic is anchored early (dimly lit, stacks of tomes, musty air, skylight) and houses all action. It provides resources (old books for message paper, sanctuary space) and atmosphere. The attic transitions from refuge to "laboratory of sorts," a shift acknowledged on the page. However, the setting does not pressure a choice—Elara could pursue her quest in any quiet space. Setup, development (transformation noted), and closure presence, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across learning to trust again" as timeframe is signaled early (buried history, half-truths) and claimed at closure ("to trust again, to believe that the past could be more than a series of lies"). The weeks after the letter's arrival mark progression. However, trust is told rather than tested—no scene shows her risking trust with a cost. The timeframe is vague and does not tighten decisions. Present thematically, missing as tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of lost songs" is stated early (motivation, melodies lingering in dreams), pursued in the middle (humming to pigeons, letter clue), and claimed at closure. The desire is clear and consistent. However, it is never dramatized in a conflicted choice—no moment where preserving songs costs her something else she wants. Friction between want and cost is absent. The motivation drives action but remains abstract; told more than shown under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" as tone is seeded early ("blooming and withering parts of her soul") and recurs throughout (reviving withered parts, "symphony of blooming and withering" at closure). The tone modulates from refuge to laboratory to final stillness. However, the phrasing is stock and the tonal charge at the ending is asserted ("symphony of blooming and withering") rather than embodied in a specific image. Present across structure, but reliance on the label itself weakens integration.</comment>
