<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to guide travelers is asserted early, but her internal contradiction between hating the role and staying is told rather than dramatized through embodied conflict. The decision to use the nut-map feels prompted by the nut's pull rather than arising from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final planting carries a sense of earned action, but the causal chain leading there reads more as discovery than as a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost. Interiority leans on abstractions ("stubborn sense of duty," "faint hope") rather than character-particular textures.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal lens: nut discovery → impressions → map assembly → rescue → planting → bud. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first two paragraphs, satisfying the test. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (bud emergence), but the cost is diffuse—"the curse wasn't broken, but it was weakening" tells the shift rather than showing a visible price Elara pays or a live option she forecloses. The nut glowing "as if approving" and the ground trembling feel convenient rather than motivated by prior constraint, weakening causal tightness at the pivotal moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds supply vivid, purposeful detail that pressures Elara's rescue. The orchard's gnarled trees and the nut's etched surface are handled concretely. Spatial choreography during the chase is clean ("hidden alcove," "dodged"). However, the mechanical birds' "wings whirred like broken gears" and "graceless yet precise" read as stock contradictions rather than POV-filtered observation. The setting does not constrain the final planting choice—Elara simply presses the nut into soil without environmental resistance—so the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges closure) is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (break the curse, guide travelers) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs: the traveler's cry forces Elara to act, and the map enables the rescue. However, the escalation is linear rather than narrowing—Elara assembles the map without opposition, and the rescue succeeds without a trade-off or visible price paid on the page. The bud's emergence rewrites the orchard's state, but the cost is told ("less absolute") rather than felt. Agency at closure (planting the nut) is present but not dramatized as a choice that forecloses another live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the curse, the nut-as-key, and "graceless beauty," but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "she had found her purpose, not as a caretaker bound by duty, but as a guide, a breaker of curses." This tells the thematic answer rather than letting the bud image resonate. The nut's function as blueprint is asserted ("a forgotten blueprint") rather than discovered through scene pressure. "Graceless beauty" recurs in the mechanical birds' description but reads as a label applied to fit the prompt rather than an organic tension explored through contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Voice carries some texture ("offhandedly exact," "jagged paths winding"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("indifference," "absolute") that doesn't feel rooted in Elara's lived lexicon. The nut "glowing faintly as if approving her choices" and "urging her to act" externalize agency in a way that flattens Elara's perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear but remain voice-motivated. Psychic distance is consistent, though the final paragraph's summary tone ("And it had all begun") reads like retrospective narration rather than present immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings are mostly distinct. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Its surface was offhandedly exact, each line precise yet organic" is immediately restated as "as if it had been carved by a hand that knew exactly what it was doing without trying too hard." The phrase "forgotten blueprint" recurs three times, twice in the same paragraph, without new pressure. Stock metaphors cluster: "fractured spine," "glinting in the fading light," "wings whirred like broken gears." The final paragraph summarizes the arc ("something had changed") rather than letting the bud image close, dulling propulsion. Apply −0.6 for loops and stock strings; no closure-beat harm, so cap at that deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cursed orchard, reluctant caretaker, and object-as-key are familiar YA/fantasy templates. The nut's impression-leaving mechanic offers a small fresh angle, but the map assembly and rescue sequence proceed without friction or surprise. "Graceless beauty" applied to mechanical birds reads as a prompt echo rather than an organically discovered tension. The bud emergence at the end is a stock signal of hope. No bold risk-taking; the piece executes the template competently but does not transform it through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Apply −0.5 for derivative premise within Q8's band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes two key choices: assembling the map and planting the nut. Setup (caretaker role) is established early; middle development (map assembly, rescue) involves her agency; closure (planting) is her action. However, the planting is prompted by the nut's warmth and glow rather than arising from internal conflict or a trade-off. The rescue is enabled by the map but does not force Elara to sacrifice or renounce a competing desire. Two gates (setup, closure) are solid; middle pressure is weaker. Band: ~5.0–6.9 (shapes one key turn). Subtract −0.2 for prompted rather than self-driven closure choice; round to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nut appears in five distinct beats: discovery (paragraph 1), examination (paragraph 4), impression-leaving (paragraph 4), map assembly (paragraph 5), and planting (paragraph 8). Setup is early; middle beats (examination, impressions, assembly) constrain Elara's tactics; closure (planting) triggers the bud. The nut's mechanics (leaving impressions) enable the rescue. It is not swappable. Cost: the nut's function is discovered rather than costing Elara a choice, so the cost connection is weak. Band: ~7.0–8.4 (essential across beats and ending). Baseline 8.0 for beat involvement and closure linkage; subtract −0.2 for weak cost tie; round to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "forgotten blueprint" is mentioned twice by name and once implied (the map's clarity). Setup is present (paragraph 2: "bound by a forgotten blueprint"). Middle development is weak: the blueprint is not discovered through conflict but rather decoded passively when Elara assembles impressions. Closure: the bud suggests the blueprint's hold is weakening, but the blueprint itself does not appear or shape the planting choice. The concept is asserted thematically but does not constrain on-page tactics. Two gates (setup, closure echo) are present but development is thin. Band: ~3.0–4.9 (functional but replaceable). Baseline 4.5; subtract −0.4 for summary-only involvement; round to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Offhandedly exact" is used once as a descriptor of the nut's surface. Setup is present (paragraph 4). No middle development: the trait does not enable or constrain an action. No closure participation: the nut's precision is not invoked at the planting. The trait is decorative. One gate (setup mention) only. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle and closure gates. Band: ~0.1–2.9 (ornamental). Baseline 2.5 for label-only use; subtract −0.2 for decorative mention; round to 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Assemble" appears once (paragraph 5: "She assembled the impressions"). Setup is implicit (nut leaving impressions in paragraph 4). Middle development: the assembly creates the map, which enables the rescue—one major turn. Closure: the assembly's product (map) is not reprised at the planting; the bud emergence does not loop back to the act of assembly. Two gates (middle, implicit setup) are present; closure gate is missing. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure. Band contradiction: the middle turn is strong. Re-check: the map's use in the rescue counts as middle payoff, not closure. Apply lyric allowance: no reprise. Final: two gates, one strong beat. Band ~5.0–6.9. Baseline 7.0 for strong middle turn; apply −0.3 for missing closure participation; round to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Leaving impressions without touching" is demonstrated in paragraph 4 (nut leaves impressions on soil and stone). Setup is present. Middle development: the impressions are assembled into a map (paragraph 5), enabling the rescue. Closure: the method is not invoked at the planting—the nut is pressed into soil, a physical touch. Two gates (setup, middle) are present; closure gate is missing. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure. Band conflict: middle use is causal. Re-evaluate: the method shapes one key turn (map creation). Band ~5.0–6.9. Baseline 6.5 for middle causal work; subtract −0.6 for missing closure and late-middle introduction (~40%); round to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds are established early (paragraphs 1–2). Middle development: the birds patrol and threaten the traveler, forcing Elara to dodge and use the hidden alcove (paragraph 6). The setting pressures the rescue. Closure: the birds circle above at the end (paragraph 9), but they do not constrain the planting choice or charge the bud image. Three gates are present (setup, middle pressure, closure cameo). However, closure participation is weak (decorative mention). Band ~7.0–8.4 (essential across beats and ending) if closure were strong. Baseline 7.2 for setup and middle pressure; subtract −0.8 for no closure constraint (cameo only); round to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Before the night frost forms" appears twice: paragraph 1 (twilight sky) and paragraph 7 (first flakes of night frost). Setup is present. Middle: time is not tracked; the rescue is not dramatized as a race against frost. Closure: the frost's arrival is noted ("the frost would still come") but does not constrain or charge the planting. The timeframe is ornamental. Two gates (setup, closure mention) are present but neither involves causal pressure. Band ~3.0–4.9 (functional but replaceable). Baseline 4.2 for two-mention presence; subtract −0.5 for no pressure involvement; round to 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to guide lost travelers to safety" is stated in paragraph 5 and enacted in the rescue (paragraphs 6–7). Setup is present. Middle: the traveler's cry prompts action, and Elara pursues the rescue using the map. Closure: the motivation is reprised in the final paragraph ("as a guide"), but the bud's emergence is not causally tied to guiding—it follows planting the nut. Two strong gates (middle dramatization, thematic closure echo). Band ~5.0–6.9 (shapes one key turn). Baseline 6.5 for middle enactment; subtract −0.4 for closure echo without causal tie; round to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Graceless beauty" is introduced as a phrase in paragraph 6 (mechanical birds) and reprised in the final paragraph ("keeper of graceless beauty"). Setup is late (60%). Middle: the phrase describes the birds' function-driven movement during the rescue. Closure: the phrase is restated thematically but does not charge the bud image—it sits as a label. Two gates (middle, closure mention) are present. Band ~3.0–4.9 (functional but replaceable as a label). Baseline 5.2 for two-beat presence; subtract −0.4 for label-only closure use and late setup; round to 4.8.</comment>
