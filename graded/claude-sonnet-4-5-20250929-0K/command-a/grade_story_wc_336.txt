<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is assigned multiple abstract roles ("weaver between worlds," "guardian of the unseen threads") but these labels remain ungrounded in concrete contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her "insatiably creative" trait and "singular motivation" are told rather than dramatized through dilemmas that reveal competing desires. The planting ritual proceeds without visible internal friction or a choice that forecloses an alternative path with felt cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("radiant hush," "color of wonder") recycled without embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The orientation is delayed—"verdant parapet" and Elara's occupation arrive early, but her specific present goal and the immediate situation remain abstract past the 120-word threshold (−0.4). No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the seed sprouts without complication, and the "portal" outcome is declared rather than earned through causal linkage. The closure unit (sprouting seed as triumph) lacks visible cost: no prior stake is foreclosed, no tactic altered. Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural but fails to deliver a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The waterfall and parapet are mentioned repeatedly but do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; they function as postcard backdrop. The heirloom seed receives more specific handling (warmth, glow) and does charge the final image, partially meeting the micro-setting allowance. Sensory detail ("scent of blooming flora," "golden glow") is present but generic and not filtered through Elara's professional or personal priorities. Spatial choreography is minimal—no bodies in motion, no tactical use of terrain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("preserve the color of wonder") is signaled early but remains abstract and untested by on-page opposition or complication. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Elara plants the seed without friction, and it sprouts successfully. The resolution is awarded without visible cost—no renunciation, no path foreclosed, no price paid that alters her stance or future tactics. Pressure does not cohere or escalate; the ritual proceeds as a smooth, consequence-free sequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated outright ("preserve the color of wonder," "guardian of wonder") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The heirloom seed and sprouting could function as thematic image, but their symbolic weight is declared ("portal," "living testament") instead of earned through action and subtext. The ending offers no resonant reconfiguration or non-literal answer; it summarizes triumph ("she had succeeded") and restates the premise without ambiguity or cost. Motifs ("radiant hush," "weaving between worlds") recur as labels without constraint on choice or accumulation of pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Voice is stable third-limited but relies on recycled poetic diction ("radiant hush," "verdant parapet," "insatiably creative") that flattens Elara's perceptual signature. Filter verbs and passive observation dominate peak beats ("she felt," "she knew," "she imagined") where direct perception would sharpen pressure. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the narrator's lexicon drifts toward elevated register ("ethereal," "succor," "continuity") without grounding in Elara's internal idiom or the immediate sensory moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops recur: "weaver between worlds, a guardian of the unseen threads" restates the same idea; "she was more than a pruner, more than a weaver" recycles structure from the opening without new information. Template cadence runs through multiple "she [verb]" stems ("She moved," "She closed," "She had spent"). Stock metaphors ("bridge, a vessel," "lullaby of continuity") and synonym churn ("essence" appears six times, "radiant hush" four) dull momentum. Figurative density in peak beats (planting ritual) obscures causal progression without taught pattern or payoff. Apply −1.2 for loops and template artifacts touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise (wise gardener plants magical heirloom seed that embodies memory and renewal) follows a widely used template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "weaving between worlds" frame and "essence capture" method remain abstract gestures rather than grounded, irreplaceable particulars. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; the sprouting occurs without complication or risk. Elara's occupation as orchard pruner does not inform her choices or worldview in ways that make the arc specific to her. Apply −1.0 for derivative premise insufficiently transformed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara ("wise orchard pruner") is present throughout and performs the planting action, but her choices do not create reversals or alter tactics. Setup, development (planting), and payoff (triumph declared) gates are met, but her role is execution of a smooth ritual rather than decision under pressure. Apply −1.6 for absence of constrained choice, −0.4 for label-only trait use ("wise," "insatiably creative").</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The heirloom seed is introduced early (setup), handled mid-story ("felt warm," planted; two beats), and returns transformed in the closure (sprout glowing). All three gates are met. Causal involvement is present but passive—the seed does not constrain Elara's tactics or force a trade-off. Its properties (warmth, glow) are specific but the "portal" outcome is declared rather than shown altering options. Award +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage; deduct −0.5 for ornamental glow at the end and −0.4 for summary-only transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" appears as metaphor and label ("a weaver between worlds," "the worlds were connected") but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. It is absent from the middle choice (planting) and only restated thematically at the end. Setup is present as theme claim; development and payoff gates are missed. Apply −0.8 for swappability (could be "bridging realms" with no structural change), −0.5 ornamental use, and cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Insatiably creative" is mentioned twice as label ("insatiably creative soul," "her insatiable creativity") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. No choice demonstrates this trait through friction or trade-off. Setup gate is met (first paragraph); development and payoff gates are missed. Apply −0.7 for label-only use, −0.5 ornamental, and cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Succor" is named twice ("art of succor," "words of succor") and the planting ritual embodies nurturing, but the action is smooth and consequence-free—no major turn traces to it. Setup (studying succor) and development (planting as succor) gates are met; payoff is present (sprouting) but not causally decisive. Award +0.4 one beat, +0.5 causal involvement (weak); deduct −0.5 for swappability (could be "blessing" or "care" with minor edits) and −0.3 for summary invocation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Capturing essence" is described mid-story ("by capturing essence, she could restore"; "the essence...being drawn into the seed") and frames the ritual's mechanics. Setup and development gates are met; closure gate is weak (the sprout glows but no essence-capture mechanic shapes the final image). Award +0.4 one beat; deduct −0.6 for late first detailed appearance (second third) and −0.5 for ornamental use (mechanics told, not shown constraining choice).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The "verdant parapet beside a waterfall" is established early and recurs, but does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome. Setup gate is met; development and payoff gates are missed (the setting is static backdrop at closure). Award +0.3 early signal; deduct −0.8 for ornamental postcard description and cap at 4.6 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Upon the hush of budding hope" appears as abstract timeframe ("the timeframe was delicate," "the hush of budding hope remained") but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. No clock alters moves or imposes cost. Setup is metaphorical; development and closure gates are missed. Apply −0.7 for vague time that does not constrain and cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder" is stated as Elara's motivation in the opening and restated at closure, but is never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between want and cost. Setup and payoff gates are met; development gate is missed (the planting proceeds without competing desire or sacrifice). Award +0.3 early signal, +0.7 closure mention; deduct −0.7 for told-only motivation and −0.4 for absence of friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" is named four times and attempts to set a tone of quiet wonder, but the single static mood does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through diction shift. Setup is present; development and payoff show recurrence without evolution. Award +0.3 early signal; deduct −0.6 for repetition without cadence shift and −0.3 for static application.</comment>
