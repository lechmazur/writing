<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is characterized primarily through observation rather than difficult choices under pressure. His "warmly observant eyes" and "reticent" nature are labeled but never constrain a concrete decision with visible cost. The final resolve to "protect the light" is declared rather than enacted through a difficult trade-off on the page. Internal contradiction is absent; he moves smoothly from puzzlement to determination without embodied friction or competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The story accumulates clues (sea glass, stones, letters) but the closure—lighting the lamp and declaring resolve—lacks a decisive change or felt cost that forecloses a prior path. The "luminescent ache" disappearing and being "replaced by a quiet resolve" is asserted emotional summary, not an on-page reconfiguration with visible price. The letter-chain mystery resolves through discovery rather than protagonist agency, and the final stance is told ("he knew what he had to do") without a concrete action or renunciation that makes before/after legible. Drive lens reads Causal-adjacent but linkage dissolves into declaration at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse lantern room, jagged cliffs, and roaring sea are anchored early and sensory details (waves crashing, gulls crying, sea glass glow) are vivid. The hidden compartment and stone-stacking constrain one mid-story turn. However, the setting does not pressure the final choice or charge the closure image—Elias lights the lamp, an act unimpeded by environment. Spatial choreography is clean, but the setting remains atmospheric rather than essential to tactics or outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting the lighthouse's purpose—is signaled but pressure plateaus rather than escalates. The lamp flickering is a complication, but Elias solves it by relighting without visible trade-off or narrowed options. The stone-rearrangement (3-1-2 to 2-3-1) opens a compartment, a discovery beat rather than a choice under duress. The ending declaration of resolve is not tested by an on-page reversal or cost. No persistent constraint shapes tactics, and the final action (lighting the lamp) is uncontested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of guardianship and safety emerges from the lighthouse premise, but the final paragraph ("bottle the feeling of safety, one stone, one letter, one piece of sea glass at a time") states the theme rather than letting the final image imply it. The sea glass and stones recur but are used primarily as puzzle pieces rather than accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material with conceptual cost. The ending offers assertion ("he would protect the light") instead of a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elias's perception. Diction is controlled, though phrases like "luminescent ache" and "warmly observant" lean slightly elevated for a reticent skipper. No dialogue is present, so that bullet set is not applicable. Interior voice is consistent but lacks the perceptual signature or rhythmic modulation under pressure that would elevate it; stress does not compress or alter syntax in peak beats. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he felt") appear but are not excessive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure, but several loops and scaffolds appear: "sea glass" mentioned five times, "protect the light" repeated verbatim, and the final paragraph restates the entire premise in summary ("The lighthouse wasn't just a beacon; it was a guardian, and so was he"). The phrase "luminescent ache" is used twice with minimal reweighting. Stock metaphors ("anchor," "beacon," "guardian") cluster in the ending without fresh embodiment. Information density is moderate; some lines advance multiple jobs, but the final third recaps rather than propels.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse keeper deciphering coded messages to protect the light—is familiar and leans on guardian-of-secrets tropes without a fresh angle. The stone-stacking method (3-1-2 to 2-3-1) is introduced and solved within one beat without prior groundwork or transformation. The emotional arc (ache → resolve) is linear and unsurprising. The anonymous letter chain, sea glass motif, and hidden compartment read as genre furniture rather than a specific synthesis. No bold risk or non-obvious turn elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his occupation (lighthouse supply skipper) frames access to the setting, but his reticence does not constrain a key choice with cost. He observes, sorts crates, rearranges stones, and reads letters—actions of discovery rather than decision under pressure. The final resolve to "protect the light" is declared, not enacted through a difficult trade-off. Late first scene, present in closure via declaration, but swappable with a generic "caretaker" role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in five beats: Elias's pocket habit (paragraph 1), the discovered piece with message (paragraph 2), his noticing the glow (paragraph 1), the warmer feel at dawn (paragraph 6), and the closing bottling metaphor (paragraph 6). It frames the mystery and recurs at closure, but its causal role is limited—it delivers one message, then becomes symbolic. The "luminescent ache" ties to it thematically but the glass does not constrain tactics or enable a turn; it is handled but not used in ways that alter options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain is mentioned in paragraph 3 as context ("notes left in hidden places, always signed with a symbol of a wave") and letters are discovered in the hidden compartment (paragraph 5). The chain frames the mystery but does not shape on-page tactics or pressure—Elias reads the top letter and absorbs its message. Setup is late (second third), no middle development as a live constraint, and closure participation is thematic (the bottling-safety sentence) rather than causal. Swappable with another mystery device.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is labeled in paragraph 1 ("his eyes, warmly observant, missed nothing") and again implied in the closing line about his "warmly observant eyes," but it never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Elias observes clues (waves, gulls, sea glass, stones) and solves the puzzle, but the trait does not create friction or trade-off—observation is only advantageous here. Ornamental descriptor without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Protect" is the core action signaled via the sea-glass message ("Protect the light," paragraph 2) and returned in the final resolve (paragraph 6: "protect the light, not just for himself, but for everyone who relied on it"). It anchors the dominant stake, but the on-page enactment is limited to relighting the lamp—an uncontested act. No turn where protecting the light forces a difficult choice or trade-off. The action is present in setup, thematically central, and tied to closure, but easily swappable with "maintain" or "guard" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Stone-stacking as a message method is introduced in paragraph 3 ("an old method sailors used"), the 3-1-2 pattern is noted, and Elias rearranges the stones to 2-3-1 to trigger the hidden compartment (paragraph 5). It drives one turn (discovery of letters) but the mechanics are presented and solved in two contiguous beats without prior groundwork or later consequence. Late first appearance (second third), no closure participation beyond enabling access to the letters. Swappable with any puzzle mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "haunted lantern room" is the primary setting, established in paragraph 1 and sustained throughout; the lamp flickering and darkness create the inciting complication (paragraph 2). The hidden compartment and stone corner are lantern-room features that enable the mid-story turn (paragraph 5). However, the setting does not constrain the final choice—Elias lights the lamp without environmental resistance—and "haunted" is more atmospheric label than demonstrated pressure. Present in all three gates but lacks causal teeth at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The lamp flickers and sputters out (paragraph 2), and the story unfolds "as dawn broke" (paragraph 6), implying a night window. However, elapsed time is vague and does not tighten decisions—Elias sorts stones, reads letters, and reflects without urgency tied to the dark. The lamp is relit "as dawn broke," but no on-page cost or narrowed window shapes tactics. The timeframe is present but passive, functioning as atmosphere rather than a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"To bottle the feeling of safety" appears once in the discovered letter (paragraph 5: "To bottle the feeling of safety, you must first understand what threatens it") and is echoed in the closing metaphor (paragraph 6: "bottle the feeling of safety, one stone, one letter, one piece of sea glass at a time"). The motivation is told via the letter rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Elias's actions (lighting the lamp, protecting the light) align smoothly with safety; no friction or trade-off between safety and another desire is enacted on the page. Late signal, thematic closure reprise, but no mid-scene tension or choice where bottling safety competes with another stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is labeled twice (paragraph 1: "a luminescent ache that reminded him of something he couldn't quite name"; paragraph 6: "The luminescent ache in his chest was gone") and tied to the sea glass glow. The tone reads as melancholic wonder, but it does not modulate with pressure—peak beats (darkness, discovery) maintain the same register without intensification or release. The final disappearance of the ache is asserted rather than shown through cadence or image shift. Present at opening and closure, but static mood rather than dynamic tonal charge.</comment>
