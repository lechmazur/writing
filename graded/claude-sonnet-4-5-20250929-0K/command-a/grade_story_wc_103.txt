<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract therapeutic language ("retrocognitive entrapment," "quaking reverie," "texture of time") that feels more like prompt echo than embodied character thought. The motivation to restore fading photographs is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure; her trembling hands and quickening heart are bodily clichés without specific embodiment. The final transformation ("she had discovered herself") arrives as assertion rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. No genuine internal conflict surfaces—she pursues the fragment without hesitation, doubt, or cost until the vortex simply grants her wish.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph, meeting the test. The piece attempts an accumulative/textural lens but the closure lacks visible cost: Elara places the fragment, experiences a vision, and emerges with restored memories and a changed maze—pure gain with no forfeiture, renunciation, or price paid. The fragment's disintegration removes the object but doesn't foreclose a path or exact a felt consequence. The ending's "she had discovered herself" is an abstract claim disconnected from on-page pressure, failing to land a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The living bridge garden and hedge maze provide vivid sensory grounding (damp earth, blooming flowers, rustling leaves, warping geometry), and the maze's shifting paths constrain Elara's navigation in the middle section. The pedestal and clearing supply the closure stage, charging the final beat. However, the hyperbolic geometry remains ornamental—mentioned but not dramatized in a way that alters tactics or deepens the spatial pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking time's texture to restore fading memories—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or trade-off. Elara's journey through the maze encounters no meaningful obstacle; the fragment warms, the hedges part, and she places it "without hesitation." The vortex grants her exactly what she wanted (restored photographs, vivid ancestral stories) with no visible price, missed opportunity, or path foreclosed. One tightening occurs when the maze's geometry warps, but it doesn't narrow options or force a renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of memory's texture and temporal fragmentation emerges through repeated imagery (fading photographs, disintegrating fragments, layered time), and the maze functions as metaphor for retrocognitive exploration. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "she had discovered something far greater than a fragment of a halo—she had discovered herself" is a stated thesis rather than a resonant image. The resolution's symmetric satisfaction (memories restored, maze fulfilled, no ambiguity) flattens complexity into a tidy payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("otherworldly glow," "elusive essence," "infinite depth") that matches the lyric intent, though phrases like "quaking reverie" and "retrocognitive entrapment" feel imported from the prompt rather than character-specific perception. The perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices in ways any hedge maze designer might, without idiosyncratic bias. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests don't apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "The fragment pulsed faintly, as if alive" followed by "felt an inexplicable pull toward it, as though it held answers" restates the same content without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence runs through the climax: "She saw... She felt... It was both... When the light faded, Elara found herself..." (−0.5). The phrase "texture of time" recurs four times without evolving meaning, becoming a stock metaphor (−0.3). Filter verbs stack in the vortex sequence ("felt herself being pulled," "saw her ancestors," "felt the texture"), dulling immediacy at the story's peak (−0.5 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact penalty pack). Cumulative artifact penalties total approximately −1.5 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—a maze designer uses a mystical fragment to unlock temporal memory—combines familiar portal-fantasy and self-discovery templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious stakes. The hedge maze and living bridge garden offer vivid setting, but the emotional arc (trembling uncertainty → transcendent vision → self-actualization) follows a median trajectory with no bold risk or specificity that would survive transplant to another setting. The halo fragment functions as a convenient key rather than an element whose unique properties shape tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Hedge maze designer is present throughout and frames Elara's professional lens (she evaluates the maze's geometry, its temporal effects on visitors). However, her choices don't create key turns—she follows the fragment's pull without decision friction, places it "without hesitation," and the maze changes itself. Observation without pivotal agency trends low per guidance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Halo fragment appears in paragraph one (setup), warms and guides her through the maze (middle development), and disintegrates on the pedestal to trigger the climax (closure participation). It enables the vortex and restoration of memories, meeting all three gates. However, the fragment's unique properties (iridescence, pulse, warmth) don't constrain her tactics—it's a pure enabler without tradeoff. Causal involvement across three beats with closure linkage places it in the 6–7 band, but swappability with any mystical key (amulet, gem, sigil) and lack of visible cost caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fading photographs appear in paragraph three as Elara's motivating obsession and return in the vortex climax when "the fading photographs in her mind had been restored, their images sharp and vivid." Early seed and final reprise with reweighted meaning (blurred → clear) meet the lyric-resonance allowance, eligible for ~5.5–6.3. The concept shapes the dominant stake (restore what was lost) but isn't dramatized as a visible constraint during the maze journey—it remains thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Retrocognitively trapped appears once as a label ("temporal labyrinths, designed to evoke a sense of retrocognitive entrapment") describing the maze's effect on visitors, not Elara herself. It doesn't constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. Label-only mention without causal work trends low; late first appearance (paragraph two) and ornamental use cap it at 2.8 per missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Disintegrate occurs at the climax when the halo fragment "began to disintegrate, its shards dissolving into the light," triggering the vortex, vision, and Elara's transformation. This action is causally indispensable—removing it would collapse the closure. It appears in the final third (−0.3 for late arrival per guidance) but drives the ending decisively, earning closure linkage (+1.0) and causal pressure (+0.8). Net score ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is mentioned once in paragraph four ("as though the maze was employing hyperbolic geometry, bending space and time") as metaphorical description. The mechanics don't shape Elara's attempts, constrain her path, or return at closure—it's ornamental flavor rather than a functional method. Late arrival (second half), summary-only use, and no causal work cap it below 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Living bridge garden frames the opening and closing images, supplies the maze as the arena for all action, and provides sensory pressure (rustling leaves, warping hedges, clearing with pedestal). The maze's shifting paths constrain navigation in the middle section and the pedestal provides the closure stage. Setup, development (spatial constraint), and payoff (final image "the living bridge garden seemed brighter") all present. Causal involvement in two beats and closure linkage place it solidly in the 6–7 band, approaching 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>To discover the texture of time is stated early ("her true obsession was the texture of time itself") and recurs in the vortex ("She felt the texture of time—its rough edges, its smooth surfaces, its infinite depth"). However, it's told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—Elara never questions the pursuit, weighs alternatives, or sacrifices anything to achieve it. Early seed and lyric reprise meet setup and payoff, but friction between wants and costs is absent, capping it in the mid-5s per the gate model.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Quaking reverie appears once as a phrase ("her quaking reverie giving way to a sharp focus") in paragraph four. The tone remains consistently elevated and dreamlike (trembling, ethereal light, breathless revelation) but doesn't modulate meaningfully with pressure—the vortex maintains the same awed register rather than compressing or intensifying. Static mood across turns without charging the final image trends mid-low; functional presence in one beat but no closure charge or tonal shift caps it near 5.0.</comment>
