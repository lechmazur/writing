<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to "witness change without judgment" is stated but never genuinely tested—she simply follows the map because it intrigues her, then returns unchanged in action. The swan's trembling and the mirror visions are externally imposed rather than driven by her contradictory impulses. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("breath catch," "grip reality loosely") and the ending asserts transformation ("she had become the silence") without showing a foreclosed path or visible cost in her subsequent behavior. The journals she "did not remember writing" is a convenience that bypasses agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first paragraph. The piece attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens but the closure unit is weak: Lira returns to the library with journals she doesn't remember writing, the refuge vanishes, and the final image asserts she "had become the silence" without reweighting prior material through a concrete on-page cost or cadence shift. The journey to the refuge and back reads as a circular reset rather than a reconfiguration, and the visions (library crumbling, river drying, swan disintegrating) do not alter her tactics or options upon return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The overgrown library is vividly sketched with vines and ancient tomes, and the obsidian refuge's light-absorbing stone is memorable. However, spatial choreography in the catacombs is vague—walls "shifting as if guiding her" without concrete distances or choices based on layout. The swan functions as setting-object but constrains no middle choice; the mirror appears only at the end. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric but does not shape a key tactic or decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the "fragile balance" and "crumbling peace"—is signaled early but never tightened into a live dilemma. Lira's decision to follow the map lacks opposition or trade-off; the journey is arduous in description but not in cost. The mirror visions are passive (things happen to her) and upon return nothing has visibly changed in her actions or the library's state except for the asserted internal shift. One potential turn (the swan unfolding into a map) is intriguing but does not narrow options or force a sacrifice; escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake, which the ending does not deliver.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of impermanence and "regenerative silence" is present but remains abstract; the visions of decay and rebirth are told rather than dramatized through specific choice. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the crumbling peace…no longer felt like a burden but a reminder of the balance she was sworn to uphold." The swan recurs but does not accumulate new meaning through action—it is reset to its folded state without consequence. No counter-reading or meaningful ambiguity; the ending states the thesis rather than offering a resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lira with consistent psychic distance. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cryptic folds," "regenerative silence," "drift of untold seasons") that feels externally imposed rather than filtered through a character-specific perceptual signature. The phrase "grips reality loosely" is told as attribute rather than shown through skewed perception. No dialogue to evaluate. Narration is competent but lacks a distinct rhythmic or lexical signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear but carries template cadence and stock phrasing: "breath catch," "distant call," "the only sound the faint echo of her own heartbeat." Paraphrase loops appear in the final paragraph ("the crumbling peace…no longer felt like a burden but a reminder"). Figurative language is dense without payoff—"drift of untold seasons," "regenerative silence," "crumbling peace" are repeated as ambient texture rather than charged at closure. No overt grammatical errors, but momentum sags under the weight of ornamental description in the catacombs journey.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—chronicle keeper ventures into mysterious refuge, experiences transformative vision, returns—is a familiar template (hero's journey lite, vision-quest structure). The origami swan as map is a fresh detail but underused; the obsidian refuge and mirror are stock liminal-space symbols. The visions (crumbling library, drying river, disintegrating swan) are told generically without specific lived detail or moral calculus. No risk-taking in structure or perspective; the circular return erases consequence rather than deepening it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and the ending claims she "had become the silence," but her choices do not create key turns. She follows the map because it intrigues her (low agency), passively receives visions in the mirror, and returns to the same task. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development (a choice that alters tactics) is absent. The trait "witness change without judgment" is never tested by a competing want or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge is signaled early ("lingered in her thoughts"), visited at midpoint, and the mirror inside triggers visions. It returns at closure when "the obsidian refuge was gone, its existence erased," but this erasure is asserted rather than reweighted through a visible cost. The structure is dark stone that absorbs light; this property is described but does not constrain a choice. Two beats (arrival, disappearance) but the ending participation is ornamental—its absence is told, not felt.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Regenerative silence" appears as atmospheric descriptor (river's song, refuge's air, the mirror's "vast emptiness") but does not shape stakes or tactics. Lira experiences it passively; it does not narrow her options or enable a distinct action with cost. The concept is echoed thematically in the ending ("its silence now a part of her own") but remains abstract. Setup and payoff gates are met through repeated mentions; middle development is absent. Functional but replaceable with "transformative stillness" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is stated in paragraph two ("her perceptions shaped by the stories she preserved") and the mirror scene shows her mind unraveling, but no on-page action demonstrates this trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. It is label-only. The visions could occur to any character; the trait does not alter her tactics. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates missing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The word "Burrow" appears etched in the swan's hidden compartment, prompting Lira to press the beak and unfold the map—this drives one turn (decision to follow the map). The action itself (burrowing, descending into catacombs) is implicit in the journey but not dramatized as a specific tactic or choice. The word could be replaced with "Descend" or "Seek" with minimal edit. Setup and one middle beat; closure participation absent. Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The origami swan is introduced in paragraph one, trembles and reveals the word "Burrow" in paragraph three, unfolds into a glowing map that Lira follows, and returns folded at the end. It appears in setup, drives the middle turn (map reveal), and reappears at closure—but the closure reprise is a reset rather than reweighted meaning. The mechanics (cryptic folds, hidden compartment, glowing lines) are signaled and matter to one beat. Three gates met; causal pressure in one beat; closure linkage is static. Solid integration but lacks specificity cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The overgrown library is anchored early with vivid detail (vines, tomes, catacombs), Lira sits within it making the choice to follow the map, and she returns to it at closure where the final image occurs. The catacombs' "shifting walls" are described but do not supply a resource or obstacle that alters her path. The library's "crumbling peace" is told as atmosphere rather than a spatial constraint. Three gates met (setup, middle presence, closure location); causal pressure minimal. Setting frames the action but does not pressure a choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Drift of untold seasons" appears once in paragraph three as ambient phrasing and does not track or tighten decisions. The journey to the refuge and back occurs in a single evening ("One evening…When Lira emerged"). Time is vague and untracked; no clock pressure. Setup gate missing (not signaled by end of first third as a constraint); development and payoff gates missing. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To witness change without judgment" is stated as Lira's task in paragraph one and the ending asserts she now has "a deeper understanding." The desire is never dramatized in a choice where witnessing conflicts with intervention or self-preservation. She follows the map out of curiosity, not because it tests her witness-role. Setup gate met; middle friction (want vs. cost) absent; payoff is told. Functional but not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Crumbling peace" is named in paragraph one ("the library felt heavier, its crumbling peace strained") and returns in the final paragraph ("no longer felt like a burden but a reminder"). Tone is melancholic and atmospheric throughout with no sharp modulation under pressure—the catacombs journey and mirror visions maintain the same lyric distance. The final image repeats the phrase without shifting cadence or intensity. Setup and payoff gates met; middle modulation absent. Coherent but static.</comment>
