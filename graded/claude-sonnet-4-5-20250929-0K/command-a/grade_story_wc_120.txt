<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The fortune cookie writer remains wholly abstract—no contradictory impulses, no embodied choices under pressure. Interiority consists of stock phrases ("chronologically homesick," "conductor of unheard symphonies") that label rather than dramatize. The slump at the end is told, not earned through prior struggle or visible cost. No micro-choices alter tactics; the character observes and inscribes without agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: textural density competes with a gestural causal frame, never committing. The Orientation Test fails—who is this writer, why here, why now?—with no anchors by 120 words and no taught pattern that pays off. Closure reads as summary ("the symphony was unlike anything") rather than an on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The harp activation and final slump are asserted, not causally linked to prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake are vivid but ornamental; neither constrains a choice or alters tactics. The nautilus shell is handled twice (tracing ridges, inscribing) but remains static description. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the sensory hierarchy (silvery glow, fogged glass) reflects calm rather than crisis. Micro-setting could elevate if the shell's chambers or the harp's crystal strings shaped a choice, but they do not.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to become the conductor of unheard symphonies"—is declared but never tested on the page. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the writer inscribes, whispers, and the harp responds without resistance or cost. Exhaustion is mentioned as a deadline but never pressures a single choice. No reversal, no agency-driven escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme ("chronologically homesick," "mirrored horizon") is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "the music of the chronologically homesick, of those who longed for a time that never was." The nautilus and horizon recur but do not shift meaning through action. No earned insight; the closing "soul of the one who dared to dream it" is sermonic abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated ("liminal space," "distillation of memory and longing") but consistent within a lyric register. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt") appear frequently but fit the contemplative voice. No dialogue to assess. Perceptual signature is generic—any introspective narrator could notice these details—and does not degrade under the mentioned exhaustion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Template cadence and paraphrase loops pervade: "seemed to hum," "seemed to echo," "seemed to pulse" across three beats (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("threads of silk," "cascade of sound") and therapy-speak ("chronologically homesick") clutter peak moments. Information density is low; adjacent sentences restate the same mood without advancing pressure ("The horizon is a mirror" written, then narrated again). Clarity is adequate, but propulsion stalls in decorative phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—artist seeks inspiration in isolated, symbolic setting—is template. The fortune cookie writer detail is specific but unused; any creative could replace them. The nautilus-to-harp whisper and the "unheard symphonies" feel generic mysticism. No fresh inflection; the ending reproduces familiar epiphany structure. One signal of freshness: "chronologically homesick" as coined phrase, but it remains label-only without transformation through action.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Present throughout but purely observational until the final whisper, which is asserted rather than chosen. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. The writer traces, inscribes, whispers—passive gestures without friction or cost. Setup is early, but no middle choice and no causal closure role beyond presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Handled in two beats (tracing ridges, inscribing phrases) and returns in the final slump when it slips from grasp. The chambers serve as canvas but do not constrain or enable a choice. Closure linkage is ornamental—the shell falls, but the symphony's success or failure does not hinge on it. Swappable with any symbolic object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The mirrored horizon is described repeatedly and inscribed onto the shell, but it does not shape an on-page choice or alter options. It functions as thematic echo rather than causal pressure. Present in the final image ("the horizon remained, a mirror") but without reweighted meaning tied to a cost. Setup is early, no middle development, ornamental closure cameo.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Chronologically homesick" appears twice as a label without constraining or enabling a single action. No on-page cost or tradeoff linked to this trait. It exists as thematic flavor rather than lived friction. Missing middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dawn frames the urgency ("pressing need to complete their task") and the room's lighting shift. The writer's final action (whispering into the shell) coincides with dawn breaking and the harp's response. Present in setup, middle atmosphere, and closure timing, but the turn does not hinge on dawn itself—exhaustion or any other clock could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Mapping childhood memories onto the shell's spiraling chambers" is stated once and referenced in the fourth paragraph ("memories mapped onto the shell wash over them"). The mechanic is summarized, not demonstrated; we do not see the mapping process shape an inscription or choice. Setup is present, lyric reprise occurs, but no middle causal use. Swappable with "channeling emotions" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake anchor all three paragraphs and supply the central chamber with the crystal harp. The writer presses forehead to glass and later stands in the central chamber, so spatial use is present. Yet neither the spire's fragility nor the lake's stillness constrains a choice or alters outcome. Postcard description with moderate presence across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Before exhaustion hits" is declared in paragraph one but never tracked or enforced. The writer completes the task and slumps only after the symphony finishes—exhaustion arrives on cue without pressuring a single decision. No middle tightening, no visible cost tied to the clock. Ornamental urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The desire "to become the conductor of unheard symphonies" is stated as motivation and echoed in the ending. No on-page friction between this want and a competing need or fear; the harp responds, the symphony plays, the writer slumps in apparent success. Told without dramatized cost or choice. Setup and thematic closure presence, but no middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Upturned hush" is named once and reflected in the prose's elevated, quiet register throughout. The tone remains static—no modulation under pressure, no shift at the climax. The final image ("the horizon remained") sustains the hush, so closure linkage is present. Coherent but unvaried; does not charge the turn because no turn exists.</comment>
