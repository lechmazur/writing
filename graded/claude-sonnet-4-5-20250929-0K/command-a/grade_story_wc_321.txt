<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's "resiliently positive demeanor" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her interior life relies on stock phrases ("her mind racing," "her heart ached") and therapy-speak emotional labels without embodied specificity. The transient's warning and her response feel like a convenience dialogue exchange rather than a choice that reveals hierarchy of values. No visible cost attaches to her final "mission complete" stance; she collapses but smiles, flattening what should be a transformative ordeal into a reset.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Mara is beyond "deckhand," where exactly she stands in the grotto, and what "three nights prior" means in a world where "clocks run sideways" remain unclear past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The vanishing ferry premise is declared but never dramatized as a live problem Mara navigates on the page; she steps into the rift, emerges, and "resets time itself" through unexplained mechanics. Closure occurs (ferry restored, rift sealed) but the cost is asserted in a final paragraph summary rather than shown through a decisive choice or image that makes before/after legible. The hourglass "now filled with glowing sand" functions as a prop rather than a causal lever Mara pulls.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "spectral grotto under starlight" is described with atmospheric adjectives but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is vague: Mara stands "at the edge of the dock," then "the grotto's walls," then "into the rift," then "a dimly lit chamber" with no legible transitions or distances. The hourglass and radio are handled but their physical presence does not shape movement or cost. The Q2 Orientation Test penalty caps Q3 at 7.0, but execution issues independently lower the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore the ferry and save passengers—is declared early but never tested by a choice that narrows options. Mara's journey into the rift and "channeling energy" to reset time bypasses on-page escalation; no reversal or tightening choice alters her tactics. The transient's warning is deflected in one line with no cost. "Hours—or perhaps minutes" compresses what should be a crucible into summary, and the passengers' frozen state resolves through mechanics rather than Mara's agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of transience and endurance is stated explicitly ("some things endure") in the final paragraph rather than arising from image and choice. The hourglass, rift, and "interconnected patterns" are symbolic conveniences rather than particulars that charge a non-obvious question. Mara's "resiliently positive spirit unbroken" is a label that replaces earned complexity with tidy affirmation. No counter-reading or meaningful ambiguity; the ending mechanically ties resolution to a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts into elevated register ("ardent," "resiliently," "kaleidoscope of colors and sounds") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Mara's perceptual signature is generic; her way of noticing does not reflect a deckhand's idiom or lived experience. Dialogue with the transient is functional but carries no subtext or indirection. The phrase "her consciousness splintering" tells a state that should be rendered through fragmented perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "her eyes fixed on the horizon" and "stood at the edge of the dock" restate position without adding detail. Template cadence runs through the middle: "She felt herself stretched thin… she pressed on… she knew her mission was complete." Stock metaphors (kaleidoscope, starlight bathed) and therapy-speak ("her resiliently positive spirit") cluster in peak beats. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she believed," "she suspected") dull immediacy. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the closure image, applying −0.6 to −1.4 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Core premise—time rifts, vanishing ferry, merging timelines—is a widely used template of speculative rescue-mission plots without specific transformation through lived detail or world logic. The hourglass, patterns, and "channeling energy" mechanics are generic fantasy conveniences. Mara's archetype (resilient deckhand saves passengers) lacks a non-obvious angle or trade-off that would charge the synthesis. Transformation test fails: swap names and props, and the arc is unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and makes decisions (steps into rift, channels energy), but her choices do not create key turns—events happen to her or through her rather than because of her micro-choices under pressure. Her agency at closure is asserted ("her mission was complete") rather than shown through a decisive act that alters options. Introduced early, present at closure, but swappable with any determined rescuer archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hourglass appears in three beats: Mara holds it, hands it to the transient, uses it as a focal point at closure. Its "empty chambers" and later "filled with glowing sand" provide a visual reprise that reweights meaning. However, the mechanics of how it enables the reset are unexplained, and its presence feels convenient rather than causally essential. It constrains one choice (handing it to the transient) and shapes the closure image, but the cost of its use is not made specific on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The vanishing commuter ferry is the stated problem but never dramatized as a live constraint. Mara does not navigate the ferry's absence on the page; she steps into the rift and finds it intact in a frozen state. The concept shapes the premise but not the on-page tactics or choices. It is resolved through summary mechanics (time reset) rather than a choice that the concept forced.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is told in the opening and repeated at closure ("her resiliently positive spirit unbroken") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Mara's smile "never faltered" when warned, but this is assertion rather than a visible trade-off. The trait functions as a label rather than a lived contradiction that shapes her choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Mara raises the radio and calls the *Chronos* in one early beat; static crackles back with no reply. The action does not create a turn or alter her tactics; it is a setup that does not pay off. Easily swappable with any communication attempt. The radio does not appear at closure or shape the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Via interconnected patterns" is mentioned as Mara's method: she reads symbols on the grotto walls and memorizes patterns to navigate the rift. The method is signaled early and shapes her approach, but the mechanics remain vague and the patterns do not visibly constrain her choices or create friction. The method is functional but replaceable with any navigational system. It is present at closure ("patterns on the walls flared to life") but its causal role is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "spectral grotto under starlight" frames the opening and closing, and its walls with shifting symbols provide Mara's method. It does not, however, pressure choices or supply resources that alter tactics on the page. The setting is atmospheric but functionally replaceable with any mystical threshold. It is present at closure but as a static backdrop rather than an active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways" is declared and Mara's watch "ticked erratically," but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. Mara ignores her watch, and "hours—or perhaps minutes" compresses the rift journey into summary. The timeframe is mentioned but does not function as a live clock that alters her moves or raises cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to merge parallel timelines and restore the ferry" is stated early and drives her into the rift. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No friction between her want and a competing cost appears on the page; she pursues the goal without hesitation or trade-off. The motivation is functional but not tested by pressure that would reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" as tone is suggested through the grotto's shifting nature and the transient character, but the tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image in a specific way. The story's emotional register remains steady rather than crystallizing into a coherent tonal stance at closure. The tone is present but does not reweight the dominant stake with undeniable cost.</comment>
