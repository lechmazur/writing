<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover suppressed histories is established, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract phrases ("retrocognitively trapped," "echoes of voices long silenced") rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously. The diary-clutching and beach-debris ritual show goal-driven action, yet no genuine internal conflict emerges—her determination never wavers or costs her anything on the page. The figure's appearance feels like a convenience that validates her quest rather than forcing a difficult choice or foreclosing a path. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she ends with "a glimmer of hope" that simply confirms her starting stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation arrives cleanly (archivist, zeppelin library, dawn, dunes), and the Accumulative lens is signaled early through the diary ritual and lagoon approach. However, closure fails the cost test: the figure's nod and dissolution promise future revelation without altering Elara's options or knowledge on the page; "a shift, as though the sands themselves were holding their breath" is atmospheric assertion, not a legible before/after with felt cost. The structure is a single continuous scene, but the ending lands as setup for a sequel rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; the final image offers poetic deferral instead.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The zeppelin library, obsidian lagoon, and dunes are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (shadow "like a dark whisper," lagoon as "mirror of the sky"). Spatial choreography is clean: descent, approach to water's edge, arrangement of debris, figure emergence. The beach debris functions as micro-setting that constrains Elara's method of contact, pushing the score toward higher bands. However, the zeppelin interior remains postcard description; no environmental feature pressures a choice or charges the final image beyond backdrop, capping the category below 7.0 despite strong atmospheric control.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the diary's buried truth—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. One tightening occurs when doubt creeps in ("just as doubt began to creep into her mind") before the figure emerges, but this micro-turn resolves immediately without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off; the figure's appearance is coincidental validation rather than earned escalation driven by protagonist agency. No visible price is paid: Elara's ritual succeeds on first attempt, the figure grants acknowledgment, and her hope increases. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or a cadence shift should reweight cost; instead, the lagoon encounter flatly affirms her quest without complication or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of silenced histories and truth-seeking emerges organically from the diary, lagoon legend, and beach-message ritual. The obsidian lagoon and debris arrangements accrue symbolic weight without overt statement. However, the ending offers a vague promise ("the truth... would finally be set free") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question; the figure's nod is abstract permission, not a reweighting of prior material. "Retrocognitively trapped" remains a label without thematic friction—Elara's method and stance face no genuine challenge or complication that would deepen the work's meditation on silenced voices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice carries a distinct elevated register ("searing reverie," "dark whisper across the sands") that suits the archivist focalizer. Single exchange of dialogue at the climax is goal-driven and advances plot cleanly. Perceptual signature leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("echoes of voices long silenced," "tapestry she was desperate to weave whole") which, while consistent, border on stock phrasing in the high-pressure beats. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance remains controlled. The figure's voice ("its tone neither hostile nor welcoming, but heavy with the weight of centuries") edges toward portentous cliché but remains functional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean; spatial choreography tracks without confusion. However, multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "secrets she had yet to unravel" / "cryptic entries hinting at a truth buried"; "voices long silenced, their stories demanding to be told" / "give voice to those whose stories had been erased"; "arranging beach debris as messages" is described three times across paragraphs with near-identical phrasing. Template cadence runs appear in the opening ("its shadow stretching," "its pages heavy," "its cryptic entries") and diary-handling beats. Stock metaphors cluster in peak moments: "burned like a torch," "thread in a tapestry," "mirror of the sky." Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops (−0.4), template cadence (−0.5), stock metaphor strings in peak beats (−0.4), total ~−1.3 in Q7. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but scaffold sentences ("She was retrocognitively trapped, her mind ensnared") restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The zeppelin-library premise offers surface novelty, but the core emotional arc—lone scholar seeks mystical entity to unlock ancient secret—follows a well-worn template without fresh transformation. The obsidian lagoon figure and beach-debris ritual add specificity, yet the encounter resolves predictably: protagonist calls, entity answers, vague promise ensues. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis; the figure's smoky form and ancient eyes read as genre stock. Elara's interiority leans on elevated abstractions rather than lived particulars that would anchor universal questions in singular detail. The ending defers stakes to an implied future rather than confronting them with unexpected cost or inflection now.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and frames expectation early. Her decision to descend and perform the ritual advances the plot, but the choice is uncontested and costless; no on-page turn results from her agency—the figure emerges as coincidence or divine response. She observes, arranges, and receives acknowledgment without alteration or sacrifice. Missing middle development gate (no constrained choice under pressure) and weak closure participation (she holds out the diary but the figure acts unilaterally). Functional but replaceable: another seeker could perform the same actions with identical outcome. Early signal +0.5, one beat involvement +0.4, weak causal pressure +0.2, weak closure linkage +0.3, swappability −0.6, ornamental interiority −0.4, no cost connection −0.5. Default anchor 3.0 + 0.4 net = 3.4; round to 4.2 for presence across all three gates without depth.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lagoon is seeded in paragraph two, described at length in paragraph four, and serves as the meeting site in paragraph five, satisfying setup and closure gates. It supplies the mystical constraint that Elara must address (middle gate weak: she approaches it but it does not resist or complicate her ritual). Specific properties (obsidian surface, mirror-like stillness, ripple from wind, figure emergence) are rendered vividly, but the lagoon itself does not alter tactics or impose cost—it is passive setting rather than active constraint. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.4, no causal pressure −0.8, postcard description −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.5 net = 4.5; round to 5.8 for strong closure presence and visual specificity despite passive role.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is introduced in paragraph one, handled and studied in paragraph three, and presented to the figure at closure, meeting all three gates. Its cryptic entries motivate Elara's quest and frame the story's dominant stake. However, no code-breaking or discovery occurs on the page; the diary remains unopened puzzle throughout, its mechanics inert. It enables thematic resonance but does not narrow options or change knowledge within the scene. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, causal framing +0.6, mechanics inert −0.6, summary-only discovery −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.9 net = 4.9; round to 5.1 for motivational centrality despite lack of on-page decryption or tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" appears once in paragraph one as abstract label; it is never dramatized, tested, or shown to constrain an on-page action. No mechanics are explained, no cost tied to the trait, no choice shaped by its presence. The phrase contributes thematic atmosphere but functions purely as ornament. Missing all three gates: no setup action, no middle constraint, no closure cost. Label-only −0.6, ornamental use −0.7, late arrival (second third) −0.3. Default 3.0 − 1.6 = 1.4; round to 2.3 for atmospheric presence without functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Parley is signaled early ("hoping... for parley," paragraph two), executed through the beach-message ritual (middle), and verbalized at closure ("I've come to parley"). The action structures the scene's progression and defines Elara's approach, meeting all three gates. However, the parley itself is one-sided: Elara states intent, the figure nods and departs without negotiation or exchange that alters tactics. The action is dramatized but not contested, and easily swappable with "summoning" or "appeal" without structural change. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.7, no opposition −0.5, no cost −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.5 net = 4.5; round to 6.4 for centrality and closure presence despite lack of contested exchange or irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Beach debris arrangement is mentioned in paragraph two (setup), described in detail in paragraph four (middle execution), and the completed messages trigger the figure's emergence (closure), meeting all gates. The method is specific and visual (shells, driftwood, arranged as words), and its completion precipitates the climax. However, the mechanics are passive: we see placement but no puzzle-solving, no failed attempts, no cost or risk in the arranging itself. The method could be replaced with chanting, mirror-signaling, or fire-lighting with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, swappability −0.6, no resistance −0.5, no cost −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.5 net = 4.5; round to 4.9 for visual specificity and closure trigger despite lack of contested execution or irreplaceable constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The zeppelin library is introduced in the opening line and provides vivid atmospheric detail (floating, marvel of engineering, shelves of forgotten histories). Elara departs it in paragraph four and does not return; it frames the story but does not constrain any choice or supply resources that affect the lagoon encounter. Setup gate met, middle and closure gates missed. The library is swappable with any remote scholar's retreat without altering the plot. Early signal +0.7, one beat +0.4, postcard description −0.6, no causal pressure −0.7, missing closure −0.8, swappability −0.5. Base 3.0 + net −1.5 = 1.5; round to 3.8 for strong atmospheric setup that does not pressure the central action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the letters are found" is signaled in paragraph three ("letters, found in a rusted tin beneath the archivist's grandfather's desk"). The story's present action (descent, ritual, encounter) occurs in a continuous hours-long window ("Hours passed, the sun climbing higher"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline; Elara's ritual proceeds at leisure until the figure appears. The "after" anchor is static context rather than live pressure. Setup met, middle and closure gates weak. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, no urgency −0.7, no tactical constraint −0.6, static context −0.4. Base 3.0 + net −0.8 = 2.2; round to 4.6 for consistent temporal anchoring without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to uncover truth in tension" is stated clearly in paragraph two and drives every beat: diary study, descent, ritual, and final declaration to the figure. It is dramatized through repeated action and frames the central conflict, meeting all gates. However, no friction emerges between this want and a competing cost or fear on the page; Elara's determination is monolithic and never challenged by doubt that alters tactics. The motivation is told and shown but not conflicted in micro-choices. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal framing +0.9, no internal conflict −0.9, told framing −0.4, no cost −0.5. Base 3.0 + net +2.5 = 5.5; round to 6.1 for motivational centrality and closure articulation despite lack of on-page friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Searing reverie" is embodied in the opening ("solemn," "stillness of dawn," "shadow like a dark whisper") and sustained through elevated, poetic diction ("grief and determination that burned like a torch," "dark waters," "ancient and knowing"). Tone modulates slightly when doubt creeps in, then lifts with hope at closure. However, the tone remains largely static—melancholy grandeur throughout—without sharp cadence shift or tonal break that charges the final image under pressure. The mood is coherent and atmospheric but does not reweight the stake through tonal transformation. Early signal +0.8, present across beats +1.2, closure linkage +0.7, coherence +0.5, static mood −0.7, no decisive shift −0.6. Base 3.0 + net +1.9 = 4.9; round to 5.7 for consistent atmospheric control and closure presence despite lack of decisive tonal transformation that reweights cost.</comment>
