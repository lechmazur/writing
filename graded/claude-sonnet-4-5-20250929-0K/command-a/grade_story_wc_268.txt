<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to unmask the pretender is declared but her internal contradiction or hierarchy of values never surfaces under pressure. The pretender's final collapse feels unmotivated—no prior scene shows Elara constraining their options through specific choices, only vague messaging. The confrontation resolves via a symbolic gesture (the ink pellet) rather than earned character cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her heart quickened") without embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. The closure unit—pretender's facade cracks when handed the pellet—lacks visible cost to Elara; the pretender's capitulation is asserted, not dramatized through prior narrowing of options. The causal lens is attempted but key turns (pretender finds messages, responds, appears in person) occur off-page or via summary, breaking because/therefore linkage. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence at closure shows Elara forfeiting or risking something tangible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The library setting provides vivid sensory anchors (dust in light, humming stones) but remains postcard-level—Elara never uses spatial layout or book proximity to constrain a tactical choice. The iron gall ink pellet is named but not handled with tactile specificity until the final beat. Micro-setting potential (books, ink, rune carvings) is described rather than integrated into choice architecture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unmask pretender) is signaled early but pressure never tightens through on-page reversals—messages are left, pretender responds off-page, then appears. No live option is foreclosed; the pretender's arrival and confession are convenience plot. The ending's symbolic gesture (pellet pressed into hand) substitutes for escalation. Escalation by lens (Causal) requires narrowing options; here, the climax summarizes capitulation without showing the tactical cost or bind.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus deception is announced rather than emerging from particulars. The rune of drift functions as a label; no scene shows it constraining Elara's method or reweighting the pretender's tactics. The final image ("graceful collapse of the old order") is abstract moralizing rather than a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in the pretender's annotations ("The drift is not mine alone") hints at complexity but is never paid off in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization remains stable. Psychic distance is consistent but generic—perceptual signature is absent (Elara notices "dust," "stones," "constellations" without character-specific bias). Dialogue appears only in the climax; the pretender's "You think you can unmask me?" and Elara's "I don't think, I know" sound interchangeable and thesis-driven. Prose rhythm is uniform; no modulation under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary adequately. Paraphrase loops appear: "The pretender...had woven lies" / "she would tear apart the pretender's illusions" recycle the same claim across paragraphs. Stock metaphors cluster without grounding: "shadow cast by a false light," "tapestry of truth," "weight of centuries" (three instances). Figurative density in the climax paragraph ("frailty," "whisper that carried the weight of centuries") obscures physical action. No filter-verb stacks, but template cadence in middle paragraphs ("Her first message...She knew...She carved") applies −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Core premise (secret messages to unmask a pretender) is functional but echoes familiar espionage/detective templates without fresh angle. The rune of drift, iron gall ink, and "regally unpretentious" cloak are ornamental rather than transformed through lived detail. The climax's symbolic pellet-press gesture substitutes for earned specificity. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara ("diminutive titan") is named and described but her stature never constrains a tactic or enables a surprising choice. Present in all beats but observational; the pellet-press gesture is symbolic, not a decision with visible cost tied to her specific attributes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Iron gall ink pellet is introduced early (paragraph 2), used to write messages (one beat), and appears in the climax gesture. Two beats, but the climax use is ornamental (pressed into hand) rather than causal—removing it would not break the confrontation's logic. Swappable with any symbolic token.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Rune of drift is introduced early, carved into book spines, and mentioned at closure ("now marked a new beginning"). Two beats, but it never narrows Elara's tactical options or forces the pretender's response. Functions as thematic label rather than plot constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" appears twice—describing the pretender's attire and Elara at the end. Label-only; no scene shows the trait enabling or constraining a choice. Could be removed without altering any beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears once as Elara's internal vow ("she would tear apart...sunder their hold") and is claimed fulfilled at closure. The action is asserted rather than dramatized—no on-page beat shows Elara severing a specific link or option. Summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cryptic messages in library books are introduced early, drive the middle sequence (messages left, pretender responds), and the final confrontation hinges on the messaging duel. Three beats; method shapes attempts. Cap at 5.9: the mechanics are vague (how does Elara know which books the pretender will find?) and the climax abandons the method for a symbolic gesture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Ancient temple library is anchored early with vivid detail (crumbling tomes, shifting light) and present across all beats. Two gates (setup, payoff cameo). But the library never constrains Elara's movement or supplies a resource that alters the outcome—postcard setting. Could transplant to any archive without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Across the pause of shifting constellations" frames the mission and is mentioned twice more ("constellations shifted," "stars seemed to pause"). Atmospheric but never tightens a deadline or alters Elara's tactics. Time remains vague; no live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation (unmask pretender) is stated early, drives all beats, and is claimed fulfilled at closure. Three gates. But the desire is never conflicted—no friction between Elara's want and a competing cost. The stake is told rather than tested in a choice that forfeits something tangible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Graceful collapse" is named at closure ("graceful collapse of the old order") and fits the climax's symbolic tone (pellet clatters, facade cracks). One beat. The tone is asserted rather than charged through rhythm or image—removing the phrase would not alter the scene's texture. Ornamental.</comment>
