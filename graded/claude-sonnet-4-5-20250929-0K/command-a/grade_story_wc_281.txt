<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("affection for humanity," "skepticism was her shield") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The night-long work montage tells us she moves with "somatic markers of intuition and memory" but never dramatizes a micro-choice under pressure where cost is visible. Emotional states are labeled ("unease," "hope") without embodied contradiction; the geode becomes a passive talisman rather than a decision point. The final smile and determination arrive without foreclosing a live option or revealing a hierarchy of values through conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph, satisfying the test. However, closure lacks a decisive change with visible cost: Elara completes her light painting and feels "willowglass hope," but no prior option is foreclosed, no tactic altered, no knowledge shifted. The montage structure ("She worked through the night") compresses the creative act into summary, leaving no on-page reversal or deepening that narrows her choices. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending offers reassurance without reweighting the telepathy-pill premise or her skepticism with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The light painting studio supplies adjustable LEDs, mirrors, cameras, and the geode placement, grounding the spatial work. The geode's "fractally precise edges" and reflective setup are vivid but remain postcard details; no environmental constraint alters Elara's creative choices or complicates her access. Spatial choreography is coherent, yet the studio functions as backdrop rather than pressuring tactics or charging the closure image, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to illuminate… what had gone wrong"—is declared early but never tested by opposition or trade-off. Elara's night-long assembly proceeds without friction, failed attempts, or a visible price that forecloses an alternative approach. The "jagged edges where thoughts had been severed" and "glowing threads that could be rewoven" are observed in the finished painting, not dramatized as a choice under pressure. No reversal or deepening occurs; the resolution is aesthetic achievement without agency-driven escalation or felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of fragility and resilience emerges through the geode metaphor and light-painting imagery, yet the story states rather than earns its insights: "even in brokenness, there was beauty to be found" and "after the doubt, she had found her way forward" are direct thesis statements in the final paragraph. The telepathy-pill recall remains abstract social backdrop; no specific event or character calculus tests the premise. The geode recurs but as symbol rather than a particular that reweights prior material, and the ending's "one light painting at a time" reads as platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register ("ethereal hum," "willowglass hope," "fractally precise"), but elevated phrasing often floats above embodied perception: "somatic markers of intuition and memory" and "visual exploration of the pathways" read more like thematic shorthand than Elara's lived texture under stress. Perceptual signature is underdeveloped; the geode and studio are described generically rather than filtered through her artist's priorities. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "She had always been drawn to the unseen, the unspoken, the hidden pathways" mirrors "unseen… unspoken… hidden" in adjacent beats; "her skepticism was her shield, but her affection for humanity was her compass" and "her affection… had guided her, her skepticism had sharpened her focus" recycle the same metaphor pair. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to whisper," "seemed to pulse," "felt like a key") dull immediacy. Stock phrases ("soft luminescence," "tapestry of blues and silvers," "one light painting at a time") and the thematic-echo ending ("fractally precise beauty of the unseen") flatten the closure beat. Accumulated artifact penalties apply: −1.4 for loops, template stems, and metaphor recycling across pivotal beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—artist responds to telepathy-pill recall by creating symbolic light painting—follows a familiar artist-as-healer template without transforming it through lived detail or non-obvious calculus. The geode, somatic markers, and "fractally precise" modifier are prompt elements inserted ornamentally rather than synthesized into a singular vision. The "map… visual exploration of the pathways" and "call to action" are abstract declarations; no specific inflection or risk-taking distinguishes this from workshop boilerplate. The ending's "one light painting at a time" and "guided by the fractally precise beauty of the unseen" echo the opening without fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara is labeled "affectionate skeptic" in paragraph one and her skepticism/affection pair is restated in paragraphs two and four, but these traits do not drive on-page choices with visible cost. She observes the geode, adjusts equipment, and completes the painting without friction or a moment where skepticism conflicts with affection to alter tactics. The character functions as vessel for thematic commentary rather than agent whose decisions create turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The muscovite geode sliver appears in all four paragraphs: found (para 1), pressed to chest (para 2), placed at composition center (para 3), glowing in hand at closure (para 4). However, its role remains symbolic anchor rather than causal tool—it does not constrain a choice, enable a tactic, or return with reweighted cost. The object is handled but not used to solve a problem or test a hypothesis; removing it would require only minor edits to metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The telepathy pill recall is mentioned twice (paragraphs 1 and 4) as social backdrop that "haunted her" and whose "fractures" she visualizes in the painting. It frames thematic concern but does not shape on-page stakes: Elara neither assists recall victims, debates intervention, nor risks resources tied to the crisis. The concept remains echo rather than tactical constraint or decision point.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" modifies the geode's edges (para 1), Elara's movements (para 3), and the ending's "beauty of the unseen" (para 4). The attribute is descriptive label without mechanical consequence—no scene demonstrates how fractal precision enables her light-painting technique or imposes a tradeoff. Swappable with "intricate" or "meticulous" with no structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Devise" appears in paragraph one as Elara's intent to "devise a way to understand… what had gone wrong." Paragraph three shows her devising the light-painting setup (cameras, mirrors, geode placement). The action frames the central creative project and occupies the story's middle, but the devising itself is summarized montage without friction, failed drafts, or cost that narrows options. One major beat involvement; causal role is functional but thin.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Somatic markers" are named twice (paragraphs 2 and 3) as her method: "through somatic markers… she began to piece together a plan" and "her body moving through somatic markers of intuition and memory." The mechanics are never shown—no scene demonstrates how bodily response guides a specific creative choice or differs from ordinary intuition. The phrase functions as thematic ornament; removing it would require only synonym edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The light painting studio is anchored early (paragraph 1) and supplies LEDs, mirrors, cameras, and the space for night-long work (paragraphs 2–3). It provides resources and coherent spatial choreography. However, the studio does not constrain access, complicate her process, or supply a micro-setting detail that alters tactics—any artist workspace would serve. Present across all paragraphs and integral to the concept, but postcard rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the static shock" anchors the opening and recurs in the final sentence ("After the static shock, after the recall, after the doubt"). Paragraph three notes "she worked through the night" and paragraph four opens "By dawn," establishing elapsed time. The timeframe provides sequence but does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure or irreversible window forces her hand. Two-gate presence (setup, closure reprise) with no middle development; lyric callback without tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden pathways" is declared in paragraph one as her need and recurs in paragraph four's reflection: "she had illuminated a hidden pathway, one that others could follow." The motivation frames her creative intent and appears at closure, but it is never dramatized as conflicted choice where illuminating competes with another want or exacts a trade-off. Told twice; no friction between desire and cost visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope—fragile yet unyielding" is named once in the penultimate paragraph and implicitly carried in the final "small, determined smile" and forward-planning stance. The coinage is apt but arrives late and remains tonal assertion rather than modulating through pressure. The piece maintains steady lyric-philosophical register from opening to close without cadence shift or tonal deepening that charges the final image with cost.</comment>
