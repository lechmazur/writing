<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's core trait (tasting memories) is vividly established but never drives an on-page choice under pressure; it remains atmospheric texture. Internal contradiction appears only in the "no room for bitterness" moment, which reads as self-instruction rather than simultaneous impulse conflict. The climactic fruit harvest floods her with memories, yet no micro-choice emerges—she follows a predetermined plan (divide and plant) without visible cost or foreclosed alternative. The final image shows outcomes but no dramatized renunciation or trade-off that tests her values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (who, where, when). The story teaches an Accumulative lens through cosmic-alignment framing and weeks of tending, but closure deflates into summary: "By morning's light...twenty tiny knowledge fruit sprouts" lists outcomes without a decisive image that reweights prior material or imposes felt cost. The "didn't consume the fruit herself" moment gestures toward sacrifice but is told, not shown, and the final paragraph drifts into thematic assertion ("already savoring the future flavors") rather than a charged image. No meaningful tightening occurs; the alignment concludes off-page and the protagonist executes a plan without friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vividly anchored (hanging pans, glass ceiling, nutrient soil) and the cosmic energy "singing softly with the cosmic energy" provides atmospheric specificity. The glass walls and scattered tools recur, but they do not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara's actions proceed unimpeded. The final morning light and surrounding sprouts charge the ending image slightly, lifting the score into mid-band, but the environment remains more backdrop than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating beauty from ruins via the knowledge fruit—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation unfolds through weeks of tending and the plant's growth, but the sequence reads as steady progress without a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The pruning paragraph gestures toward choice ("cuts healed instantly") but imposes no visible cost; branches dissolve into light without consequence. The final distribution of seeds completes the plan without on-page friction or trade-off, leaving the closure image declarative rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "gentle rebellion" theme is declared explicitly throughout ("gentle rebellion—not against what had broken the world, but against acceptance of its brokenness") rather than emerging from scene particulars. The final paragraph shifts into meta-commentary ("a quiet determination to grow what came next") and overt moralizing ("already savoring the future flavors") that replaces dramatized resonance. The knowledge fruit's "miniature galaxy" risks symbolic convenience without prior grounding, and the ending resolves into a thesis statement rather than a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("ghost-tastes of wilted herbs," "pulsed with a gentle warmth"), though several lines drift toward elevated register ("embodying her philosophy of resilience without hardness"). The sparse dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Register wobbles slightly in peak beats ("synaptic plasticity to shape what would grow" reads clinical mid-crisis), and the final paragraph's "already savoring the future flavors" tilts toward summary rather than immediate perception, but these slips remain minor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm and vivid imagery ("iridescent light that shifted in response to Elara's emotional state"). However, the story suffers from moderate paraphrase loops: the greenhouse as sanctuary/rebellion is restated across multiple paragraphs, and the plant's growth is recounted in adjacent sentences with synonym churn ("emerged...unfurled...grown"). The pruning sequence contains template cadence ("With each careful cut...The cuts healed instantly...the plant's structure becoming"). Figurative density is high in non-peak beats ("dissolved into light that joined the growing chorus of cosmic resonance") without clear pattern-teaching, triggering the overwriting check. The final paragraph stacks abstract claims rather than concrete propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—chef who tastes memories plants a knowledge fruit during cosmic alignment using synaptic plasticity—synthesizes several speculative elements but trends toward genre template (magical seed + rare event + mental technique). Emotional specificity is present (grandmother's cinnamon bread, taste-memories) yet the arc follows a predictable prosperity curve without surprise or reversal. The "gentle rebellion" frame and the twenty-sprout ending read as thesis fulfillment rather than an earned, non-obvious turn. Transformation test: the plot and emotional arc could function largely unchanged with different surface details (e.g., musician who hears echoes, artist who sees auras).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Chef-with-memory-tasting appears early and is vividly rendered (tasting laughter, curiosity, hope in the final fruit), but it remains observational. The trait does not drive a key turn or force a difficult choice; Elara's decisions (plant, prune, divide) would proceed identically if she were simply a skilled gardener. Swappable with minor edits; the memory-tasting enriches atmosphere without altering stakes or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit seed is handled across multiple beats: held in the opening, planted with focus, sprouts and grows through weeks of tending, harvested at climax, divided and replanted in the ending. It shapes the escalation arc and appears in the final image ("twenty tiny knowledge fruit sprouts"). However, its properties (responding to emotional state, dissolving pruned branches into light) feel convenient rather than constraining—Elara never struggles against the seed's nature or pays a specific cost tied to its unique mechanics. Present in setup, development, and closure, but lacks the specificity or cost linkage for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Gentle rebellion is stated explicitly as theme ("gentle rebellion—not against what had broken the world, but against acceptance of its brokenness") and echoed in the ending, but it does not shape on-page tactics or create a dilemma. The rebellion manifests as patient gardening without friction, opposition, or visible cost. Told as concept rather than dramatized through competing impulses or trade-offs. Functional but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Informally wise, having learned more from the ghost-tastes of wilted herbs than any textbook could teach" is stated in paragraph one but never constrains or enables a choice. The trait remains label-only; no on-page moment shows this informal wisdom guiding a decision under pressure or imposing a cost. Present but decorative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Pruning appears in week three as a distinct beat ("The time had come to prune...With each careful cut, Elara focused on memories...The cuts healed instantly, the plant's structure becoming stronger yet more delicate"). It demonstrates Elara's disciplined shaping and reinforces the gentle-rebellion theme. However, the action is frictionless—no risk, no misstep, no visible cost—and could be replaced with another nurturing action (watering, staking, transplanting) without structural impact. Shapes one middle beat but lacks the causal pressure or closure linkage for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Synaptic plasticity is named and explained in the planting beat ("working through synaptic plasticity to shape what would grow...carefully controlling her own neural pathways") and referenced again during pruning ("neuroreorganization"). The method is present across two beats, but its mechanics remain summary-told rather than dramatized with cost or constraint. Elara's mental discipline never falters or requires trade-offs; the technique functions as a convenient tool rather than a shaping pressure. Functional but swappable with "meditation," "focused intention," or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is anchored vividly in the opening and recurs throughout (glass ceiling, hanging pans, nutrient soil, cosmic energy singing through the walls). It provides the frame for all action and supplies the "decades of patient waiting" memories that flood Elara at harvest. The setting shapes the accumulative lens and charges the final image ("surrounded by twenty tiny knowledge fruit sprouts"). However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a tactical cost; the greenhouse is more crucible than obstacle. Strong setup and closure participation, but lacks mid-beat pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The celestial alignment is signaled early ("occurred only once every two centuries...all seven planets would trace a perfect arc"), provides the catalyst for the seed's amplified growth, and frames the three-week escalation ("As the third week began...On the final night of the alignment, the first fruit appeared"). The timeframe tightens the action window and by morning's close the planets separate, but no on-page scene shows Elara racing the clock or making a time-pressured choice. The alignment enables rather than constrains. Present in setup, development, and closure, but lacks urgent pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To create something beautiful from the ruins" is stated in the opening ("We'll make something of the ruins yet") and restated in the ending. The motivation drives Elara's overall plan but is not dramatized in conflict—no moment where she must choose between beauty and another need, or where the desire for beauty imposes a cost. The friction is external (barren world) rather than internal (competing wants). Functional but lacks the on-page dilemma or trade-off for mid-band.</comment>
