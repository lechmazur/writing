<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prophet's interiority is poetic but distant—we observe their ritual actions without internal contradiction or pressure-tested choices. Motivation ("to turn obstacles into instruments") is stated rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The transformation process lacks embodied struggle; the prophet performs flawlessly without visible cost or genuine friction between want and execution. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—who the prophet is, why this matters now, and what's at stake remain abstract through most of the text. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but never tightens or deepens meaningfully; the final image ("already composing") returns to the opening state without reweighting options or stakes. No visible cost forecloses a path; the prophet's stance at closure is identical to the start, creating stasis without earned pressure or conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating orchard and saltwater-adapted trees are vividly specific, and the hollow fruit functions as instrument. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the setting never constrains a choice—the prophet moves freely through an accommodating environment. The blue hour timeframe and cloud movements remain atmospheric rather than pressuring tactics or the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled early or tested on the page. The prophet faces no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and encounters no reversal. The text describes a process (making music) without escalation—each action succeeds smoothly. "Obstacles" are mentioned thematically but none appear on the page to narrow options or force a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of transformation and survival-as-art emerges clearly through recurring imagery (fruit, driftwood, waves). However, the final paragraph lapses into direct thematic statement: "they read the future and then, mallet in hand, they played it" and "that was what prophets of the leeward tide did" openly moralize. The resonance is asserted rather than embodied in a charged final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrical but tonally uniform—diction remains elevated even during described physical actions. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "could hear") appear frequently. The prophet's perceptual signature is generic elevated-poetic rather than character-specific. Psychic distance never modulates; the narrator maintains the same register and certainty throughout, reducing immediacy during what should be high-engagement moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence throughout: "Each obstacle found its note, each challenge its rhythm, each impossibility its harmony" mirrors earlier "part prayer, part rebellion, part mathematics"; "whether storms or stillescence, whether the floating circle would spin or drift" and similar structures recur mechanically. Stock metaphors ("cosmic sonic origami," "mathematics of the impossible") cluster without earned specificity. Information density is low—multiple sentences restate transformation without advancing scene pressure. These artifacts pervade the closure paragraph, disqualifying 9+ globally and triggering −1.4 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The floating orchard and musical prophet premise is imaginative but executed through familiar lyric-essay patterns. The transformation-of-obstacles theme is stated repeatedly rather than tested through specific dramatized friction. No turn or reweighting arises from character choice; the piece cycles through variations on the same idea. The closure returns to the opening without fresh inflection or earned insight.</comment>
