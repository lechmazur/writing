<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The medium's motivation is stated but never dramatized through on-page choice under pressure—she performs a ritual procedure without meaningful internal conflict or trade-off. Interiority relies on generic mystical phrasing ("fierce tenderness," "weight of its purpose") rather than character-particular thought. The emotional arc is entirely smooth: she arrives, performs, achieves closure, leaves—no contradictory impulses, no cost to her stance. The piece tells us she "needed to understand" but never shows what understanding costs or changes in her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the shard warms, spirits crescendo, words form in condensation—but no action narrows options or creates a fork. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who/where/when by the second paragraph). Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (the apology released, "peace" achieved), but the cost is abstract: we see no price paid by the medium, no path foreclosed, only atmospheric resolution. The "moment before deciding" promised in the timeframe never materializes as an on-page choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is vividly rendered with skeletal roots, brackish water, and salt-laced air; sensory details are selective and support the mystical tone. The shard's physical warmth and the condensation mechanism give tactile specificity. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—the medium moves freely, the spirits guide without friction, and the moonlight clearing appears exactly when needed. The setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>No escalation under any lens: the medium enters, the shard responds, words appear, closure arrives—each step facilitated rather than resisted. The dominant stake (evoking an unspoken apology) is declared but never tested; no decision point asks what she will sacrifice or risk. The "unsent letters" belong to an absent lover, so the protagonist has no agency in their resolution. Coincidence provides: the spirits guide, the moonlight pierces at the needed moment, the shard fulfills its purpose without cost to her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of unspoken regret and the weight of silence emerges through image (condensation words, gargoyle shard as witness). The final paragraph moralizes lightly ("fierce tenderness do") but the particulars—apology, mangrove, shard—carry symbolic weight. However, the medium herself has no thematic stake: she facilitates someone else's resolution without confronting her own unspoken words or choices. The piece gestures at complexity (love vs. pride) but resolves it tidily without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with mystical idiom ("liminal," "stitched into the fabric of what could have been"). Psychic distance remains consistent. However, voice lacks character-particular texture—"fierce tenderness," "salt-laced air," "the weight of the moment lifting" read as ornamental rather than filtering through a distinct perceptual signature. The medium's professional expertise (mediumship) is asserted but not embodied in her thinking or tactical adjustments. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Density is low: multiple sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation ("The singing spirits harmonized… as if encouraging her quest" / "The singing spirits crescendoed, their song now a fierce tenderness, urging her forward"). Template cadence appears in the shard's beats: "The shard began to pulse… The shard glowed… The shard warmed again… she held the shard aloft." Stock mystical phrasing ("older than memory," "fierce tenderness" repeated) and filter-verb stacks ("she knew," "she stepped," "she pressed") dull immediacy. Paraphrase loop in the final two paragraphs: peace/release/closure restated without new detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Core premise (medium evokes unspoken apology via mystical shard and condensation messages) is functional but derivative of countless "spiritual guide resolves past trauma" templates. The mangrove/singing spirits/gargoyle shard combination feels assembled from a prompt checklist rather than organically unified. No turn or cost arises from character choice; the resolution is atmospherically delivered rather than earned. The emotional particulars (pride, fear, regret) remain generic; the absent lover's words could apply to any breakup.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The cryptic medium is present throughout and performs the ritual, but makes no decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path—she executes a procedure without friction. Observation dominates; she witnesses the words form and holds the shard aloft. Late first third setup, two functional beats (pressing shard to leaf, holding it in moonlight), no closure choice or cost. Swappable with "spiritual guide" or "shaman" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gargoyle's rainspout shard appears early (second paragraph), is handled in three beats (pocket warmth, pressed to leaf, held in moonlight), and its thematic link to watching/thresholds is explained. It enables the evocation and "heals" in moonlight at closure. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost—it simply works when used. The "stony violence now a vessel for healing" moment shifts meaning but remains told rather than dramatized. Slightly above functional due to reprise and multi-beat presence, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Unsent letters appear as the story's central image: condensation words forming on leaves are the visible manifestation of unspoken apology. Signaled early ("apology waited unspoken"), developed across multiple beats (words appear, cascade, dissolve), and directly shape the closure ("apology finally found its voice"). The concept drives the structure and stakes; removing it breaks the premise. Cost is atmospheric rather than protagonist-driven, preventing a higher score, but integration is strong across setup/development/payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The "heals in moonlight" attribute is mentioned twice (mid-story assertion, final moonlight clearing) and appears to enable closure—but the mechanics remain vague and the healing is cosmetic (the shard "began to heal, knitting together the fractures of the past it had witnessed"). No visible cost or constraint tied to needing moonlight; the medium simply moves to where moonlight is available. The attribute resolves a problem it did not create and could be cut with minor plot edits. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Evoke" is the story's inciting action—the medium whispers it, triggering the shard's glow and the appearance of condensation words. Present in setup (the quest "to evoke something unresolved"), executed at midpoint (the whispered command), and implicit at closure (the apology evoked and released). Two beats of direct involvement, causal linkage to the words appearing. However, the action itself is passive ritual performance rather than a difficult choice, and swapping "evoke" for "summon" or "call forth" would not alter structure. Solid integration but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Messages in condensation on windows/leaves are signaled early ("condensation forming words"), demonstrated across three beats (leaf words, curved leaf as windowpane, cascading words on surrounding leaves), and provide the visible text of the apology that drives closure. The mechanism is specific and recurring; removing it collapses the method of revelation. The "windowpane" image ties explicitly to the prompt. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, though the medium does not wrestle with the method's limits or costs.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is established early with vivid detail (skeletal roots, brackish water) and the singing spirits are present throughout as atmospheric chorus. The setting provides the ritual space and the spirits "guide" the medium to the moonlight clearing. However, the labyrinth does not constrain or pressure—it facilitates. The medium moves freely, the spirits encourage rather than oppose, and the needed moonlight appears when required. Functional setting with thematic resonance (liminal space, prison of possibilities) but not indispensable to choice or cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the space where an apology waits unspoken" is thematic rather than temporal—it describes a liminal emotional state, not a ticking clock. The story unfolds in continuous present action with no deadline or time pressure that alters tactics. The phrase appears in the opening and is restated metaphorically but does not tighten decisions. Swappable with "a moment suspended in time" or similar abstractions. Present as theme, absent as functional constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the moment before deciding" is declared early ("she needed to understand the fork in the path") but never dramatized—the medium does not face a decision, only facilitates someone else's. The phrase reappears in the abstract ("the moment before deciding") but the medium herself is never shown before or after a consequential choice. The motivation explains her quest but does not create on-page friction between wants and costs. Functional setup, weak payoff, no cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Fierce tenderness" is named three times and asserted as the spirits' quality and the story's emotional register. However, the tone itself is consistently soft, mystical, and facilitative—no fierceness (struggle, resistance, sharpness) appears in action. The phrase functions as a label rather than an embodied modulation. The ending is gentle release without fierce cost. Present as thematic claim, absent as tonal pressure that charges the closure.</comment>
