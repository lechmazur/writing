<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's internal life consists almost entirely of abstract philosophical framing ("functionally creative nature," "stoic wonder," "equations for hope") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The sextant piece and water system provide tactile anchors, but her decisions—turning a valve, tracing lines—never reveal competing impulses or a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The ending gesture (slipping the sextant into her pocket) reads as symbolic closure rather than a choice that forecloses a live path. Diagnostic label-speak ("curious civil engineer mind," "functionally creative") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("stoic wonder") flatten interiority at key beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: the reader learns "abandoned spaceport terminal" in the opening line but "after the carnival left town" arrives as metaphor rather than literal timeframe, causing brief disorientation (−0.3 per Orientation Test). The closure unit—water flowing through channels to create "equations for hope"—lands as Conceptual Repricing, but the conceptual cost is asserted rather than dramatized; the story declares transformation without showing what Elara risks or loses. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern layering toward a resonant image), but the final image recycles prior abstractions ("maze of intentions," "threshold") without reweighting them through a concrete before/after change. No visible cost at closure; the terminal "hums," but Elara's options and the world's state remain unchanged on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The hydroponics bay—dry pipes, dust, rust-scented water—grounds the middle sequence and constrains Elara's work (she must redirect flows through dormant infrastructure). The sextant piece as micro-object charges the final beat by serving as both tool and anchor. Spatial choreography (terminal, concourse, hydroponics bay) tracks cleanly. However, "after the carnival left town" functions as abstract metaphor rather than a concrete timeframe or location detail, and the "phantom destinations" on departure boards remain decorative. The setting pressures one key turn (opening the valve, redirecting water) and returns at closure, satisfying two of three gates and reaching mid-6s on specificity and constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to "resurrect something" and "puzzle out new equations for hope"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the valve resists then opens, releasing water; this reversal alters tactics (she redirects the flow through channels). However, the resolution costs Elara nothing on the page: the water flows, the patterns resolve, and she slips the sextant into her pocket without forfeiting an alternative or paying a visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight; here it plateaus after the valve turn. No competing option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme—hope engineered from decay—is declared repeatedly ("equations for hope," "testament to the idea that even in abandonment, there was a purpose") rather than emerging from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "a proof that hope could be engineered, one redirected flow at a time." This violates the no-moralizing rule and triggers −0.6 in Q5 for theme summary replacing scene pressure. The sextant piece and water channels offer concrete anchors, but the story leverages them for symbolic freight rather than dramatic irony or earned insight. No counter-reading is invited; the text insists on a single interpretation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("stoic wonder," "functionally creative nature," "labyrinth of forgotten dreams") that reads more like authorial commentary than Elara's engineering idiom. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she intended," "she watched") cluster in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. The prose attempts a lyric register but the vocabulary—"mausoleum of forgotten journeys," "humble navigator"—feels imported rather than voice-particular. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is weak; Elara notices in generic poet-engineer mode rather than through a selective, biased lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template cadence dominates the middle: "She worked silently… She redirected it… The water flowed, then pooled, then began to creep… Elara watched… She placed it… Elara stood… She smiled… Elara picked up." Paraphrase loops recur: "maze of intentions" appears five times; "stoic wonder" thrice; "functionally creative" twice. Stock metaphors abound: "ghost of its own former joy," "last heartbeat of a bygone era," "ashes," "threshold." Applying the artifact penalty pack: template stems (−0.6), paraphrase loops (−0.4), stock metaphor strings (−0.4) cumulate to −1.4 in Q7, with artifacts touching the closure beat (final paragraph recycles "maze," "threshold," "humble navigator"), which triggers disallowance of 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—abandoned infrastructure resurrected via water—offers potential freshness, but the execution relies on generic lyric tropes: the lone engineer, the symbolic relic, equations as metaphor for hope. "Stoic wonder" and "maze of intentions" function as prompt-adjacent labels rather than transformed particulars. The sextant piece's shift from navigation tool to symbolic key feels ornamental rather than causally rooted. The final image (water flows, terminal hums, sextant pocketed) could transpose to any ruin-redemption narrative with minor edits. No bold risk elevates the frame; the story retreats into abstraction rather than committing to the engineering puzzle or the emotional cost of solitary work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout but her engineer role is label-only; her key choices—tracing lines, turning a valve, redirecting water—do not require engineering expertise or "curiosity." Any restorer could perform these actions. She makes one consequential decision (opening the valve) that alters tactics, earning ~5.0 for beat involvement. However, "curious" and "functionally creative" are asserted traits without on-page demonstration of how they constrain or enable her moves. Missing middle development (no choice where curiosity or engineering uniquely matters) caps at 3.4, but the valve turn lifts slightly. Swappability and label-only usage apply −0.8 cumulative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sextant piece is present in paragraph 1 (setup), used at midpoint to align with the terminal's axis and trace floor lines (development), and placed at the pattern's center before being pocketed at closure (payoff). All three gates satisfied. However, its mechanical function—curved edge catching light, marks guiding floor tracings—could be fulfilled by any inscribed arc or measuring tool; the object is not irreplaceable. It returns at closure but as symbolic gesture rather than causal necessity. Beat involvement (three touches) +1.4, setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, minus swappability −0.6 and ornamental final use −0.5 place it mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" is introduced in paragraph 1 as metaphor ("labyrinth of forgotten dreams") and repeated five times, but it never shapes a concrete choice or alters tactics. Elara traces floor patterns that "resolve into something new," yet the maze does not constrain her movement, complicate her engineering, or present competing paths. It functions as thematic decoration. Present throughout but ornamental (−0.8), no causal pressure (−0.8), and swappable with "web of connections" or "network of hopes" (−0.6) yield ~3.1. The concept anchors theme but not plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" appears twice as label without demonstration. The story asserts Elara's nature "thrived on such puzzles" and that she transforms "dereliction into design," but her on-page actions—turning a valve, carving channels—require persistence, not creativity. No moment shows her improvising a novel solution or balancing aesthetic and pragmatic constraints. Setup present, but missing middle development (no choice where the trait enables or limits) and missing closure participation cap at 2.8. Label-only usage (−0.6) and swappability (−0.4) apply.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is signaled early ("Her quest was to resurrect something") and drives the central action: opening the valve and redirecting water to revive the terminal's dormant systems. The act shapes two beats (valve turn, water flow establishing patterns) and is named again at closure ("resurrecting fragments of the past"). All three gates satisfied. However, the resurrection could be reframed as "restore" or "reactivate" with minimal edits; specificity is middling. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, minus swappability −0.5 and summary mention at closure −0.4 yield ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" is signaled in paragraph 1 ("through redirected flows, she intended to turn the maze…") and executed at midpoint: Elara opens a valve, redirects water through makeshift channels, and the flow traces patterns on the floor. Setup, development, and closure participation all present. The method is specific to the hydroponics infrastructure and cannot be swapped without changing the setting. Setup +0.6, beat involvement (two uses: valve turn, channel carving) +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.5, minus late first mechanical use (water flow begins ~55% in) −0.3 yield ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is named in the opening line, described across concourse and hydroponics bay, and returns at closure ("The terminal hummed"). The hydroponics bay supplies the dormant pipes and valves Elara uses, directly enabling her work. Setup +0.7, development (pipes and valves constrain her method) +1.2, closure participation +0.9, causal pressure (infrastructure enables the resurrection) +1.1, specificity (spaceport details: departure boards, hydroponics) +0.6 yield ~6.7. The setting functions as more than backdrop; it provides the puzzle Elara solves.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves town" appears once in paragraph 1 and is never anchored as a literal event or timeframe. The phrase functions as metaphor for abandonment rather than a temporal constraint that tightens decisions. No live clock pressures Elara; she works at her own pace with no urgency. Missing setup as concrete anchor, missing development (no tactical pressure from elapsed time), missing closure participation. Present as abstract image only, ornamental (−0.8), and swappable with "after the exodus" or "in the aftermath" (−0.6) cap at ~2.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated in paragraph 1 and repeated at closure ("equations for hope were taking shape"). However, it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. Elara's work proceeds smoothly; no moment shows her weighing hope against practical limits or risking failure. The desire is present and frames the action, but it remains abstract—told rather than embodied in a choice with friction. Setup +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, minus told-only execution (−0.8) and lack of friction (−0.7) yield ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is named three times and attempts to color Elara's perception ("stoic wonder was the only remaining emotion," "her expression unreadable yet full of stoic wonder"). The tone is consistent and modulates slightly—quiet awe in the opening, sustained through her work, returned at closure. However, the phrasing is static and label-reliant rather than embodied in syntax or rhythm. Setup +0.6, tonal coherence across beats +0.8, closure participation +0.7, minus label-only delivery (−0.6) and lack of rhythmic modulation under pressure (−0.5) yield ~5.4. The tone is present but not charged by the final image.</comment>
