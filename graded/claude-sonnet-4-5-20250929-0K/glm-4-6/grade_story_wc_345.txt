<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The Gardener operates entirely as told-through device; no contradictory impulses, no embodied struggle. Elara and Kael are names attached to functions (noticer, decoder) without distinct interior texture or embodied stakes. The "becoming family" premise and final choice to tend gardens lack visible cost or prior friction—the transformation is asserted across years in summary, not earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Motivation remains label-only altruism with no dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of chalk messages → network reveal). Orientation anchors arrive late: "Season of Falling Stars" and "orchard planet" appear early, but who Elara is and when "now" occurs remain vague past 120 words; apply −0.4. Closure unit is Conceptual Repricing (the network's purpose reweights the ghost's guidance), but cost is told retrospectively across "seasons" and "years" rather than felt in a final image—no on-page forfeiture or crystallized poise moment. The piece teaches its mosaic pattern (early years → discovery sequence → final revelation → epilogue future), but the ending diffuses into summary rather than landing a decisive beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Floating rock arches and butterfly gardens are vivid labels, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint. The watering bell hovers "untouched" and pulses light; no character handles it or adjusts tactics due to its presence until the told epilogue. Spatial choreography across arches is abstract—"easternmost arch" supplies a discovery site but no legible distance or access friction that alters a choice. The orchard-planet idiom remains generic pastoral-SF without sensory hierarchy or POV-filtered detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore atmospheric balance) is declared late (final third) and never pressures an on-page choice. The discovery sequence is tourism: each chalk message → cave → artifact, with no reversal or narrowing. Kael's suggestion to reexamine logs and the community's cooperative garden-tending are frictionless; no competing goods, no visible loss of time or resource. The ghost's "waiting for you to become family" criterion is a told gate, not a dramatized test with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of collective trust and interconnectedness is stated overtly ("orchestrate collective effort," "interconnectedness of the arches," "altruism and trust could grow") rather than earned through image and choice. The nebula matching arch locations is clever setup, but the payoff is expository tour rather than a resonant reconfiguration. The final paragraph's "cosmic wink" and "greatest homecoming" lines are direct theme summaries that replace scene pressure. One elevating detail: the children continuing chalk messages offers a graceful echo, though it arrives in told epilogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Voice is competent YA-SF house style—clear, warm, slightly elevated—but lacks perceptual signature. No dialogue on the page to test character distinction. POV remains stable third-limited on the community collective, but switches among Elara (opener), Kael (council scene), and a diffuse "they" without section breaks or distinct focalization. Filter verbs ("noticed," "realized," "seemed") cluster in expository beats without voice motivation. Psychic distance floats between close (Elara's first notice) and wide (years-later summary) without intentional modulation tied to pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in the opening: "noticed the presence" / "manifested" / "found the presence strangely trustworthy" restates shimmer-plus-trust across three lines. Template stems proliferate mid-piece: "They discovered," "They realized," "They mapped." The final two paragraphs are summary scaffold—"In the seasons that followed," "Years later"—that tell outcomes rather than dramatize a beat. Stock phrases: "vast emptiness of space," "gentle smile," "cosmic wink." Rhythm is competent but uniform; no sentence-level propulsion mirrors the discovery sequence's supposed urgency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The benevolent-ghost-teaching-settlers premise is familiar YA-SF pastoral; no fresh angle beyond combining chalk messages with atmospheric-network maintenance. The "strangers become family" frame and the ghost's "waiting" criterion are stock found-family beats. One modest inflection: the nebula pattern matching arch locations is a neat structural idea, but it resolves as treasure-map exposition rather than high-stakes moral calculus. The story chooses the safe middle—no character fails, no cost complicates trust—and the ending diffuses into wish-fulfillment epilogue.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout (setup, middle discoveries, final reveal, epilogue) and described as altruistic on the page. Development: the ghost leaves chalk messages that guide discoveries, a choice with mechanical consequence. Payoff: appears embodied to explain the network. Swappability: any benevolent mentor figure could deliver the same messages and exposition with minor edits; the "ghost" trait (shimmer, chime, bound consciousness) is atmospheric rather than causally essential. No visible cost tied to her choices—she succeeds without friction. Late frictions: −0.3 ornamental description (shimmer/chime); −0.2 summary-only middle involvement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Setup: "antique watering bell" appears in paragraph one with chime. Development: mentioned again at the easternmost arch pedestal (past tense, absent). Payoff: central cavern bell "hovered untouched," pulsing light; the ghost reveals it maintains atmospheric balance. Beat count: two on-page touches (opening, cavern) plus one told absence. Causal pressure: the bell's network function is told in exposition; no character handles it or adjusts tactics due to its presence. Swappability: any mystical maintenance device could serve the same plot role. Late penalty: −0.2 (second embodied appearance in final third); ornamental: −0.3 (description without action pressure).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setup: "nebula of respite" appears in paragraph two, visible in night sky. Development: paragraph six reveals "its pattern matched the locations the ghost was guiding them to"; they map arches accordingly. Payoff: final paragraph's "cosmic wink" callback. Causal work: the nebula's pattern enables the mapping choice, a functional middle turn. Swappability: moderate—any celestial or environmental pattern (constellation, river network, seasonal bloom) could serve the same map-key role. Frictions: the "respite" label and "cosmic wink" are thematic summary rather than on-page constraint (−0.3 ornamental); the concept remains backdrop after the mapping beat (−0.2).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Setup: "strangely trustworthy" appears in paragraph one, describing the settlers' reaction to the ghost. Development and payoff: the trait is told-only; no on-page scene where a character debates or tests trust with visible cost. The attribute narrates collective feeling rather than constraining a choice. Swappability: high—"benevolent," "reassuring," or "familiar" would function identically. Late penalty: none (early). Ornamental: −0.6 (label-only, no dramatized tradeoff). Summary-only: −0.4 (reaction asserted, not shown through action or dialogue).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: Kael suggests "reexamine the original colony logs" in paragraph three. Development: this suggestion leads directly to the first discovery at the easternmost arch and launches the guided quest sequence—a clear causal turn. Payoff: the reexamination method is not revisited at closure; the ending focuses on the network and children's tradition. Beat involvement: one (Kael's council scene). Causal pressure: +0.7 (enables the discovery arc). Swappability: moderate—"search the caves," "follow the chimes," or any investigation prompt could launch the quest with adjustments. Closure linkage: absent; the logs do not reappear or reweight the final image (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: chalk messages on sidewalks introduced paragraph two, described as dawn symbols. Development: paragraph five explains children race to decode "the day's mission"; the method organizes the community's cooperative arc. Payoff: penultimate paragraph states children continue leaving chalk messages as tradition; final paragraph notes "the legend of the Gardener already chalked onto the welcoming path." Beat involvement: two+ (initial discovery, children's daily races, future tradition). Causal pressure: +0.6 (the method shapes daily tactics and closure tradition). Specificity: +0.4 (chalk-at-dawn detail is concrete and irreplaceable for the teaching-cooperation arc). Frictions: the method is told-about rather than dramatized in a single scene where a character decodes under pressure (−0.4 summary-only).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup: "orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches" appears in title phrase and paragraph two. Development: arches serve as discovery sites (easternmost arch, central arch); the nebula-pattern matching enables mapping in paragraph six. Payoff: the network spans arches in epilogue, but no final image grounds the closure beat in arch-specific action. Beat involvement: two (mapping, central cavern). Causal pressure: +0.5 (arches supply quest structure). Swappability: moderate-high—any distributed landmark set (islands, ruins, groves) could serve similarly. Micro-setting test: the arches do not constrain a choice or charge the final image; they remain backdrop. Ornamental penalty: −0.4 (vivid labels without tactical friction). Generic-template usage: −0.2 (floating islands trope).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Setup: "Season of Falling Stars, when the strangers…were finally beginning to call this orchard planet home" and "five years prior" anchor the opening. Development: "In those early years," "For months following," "seasons that followed," "Years later" mark time, but no ticking clock pressures a choice. Payoff: the epilogue future ("when new star-farers would arrive") extends the timeframe without cost. The element is functional summary scaffolding rather than a constraint. Swappability: any post-settlement interval works. Frictions: told-only time passage (−0.5); no live deadline alters tactics (−0.3); the "after strangers become family" gate is asserted, not dramatized with visible before/after cost (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Setup: the ghost's motivation "to orchestrate collective effort" is stated in paragraph eight (final third). Development and payoff: the motivation is explained in exposition ("each morning's chalk messages had been carefully designed to teach them to work together") and fulfilled in told summary ("the community transformed"). No on-page scene dramatizes the ghost's friction between this desire and a competing cost or doubt. Swappability: "unite the settlers," "restore the planet," or "teach cooperation" function identically. Frictions: late introduction (−0.6); told-only, no embodied choice under pressure (−0.7); no visible tradeoff or cost tied to orchestration (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Setup: tone is warm, hopeful, gently mysterious from the opening (shimmer, "strangely trustworthy," "assurances of goodwill"). Development: the tone remains static—each discovery affirms cooperation and wonder without friction or dread. Payoff: "brambled" implies tangled complexity, but the final image ("cosmic wink," "altruism and trust could grow as naturally as any garden") is unambiguously gentle and optimistic. Coherence: consistent warmth, but no modulation under pressure; no moments where hope tangles with doubt or cost. "Brambled" is label-only; the narrative delivers uncomplicated uplift. Frictions: static mood throughout (−0.5); "brambled" descriptor not embodied in tonal shifts or imagery (−0.4); final-paragraph summary replaces scene tension (−0.3).</comment>
