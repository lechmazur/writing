<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is specific and embodied—the freeze response and trembling hands are somatically grounded. The trajectory from haunted survivor to placing the framed photograph reads as earned endurance (Earned Stasis) with visible cost. However, the emotional progression is too smooth; the leap from freezing in terror to transcendent stillness while transplanting sea thrift lacks the messy ambivalence or contradictory impulse that would push this higher. Therapy-speak touches ("somatic markers," "integrating") slightly flatten peak interiority but do not collapse the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (Maya, cliffside arboretum, post-trauma timeline). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through repeated imagery (freeze, photograph, plants as metaphor) and a cadence shift at the sea-thrift moment. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—framing the photograph and placing succulents beside it forecloses hiding and crystallizes integration with visible cost (end of concealment). The cost is legible on the page in the act of moving the photograph from hiding to display. One meaningful deepening (the transcendent freeze) tightens her relationship to trauma, meeting the scope requirement for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The arboretum, cliff edge, greenhouse, and lighthouse are spatially coherent and textured with salt-laced wind, turquoise-to-amethyst sea, and plants that "refuse to surrender." The garden constrains Maya's choices—tending plants becomes the language for grief—and charges the final image when she places succulents beside the photograph. The sea thrift's roots gripping rock directly mirrors her endurance, shaping the transcendent moment. Sensory selection is consistent and filtered through her botanical focus, meeting the 9+ gate (environment charges closure).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maya's capacity to integrate trauma without erasure—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The transcendent freeze while transplanting sea thrift provides one meaningful tightening that narrows her options from concealment to acknowledgment. Framing the photograph forecloses the hiding path with on-page cost (vulnerability, permanence of memory). Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices at this length. The escalation is protagonist-driven (her choice to frame and display), and the cost is unmistakable in the shift from crumpled/hidden to framed/visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely through root systems as trauma metaphors and the coexistence of salt-tolerant plants at the freshwater/seawater boundary. The lighthouse keeper's "anchor optimism in realism" philosophy shapes Maya's arc without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph over-explains: "She was a drone strike wedding survivor, quietly talented at nurturing life where devastation had struck, anchoring optimism in the realism of her daily work" restates the thesis in prompt-like language rather than trusting the framed photograph and succulents to carry the resonance. This thematic echo in the penultimate beat costs −0.5, preventing higher bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Maya's perceptual signature (botanical lens, somatic awareness). Diction mostly matches her interiority, though "somatic markers" and "integrating" edge toward clinical register in peak beats. The phrase "a pearl of stillness bloomed within her chest" is slightly elevated but voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates purposefully between close observation and reflective pulls. The over-articulated thesis in the final paragraphs slightly flattens voice under pressure, but the core narrative stance holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines advance character or image. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Root systems became metaphors for how trauma takes hold beneath the surface. The seasonal cycles offered perspective on healing after catastrophe" restates the same content across adjacent sentences without added pressure (−0.2). The phrase "quietly talented hands" recurs three times in near-identical constructions, edging toward template cadence but not egregious (−0.2). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "pearl of stillness" recurs purposefully. Minor scaffold and synonym churn prevent entry to 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The botanical grief metaphor and survivor-in-garden premise are familiar templates (trauma + nature healing). The story transforms this through specific detail—sea thrift roots gripping rock, sempervivum cuttings as continuation symbols—and the framed photograph beat offers a fresh inflection on concealment-to-acknowledgment. The lighthouse keeper's philosophy and the salt-spray conditions add texture. However, the core arc (traumatized woman finds solace in gardening) does not surprise, and the final paragraph's thesis summary undercuts the earned particularity. Solid execution of a known form, not a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and her survivor status motivates every beat. She makes two key choices: the transcendent observation of sea thrift (middle) and framing the photograph (closure). Both decisions alter her stance from concealment to integration, and the cost (vulnerability, permanence) is visible. Setup early, development at the sea-thrift moment, payoff at closure—all three gates met. Causal pressure is strong (+1.2), closure linkage clear (+1.0), but the trait is somewhat abstract (survivor as identity rather than a constraint that shapes tactics in scene). Strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears in three beats: hidden in the greenhouse (setup), retrieved and smoothed mid-story (development), and framed beside succulents at closure (payoff). Its state evolution—crumpled/hidden to smoothed/framed—directly embodies Maya's internal shift and charges the final image. Causal pressure is high (the act of framing forecloses hiding, +1.4) and closure linkage is unmistakable (+1.6). The object's transformation is specific and irreplaceable (+0.7). Strong integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The concept "pearl of stillness" is introduced via the lighthouse keeper's quote, recurs in Maya's transcendent moment with the sea thrift, and again in the penultimate paragraph. It shapes her understanding and reweights her relationship to trauma (setup, middle reflection, closure echo). However, it functions mostly as thematic gloss rather than a constraint that alters on-page tactics. The cost connection is oblique—stillness as acceptance has conceptual weight but does not narrow options in a high-pressure choice. Two gates (setup, closure reprise); lyric resonance lifts it into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" appears three times, always as a descriptor of Maya's hands. It enables her botanical work (general capability) but does not constrain a specific choice or create visible tradeoff. The trait is label-only in the final paragraph ("quietly talented at nurturing life") without dramatized cost. Setup present (early mention), no middle development where the talent's limits matter, closure mention is ornamental. Functional but replaceable; could swap "skilled" or "patient" with minor edits. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development, small lift for label recurrence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Freeze" appears in trauma flashbacks (jet whine triggers body rigidity) and is transformed in the transcendent sea-thrift moment ("a different kind of freeze—not traumatic but transcendent"). This evolution drives the middle turn and shapes her capacity to reframe trauma. Setup early (trauma freeze), development at the sea-thrift beat (transcendent freeze), implicit payoff (the framed photograph enacts the integration the transcendent freeze initiated). Causal role in one major turn (+0.9), specificity high (freeze as somatic state is precise, +0.6). Strong but the closure beat does not show freeze on the page—it's preparation, not the climactic act itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Somatic markers" appears twice: once in Maya's memory of her grandmother's teachings (watering/protection cues) and once in the reflection on freeze as "somatic connections to what she'd survived." The method is named but not dramatized—we do not see her read a plant's need through bodily sensation in a choice under pressure. Setup present (grandmother's teaching), no middle beat where the method alters tactics, closure mention is retrospective summary. Functional presence but swappable with "physical memory" or "body knowledge." Cap at 3.8 for swappability and lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliff are present throughout, supply the plants that become Maya's language for grief, and house the greenhouse where the photograph is hidden and later framed. The setting pressures her choices—wind-swept junipers and salt-tolerant plants mirror endurance, the cliff edge is where she pauses at closure. Setup immediate, development across all beats (tending plants is the method of integration), payoff when the final pause at the cliff's edge frames her transformation. Causal pressure high (+1.4), closure linkage strong (+1.2), specificity good (arboretum + cliff is distinct, +0.6). Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper" anchors the timeline (five years post-keeper, three years post-attack for Maya) and his remembered philosophy shapes her arc. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—there is no live clock or urgency tied to his absence. Setup present (keeper died five years ago), his wisdom recurs in reflection, but the "after" does not create pressure or alter tactics. The element is atmospheric context, not a constraint. Functional but replaceable with "in solitude" or "alone." Cap at 4.6 for missing middle pressure, small penalty for late-timeframe swappability (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Anchor optimism in realism" is the lighthouse keeper's teaching, becomes Maya's own principle, and governs her final stance (acknowledging suffering while cultivating beauty). Setup via the keeper's philosophy, development in her three years of work, payoff in the final reflection where it's named as "her own." The motivation shapes her choices (framing the photograph rather than discarding or re-hiding it) and charges the integration. However, it is more told than dramatized in friction—her choices align smoothly without a moment where optimism and realism pull against each other with visible cost. Two gates (setup, closure), causal linkage moderate (+0.7), but lacks embodied conflict. Mid-6s.</comment>
