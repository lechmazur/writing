<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dr. Maris exhibits consistent traits (methodical, analogical thinking) but her emotional arc relies heavily on label-speak ("touching distance," "renewed purpose") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The decision to plant the seed feels predetermined rather than a choice that forecloses a visible alternative path. Interior reflection dominates over dramatized micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values with cost. Hamid's spectral presence is told retrospectively without creating on-page pressure through interaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (magnetic arbor, Dr. Maris, post-Hamid departure). The closure—planting the seed and achieving understanding—is presented as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual ("from sorrow to understanding") without a visible forfeiture or tactical constraint on the page. The causal lens is attempted but the breakthrough ("analogical approach yielded breakthroughs") is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the because/therefore linkage at the pivotal turn. The ending reconfigures meaning but the felt price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is vividly rendered with specific details (metallic leaves, zero-gravity roots, ninety-thousand feet altitude) that establish atmosphere. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics during the breakthrough moment. The seed's containment field and soil matrix are mentioned but their properties do not pressure Maris's decisions. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (complete Hamid's research, understand transition physics) is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or complication. The breakthrough arrives via summary ("her analogical approach yielded breakthroughs") without on-page escalation or a visible choice that narrows options. The seed germinates "within minutes" without cost, obstacle, or trade-off. No reversal or tightening tests Maris's commitment; the resolution is delivered rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The transition/translation theme is coherent and emerges from the cuneiform background and the seed's encoding. The final paragraph states the theme overtly ("not as death's mechanism but as its very opposite") rather than letting the image resonate without a moral. The analogical method and botanical metaphor support the concept, but "touching distance" and related abstractions lean toward label-speak. The piece invites reflection on consciousness and continuation, though the epiphany is asserted more than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries academic diction appropriate to a physicist-translator but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liminal spaces," "ontological," "cuneiform expertise") that risks sounding more like the prompt than lived interiority. Perceptual signature is present in the analogical framing. The prose modulates with emotional intensity, though some turns ("her voice carried away by the high-altitude winds") read as literary flourish rather than character-specific perception. Psychic distance is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "hovering over her shoulder... his form wavering" and "knowledge fruit seed" repeated across beats without variation. Template cadence in opening: multiple "her [noun]" constructions. The phrase "touching distance缩小" includes a stray Chinese character (artifact). Stock metaphor "whisper promises" and elevated diction ("liminal spaces," "ontological") in peak beats reduce immediacy. Sentence openings vary but information density is uneven; some lines do double work while others scaffold. Clarity is maintained but momentum sags during reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor setting and knowledge fruit seed offer specificity, but the core premise (scientist completes mentor's work to understand consciousness/death) follows familiar template. The cuneiform translator angle provides a fresh detail but does not fundamentally transform the arc. Hamid's ghost departs off-page two weeks prior, reducing dramatic potential. The analogical thinking method is named but not dramatized in action. The ending's insight ("mathematics of continuation") is conceptually interesting but arrives through summary rather than an earned, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Dr. Maris (cuneiform translator) is present throughout and her background motivates the analogical approach, but her translator expertise appears primarily in exposition and internal summary rather than driving on-page turns. The breakthrough ("translated using her cuneiform expertise") is told, not shown. She makes the decision to plant the seed, but this choice does not meaningfully alter tactics or create visible cost. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but primarily as lens rather than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit seed is introduced early (containment field, crystalline structure), handled in the middle (containment adjustment), and planted at closure where it germinates and delivers understanding. It drives two distinct beats (examination, planting) and shapes the ending image (branches with constellations of information). However, the seed's properties do not constrain Maris's choices or impose cost; it delivers answers rather than complications. Its specificity matters, but it resolves a problem it enabled rather than one it helped create.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Haunted ambitions" appears as theme and backstory (Hamid's regrets, Maris's inherited purpose) but does not create on-page tactical pressure. The spirit departed two weeks ago, so the haunting is past-tense and does not complicate present choices. The phrase recurs in reflection but functions as label rather than constraint. Present in setup as framing device, absent from middle beats, mentioned at closure as thematic echo. Swappable with "unfinished work" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is introduced early ("Her kindly methodical nature kept her steady") and linked to her patient approach, but it does not create visible trade-offs or constrain action under pressure. The trait is asserted rather than dramatized through on-page behavior that forecloses an alternative. It colors her characterization but remains label-level; removing it would not break story logic or alter the arc. Present in setup, implied in middle patience, absent from closure beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Reestablish" Hamid's research is the stated goal and frames the narrative from the opening. Maris's actions (examining the seed, adjusting the field, planting) serve this purpose. However, the reestablishment itself is completed via summary breakthrough rather than a dramatized turn. The action is present throughout but does not redefine options at a climactic beat; it is more motivational backdrop than pivot point. Swappable with "complete" or "validate" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Through analogical thinking" is mentioned explicitly in dialogue and narration ("Translation and transition... both involve crossing liminal spaces") and credited with the breakthrough. However, the mechanics are not shown on the page; we do not witness Maris applying the method to decode the seed's patterns in real time. It appears in setup (stated), is absent from middle beats as active process, and reappears at closure as summary explanation. Label-only use without demonstrated technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is established early with vivid detail (ninety-thousand feet, metallic leaves, humming fields) and provides atmosphere throughout. It houses the research station and symbolizes the work ("suspended between heaven and earth"). However, the setting does not pressure Maris's choices or supply resources that alter outcome; she could conduct the same breakthrough in a conventional lab. Present in setup, sustained in middle description, invoked at closure as metaphor but not as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the spirit leaves" establishes the timeframe (two weeks post-departure) and motivates Maris's renewed purpose. The absence creates loneliness and urgency in reflection. However, time does not function as live pressure or tighten decisions on the page; the breakthrough occurs "by morning" without a clock that alters tactics or imposes cost. Present in setup, colors middle reflection, mentioned at closure as thematic frame but not as tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Maris's desire "to understand the physics of transition" is stated early, sustained through her research actions, and fulfilled at closure when she comprehends transition as continuation. The motivation is clear and drives the plot arc. However, it is not dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction between wants and costs; the path is smooth and the breakthrough arrives without sacrifice or trade-off on the page. Present throughout but primarily as declared intent rather than tested commitment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Touching distance" recurs as phrase and concept (distance from Hamid, communion with the plant, bridging the gap). It colors the tone with melancholy and intimacy. However, the tone remains static across beats rather than modulating with pressure; the piece sustains one reflective register without tightening or charging at climax. Present in setup, middle, and closure as thematic thread, but does not shift to charge the final image with new emotional weight.</comment>
