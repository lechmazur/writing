<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The collector remains a cipher throughout—"modestly fearless" and "luminous ache" are labels rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values; the protagonist performs a fixed ritual (raise tooth, play tune, weave confession) without visible cost or internal friction. The woman and child are summoned and healed in identical beats with no variation in the collector's approach, flattening any sense of struggle. Interiority consists of atmospheric declarations ("his chest tightened," "bittersweet joy") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear by the opening lines; no penalty. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: each spectral encounter adds density toward a thematic charge. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the second soul (child) is healed identically to the first (woman), with no escalation in difficulty, method, or cost. The final paragraph asserts continuation ("the story continued") rather than landing a decisive image or reconfiguration that reweights prior material. Closure reads as conceptual assertion ("healing began with a single, courageous laugh") without visible cost on the page, failing the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is vividly rendered early ("cliffs swallowed sound," "misaligned harp," "sunrise filtered through cracks") and the acoustic properties recur through multiple beats, shaping the collector's method. The crocodile's tooth functions as a tactile anchor (coolness, serrated edge, pressed into earth) across three moments. However, neither gorge nor tooth constrains a choice or alters tactics; they ornament rather than pressure. The ending image (tooth left behind, collector walking onward) charges thematically but does not demonstrate how the environment forced a tradeoff, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—integrating laughter into healing—is signaled early but never tested. Both spectral encounters resolve in identical fashion: collector plays, confession emerges, laughter surfaces, spirit dissolves. No reversal, complication, or escalation appears; the second soul does not resist more strongly or require a new tactic. The protagonist's agency is limited to repetition of a method that succeeds without friction. No visible price is paid; the tooth is left behind as a thematic gesture rather than a forfeited resource that alters future capability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (grief's capacity for transformation, laughter as healing) emerges through recurring images (misaligned harp, crocodile's tooth, laughter woven into essence) rather than direct statement, which is a strength. However, the final two paragraphs tip into overt thematic summary ("a conduit for the luminous ache," "endless cycle of sorrow and joy," "healing began with a single, courageous laugh") that replaces scene pressure with assertion. The conceptual cost is claimed but not dramatized—what did the collector sacrifice or foreclose to achieve this healing? The thematic question is posed but not answered through specific, conflicted action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic—"haunting beauty," "luminous ache," "bittersweet joy"—without character-specific bias. Diction elevates consistently ("spectral confessions," "ivy on stone," "gray tapestry") but matches a lyric register more than a lived interior. The collector's way of noticing does not shift under the pressure of encountering two souls; both encounters are narrated with identical texture and rhythm. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence proliferate: "The woman's voice rose… speaking of a life half-lived" is immediately followed by "He adjusted his tune… until a single, pure laugh escaped," then "The woman flickered… a thread of gold in her gray tapestry"; the child's beat recycles the same structure ("The collector played again… the child's confession tumbled out… he pursued that giggle… The child's form dissolved"). Stock metaphors ("ivy on stone," "gray tapestry," "thread of gold") and elevated diction ("luminous ache," "modestly fearless") repeat without variation. Runs of "The collector [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" sentence stems span 6+ consecutive lines mid-story, triggering template-cadence penalties. The final third consists almost entirely of thematic summary rather than concrete action, flattening momentum. Apply −1.2 cumulative in Q7 for loops, template cadence, and closure-adjacent summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—soul collector using music to heal spectral grief—is a familiar fantasy template (psychopomp + therapeutic healing quest) executed without transformation. The crocodile's tooth and misaligned harp are vivid but do not generate fresh narrative friction; they ornament a stock progression. Both spectral encounters follow the same beat: appear, confess, laugh, dissolve—no variation in resistance, complication, or moral calculus. The final image (walking onward, "forever chasing the light") echoes countless quest-continuation endings. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the lyric accumulation does not compensate for the derivative emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The lost soul collector is present throughout and performs actions (raises tooth, plays tune, weaves confession, kneels, presses tooth into earth), but these are ritual gestures rather than choices that alter tactics or create turns. The collector executes the same method twice with identical success; no decision point narrows options or imposes cost. Present and functional, but replaceable with any psychopomp role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The crocodile's tooth appears in five beats: opening (carried, serrated edge glinting), raised to lips (coolness grounding), traced with fingers, pulsed in hand (reminder of grief's primal nature), pressed into earth (offering). Early signal is strong, but the tooth never constrains a choice or enables a tactic under pressure—its properties (serrated, cool, primal) are described but do not alter outcomes. The final press into earth is a thematic closure gesture, not a causal payoff. Functional but swappable with any ritual object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Spectral confessions frame the task (seeking "whispers of souls too tangled to pass on") and appear in both healing beats (woman speaks "of a life half-lived, of laughter buried under duty"; child's confession "tumbled out—loneliness, fear"). The concept shapes what the collector pursues but does not generate friction or choice—both confessions emerge and resolve identically. Present in setup, middle, and ending image ("spectral confessions faded, but their echoes remained"), meeting the three-gate test, but the concept is more thematic than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Modestly fearless" is declared in the opening line but never dramatized through a choice that shows the tension between modesty and fearlessness. The collector walks into the gorge without visible hesitation, performs the healing ritual twice without friction, and continues onward—pure confidence with no cost or constraint tied to this attribute. Label-only; no on-page tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Pursue" appears throughout: the collector "pursued [whispers] with a single purpose," "pursued that giggle, chasing it through the melody," and in the closing lines "pursued the next note, the next confession, the next laugh… forever chasing the light." The action is thematic and continuous but does not create a turn—both pursuits succeed identically without complication. Swappable with "seek" or "follow" with minor edits; present in closure but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The misaligned harp is signaled early ("acoustics a misaligned harp, each step striking a discordant chord") and recurs in both healing beats: "distorted notes of a misaligned harp called to the lingering spirits," "notes warping to match her ache," "notes bending like light through water," and at closure "The misaligned harp fell silent, its purpose fulfilled… its distorted notes now a symphony of release." The method shapes both attempts and the final image. However, the mechanics are atmospheric rather than tactical—how does misalignment enable the healing? Present across setup, middle, ending; charges closure but lacks specificity in causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is established early with vivid acoustics ("cliffs swallowed sound and spit it back fractured," "misaligned harp") and recurs through multiple beats (sunrise filtering through cracks, canyon wall where the woman appears, earth where tooth is pressed, warming as sun climbs). The gorge's echo properties inform the collector's sonic method and frame the resolution ("gorge whispered back… a symphony of release"). Setting is essential to the method and charges the final image, but it does not constrain a choice or force the collector to adapt tactics. Strong setup, middle presence, and closure linkage, but lacks visible cost tied to spatial pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"In the hush of a hidden sunrise" appears in the opening and closing lines, and "As the sun climbed higher, the gorge warmed" marks a midpoint moment. However, the sunrise imposes no deadline or urgency—time is atmospheric rather than tactical. The collector performs two healings at an unspecified pace with no clock pressure. Present at beginning and end, but middle development is absent; the timeframe does not alter moves or choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to integrate laughter into healing" is declared early ("pursued them with a single purpose") and enacted in both healing beats: the collector adjusts tune until "a single, pure laugh escaped," then "pursued that giggle… until it surfaced." The desire is shown through repeated action, but no friction or conflicting want appears—both healings succeed without cost or failure. The motivation shapes the method but is never tested by a resistant soul or a tradeoff between laughter and another outcome. Functional across setup, middle, and ending, but lacks dramatized conflict or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" is a recurring phrase (title-like prominence) and the tone is sustained through lyric diction ("bittersweet joy," "haunting beauty," "the weight of unsaid goodbyes," "gray tapestry with a thread of gold"). The tone modulates between melancholy (souls' confessions) and affirmation (laughter, healing) without sharp discord. The final image ("luminous ache that connects all things," "endless cycle of sorrow and joy") reprises the tone and charges the closure conceptually. However, the tone is static rather than dynamically pressured—no moment where the ache threatens to overwhelm or the luminosity dims under stress. Coherent and purposeful, charges the ending, but lacks modulation under escalation.</comment>
