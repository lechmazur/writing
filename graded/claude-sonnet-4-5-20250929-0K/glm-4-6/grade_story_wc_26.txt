<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's role reads more as observer than agent—her "softly deliberate movements" and retrospective analysis dominate, but on-page choices that alter tactics under pressure are sparse. The river stone's mechanics and the metamorphosis are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Interiority leans heavily on abstract phrases ("luminous regret," "methodical resolve") without specific sensory anchors or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final transformation happens largely off-page, summarized in a single paragraph without visible cost or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Elara is and her concrete role remain vague past the first third, triggering a −0.4 penalty. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the metamorphosis and its cost are summarized ("By dawn, the transformation was complete") rather than shown in a decisive on-page moment. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (pattern of unbound shadows accumulating toward a solution), but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it asserts success without showing friction or failure. Causal linkage between the river stone's use and the library's reconfiguration is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds supplies vivid, specific details (crystalline window, breathing shelves, cloud-void) that anchor the reader and constrain Elara's world. The river stone's velvet-lined box and the viewing chamber provide micro-setting that shapes her method. However, the floating gardens and shadow-drift mechanics remain decorative—they do not alter a tactical choice or close off an option. The final sanctuary and "shadow gardens" are named but not experienced, reducing their closure charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving hope's shape) is signaled early but remains abstract—no on-page scene tests Elara's commitment with a visible trade-off. The unbound shadows complicate the situation, yet the story offers no reversal or tightening choice where Elara's decision narrows options or imposes cost. The resolution ("By dawn, the transformation was complete") is summarized, eliding the pressure moment where success or failure would crystallize. Agency reads as retrospective analysis rather than high-stakes decision under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (hope's fragility in a shareable-dream era) emerges through the unbound-shadow conceit and the river stone's crystalline patterns. Yet the final paragraph moralizes ("protecting hope's shape had given her a new purpose") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image. The "luminous regret" motif recurs but does not shift meaning across beats—it remains a static label. The piece gestures at complexity (hope bleeding into tangible forms) but resolves into tidy optimism without ambiguity or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "blooming knowledge") and maintains single-POV focus. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("ephemeral nature of hope," "methodical resolve") that clashes with embodied urgency; phrases like "fragile architecture of human consciousness" read expository rather than character-particular. Psychic distance remains stable, but the prose leans on filter verbs and summary ("she had discovered," "Elara understood") that dull immediacy. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening and middle: "shadows were unbound" / "shadows becoming unbound" / "shadows were becoming unbound" across multiple paragraphs; "by comparing silent video footage from decades apart" appears verbatim twice without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the fourth and fifth paragraphs ("Her metamorphosis had begun… By comparing… Elara understood…"). Stock metaphors ("shadows stretched like fingers," "bleeding from human hearts") and abstraction ("luminous regret," "methodical resolve") blur specificity. These artifacts span multiple beats, triggering cumulative −1.2 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core conceit (unbound shadows in a shareable-dream library) offers a fresh synthesis, and the river stone as hope-capture mechanism adds specificity. However, the emotional arc and resolution follow a predictable template: problem discovered, method applied, transformation achieved without significant friction or unexpected cost. The "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" and "luminous regret" labels feel ornamental rather than lived-in. The ending opts for tidy optimism ("the transformation was complete") that avoids bold risk or ambiguity, settling into the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her observation frames the narrative, satisfying setup and development. However, her choices do not create key turns—she enacts a plan told in summary rather than making high-stakes decisions under pressure. The closure beat summarizes her work's result without showing her agency at the moment of transformation. Swappable with a near-synonym role (librarian, archivist) with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The river stone appears in three distinct beats: discovery (month ago backstory), use in the viewing chamber (midpoint), and final placement of honor (closure). It enables her method (capturing hope's patterns) and is causally linked to the library's metamorphosis. However, its mechanics remain abstract—how it "restores hope's shape when played alongside proper shadow frequencies" is asserted, not shown. The closure linkage is present but not charged with visible cost or reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The unbound-shadow concept frames the central problem and appears in every third of the story (setup, middle analysis, closure containment). It shapes Elara's goal and the library's transformation. However, the concept never constrains a tactical choice on the page—shadows drift but do not force Elara to sacrifice or choose between competing goods. The resolution (shadow gardens that contain them) is told rather than tested, reducing causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" appears twice as a descriptor of Elara's movements but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It functions as a character label without altering her choices or tactics. The trait could be removed without changing the plot or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" appears in multiple beats (Elara's own shift six months ago, her plan to metamorphose the archival system, the library's branches reconfiguring). The final transformation is the story's climactic event. However, it is summarized ("By dawn, the transformation was complete") rather than dramatized, and the action is easily swappable with synonyms (transform, reconfigure, alter) without structural loss. The cost of metamorphosis is asserted, not shown.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The video-comparison method is signaled early ("by comparing silent video footage from decades apart") and recurs in the middle beat where Elara uses it to understand the shadow-unbinding pattern. It shapes her discovery and informs her solution. However, its mechanics remain vague—how the comparison yields actionable insight is told, not shown. The method does not constrain a choice under pressure; it enables backstory analysis rather than present-scene tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds provides the central arena and supplies specific resources (breathing shelves, viewing chamber, river stone's velvet box, cloud-void). The library's metamorphosis at closure is the story's decisive event. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices—she moves freely through it without friction. The floating architecture and shadow gardens remain decorative until the ending, where they are reconfigured off-page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The fifty-year post-shareable-dream era frames the premise and Elara's retrospective comparison. However, the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions—no clock, deadline, or urgency shapes her tactics. The six-month window of her own metamorphosis is mentioned but does not create pressure. The ending's "by dawn" marker appears once without prior time-tracking, functioning as a summary close rather than a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Preserving hope's shape is Elara's stated goal, present in setup, middle analysis, and closure declaration. The desire drives her archival work and the library's transformation. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page scene forces her to choose between hope-preservation and another competing good or cost. The final paragraph asserts the motivation's fulfillment without showing friction or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" recurs as a label in the opening, middle, and closing paragraphs, satisfying setup and payoff. However, the tone remains static—regret is named but not embodied through contradictory impulses or sensory degradation. The phrase functions as a thematic claim rather than a texture that modulates under pressure. The closure does not reweight the regret; it simply reasserts it alongside declared purpose.</comment>
