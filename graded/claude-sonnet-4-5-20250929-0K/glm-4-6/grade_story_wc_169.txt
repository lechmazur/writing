<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara remains a collection of abstract labels ("logical dreamer," "lucidly watchful") without embodied interiority or contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her work with the decorations is described externally rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure; we never see her hesitate, doubt, or make a trade-off that reveals hierarchy of values. The "serene upheaval" moment is asserted rather than felt through her body or perception. The ending smile and balloon-light heart read as stock satisfaction rather than earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The piece orients who and where by the opening lines but lacks a legible drive lens; the gauge reacts, water glows, patterns shift, yet no causal because/therefore chain tightens options or knowledge. The closure image—gauge pointing skyward, heart "light as a balloon"—offers no visible cost or foreclosed path; Elara completes her trial and walks out satisfied, rendering the ending a summary rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The parallel-timelines frame is invoked repeatedly but never constrains a choice or complicates a beat on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The grotto is anchored early with vivid tactile detail (tide-polished, lucent shells, tidepool), and the rising tide distorts her patterns in a moment that could pressure choice. However, she observes the distortion without fear or adjustment of tactics; the environment remains postcard rather than constraint. The gauge and decorations function as props described rather than tools that alter her approach, missing the micro-setting constraint test for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to puzzle out new equations for hope"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or a narrowing choice. The gauge's movements and the water's glow feel like atmospheric responses rather than escalation that forces trade-offs. No reversal or tightening occurs; she arranges, adjusts, observes, and succeeds without visible cost or a moment where prior tactics fail and force adaptation. The "trial" proceeds smoothly to affirmation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme relies on repeated abstract assertions—"equations for hope," "serene upheaval," "logical dreamer"—rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("her equations for hope were ready to be tested… built on patterns as old and as new as the tide"), replacing scene pressure with thematic summary. The gauge's symbolic role is told rather than charged through cost; its "unreadable symbol" moment offers vague mystery instead of a resonant reweighting of prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains stable third-person limited distance and a lyric register with purposeful compression ("serene upheaval," "lucidly watchful"). However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; Elara's way of noticing reads interchangeable with any contemplative protagonist. Diction occasionally lifts into unearned profundity ("across parallel timelines, she imagined other versions of herself") without grounding in her present perception or micro-choice. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "patterns… patterns she'd made… patterns aligning… patterns emerge… patterns converging… patterns in stone… patterns she'd found." Sentence stems repeat mechanically ("She adjusted… She closed… She reached… She turned"). The final third stacks summary statements without propulsion ("The logical dreamer had done her work, and the world would never be the same" followed by three more declarative paragraphs). Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she saw," "she sensed," "she knew") dull immediacy in the closing beats, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—solitary figure in mystical grotto conducting symbolic experiments—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Trial balloons" as metaphorical experiments and "equations for hope" read as prompt-fulfillment rather than organically arising from character or world logic. The gauge and parallel timelines remain ornamental rather than constraints that shape unique tactics. The ending's upward-pointing needle and balloon-light heart recycle stock uplift imagery without fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no key turn through choice; she arranges, observes, and concludes without decision that alters tactics. The "logical dreamer" label appears in opening and closing frames but does not constrain or enable action with cost. Ornamental presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The altitude gauge appears in multiple beats (trembling, swaying, jumping, stopping at a symbol, pointing upward) but its mechanics remain vague and its responses feel atmospheric rather than diagnostic. It does not enable or constrain a choice; Elara never adjusts her method based on its readings. Present across beats but functionally ornamental, capped by swappability and lack of closure participation where it redefines stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Trial balloons" is named early as her process and reprised at closure ("her trial balloons complete"), but the concept remains metaphorical label rather than shaping on-page tactics. She does not launch multiple attempts, fail, and adjust; the singular trial proceeds smoothly. Functional but replaceable with "experiment" or "test" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears twice as a label framing her observation but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. She watches the gauge and water without the trait forcing a trade-off (e.g., hyper-awareness that exhausts her or causes her to miss a simpler solution). Label-only use, no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Revitalizing old ideas, giving them new form" is stated early but the action itself—her arranging decorations—does not turn the plot. She does not revive a failed prior attempt or transform a stale method under pressure; the work is new from the start. Mentioned but not causally active in a major beat; swappable with "experimenting" or "creating."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Creating patterns with decorations is signaled early, demonstrated in the middle (she arranges shells, sea glass, seaweed into intricate patterns), and mentioned at closure ("decorations now swirling in the rising tide, their purpose fulfilled"). The method shapes her attempt in one extended beat, though its mechanics—how pattern geometry matters—remain vague. Functional in one key beat; lyric reprise at end adds modest closure linkage, reaching lower 5-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tide-polished grotto is anchored in the opening line, its tidepool and rising water distort her patterns in the middle, and the location frames the closure ("stepped out of the grotto"). The rising tide complicates her work visually but she observes without fear or tactical shift, reducing the setting's pressure. Present in setup, development, and payoff; shapes one beat (water distortion) and contributes to ending frame, reaching low 6-band via the three-gate path.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Across parallel timelines" is invoked three times as a thought-frame but never creates urgency or choice between branches. No live clock; the parallel structure remains abstract metaphor without mechanics that tighten decisions. Ornamental presence; late penalties do not apply since it appears early, but it never constrains tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope" is declared early and restated at closure ("her equations for hope were ready to be tested"). The motivation frames her activity but is never dramatized through conflicted choice—she pursues it without friction between want and cost, or competing desires. Setup and payoff present; missing middle friction and on-page cost, capping in upper 4-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is named twice (midpoint and near-end) and the tone attempts to balance peace and chaos through descriptions of water distorting patterns. The register remains meditative throughout without modulation under pressure; crisis never accelerates rhythm or narrows perception. Functional presence across beats with modest coherence; purposeful lyric reprise reweights the stake slightly, reaching lower 5-band via the two-gate allowance and resonance credit.</comment>
