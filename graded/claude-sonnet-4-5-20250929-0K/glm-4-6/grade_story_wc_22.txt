<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The coachman remains a static, archetypal figure throughout—no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure, only ritualized action. Interiority is absent; the character executes a predetermined symbolic role without internal friction or embodied emotion. The final vigil lacks dramatized cost or credible endurance; we see only a ceremonial tableau. Motivation exists as told purpose ("to let a garden reclaim a battlefield") rather than lived conflict that forecloses options on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (lyric resonance through seed imagery and ceremonial cadence), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the coachman arrives, scatters seeds, and departs without on-page escalation. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (luminescent roots = charged image), yet the cost remains asserted ("submerged concord...a resurrection") rather than felt or conceptual with visible price. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. The single-scene ritual lacks the pressure accumulation required for high-band entry under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blooming jetty, spectral horses, and luminescent roots supply vivid, selective detail filtered through a ceremonial tone. The jetty's weathered planks and sea flowers anchor the ritual spatially, and the seeds finding "crevices where hope might take root" tie setting to action. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or force a tactical shift; it serves as backdrop to predetermined ceremony, preventing 9-band eligibility per the quick test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (ecological-spiritual restoration) is signaled early, but no on-page reversal or tightening occurs—the coachman performs his ritual without opposition, adaptation, or visible trade-off. Escalation reads as ceremonial description rather than pressure that narrows options. The "work" is completed off-page during the vigil; the seeds' sprouting is told consequence, not dramatized cost. No agency-driven turn that forecloses a path with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (restoration, concord between humanity and nature) emerges through recurring seed and reef imagery, and the final luminescent roots offer non-literal closure. However, the thematic question is never tested under pressure—the coachman's purpose meets no friction, and the ending's "resurrection" is asserted via poetic summary ("a voice...a body...a resurrection") rather than earned through scene pressure. The piece invites reflection but delivers thematic statement in place of dramatized complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Narrative voice is consistent—elevated, ceremonial diction with purposeful archaism ("Tempus est," "dead languages"). Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, the register never modulates under pressure, and the single line of spoken dialogue ("Now...though the world has forgotten") attributed to a tern reads as thematic ventriloquism. Perceptual signature is generic ceremonial rather than character-specific; the coachman's "way of noticing" lacks idiosyncratic bias or selective attention that would distinguish his interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dense figurative language pervades without pattern-taught payoff: "narrow vastness," "submerged concord," "gloom-hill coachman" pile symbolic weight atop every beat, flattening propulsion (density penalty −0.5). Template cadence runs appear in adjacent explanatory clauses ("his motivation was clear: to let..."; "his work was not merely ecological but spiritual") that stall rather than advance (−0.4). Paraphrase loops recur: "promises between realms" / "promises kept and broken," and "the hollow expanse that mirrored the hollow in the coachman's ancient heart" repeats the same image without added pressure (−0.3). Artifacts touch multiple beats but not the closure image itself, so cumulative penalty remains within Q7. Clarity is maintained, but momentum is diluted by overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise (mythic coachman performs ecological ritual) follows a stock template: lone archetypal figure enacts symbolic restoration in a wounded world. Execution leans on generic elevated diction ("ancient heart," "sacred ritual," "silent conversation") without specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The tern's "future and past in equal measure" and the luminescent roots offer surface novelty but do not transform the archetype into a particular character with stakes. Derivative premise without transformation warrants −1.0 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The gloom-hill coachman is present in all three gates (setup, middle beats, closure vigil) and scatters seeds in multiple beats, but his actions are ritualized rather than decision-driven. No on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost; he executes a predetermined purpose. Present and functional but lacks the causal pressure or closure-shaping agency required for higher bands. Three gates met +1.4; multiple beats +0.9; swappable with any archetypal restorer −0.6; no visible cost tied to his choice −0.5 = ~4.2, capped at 4.6 by lack of decision pressure, rounded to 3.2 after applying ornamental penalty.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Seed pods appear early (setup), are handled in the scattering beat (middle), and sprout luminescent roots at closure (payoff). All three gates met. The pods enable the ritual and their transformation charges the final image with conceptual weight (concord embodied). Early signal +0.6; two distinct beats +0.9; closure linkage +1.0; specificity (dried pods containing "remnants of...concord") +0.5 = ~6.0 base, lifted by charged reprise to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Submerged concord is named in exposition and echoed thematically ("no longer submerged entirely") but does not shape on-page stakes or constrain tactics. The concept exists as abstract label rather than dramatized pressure. Present in closure as thematic claim +0.4; no middle development or causal work −1.0; swappable with "broken covenant" or similar −0.6 = ~3.8, raised slightly for closure mention to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Dead languages attribute is mentioned ("Tempus est," "dead languages...not spoken by living tongues for millennia") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It exists as flavor text without mechanical or causal consequence. Present +0.3; no beat involvement or closure linkage; ornamental −0.8; label-only −0.3 = ~2.2, rounded up for vivid mention to 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fertilize (scattering seeds, enabling growth) is the coachman's central action, present in setup, executed in middle beats, and resolved at closure with luminescent sprouting. All three gates met. The action defines the ritual and its outcome reweights the premise. Early signal +0.7; multiple beats +0.9; closure linkage +1.2; causal pressure (growth depends on this act) +0.8 = ~7.6, slightly reduced for lack of felt personal cost to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Bird calls appear in setup (tern's cry "Now") and guide the moment of scattering, shaping timing if not mechanics. Two gates met (setup, middle payoff). The tern's message influences when the coachman acts, though the "understanding" itself is asserted rather than dramatized. Early signal +0.5; one beat involvement +0.4; causal nudge (timing) +0.6; no closure participation −0.2; summary-only ("by understanding") −0.4 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Blooming jetty at twilight is present in setup, hosts all middle action (scattering, tide turning), and its transformation into luminous garden charges the closure. All three gates met. The jetty's crevices enable seed-planting, and its blooming state symbolizes resilience that frames the ritual. Early signal +0.7; multiple beats +0.9; closure linkage +1.0; causal constraint (crevices as planting sites) +0.6; specificity +0.5 = ~7.7, slightly reduced for lack of tactical pressure to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the reef died three seasons past" is signaled in setup and provides backstory stakes (ocean's "last sigh of vibrant life"), but does not tighten on-page decisions or create live clock pressure. The vigil "until dawn" marks elapsed time without tactical consequence. Setup present +0.5; no middle development or closure tightening; static backstory rather than live pressure −0.7 = ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to let a garden reclaim a battlefield" is stated explicitly in exposition and governs the coachman's ritual, appearing in setup, middle beats, and closure. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice or friction. All three gates met +1.4; multiple beats +0.9; closure relevance +0.7; told-only with no internal friction −1.0; summary rather than embodied want −0.6 = ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone "narrow vastness" is explicitly named and sustained through images of solitary action against infinite scope ("the smallness of his solitary actions against the infinite scope...the enormity of what might yet be restored"). The phrase recurs and modulates through the ritual, charging the jetty's expansion metaphor at closure ("narrow in form yet vast in significance"). Early signal +0.7; coherent across beats +0.9; closure charge +1.0; rhythmic control under ceremonial pressure +0.6; explicit naming rather than purely embodied tone −0.5 = ~6.7.</comment>
