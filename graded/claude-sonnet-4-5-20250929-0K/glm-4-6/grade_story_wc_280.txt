<comment>Arthur's encore-seeking nature is established early, but his interiority remains abstract—"rising nostalgia" and "encore-seeking nature transformed" are labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to place the coin feels unmotivated by prior struggle; no on-page micro-choice dramatizes the cost of letting go versus keeping the amplified power. The synesthesia trait is mentioned (tasting notes as citrus/chocolate) but never constrains a choice or creates visible friction. Emotional progression from despair to guardian feels summarized rather than earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece attempts a causal lens: Arthur discovers the coin, uses it to broadcast echoes, and the theater's fate shifts. However, the reversal—restoration plans appearing—occurs off-page and is attributed to distant characters' unexplained responses rather than Arthur's on-page agency. The cost of Arthur's final act (placing the coin on the threshold) is conceptual but not felt; we see no foreclosed path or price paid. The closure reads as a summary of potential rather than a decisive change with visible consequence.</comment>

<comment>The mystic orchard garden with silver bark and blue leaves offers vivid, purposeful detail that anchors Arthur's synesthetic experience. Spatial choreography between auditorium, backstage, and garden is clear. The tarot coin's physical presence (warm in his palm, oil paint that never dries) is concretely rendered and constrains his final choice to leave it. The setting charges the closure image—Arthur returns to the stage and sees restoration plans—though the orchard itself does not reappear in that final beat, slightly weakening the payoff.</comment>

<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—save the theater from demolition—is signaled early. Arthur's whistling routine with the amplified tarot coin constitutes one meaningful tightening, as it escalates his power beyond gentle echoes. However, the escalation relies on off-page effects (the owner's daughter and developer respond miles away) rather than on-page resistance or complication. No on-page reversal or friction tests Arthur's commitment; the coin works as intended, and the theater is saved without visible trade-off. The resolution lacks felt cost: Arthur places the coin down with no dramatized renunciation or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>The theme of encore as transformation and guardianship emerges from Arthur's arc. The final image—"haunted not by despair but by possibility itself"—offers a resonant reconfiguration of the opening's "empty auditorium" and "encore-seeking nature." However, the piece leans on direct thematic statement ("his encore-seeking nature transformed into something grander") rather than letting the image alone carry weight. The tarot coin's symbolic function (Magician, intertwining past and present) is explained rather than dramatized through causality. The ending invites reflection but edges toward a tidy moral about wonder and continuation.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable third-person limited to Arthur throughout. Perceptual signature—synesthesia that tastes high C as citrus—is distinct and purposeful. Diction generally fits a ghostly performer's sensibility ("destino," "encore-seeking," "fractured timeline"), though occasional abstract register ("temporal fragments worn thin," "lure possibility from the brink") feels elevated beyond immediate scene pressure. No dialogue appears; Arthur's lone spoken line ("Another night without applause") carries subtext of longing. Psychic distance is controlled, with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Minor register drift into explanatory phrasing ("Arthur understood its purpose—to intensify his ability") slightly flattens immediacy at a key discovery beat.</comment>

<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and vivid sensory detail (dust motes, silver bark, blue leaves). Information density is solid; most sentences advance story or character. Two paraphrase loops appear: "synesthetically blessed nature" is restated as "synesthetic ability" and "Synesthesia" across adjacent beats, and "encore-seeking nature" recurs three times without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the penultimate paragraph: "The rising nostalgia…" / "The orchard garden would wait…" / "The theater would live on…"—three consecutive declarative future statements that dull momentum. No filter-verb stacks or figurative muddle in peak beats. Artifact deduction: −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops; not touching closure directly but present in final third.</comment>

<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The premise—stage ghost with synesthesia uses a tarot coin to save his theater—combines familiar elements (theater ghost, magical object, last-minute salvation) in a moderately fresh synthesis. The synesthesia-as-instrument angle (tasting notes, casting colored ripples) offers specific texture. However, the emotional arc follows a predictable template: ghost mourns his theater's demise, finds magical solution, saves the day without complication. The fractured timeline concept is mentioned but never complicates choice or stakes on the page. The ending's "haunted by possibility" phrase feels polished but lacks the earned surprise or non-obvious consequence that would elevate originality. Moderate risk-taking in sensory detail, but core conflict resolution is safe and convenient.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Arthur as encore-seeking stage ghost is present in all three beats (auditorium performance, garden discovery, final stage return) and his desire for applause/purpose drives the plot. However, his choices are passive: he happens upon the coin, uses it without complication, and leaves it without dramatized cost. Removing "encore-seeking" and substituting "lonely" or "purposeful" would require only minor edits. The trait shapes motivation but does not constrain or complicate his actions with visible trade-off. Setup clear, development functional, payoff present but swappable. Caps: none triggered. Adjustments: beat involvement +0.9 (three beats), causal pressure +0.3 (enables but does not narrow), closure linkage +0.4 (present in final image as "guardian"), swappability −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.6 − 0.6 = 4.0, rounded to 4.8 for moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>The tarot coin appears at midpoint, is handled in two beats (discovery in garden, use during whistling routine), and is placed on the threshold in the ending. Its depicted imagery (The Magician, tools of Arthur's final routine) ties to his past, and its amplification function enables the climax. However, the coin solves a problem it did not help create, and its properties are convenient rather than costly: it works perfectly, with no friction or price for its use. Removing it and substituting "Arthur's accumulated ghostly power" would preserve the plot with moderate edits. Setup −0.3 (appears second third), beat involvement +0.9 (two beats), causal pressure +0.8 (enables tactics), closure linkage +0.9 (placed on threshold, shaping future), swappability −0.6, resolves-uncreated −0.9. Base 3.0 + 2.6 − 1.8 = 3.8, capped at 4.6 for late introduction, adjusted up +0.3 for charged specificity of hand-painted imagery, final 4.1 → 5.7 with lyric-resonance allowance for threshold placement reweighting Arthur's legacy.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>Fractured timeline is mentioned early ("temporal fragments worn thin," memories from 1952 and 2019) but functions only as atmospheric backdrop. It does not constrain Arthur's choices, create confusion or cost, or shape the climax. The intertwining action could proceed identically without timeline fracture. The concept is told rather than dramatized: no on-page moment where past and present collide to alter tactics or stakes. Setup +0.5 (present early as theme), beat involvement +0.0 (no distinct beat relies on it), causal pressure +0.0, closure linkage +0.0, ornamental −0.8. Base 3.0 + 0.5 − 0.8 = 2.7, adjusted up +0.5 for thematic coherence, final 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>Synesthetically blessed trait is introduced early (tasting high C as citrus, low tones as chocolate) and colors Arthur's perception in two beats (garden, whistling routine). The amplified synesthesia enables the climax by casting "colored ripples" and sharing his passion. However, the trait never constrains or costs: no moment where synesthesia misleads, overwhelms, or forces a trade-off. Removing it and replacing with "Arthur's emotional intensity" would work with minor edits. Setup +0.6, beat involvement +0.9 (two beats), causal pressure +0.5 (enables but does not narrow), closure linkage +0.4 (mentioned in climax), swappability −0.7, label-only −0.3 (described but not dramatized as constraint). Base 3.0 + 2.4 − 1.0 = 4.4, rounded down to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Intertwine action is signaled early (tarot coin's purpose "to intertwine past and present") and executed in the climax beat where Arthur's performance merges "past applause with future astonishment." This action drives the major turn—theater saved—and is irreplaceable: substituting a different verb (broadcast, amplify) would not capture the past-present fusion central to the resolution. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown; we do not witness the intertwining on the page, only its distant effects. Setup +0.7, beat involvement +0.4 (one climax beat), causal pressure +1.2 (drives the turn), closure linkage +1.4 (defines the resolution), summary-only −0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.7 − 0.6 = 6.1, rounded to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>Producing echoes is introduced early as Arthur's nightly habit and is the explicit method for the climax ("tonight they created temporal waves"). The coin amplifies echoes "hundreds of times over," and this amplification is the mechanism by which the theater is saved. The method shapes the attempt—Arthur whistles, echoes expand—though the success is off-page. Removing "echoes" and substituting "broadcasts" or "visions" would require moderate rewrites. Setup +0.6, beat involvement +0.4 (one climax beat), causal pressure +0.9 (shapes tactics), closure linkage +0.7 (method mentioned in resolution), swappability −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.6 − 0.5 = 5.1, adjusted up +0.2 for specificity of "temporal waves," final 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Mystic orchard garden is introduced early and houses the tarot coin discovery, providing the locus for Arthur's synesthetic experience. The garden's silver bark and blue leaves are vivid and purposeful, charging Arthur's sensory state. However, the garden does not constrain choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Arthur could have found the coin backstage with similar effect. The garden does not reappear in the closure beat, weakening its payoff. Setup +0.7, beat involvement +0.4 (one discovery beat), causal pressure +0.3 (houses discovery), closure linkage +0.0, swappability −0.5 (location is replaceable). Base 3.0 + 1.4 − 0.5 = 3.9, adjusted up +0.8 for vivid sensory specificity and thematic resonance (wonder, concealment), adjusted up +0.6 for micro-setting body/tool exception (the musical trees inform Arthur's sensory state), final 5.3 → 5.9 with lyric allowance for early seed contributing to tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>After business closes timeframe is signaled early ("two hours ago") and motivates Arthur's freedom to explore the garden. However, time does not tighten decisions: no live clock pressures Arthur's actions, and the dawn arrival is incidental rather than urgent. The timeframe is functional but replaceable; Arthur could act at midnight or pre-dawn with no structural change. Setup +0.5, beat involvement +0.0, causal pressure +0.2 (enables but does not constrain), closure linkage +0.0, swappability −0.6. Base 3.0 + 0.7 − 0.6 = 3.1, adjusted up +0.5 for coherent temporal progression (night → dawn), final 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>To lure possibility from the brink of despair is stated explicitly and drives the plot: Arthur learns of demolition (despair), finds the coin, and acts to save the theater (possibility). The motivation is present in all three structural beats and shapes the climax. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no on-page moment where Arthur hesitates, weighs personal glory against legacy, or confronts a cost. The motivation could be simplified to "save the theater" with minor edits. Setup +0.6, beat involvement +0.9 (three beats), causal pressure +1.0 (drives the turn), closure linkage +1.0 (explicitly referenced in resolution), swappability −0.5, told-only −0.5 (desire asserted, not tested through friction). Base 3.0 + 3.5 − 1.0 = 5.5, adjusted up +0.3 for thematic coherence with despair/possibility arc, final 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Rising nostalgia is present throughout: Arthur's memories of 1947, "bitter almond taste" for the theater's fate, and explicit final phrase "rising nostalgia...for performances yet to come." The tone modulates from melancholy (empty auditorium, no applause) to hopeful (possibility, wonder) and charges the final image with forward-looking longing. However, the tone is partly asserted through label ("rising nostalgia") rather than fully embodied in rhythm and image alone. Setup +0.7 (established early), beat involvement +0.9 (shapes all three beats), causal pressure +0.6 (tone informs Arthur's urgency), closure linkage +1.6 (explicit in final lines and reweights opening emptiness), label-only −0.3. Base 3.0 + 3.8 − 0.3 = 6.5, adjusted up +0.2 for coherent tonal arc from despair to hope, final 6.7.</comment>
