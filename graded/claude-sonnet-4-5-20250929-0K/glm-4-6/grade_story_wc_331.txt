<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The librarian remains a static cipher throughout; her "sanely eccentric" nature is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses or embodied through micro-choices under pressure. The scarf's tightening and the portal crossing are narrated rather than felt as stakes that foreclose options. Interiority consists of abstract metaphysical declarations ("The stories lived here, not as words, but as living geometries") rather than character-particular perception. No meaningful change or credible endurance with visible cost emerges—she completes her "mission" without any trade-off or genuine struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but the librarian's concrete goal and the scene's spatial logic remain vague throughout (−0.4). No legible closure unit: the librarian "steps through" and "returns" with no on-page decisive change, felt cost, or reconfiguration of prior stakes—the "mission complete" is asserted, not dramatized. The drive lens is ambiguous (drifts among causal gestures, accumulative atmosphere, and concept-first abstraction) and never resolves to a coherent mode at closure. The "reawakening" is told as summary rather than enacted with visible cost or constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "scientific poetry library" and "hyperbolic geometry" are named but remain generic placeholder concepts without tactile detail or spatial constraint. The scarf's frayed silk and the dusty shelves appear early, and the scarf returns at closure, creating a purposeful reprise that reweights the librarian's journey; this lyric callback lifts the score into the mid-5s despite the lack of environment-as-pressure. The "odd hours" timeframe and browsing patrons supply ambient setting but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the place where stories live"—is declared but never tested by an on-page reversal, trade-off, or tightening choice that narrows options. The librarian walks, traces, steps through a portal, and returns without any visible cost, opposition, or escalation; the "hyperbolic space" reweights nothing because no prior constraint was established. Coincidence (a "subtle hum") initiates the sequence, and convenience (the scarf as compass, the door appearing) resolves it. No protagonist agency or felt price is legible at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>A coherent theme—stories as living geometries beyond ink—emerges from recurring images (the scarf, the library's curves, the analog memories). However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "The library was no longer just a building; it was a living organism, its heart the librarian herself" is Thematic Echo that replaces earned resonance with declaration (−0.6). The scarf's return from tattered to whole is a purposeful image, but it is undercut by the explanatory coda. Subtext operates minimally; most meaning is stated rather than implied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into abstract academic register ("hyperbolic geometry," "theorems in the dust," "narrative spiral") that sits uneasily alongside the librarian's tactile world; the narrator's perceptual signature is blurred by concept-first language. Sentence stems recur: "She [verb]" patterns across many beats without purposeful variation. The prose lacks a distinct rhythmic signature—syntax is serviceable but does not modulate with emotional intensity. Filter verbs ("felt a flicker," "knew the library's geometry") appear frequently, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "stories live…as living, breathing entities" / "The stories lived here" / "the stories lived, breathed, and waited" recycle the same assertion across multiple beats without added pressure (−0.6). Template cadence: runs of "She [verb]" stems across seven consecutive sentences in the portal sequence (−0.5). Figurative language density is high in peak beats ("her footprints tracing theorems," "each curve a line of poetry") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating metaphor muddle (−0.4). The final third is loaded with these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Information density is low; many sentences restate the librarian's completed mission without advancing action or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—librarian seeking living stories via hyperbolic geometry—gestures at originality but executes as a checklist: "scientific poetry library," "analog memories," "hyperbolic geometry" are invoked as labels rather than transformed through specific mechanics or lived detail. The emotional arc and plot beats could be transplanted to any metaphysical library quest without loss. The scarf's transformation (tattered → whole) offers a fresh inflection but is undercut by the didactic final summary. No bold risk that heightens stakes is visible; the story retreats into safe abstraction rather than committing to the implications of its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The odd-hour librarian is present throughout and frames the narrative, but her choices do not create key turns—she observes the hum, follows the scarf's pull, and steps through the portal without on-page decision or trade-off. The "mission complete" is declared rather than earned through agency. Functional role without causal pressure: mid-3s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tattered silk scarf appears in the opening beat (setup), tightens as a compass in the middle (development), and returns "whole again" at closure (payoff). Two-gate early–final reprise that reweights the librarian's journey, but the scarf never constrains a choice or imposes visible cost; its transformation is asserted rather than felt. Lyric resonance lifts it into the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Analog memories—books, scrolls, handwritten notes—are named early but remain ornamental: they "pulsed with life" at the end as assertion, not through on-page mechanics that shaped stakes or tactics. The concept is echoed as theme rather than operationalized to change options. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is declared twice as a label without enabling or constraining an on-page action with visible cost. The attribute does not alter the librarian's choices or impose a trade-off. Ornamental mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is declared as the librarian's mission and asserted as complete in the final paragraph, but the action is not dramatized through a specific, irreversible beat that redefines options. The stories "pulsing with life" is told rather than shown. Functional but replaceable; swappable with "restore" or "revive" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is named in the middle third and invoked at closure ("hyperbolic space folded back"), but its mechanics never matter—no attempt, constraint, or specificity shows how it differs from generic magic. The method is ornamental label without on-page demonstration. Late mention, no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library anchors the opening and supplies ambient atmosphere ("dusty shelves," "forgotten verses"). The walls curve and shelves stretch in the middle sequence, suggesting spatial transformation, but this does not constrain a choice or alter the librarian's tactics—she walks "without walking" through it. Setup and development present, but no closure linkage; setting remains backdrop rather than pressure. Functional but low causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "while patrons browse" is mentioned in the opening and closing paragraphs, but the patrons remain static scenic elements who "browsed on, oblivious." No ticking clock tightens decisions or alters tactics; time is untracked. Ornamental framing without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the place where stories live" is declared early and drives the librarian's forward motion, but it is never dramatized through friction, trade-off, or conflicted choice—she follows the scarf and completes the mission without visible cost. Told-only desire without on-page struggle. Functional setup, no development cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Tone of "observed solitude" is coherent through the browsing patrons and the librarian's silent watch; it modulates slightly when the scarf glows and the portal opens. The final image returns to the quiet watch, charging the solitude with the weight of her journey. Coherent through turns with a modest payoff at closure, but the tone does not deepen pressure or impose cost. Mid-band integration.</comment>
