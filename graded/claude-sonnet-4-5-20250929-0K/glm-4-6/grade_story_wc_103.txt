<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("to discover the texture of time") remains abstract throughout; his micro-choices (gripping the fragment, running through the maze) are physical but don't embody contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The wife's disintegration and his retrocognitive trap are told rather than dramatized through embodied conflict. Interiority relies on therapy-adjacent phrasing ("quaking reverie," "fractured mind") rather than character-particular perception. The final renunciation ("Let me go") is conceptually present but feels declared rather than earned through prior on-page choices that foreclose paths with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "hedge maze designer" and "living bridge garden" anchor role and place early, but the retrocognitive trap mechanism and timeline remain abstract past 120 words. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density increase through hyperbolic imagery converging at the tree of light), and closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: Elias destroys the fragment, erasing the wife and accepting the "utterly, beautifully empty" future. Causality is loose—why destroying the fragment ends the trap is asserted rather than built through prior rules. The cost is legible in the final image ("rough, unyielding, and utterly, beautifully empty"), satisfying the Accumulative lens requirement for a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The living bridge garden supplies vivid, purpose-driven imagery (bridges "pulsed faintly, as if breathing," "looped into the canopy," "writhing"), and the hyperbolic geometry constrains Elias's navigation ("paths folding back on themselves"). The tree of light at the center charges the final image. However, spatial choreography drifts—distances, exact positions, and the staircase's sudden appearance lack coherent anchoring. The garden functions more as symbolic backdrop than lived-in space that alters tactics through proximity or access.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (sever ties to the past/wife by destroying the fragment) is signaled early and tightens through the descent and tree confrontation. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase (garden shudders, bridges writhe, fragment heats) rather than plot reversals. Agency is present: Elias chooses to descend and raise the fragment at the tree. However, the resolution mechanism (merging fragment with tree triggers maze collapse) is not constrained by prior rules—it feels asserted. The cost ("she was gone, erased not by time but by his own hand") is felt but abstract; no concrete trade-off or visible forfeiture shapes the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (the texture of time, memory as trap vs. liberation) emerges from the fragment/photographs/maze particulars and avoids overt moralizing. The final image ("rough, unyielding, and utterly, beautifully empty") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the wife's shift from "smile dissolved like ash" to "strong, unsmiling, her eyes locked on his" at the end introduces a late contradiction without prior grounding, weakening thematic coherence. Subtext operates in silence and image (fragments "burning out like dying stars"), but peak moments lean on abstract poeticism ("sliver of heaven," "quaking reverie") rather than earned particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias. However, perceptual signature is generic: elevated diction ("hyperbolic geometry," "retrocognitively trapped," "quaking reverie") exceeds a character mid-crisis and reads prompt-driven rather than voice-motivated. Register drifts into abstract poeticism at peak pressure ("the texture of time finally his to touch: rough, unyielding, and utterly, beautifully empty"). Psychic distance is inconsistent—intimate access to Elias's embodied fear alternates with detached metaphor-heavy narration. No dialogue is present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff: "looped into impossible spirals," "time itself were chewing them to bits," "hyperbolic geometry shifting beneath him," "branches dripping with halo fragments." Mixed metaphors accumulate: bridges "pulsed faintly, as if breathing" yet also "disintegrating into petals"; photographs "crumbling to dust" yet earlier "edges curling inward." Template cadence appears in repeated "the fragment + verb" constructions and "He + past tense" stems. Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("felt the hyperbolic geometry collapse," "saw her") dull immediacy. Paraphrase loops: "garden resisted" → "garden seemed to pulse in answer" within two sentences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The hedge maze as mind-trap and halo fragments as memory anchors offer a conceptually rich premise. However, execution leans on genre furniture (retrocognitive trap, hyperbolic geometry, living bridges) without transforming them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The wife's disintegration and Elias's designer role remain abstract labels rather than particular synthesis. The final move (destroying the fragment to erase the past) follows predictable logic. Elevated diction and metaphor density read as surface novelty rather than earned from character or world logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's role as designer is mentioned early but does not constrain his present choices—he navigates the maze but his design knowledge does not enable tactics or create irony. His final decision (raising the fragment) is not specific to his designer expertise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in setup (gripped, humming), middle (heating, casting light), and closure (raised, merging with tree). It constrains Elias's movement (heat sears skin) and enables the final act. However, its properties are asserted late (merging with tree dissolves maze) without prior mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Fading photographs are present in setup (edges curling, woman's smile dissolving) and middle (crumbling to dust). They shape the dominant stake (sever ties to the past). However, they do not constrain a present choice—Elias's actions are driven by the fragment, not the photos themselves.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is a label mentioned in the first paragraph but never dramatized through action. The trap manifests as emotional obsession with photographs rather than a constraint on time perception or choice. Swappable with "haunted" or "obsessed."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Disintegrate" appears at closure (fragment dissolves the maze; bridges disintegrate into petals; wife erased) and is signaled in the middle goal statement. It redefines the stakes and charges the final image. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than built through prior attempts or constraints.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is mentioned repeatedly as description ("paths twisting like ribbons," "hyperbolic geometry shifting") but its mechanics never constrain a choice or enable a tactic. It remains atmospheric label rather than functional method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is present throughout (setup, middle navigation, closure tree). Bridges writhe and the spiral staircase forces descent, shaping Elias's path. The tree of light anchors the climax. However, spatial logic is loose—bridges and staircase appear as needed rather than as coherent constraints.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated in the first paragraph and echoed at closure ("the texture of time finally his to touch"). However, it remains abstract—no on-page choice tests the friction between this desire and its cost. The stated motivation does not shape a middle decision or renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" is invoked explicitly in paragraph one and modulates through escalation (garden shudders, fragment buzzes, air crackles). It charges the final image ("utterly, beautifully empty"). However, tone remains uniformly elevated and dreamlike without clear modulation under pressure—no shift from urgency to stillness or vice versa that marks the closure beat.</comment>
