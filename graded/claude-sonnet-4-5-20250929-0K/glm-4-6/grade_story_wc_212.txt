<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Motivation is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses—"furiously tranquil" is asserted repeatedly as a label rather than shown through embodied micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist's internal experience remains abstract and uniform throughout; the peak act (pressing the acorn cap, stepping through) proceeds without visible friction or cost that would reveal character limits. Agency reads as execution of a predetermined ritual rather than choice that forecloses a path. Interiority leans on stock phrases ("heat of purpose," "wild serenity") and the reflection on the vortex inheritance operates as exposition rather than tilt to present stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is established (icebound atrium, post-egg-hatching), but causality is unclear: the egg hatching released "vortex inheritance" three cycles ago, yet the story never dramatizes how this inheritance constrains present options or why *now* is the moment to reopen the chamber. The closure—syncing borrowed time with the great-grandmother and recalibrating the inheritance—occurs on the page, but the cost is conceptual and told ("frantic energy was gone") rather than felt through a decisive trade-off or forfeiture. The middle builds texture but not because/therefore linkage; the protagonist performs gestures and whispers a language, then steps through without a meaningful tightening that narrows live options. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural attempting Causal closure, but the recalibration is asserted rather than earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The icebound atrium and starlit dome anchor setting early and vivid sensory detail (cold enough to crack stone, ice crystals rearranging) is selective and purposeful. The oak acorn cap's physical interaction—pressing into the floor depression, sinking into pliant ice—constrains the protagonist's action and charges the closure beat when it fuses seamlessly. The transition to the warmer, soil-scented Temporal Stasis Chamber offers contrast that supports the thematic shift. Micro-setting (the cap, the floor seam) functions as tool and anchor, meeting the 9+ gate test by shaping the final action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recalibrating the vortex inheritance—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: the protagonist kneels, performs gestures, and steps through without a live complication or reversal that narrows options. The "method" (decreasing entropy) is narrated as successful execution rather than a tactic tested under resistance. Agency is present (she chooses to step through) but the choice costs nothing on the page; the transformation from "frantic" to "serene" is told in summary. No escalation or deepening alters tactics; coincidence (the cap fits perfectly) enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—balance and the mastery of inherited time—emerges from the premise and images (borrowed time, entropy reduction, syncing with ancestor), but the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "She was no longer just a saver of seeds; she was the keeper of balance." The texture-of-time motif is treated as a thematic claim rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in the ice-crystal rearrangement and the warm soil contrast, yet the ending articulates its own thesis rather than letting resonance land through particulars. The vortex inheritance as curse-turned-command reads conceptually sound but abstracted from lived cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, distance controlled, but diction drifts into elevated register ("poem of reduction," "hole in the fabric of causality") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. The protagonist's perceptual signature is vague—her attention to cold, starlight, and texture is generic rather than biased by archival training or lineage obsession. Purposeful compression in the gesture-whispering beat is acceptable, but the voice lacks distinct idiom; phrases like "frantic archivists" and "wild serenity" recur as template descriptors. No head-hopping, but the narration smooths emotional intensity rather than modulating rhythm under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops: "furiously tranquil" appears three times; "borrowed time" and "vortex inheritance" cycle without added meaning. Template cadence in the opening: "She was furiously tranquil... her breath a plume... She was furiously tranquil, a state she had cultivated..." Stock metaphors ("heat of purpose," "poem of reduction") stack in high-pressure beats without specificity. Register drift into lyric abstraction ("seam of perfect darkness split the ground, expanding not outward but inward") obscures rather than clarifies the action. Information density is moderate—each sentence gestures at advancement—but scaffold phrases ("the method was far more elegant," "the texture of the borrowed time was here") delay rather than propel. Artifacts touch multiple beats but not the final syncing image, so penalties remain in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—seed saver safeguarding time via entropy reduction—offers a fresh synthesis of archival lineage and thermodynamic magic, but the emotional arc (frantic to serene) follows a familiar enlightenment template. The oak acorn cap and ice-atrium imagery are specific, yet the vortex inheritance and Temporal Stasis Chamber read as invented-for-prompt rather than lived-in world logic. Tropes (ancestral duty, magical key, stepping through threshold) are executed cleanly but not transformed. The texture-of-time conceit is conceptually intriguing yet remains abstract; no micro-detail makes it irreplaceably *this* protagonist's discovery. Transformation test: swap "seed saver" for "archivist" or "timekeeper" and the arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Present throughout; kneels, presses cap, steps through, touches ancestor, syncs time. Two gates: setup (present from line one) and closure (active in final syncing). Development is weak—her middle choices (gesture, whisper) proceed without friction. Causal pressure is low: she executes a ritual rather than making a turn that narrows options. Swappable with "timekeeper" or "archivist" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>All three gates: introduced early ("fingers tightened around the oak acorn cap"), middle (pressed into floor depression, sinks into pliant floor), closure (fused seamlessly, "purpose served"). Beats: held (touch one), pressed (touch two), fused (closure). Causal: the cap's fit is "testament to foresight" and enables the gateway opening. Specificity: the ridges worn smooth by lineage and the perfect-fit mechanic are irreplaceable. Cost is indirect—once fused, it cannot be retrieved—but the price is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Present as backstory anchor (egg hatched three cycles ago, released vortex inheritance) and thematic claim (curse to command). Gates: setup (first paragraph), closure (recalibration declared). Middle development is summary-only—"frantic circulation slowing to deliberate pulse" is told. The concept is asserted to shape stakes (accelerated experience trap) but does not constrain an on-page choice; the protagonist performs gestures without testing whether the vortex resists or adapts. Swappable with "temporal burden" or "chronal inheritance."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Label-only. "Furiously tranquil" appears three times as assertion but never constrains an action: no beat shows her choosing stillness over urgency or vice versa. The state is cultivated backstory, not a visible tradeoff on the page. The final paragraph repeats "wild serenity" as synonym churn. Gates: setup (declared early), absent in middle and closure. No cost tied to maintaining or breaking the state.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>All three gates: setup (stated goal: "reopen the Temporal Stasis Chamber"), middle (acorn cap pressed, floor splits), closure (she steps through, gateway accessed). Beats: stated, executed, completed. Causal: reopening is the dominant action and enables the syncing. Cost: stepping through risks unknown consequence, though the risk is not dramatized. Specificity: the chamber is unique to this world logic. The action defines the arc, but the reopening itself proceeds without resistance—she whispers, the floor yields—so escalation is low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup and closure present: signaled ("by decreasing entropy") and executed (ice crystals rearrange, floor becomes pliant, entropy reduced at closure). Middle development: gestures and whispers "coax order from chaos," but the mechanics remain abstract—no dramatized test of whether entropy resists. The method is unique and irreplaceable within the premise, but its execution is summary rather than tactical problem-solving. Lyric reprise (entropy as order vs. chaos) reweights meaning at closure, lifting score to mid-band despite thin middle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>All three gates: setup (opening line anchors icebound atrium under starlight), middle (cold, crystalline dome, frozen floor depression), closure (atrium solidifies again, cap fused into floor). Sensory detail (cold enough to crack stone, ice rearranging) is vivid. Micro-setting: the floor depression and the cap's fit constrain her action. The starlit dome charges the final image ("looked up at distant stars"). Does not merely describe; the setting supplies the ritual site and the contrast (frozen atrium vs. warm garden) sharpens the thematic shift.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setup present: "three cycles ago" anchors backstory. Development and closure absent: the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock, no urgency tied to cycles. The protagonist acts at her own pace; nothing on the page signals why *now* rather than later. The post-hatching frame is backstory context, not a live constraint. Swappable with any vague "after the event" anchor.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Told-only. Setup: stated in first paragraph ("to discover the texture of borrowed time"). Closure: asserted ("The texture of the borrowed time was here—it was not a grit or a smoothness, but a resonance"). Middle: no on-page friction between this desire and cost. The discovery is narrated as achieved rather than dramatized through failed attempts or trade-offs. The want does not conflict with fear or need. Summary-only use caps score; lyric reprise at closure provides mild lift but does not overcome ornamental integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup and closure present: "wild serenity" and "furiously tranquil" frame the piece and recur in final paragraph. Middle modulation is weak—tone remains uniformly lyric-abstract without shift under pressure. The oxymoric pairing is purposeful and charges the final image (the calm mastery), but the tone does not adapt to escalation; no syntactic tightening or sensory narrowing during the ritual execution. Lyric coherence across turns qualifies for mid-band; closure linkage lifts slightly, but static delivery caps higher reach.</comment>
