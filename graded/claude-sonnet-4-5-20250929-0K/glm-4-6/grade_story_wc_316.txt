<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to defeat numbness is asserted but rarely embodied through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The clone exists primarily as philosophical mirror rather than applying immediate relational pressure; their exchange feels thesis-driven ("You feel nothing" / "You feel too much") rather than goal-pursuit with subtext. The final choice to "pour his will" into the jar reads as abstract exertion without the bodily cost or tactical trade-off that would ground it. Interiority leans heavily on diagnostic phrasing ("ego death survival," "emotional numbness," "fugue of disbelief") in place of character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by ~60 words (Kael, floating rock dojo, void); no penalty. The drive lens reads Causal with symbolic overtones: Kael's act of vivifying the brain causes the clone to dissolve. However, the mechanics of "pouring his will" remain opaque—what specific action or cost triggers the synaptic glow is unclear, weakening the because/therefore linkage at closure. The ending delivers a Decisive Change (clone dissolves, Kael claims the brain) with conceptual cost ("alone with the truth"), but the cost feels stated more than felt on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the clone grabs Kael's arm and he must "do more than wake the brain," narrowing his options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and collapsing timelines establish atmosphere, but the environment does not constrain Kael's choices—he could fight anywhere. The brain jar is handled twice (rattling the pedestal, slamming hands against it), yet its physical properties (glass, liquid, distance) never alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague: the clone "lunges," Kael "sidesteps," but distances and body positions remain floating. The void and rewriting history read as conceptual backdrop rather than lived pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—claiming the brain to prove he is the survivor—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: the clone's grip and Kael's realization he must "make it choose" narrows his tactic from simply waking the brain to an emotional gambit. The clone dissolves as a direct result of Kael's action, satisfying causal escalation under the chosen lens. Cost is visible in that the clone is destroyed and Kael is left alone, but the price feels more conceptual than visceral—no stamina drain, injury, or relational loss marks the page beyond the stated loneliness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of authenticity versus copy emerges clearly, and the brain's label "duplicate" carries ironic weight. However, the final paragraph moralizes the theme overtly: "he'd never truly be whole again," "alone with the truth." The piece flirts with a non-literal answer—the survivor is left with a duplicate brain, questioning his own reality—but the last lines summarize rather than trust the image. The brain glowing as "silent companion" is a purposeful callback, yet the conceptual cost remains asserted ("something colder: the certainty") rather than shown through a choice that forecloses warmth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Kael with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature: Kael's way of noticing does not reflect his claimed numbness or training in a character-particular way. Dialogue is sparse and thesis-laden ("You feel nothing" / "And you feel too much"), functioning as exposition rather than subtext or goal pursuit. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("fugue of disbelief," "searing reality of his own existence") that sits uneasily with the embodied crisis. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose does not modulate rhythm or syntax to mirror Kael's stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "He'd survived ego death once, dissolving into the void and clawing his way back" ~10 words after "ego death survival" in the opening; "numbness" recurs nine times without varied embodiment; "the brain glowed" / "the brain's light" / "the brain pulsed" in close succession. Template cadence in the final third: "The clone was gone, but... / The numbness was gone, but... / The brain glowed..." applies identical stems. Figurative language is sparse, avoiding overwriting, but clarity suffers when the vivification mechanism remains abstract ("pouring his will"). Information density is moderate; many lines advance atmosphere without tightening choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The clone custody battle premise and brain-in-jar object are fresh synthesis, but the "original versus copy" question and "who is real" motif are well-trodden in SF. The floating rock dojo and rewriting history add conceptual texture yet function as backdrop rather than transforming the core stakes. Emotional progression—from numbness to "searing reality"—follows a predictable arc; the ending's ambiguity (was Kael the copy all along?) is hinted but not dramatized with new information that reweights prior beats. The piece commits to its premise but does not push beyond familiar territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his identity as ego death survivor frames the stakes. However, the trait itself does not constrain or enable a specific on-page choice with visible cost—his survival of ego death is backstory that motivates the fight but does not shape his tactics in the present. The final victory is attributed to his emotional capacity rather than his prior dissolution experience. Present in setup and ending, but the attribute does not drive a middle turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The brain jar is handled in two distinct beats: Kael strikes the pedestal (jar rattles), then slams both hands against it (synapses fire). The label "duplicate" seeds irony early and returns with reweighted meaning at closure when Kael claims it as "undeniably his." However, the jar's physical properties (glass, liquid, weight) never constrain a choice—Kael's success depends on abstract "will" rather than interaction with the object's material reality. Present in setup, middle, and ending; contributes to closure but could be replaced by another vessel with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The clone custody battle is the dominant stake from paragraph two and drives the entire confrontation. The fight's goal is explicitly to claim the brain and thereby claim "the right to exist without the ache of being a copy." The concept shapes every tactic: the clone's sneer, Kael's counter-assertion, and the final vivification gambit. Closure hinges on the custody resolution—Kael wins, the clone dissolves. Essential across beats and ending; story logic would fail without this exact stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" is mentioned once in dialogue ("You feel nothing" cutting through Kael's calm) but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The clone's accusation is accurate—Kael admits the numbness—so the pretense-cutting does not force a tactical shift. The attribute is present as label but does not drive a turn or recur with altered meaning. Ornamental mention in setup; no middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The action "vivify" is the climactic turn: Kael slams both hands against the jar, the brain "sparkles, synapses firing," and the clone dissolves as a direct result. The act is prepared by his realization that he must "make it choose" and is tied to his unique emotional capacity. However, the mechanics remain vague—"pouring his will" is abstract—so the action could theoretically be replaced by another metaphysical effort. Drives the ending and is hard to swap, but the specificity gap lowers irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Through complementary opposites" is asserted in Kael's training flashback ("light and dark, silence and sound, life and death") but the method does not shape his on-page attempt. The vivification involves pouring "grief, rage, love" (emotions the clone lacks) rather than a structured pairing of opposites. The method is told in the middle third but not demonstrated; Kael's tactic reads as emotional intensity rather than a dialectical technique. Present in middle exposition; no closure participation or constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo frames the scene and the void provides atmospheric stakes ("another timeline collapsed outside"), but the setting does not supply resources or constraints that alter the fight. Kael could battle the clone on solid ground with identical beats. The dojo "trembles" and "shudders" in parallel with the action, offering mood reinforcement without tactical pressure. The void "settling into a new, unblemished night" at closure provides thematic closure but no causal linkage. Present in setup and ending; postcard function in middle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>History rewriting is signaled early ("another memory flickered and died") and recurs at the climax ("history rewriting itself faster now, timelines colliding"). The timeframe tightens Kael's urgency subtly—he must act before the dojo or his own existence is erased. However, the rewrite never directly threatens a specific choice or imposes a visible deadline; Kael's victory stabilizes the dojo, but the causal link (did vivifying the brain stop the rewrite, or coincidence?) remains unclear. Present in setup, middle, and ending; shapes atmosphere and stakes but does not force a tactical pivot.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Defeating emotional numbness is Kael's stated goal and the final lines confirm the numbness is "gone." The motivation is dramatized in two beats: Kael's numbness "cracks like old ice" under strain, and he pours raw emotion into the jar in contrast to the clone. However, the desire is more asserted than conflicted—Kael never hesitates or doubts that defeating numbness is worth the cost. The ending introduces ambiguity ("given it a new name") but does not test the motivation against a competing want. Present across beats and shapes the ending, but lacks internal friction.</comment>
