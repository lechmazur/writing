<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Silas's core motivation—preserving temporal textures—is elaborated through detailed ritual, but his interiority defaults to exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The workshop activity is meticulous yet emotionally flat; we are told of "quiet satisfaction" and "complex sense of both loss and preservation" without witnessing contradictory impulses collide in scene. The ending crystallizes his role as guardian, yet the stance feels declared rather than earned through visible internal struggle or cost. No dialogue or relationship pressure tests the obsession on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph; the lens reads Accumulative/Textural (dawn ritual → stationery creation → evening satisfaction forms a textured arc). The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: Silas moves from charting frequencies to embedding them in gold leaf, and the final image reconfigures his silence-surrounded work as an act of archival resistance. However, the cost remains asserted ("the town's silence had taken so many stories") rather than dramatized in a concrete forfeiture or trade-off at closure, keeping the closure effect in the Resonant Reconfiguration zone without a sharp felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth, fluorescent lamp, and glass workshop anchor early and create a distinct micro-environment. Sensory detail is vivid ("gilded-leaf," "morning dew," "faint hum") and filtered through craft focus. The lamp's hum constrains the dawn ritual method, and the labyrinth "holds its breath" as a witness, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across workbench, lamp corner, and labyrinth exterior, meeting the micro-setting test for choice constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving temporal textures against erasure—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the ritual-to-embedding sequence, but no reversal or tightening narrows options or raises cost on the page; Silas completes twelve cards without friction, loss, or visible trade-off. The ending reweights his work thematically ("small windows into times… lost forever") yet the reweighting is conceptual rather than borne of a dramatized choice that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification would suffice, but the cadence remains steady rather than shifting with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—preservation against erasure, invented history as resistance to silence—emerges through concrete craft rather than assertion, and the stationery embedding method ties concept to stakes. The final image ("chart the hum… refract time into gold") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "guardian of moments, archivist of feeling, creator who could transform silence into resonance" veer toward thematic echo, labeling rather than letting the bonsai and gold-leaf particulars do the work. The question of what Silas sacrifices to sustain his archival solitude remains abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; diction ("incandescent restraint," "earnestly studious") is controlled and voice-particular, matching a craftsman-scholar's perceptual signature. Free indirect interiority remains clean with no head-hopping. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at peaks ("temporal textures," "mystical occurred," "complex sense of both loss and preservation") where simpler craft-minded phrasing would sharpen voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from ritual focus to evening reflection. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing images anchor well. Information density is high in the ritual description, but the piece carries paraphrase loops ("invented histories… greatest artistry… transform… embedding," then "invented histories… his answer… textures of their lives remained accessible") and template stems across expository middle paragraphs ("The stationer's work was driven…" / "Silas worked methodically…"). Stock metaphors cluster: "quiet revolution," "inner fire," "history itself burned." Filter verbs and passive constructions ("was driven," "were his greatest artistry") dull immediacy in several beats. No causality break, but momentum sags mid-passage under scaffolding weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The gilded-leaf stationery embedding "textures of time" via lamp-hum frequency mapping is specific and non-obvious, blending craft ritual with speculative method. The bonsai mountaintop setting and "invented histories" frame offer fresh angles on archival loneliness. However, the core emotional arc—solitary artisan preserving what is lost—reads as a familiar post-apocalyptic lament without a non-obvious moral calculus or risky structural choice. The ending reweights thematically but does not surprise in hindsight; substituting another craft (e.g., sound recording, textile weaving) would leave the arc largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Silas is present throughout and drives the ritual-to-embedding sequence, but his "choices" are procedural rather than stakes-altering. He decides to "close his notepad" and "return to his workbench," yet no beat hinges on a decision that narrows options or reveals cost. The character shapes the method but does not face a turn; observation and execution dominate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The battered notepad is handled in three beats: recording the hum, documenting equations, and making final entries. It anchors the charting method early and returns at evening with consistent function (record-keeping). However, its meaning does not shift; it remains a tool rather than an object reweighted at closure. Present across setup, middle, and payoff, but without causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Invented histories" frames the stakes and appears in setup, middle exposition, and final reflection. The concept shapes Silas's craft motive and the stationery's purpose (embedding temporal textures), constraining his daily ritual. Yet the histories themselves are described rather than tested; no scene shows a recipient touching one or Silas confronting a limit of invention. The concept structures motive but does not drive an on-page turn or choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" is applied as a label ("earnestly studious in his pursuit") and reflected in the meticulous charting ritual. The trait colors his method but does not constrain or enable a specific choice with cost. No scene shows studious precision foreclosing an intuitive alternative or imposing a trade-off. Label-only mention with consistent behavioral echo, no on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Refract" appears in setup ("refract time itself into tangible components"), middle ("his unique method of… refracting time"), and final line ("refract time into gold"). It names the core method and bookends the piece, but the act of refraction is told rather than dramatized in a beat that alters tactics. Swapping "refract" for "distill" or "capture" would require minimal edits. Lyric reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lamp-hum charting method is signaled early, detailed in the dawn ritual beat (positioning, breath held, frequency mapping), and directly enables the gold-leaf embedding in the middle sequence. The mechanics matter: atmospheric conditions and electrical signature guide the temporal texture. Silas's forty-minute charting session shapes the day's stationery output. Present across setup, development (ritual execution), and implicit in payoff (evening satisfaction over the day's work). The method is irreplaceable and causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth is introduced early, anchors the mountaintop isolation, and returns as witness ("seemed to hold its breath") and evening frame ("settled into twilight"). It supplies emotional atmosphere and underscores solitude, but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. No beat shows Silas navigating, tending, or using the labyrinth to solve a problem. Postcard framing with lyric reprise, no micro-setting pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent three springs ago" anchors backstory motivation and frames the urgency of preservation. The timeframe is mentioned in setup and thematic reflection but does not tighten on-page decisions; Silas's routine unfolds without a live clock or deadline. The silence motivates his project conceptually but does not pressure the day's choices or create a visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To collect the textures of different times" is stated early and elaborated through ritual and craft description. The motivation shapes Silas's daily method and the stationery's purpose. However, it is told and illustrated rather than dramatized in conflict; no scene shows a want colliding with a competing need or fear. The ending reflection asserts satisfaction without friction. Setup and payoff present, development consists of execution without internal cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Incandescent restraint" is named mid-piece and reflected in controlled diction, meticulous ritual pacing, and the final "quiet satisfaction." Tone coheres across beats: neither rushed nor emotionally florid. The phrase "results glowed with an inner fire" and the closing "small windows… shone back" echo the incandescent note, charging the final image. Modulation is minimal—pressure remains steady rather than escalating—but the tone is consistent and purpose-driven, meeting coherence and closure-linkage tests.</comment>
