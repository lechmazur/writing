<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The technician's motivations are clear and his observational skill is consistently rendered, but his emotional arc is too smooth—he watches, retrieves, and leaves without meaningful internal conflict. The trapeze artist's ghost is vivid but remains entirely externalized; no contradictory impulses complicate his choices. The final "weightless burden" settling back onto his shoulders reads as a label rather than an embodied shift, and no visible cost forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (dust patterns → ghost vision → object retrieval → release). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure effect is a Resonant Reconfiguration (relief replaces oppression; the ghost dissipates), and the cost is legible in the final image ("cold, dense weight" and "solved riddle" cracks). One meaningful tightening occurs when the vision reveals the hidden object, narrowing his search and reweighting the room's decay as wound rather than mere neglect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned ticket office is vividly rendered with sensory particulars (peeling gilt, water-stained medallion, grimy panes) that filter through the technician's observational lens. The ceiling itself constrains his action—he must climb, work loose lath, retrieve from a cavity—and the space's history (circus, trapeze fall) charges the final image. Dust accumulation and the ceiling's latticework function as micro-setting elements that shape his method and the object's concealment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what ceilings hide—is signaled early and drives each beat: observation → ghost vision → retrieval → resolution. The ghost vision constitutes one meaningful deepening, narrowing his search from pattern analysis to a specific object with emotional weight. The protagonist's agency is clear (he chooses to climb, to work the lath, to pocket the barrel), and the cost is visible: he carries the barrel away, a "cold, dense weight" that replaces the intangible burden he arrived with.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the technician reads "the stylistic calligraphy of neglect," ghosts are "imprints left on the world," and the final act transforms cracks from wounds into "solved a riddle." The horologist's mainspring—a piece of home clutched during the fall—anchors the trapeze artist's tragedy without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer (he has "just read another chapter") that reweights prior material, and the repeated image of cracks shifts from decay to narrative without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent perceptual filter ("his skillfully observant eyes," "he mused"), but the diction occasionally drifts into elevated literary register ("searing moment of failure imprinted," "bittersweet release") that sits uneasily with the technician's pragmatic voice. The prose texture is controlled and rhythmically varied, though some figurative density ("dust lay like a shroud," "truth could begin its slow accretion") edges toward overwriting in a single beat without pattern-teaching. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong with varied syntax and vivid imagery, but several beats stack metaphors without breathing room: "dust lay like a shroud," "specters of motion," "secrets pressed like flowers," "truth could begin its slow accretion" cluster in the opening third. A minor paraphrase loop appears when "weightless burden" recurs at open and close without added pressure between mentions. The final paragraph's "cold, dense weight" / "weightless burden" contrast rescues the motif, but template cadence in mid-section beats ("he stood… he didn't touch… he watched") slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of elevator technician + ghost-seer + dust-pattern analyst is fresh and grounded in a specific method. The horologist's mainspring barrel transforms a familiar "haunted circus" premise into a particularized tragedy, and the technician's job ("to understand its architecture") feels non-obvious. However, the trapeze-fall ghost and abandoned-performance-venue setting are well-trodden territory; the piece elevates them through specificity (dust swirls, ceiling cavity, mainspring) rather than fundamentally reimagining the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The elevator repair technician who sees ghosts is present throughout and drives the sequence: he kneels, analyzes, watches the ghost vision, retrieves the object. However, his ghost-sight is primarily observational; the key turn (retrieving the mainspring) arises from his skill rather than a difficult choice shaped by his ghostly perception. Setup is immediate, middle involvement is clear (ghost vision reveals the object), and closure participation is direct (he pockets the barrel and the ghost dissipates). The trait enables but does not constrain with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mainspring barrel appears in the ghost vision (she drops it), is retrieved from the ceiling cavity (middle beat), erupts with force (brief micro-turn), and is pocketed in the final image ("cold, dense weight"). It shifts from hidden object to tangible reminder, charging the closure and reweighting the cracks as solved riddle. Present across three distinct beats with causal pressure and closure linkage, though its eruption of force feels slightly ornamental—it pushes him down but does not alter his final choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "cracks in the façade" are mentioned in the opening line, described as "aftermath of a concealed impact" in mid-section, and reappear in the final third as "less like wounds and more like solved a riddle." They frame the thematic question but do not constrain his tactics or narrow options—he would retrieve the object whether the cracks were present or not. The concept is more metaphorical backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is demonstrated through dust-pattern analysis and the ghost-vision trigger, enabling his discovery of the swirl and the object. It is signaled early and drives middle beats, but no visible cost or tradeoff appears—his observation is competent without friction. The trait enables cleanly but does not constrain or force a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Engage" appears twice: "prepared to engage with the phenomenon" and "engaged with the past not to dispel it, but to understand its architecture." The first use triggers the ghost vision (major turn), and the second frames thematic closure. Removing "engage" and substituting "observe" or "interact" would weaken the technician's active stance, but the word itself is somewhat abstract and does not carry unique physical or tactical meaning.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Analyzing dust accumulation patterns is signaled early ("reading the stylistic calligraphy of neglect") and leads directly to the discovery of the circular swirl, the key middle beat. The method is specific and causal, shaping his approach. However, it is used in one concentrated sequence rather than recurring across multiple beats, and the mechanics (how dust reveals ghosts) are asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is established immediately and supplies concrete resources: the water-stained medallion marks the swirl's location, the ceiling's latticework conceals the object, the rickety ladder enables retrieval. The setting pressures his choices (he must climb, work loose lath) and the circus history charges the ghost vision. It is present in setup, middle action, and closure, though it functions more as a richly described container than as an environment that evolves or resists.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The fluorescent buzz dying off is signaled in paragraph five ("finally buzzed their last") and creates a tonal shift ("the truth could begin its slow accretion"). It marks a before/after boundary but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock—no urgency or countdown shapes his moves. The timeframe is more atmospheric threshold than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover what ceilings hide" is stated early and drives the entire sequence: he seeks, finds the swirl, retrieves the object, and confirms "his job… was done." It is consistent and causal, though it is more told than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction. No internal resistance or cost complicates his pursuit; he arrives motivated and leaves satisfied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" appears in the opening third ("his burden weightless in its familiarity; he carried this sight as one carries a scar") and returns in the final paragraph ("The weightless burden of his gift settled easily back"). The tone is melancholic-observational throughout, modulating slightly when "oppressive sorrow had lifted, replaced by a bittersweet release." The phrase charges the final image by contrasting with the mainspring's "cold, dense weight," but the tonal shift is gentle rather than pressure-driven.</comment>
