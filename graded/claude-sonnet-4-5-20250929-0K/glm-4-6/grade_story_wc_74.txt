<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is consistent and rooted in a specific obsession—proving strangers remember kindness—but the piece relies heavily on abstract motivation ("methodically hopeful spirit") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized under pressure. Her micro-choices (settling cross-legged, dipping the brush) advance action but remain illustrative rather than revealing competing desires. The final smile and "quiet triumph" feel emotionally complete but lack the visible cost or foreclosed path that would ground the renunciation. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally slips into declarative summary ("a feeling: the slight warmth").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when early (Elara, rooftop greenhouse, waxing moon) and tracks a single accumulative arc toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: she completes the script, confirms that strangers remember, and achieves "quiet triumph." The closure lands on the page with felt emotional cost (the leaf will crumble, but the proof remains "etched within her"), and the Accumulative/Textural lens—density increase via sensory layering, symbol-making, and the final charged leaf image—holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the daydream shifts from vision to "feeling" and she accesses the old man's memory. Minor deduction: the causal link between painting symbols and accessing memory is asserted more than dramatized, leaving the mechanism suggestive rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is anchored early with layered sensory detail (smog-choked city, damp earth, night-blooming jasmine) and purposefully contrasts the pallid orange glow below with lunar-tinged air above. The moon-tipped brush, magnolia leaf, and silver dust are handled concretely and constrain the final action (painting the script). The setting charges the closure image: the leaf on the windowsill catching moonlight becomes the proof that "connection was an element, as fundamental as air." Micro-setting (brush, leaf, moon) functions as setting, meeting the Q3 9+ gate. Minor slip: spatial choreography is static; Elara's movements between vines and ferns are mentioned but don't alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the daydream shifts from abstract intention to accessing the old man's specific memory, narrowing the experiment from hope to confirmation. The final act (painting the symbols) reweights her stance from desperate need to "quiet triumph," and the conceptual cost is legible: the leaf will crumble, and the proof is internal, uncheckable by others. However, the escalation relies more on accumulation of atmosphere than protagonist agency under duress; no reversal or forced trade-off tests her commitment. The old man's memory is accessed without resistance, limiting visible friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—kindness as a forgotten dialect leaving traces on the soul—emerges organically through the brush, the script, the daydream, and the crumbling leaf without overt statement. The final image (silver script catching light, then fading by morning) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: connection persists internally even when external proof dissolves, reweighting the earlier desperate need into earned peace. The "lost languages" concept integrates tightly, translated not from civilization but from "the human heart." Minor slip: "saffron quiet" and "language the world was too loud to hear" drift toward abstraction in mid-passage, though the final sensory reprise (leaf, moonlight, dawn) grounds the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and purposeful, filtering the greenhouse and city through Elara's insomniac, quasi-mystical lens. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction generally fits her painter's idiom ("canvas…a silent accusation," "saffron quiet") but occasionally slips into elevated abstraction mid-pressure ("the very syntax of lost languages made visible"). The final paragraph's rhythm and image (leaf on windowsill, greeting dawn "not with exhaustion, but with the quiet triumph of a witness") charge the closure effectively. Minor penalty: "methodically hopeful spirit" and "a language the world was too loud to hear" read as external summary rather than voice-embedded perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory anchors (moon-tipped brush, magnolia leaf, silver dust). Information density is high in the painting sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Her motivation was an abstract, almost desperate need" is immediately echoed by "methodically hopeful spirit refusing to concede"; "the language she sought" is restated as "spoken through sensation instead of sound" and again as "lost languages made visible." Template cadence in the final paragraph ("She had roused…she would try…she placed") accumulates across three beats. Figurative density ("moon-tipped," "saffron quiet," "roadmap of sorrows," "moths' wings") in most sentences of the opening third feels ornamental rather than pattern-taught. Apply −0.6 for loops and −0.3 for cadence, total −0.9 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of painter-as-memory-linguist via moonlight daydreams and calligraphic script is specific and non-obvious. The leaf-as-canvas that crumbles by morning offers a fresh angle on ephemeral proof. However, the core premise—kindness leaves invisible traces accessed through mystical means—follows a familiar template (lonely artist seeks validation through symbolic ritual). The old man subplot is present but underdeveloped; the memory accessed feels convenient rather than dramatically contested. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits to its premise but does not pressure-test the method or force Elara to confront a counter-case. Within-band: no added risk bonus; the synthesis is fresh but the stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is signaled early, her choices (settling, focusing on the old man, painting symbols) create the key turn from hope to confirmation, and she is present in the closure image (placing the leaf, greeting dawn). However, her decisions are illustrative rather than costly; the daydream succeeds without resistance, limiting agency under pressure. Gate count: setup ✓, middle development (daydream choice) ✓, closure ✓. Adjustments: early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but swappability (any insomniac artist would serve) −0.5, low on-page cost −0.4. Start 3.0 + 1.8 positive − 0.9 friction = 3.9; round down to 3.9. Gates met, demonstrable causal role across beats and ending, but decisions lack visible cost: mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The moon-tipped brush is introduced early ("a calligrapher's moon-tipped brush, its bristles soft as moths' wings, the ivory tip carved into a perfect crescent"), handled in two distinct beats (held during daydream, dipped and used to paint), and its crescent shape and material specificity matter (moon symbolism ties to the timeframe and method). It appears in the closure sequence (painting the symbols) and its use is irreplaceable to the script-making. Gate count: setup ✓, middle development ✓, closure ✓. Adjustments: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5. Start 3.0 + 3.1 positive = 6.1; gates met, causal across beats, ending involvement clear: low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Lost languages" is signaled early ("her work was not with paint but with memory," "the language she sought"), shapes the dominant stake (proving kindness as a forgotten dialect), and drives the script-painting act ("remains of a lost language…translated…from the human heart"). The concept constrains the final image (symbols on the leaf) and charges the closure ("she had finally learned to speak their language"). Gate count: setup ✓, development (daydream as translation) ✓, closure ✓. Adjustments: early signal +0.6, two beats (daydream, painting) +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.4. Start 3.0 + 3.2 positive = 6.2; gates met, stakes shaped, ending charged: low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is mentioned once ("her methodically hopeful spirit refusing to concede") but does not constrain an on-page action with cost. It describes her general approach (performing tiny deeds for months) but remains label-only in the present scene; no visible tradeoff or friction arises from being methodical versus impulsive. Gate count: setup (mentioned early) ✓, middle development ✗, closure ✗. Adjustments: setup +0.4, but ornamental use −0.7, swappable −0.5. Start 3.0 + 0.4 − 1.2 = 2.2; missing middle and closure gates caps at 3.4, but score below that due to label-only use: low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears twice: "rouse those memories from their slumber" (opening) and "She had roused a truth from the quiet" (closure). The action defines the stake (accessing buried memories) and the final image confirms success. Gate count: setup ✓, middle (daydream attempt) ✓, closure ✓. Adjustments: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but the daydream sequence does not dramatize struggle to rouse—memory surfaces without resistance—so causal pressure is modest +0.3. Start 3.0 + 2.7 positive = 5.7; gates met, closure participation clear, but ease of success limits necessity: high-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Via daydreams sparked by moonlight" is introduced early ("The method was one she had stumbled upon by chance: via daydreams sparked by moonlight") and the mechanics matter: she closes her eyes, lunar glow filters through eyelids, the daydream shifts from vision to feeling. The method is used in the middle beat (accessing the old man's memory) and primes the closure (painting under moonlight). Gate count: setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. Adjustments: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity (lunar glow, saffron quiet) +0.4. Start 3.0 + 2.8 positive = 5.8; gates met, method shapes attempts, ending charged: low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse in a smog-choked city is anchored early, provides clean air and moonlight (resources), and the contrast with the pallid city below charges the thematic opposition (connection versus anonymity). The setting supplies the magnolia leaf and positions the brush-work under lunar glow. Gate count: setup ✓, middle (daydream in greenhouse) ✓, closure (leaf on windowsill) ✓. Adjustments: early signal +0.7, two beats (daydream, painting) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, micro-setting (body, tool) constrains choice +0.6. Start 3.0 + 3.2 positive = 6.2; gates met, environment shapes tactics and charges final image: mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Under a waxing moon's glow" is mentioned in the opening and mid-passage ("under this specific moon," "under the waxing moon's glow") and the moon charges the closure image (leaf catching moonlight). However, the waxing phase does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the time constraint is ambient rather than pressing. Gate count: setup ✓, middle (moon present during daydream) ✓, closure (moon in final image) ✓. Adjustments: early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but no causal pressure (−0.5), no cost tied to phase (−0.3). Start 3.0 + 2.1 − 0.8 = 4.3; gates met but time does not constrain choice: high-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to prove strangers remember kindness—is established early, drives the daydream experiment, and the closure confirms success ("The strangers did remember"). Gate count: setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. Adjustments: early signal +0.7, two beats (daydream, painting) +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure (shapes dominant stake) +0.8. However, no friction between wants and costs is dramatized; the old man's memory surfaces without resistance, and Elara's triumph is uncontested. Deduction for told-only friction −0.6. Start 3.0 + 3.6 − 0.6 = 6.0; gates met, desire shapes stake, but lack of on-page conflict limits score: mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" is introduced early ("a saffron quiet settling over her thoughts," "A saffron quiet filled the greenhouse") and recurs in the closure passage ("in this saffron quiet, surrounded by living things"). The tone is coherent across beats and modulates subtly (from "desperate need" to "quiet triumph"). Gate count: setup ✓, middle ✓, closure ✓. Adjustments: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, tone charges final image +0.6. However, the mood is largely static—meditative throughout—and does not shift under pressure. Deduction for single-note mood −0.4. Start 3.0 + 2.9 − 0.4 = 5.5; gates met, tone present in ending, but limited modulation: mid-5s.</comment>
