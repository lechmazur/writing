<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Julian and Lyra's motivations are stated ("we'll make them remember," "translate silence into music") but remain abstract; no concrete personal stakes emerge beyond a vague mission. Interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("heart swelled with bittersweet joy, sorrow of loss entwined with hope") rather than embodied contradiction. The filmless camera functions as talisman and symbolic device but never forces a micro-choice with visible cost. Lyra's "quietly charismatic" trait is label-only; her signing is described lyrically but doesn't create friction or enable a tactical choice that alters the outcome.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Julian and Lyra are, what they're actually doing, and why remains opaque past 120 words; the Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) applies. The piece presents as Accumulative/Textural (recurring harbor imagery, sign-language motifs, camera clicks) but delivers no decisive deepening or cadence shift; the final "their work done" and "the world remembered" are told assertions without on-page cost or reweighting. No reversal, narrowing of options, or meaningful tightening occurs; the story circles the same lyric mood from opening to close. Closure form is missing; the ending announces completion without dramatizing change or foreclosing a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The moonlit harbor is vivid and sustained throughout, grounding every beat. Sensory detail (ripple, seam of silver, lapping waves, ship horns) filters consistently through the lyric POV. The lighthouse appears as backdrop but doesn't constrain a choice. The camera's mechanical click and Lyra's gestures are handled tactilely across multiple beats, meeting the micro-setting allowance. Strong atmosphere, but environment remains postcard-descriptive rather than pressuring action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"make them remember" via translating silence—is announced early but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal or tightening; the sequence is: they stand, they sign, they click the camera, they declare success. The final camera click and "their work done" offer zero resistance, cost, or complication. Agency is absent; no path is foreclosed, no trade-off made. The piece drifts through mood rather than escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme—art as memorial, silence as medium—emerges from recurring imagery (camera, harbor, sign language) and is handled with restraint; no explicit moralizing in the final paragraph. The final line "the world remembered, for a moment, what it had lost" gestures toward Conceptual Repricing but lacks on-page evidence of cost or change; it tells thematic completion rather than earning it through scene pressure. Subtext operates in the filmless camera and Lyra's whispered translations, but the thematic question is posed rather than answered through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization through Julian is stable; psychic distance is consistent. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("thread of silk against the roar of the sea," "cage of glass and metal") that feels purposeful and voice-motivated. Lyra's dialogue—both signed and whispered—reads as natural subtext ("Listen to the silence between the notes"). Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("symphony they sought to compose") but remains legible and controlled. No head-hopping or filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence carries figurative layering ("talisman," "cage of glass and metal," "thread of silk," "beacon in the dark," "wings"). Paraphrase loops appear: "capture nothing but light" / "aperture open to the void" / "trap its light"; "sorrow entwined with hope" / "melancholy and wonder" / "joy and grief." Template cadence: "Lyra's hands moved," "Lyra smiled," "Lyra's gestures grew bolder." Density penalty (−0.5), coherence slip in mixed metaphors (−0.3), and loop penalty (−0.4) compound. Stock metaphors ("heart swelled," "eyes alight with fire") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is low; many lines restate mood without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise—two artists use a filmless camera and sign language to "map silence" and resurrect forgotten voices—gestures toward originality but remains abstract and unexplored. The core is template-lyric: melancholy artist figures, moonlit harbor, symbolic device, vague mission. No fresh inflection or specific transformation; the turns (camera clicks, signing, final declaration) are interchangeable rituals. The ending's "the world remembered" is asserted thematically rather than earned through a non-obvious synthesis. Risk is gestural; the lyric mode never commits to concrete stakes or consequences.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Lyra (whispering advisor) is present across beats and speaks/signs throughout, but her lines offer poetic commentary ("They've forgotten us," "Listen to the silence") without forcing Julian's decisions. She does not create a key turn; her role is atmospheric support. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vintage camera appears in the opening, is handled mid-scene ("adjusting the camera's focus," "raised the camera to his eye"), and clicks in the final beat. It recurs with charged language ("heavier now… with the weight of their collective memory") but never constrains a choice—Julian never confronts the absence of film as a problem or cost. Lyric reprise with thematic weight, but no causal pressure; eligible for mid-5s under the two-gate allowance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Sign language is described lyrically ("hands weaving through the air," "fingers traced the shapes of unspoken stories") and Lyra signs repeatedly, but it functions as mood and metaphor rather than shaping tactics or stakes. The concept is present and consistent but does not alter options or create on-page friction. Functional but replaceable with any symbolic communication medium.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" is asserted in the opening line ("Lyra moved with a quiet charisma") but never demonstrated through action or choice. No on-page moment where the trait enables or constrains. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Disrupt" is invoked once: "He began to disrupt the quiet, not with sound but with intention, framing the harbor's glow." The action is metaphorical and does not drive a turn or alter the situation. Swappable with "engage," "capture," or any similar verb; no cost or consequence attached.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is named mid-scene and recurs in dialogue ("We'll translate this silence into music," "map the harbor's quiet"). The method is signaled but its mechanics never matter on the page; no dramatized attempt, failure, or adjustment. Theme claim without tactical use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is established early, sustained with vivid sensory detail (ripples, glimmer, lighthouse silhouette), and present in the final image. It anchors every beat and charges the ending ("The harbor glowed on, indifferent yet immortal") with lyric weight. Postcard setting elevated by consistent reprise and closure participation, but it does not constrain a choice; reaches mid-5s on atmosphere and final-image linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"When no one remembers you" is spoken aloud by Julian mid-scene ("your work becomes your ghost") and echoed in the ending ("the world remembered, for a moment, what it had lost"). The timeframe is thematic rather than dramatized; no live clock or urgency. Present as motif, not as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate silence into music" is stated by Lyra and recurs in dialogue and narrative summary. It frames the mission but is never dramatized as conflicted desire or tested by cost. Told-only; no friction between want and obstacle. Functional setup without development or payoff in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Joyful sorrow" / "bittersweet joy" / "melancholy and wonder" / "joy and grief" are named repeatedly and sustained across beats. The tone is coherent and modulates lightly (from vow to crescendo to quiet completion) but remains a single lyric register throughout. It charges the final image ("indifferent yet immortal," "songs no one else could hear") with thematic resonance. Consistent mood that supports closure; trends mid-5s for coherence and final linkage without dynamic shift.</comment>
