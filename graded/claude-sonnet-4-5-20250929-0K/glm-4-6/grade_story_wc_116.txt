<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper lacks contradictory impulses in scene and makes no meaningful choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("gripped reality loosely," "fascinated by change") rather than embodied emotion or micro-decisions under pressure. The journey to the obsidian refuge and return is observational drift with no stake that tests commitment or forces a trade-off. The final entry-recording is a gestural endnote, not an earned alteration or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who (keeper), where (catacombs/library), and when (indeterminate across seasons) are present early, so no −0.3 applied. Drive lens is ambiguous—gestures toward Accumulative/Textural (sensory layering, lyric recursion) but never teaches a pattern or delivers a decisive tightening, deepening, or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. No on-page closure: the keeper observes the obsidian's new reflective properties and returns to record "one more entry" with no felt or conceptual cost, no decision that narrows options, and no image that reconfigures prior material. The piece reads as a static travelogue through metaphysical spaces without a before/after legible in choice or consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The overgrown library, obsidian refuge, and origami swan are vividly described with sensory specificity and consistent internal logic (vine-cracked stone, volcanic glass, paper geometries). However, none of these settings constrains a choice or alters tactics; they remain postcard backdrops for drift. The final observation of crystallized obsidian does not charge the closure because no closure decision or stance crystallization occurs. Micro-setting allowance (body, tool, recurring object) is not met—objects are mentioned but never handled in a way that shapes outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled or tested. The keeper's stated motivation—"to witness change without judgment"—operates as passive observation with no on-page conflict, reversal, or tightening that narrows options. The journey to the refuge and back is frictionless; no cost, obstacle, or competing pressure appears. Agency is absent: no decision, renunciation, or endurance that forecloses a path. The piece circles thematic atmosphere without escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (impermanence, paradox of change) is declared via abstract philosophizing rather than earned through specific events: "all systems … were part of nature's paradoxical mechanisms" is late-paragraph moralizing that replaces scene pressure. Subtext is minimal; nearly every concept is stated outright (e.g., "silence … a living presence," "reflection as a form of preservation"). The final "renewed understanding" is asserted without a dramatized realization or image that reweights prior material. Conceptual Repricing does not land because the cost is not made undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries distinct perceptual signatures ("dust motes danced," "brittle parchments") and maintains elevated diction throughout. However, the prose leans heavily on abstract nominalizations ("accumulating histories," "dimension-key," "reality-looseness") and filter verbs ("observed," "perceived," "brought back") that dull immediacy. Psychic distance remains far; the keeper's interior texture is generic contemplation rather than character-specific rhythm. No dialogue to assess. Purposeful compression is present but the pattern is not taught early—ellipsis reads as drift rather than charged elision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Density is uneven: many sentences do double duty (e.g., "the concept of self became as tenuous as morning mist, thoughts diffusing until only pure witnessing remained"), but others loop or paraphrase (e.g., "the regenerative silence" appears six times with near-synonym phrasing). Template cadence is visible: runs of "The keeper [verb]" and "silence … silence" across adjacent lines. Mixed metaphor: "burrowing through … folds" conflates spatial movement and dimensional passage without coherent vehicle. Figurative language is dense but not pattern-taught, and much of it appears in mid-pressure descriptive passages rather than peak beats. Several paraphrase loops across adjacent sentences (e.g., reality-looseness restated in paragraph 1, silence restated in paragraphs 1 and 3). Scaffold phrases like "through the origami swan's interior dimensions" recur without variation. High-priority loop check fails; synonym churn is present. Apply baseline artifact penalty −0.8 in Q7 for paraphrase loops, template cadence, and filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The metaphysical-librarian archetype and "quiet observer who transcends time" are familiar templates. Specific details (origami swan as dimension-key, obsidian refuge, regenerative silence) are vivid but do not transform the stock premise—the emotional arc and outcome would remain unchanged with different names and places. The piece avoids cliché at the line level and commits to its lyric voice, but takes no structural or thematic risk that heightens stakes. No fresh inflection: the keeper's "renewed understanding" at the end does not grow from a prior turn or choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Chronicle keeper is present throughout and focalizes all perception. Setup: introduced immediately. Development: travels to the refuge and observes the obsidian's new crystallization. Payoff: returns to record one more entry. However, the keeper makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path—observation without agency. The character is interchangeable with any passive witness; removing this exact keeper would not break story logic. Score: present but ornamental, 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge appears in setup (paragraph 1), development (paragraphs describing the refuge and river), and payoff (new crystallization observed in final third). The object is described across multiple beats but never handled or used in a way that constrains choice—static backdrop. The "new reflective properties" observation does not charge the closure because no closure decision occurs. Functional but replaceable; score 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is named six times and described as a "living presence" that "scours perception clean." Setup: introduced early. Development: mentioned in relation to the refuge. Payoff: "followed them through the catacomb passages." However, it operates as thematic decoration—never shapes stakes, narrows options, or alters tactics. The concept is told, not dramatized in a way that changes what the keeper can or cannot do. Score: present but ornamental, 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is labeled in paragraph 1 and restated as "reality-looseness" in paragraph 3. The trait enables metaphysical travel but imposes no visible cost or constrains any on-page choice—it is a frictionless superpower. Label-only mentions without tradeoff; score 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Burrow" appears twice: "the keeper's spirit burrowed through these metaphysical passages" and later "burrowing through the swan's cryptic folds." Setup: mid-paragraph 1. Development: restated in paragraph 3. Payoff: absent—the return journey is not shown. The action enables transit but does not drive a turn or redefine options; easily swappable with "traveled" or "moved." Functional but replaceable; score 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Origami swan is introduced in paragraph 1 as the transit mechanism, used again in paragraph 3 when the keeper encounters other consciousnesses, and implied at the return. Setup, development, and payoff all present. The swan's "cryptic folds" and "impossible geometries" are specific and integral to the transit mechanic—removing it would require rewriting the travel method. However, the swan does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it is a frictionless device. Score: shapes one key turn (the journey itself), 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overgrown library is introduced immediately, described with vivid particulars (vine-choked archways, knowledge crystallized into stone), and returned to at the end when the keeper records the final entry. Setup, development (implicit during the refuge visit), and payoff all present. The setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—the keeper's actions would be unchanged in any meditative archive. The vines and crumbling peace are atmospheric but do not alter tactics. Score: shapes the journey structure but does not drive a choice, 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" is named in paragraph 1 and elaborated: "Years might pass in the river's meander while only moments elapsed in the catacomb library." The timeframe is descriptive flavor—it does not tighten decisions, impose a deadline, or alter tactics. Vague and untracked; score 2.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To witness change without judgment" is stated in paragraph 1 as the keeper's motivation. The keeper observes rust, decay, and the obsidian's new properties, consistent with this desire. However, the motivation is told only—no on-page friction between the desire to witness and any competing cost or obstacle. The keeper's final act (recording one more entry) aligns with the motivation but does not dramatize a choice where that desire is tested or conflicted. Score: present and consistent but not dramatized under pressure, 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Crumbling peace" is embodied in line-level diction throughout: "weathered pages," "overgrown library," "brittle parchments," and the keeper's acceptance of "gradual deterioration." The tone is coherent and modulates slightly when describing the obsidian's "moonless twilight" crystallization. However, the tone does not charge the final image because no closure decision or stance crystallization occurs—the piece ends in the same register it began. Coherent and sustained but static; score 5.8.</comment>
