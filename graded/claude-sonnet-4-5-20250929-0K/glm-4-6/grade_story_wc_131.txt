<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is detailed but largely tells rather than shows contradictory impulses in action. His motivation—becoming visible to the librarian—drives his caching behavior, but the "familiar thrill of anticipation" at the end reads as satisfaction rather than a conflicted renunciation or cost-bearing choice. The sense memory fragment is concrete, yet the character's emotional arc from isolation to connection feels smooth rather than earned through on-page friction. The librarian remains a distant object of observation rather than a pressure source that forces Elias into difficult micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who, where, and when early enough (Elias in library crawl space at dawn during power outage). A single causal chain links tape discovery → caching → librarian discovery, meeting the one-meaningful-tightening standard for this length under a Causal lens. However, closure lacks visible cost: Elias "smiled in the darkness," already planning the next act, which reads as continuation rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration that forecloses a path. The ending image does not reweight prior stakes or impose felt consequence; it confirms his ongoing pattern without alteration or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and atmospheric—"wooden beams that held the building together like aged bones," "sapphire hush of early morning," pipe chases and crawl spaces. Spatial choreography is clear throughout Elias's movements. The crawl space constrains his visibility and his flashlight enables navigation, linking environment to tactics. The power outage provides a timed window that he exploits, though the return of power at the end does not materially alter his final action. The library's hidden infrastructure is well-drawn and specific to his choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's desire to communicate hidden stories to the librarian—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The power outage provides a ticking clock, and his caching of the tape fragment in the hollowed book is a concrete escalation. However, the librarian's discovery unfolds exactly as Elias planned, with no reversal, complication, or visible price. He watches from safety, smiles, and plans the next act; the resolution confirms his pattern rather than testing it under pressure. Agency is present but consequence-free, preventing the felt cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—preservation of hidden narratives and selective visibility—emerges through Elias's actions and the tape fragment's historical weight. The "quiet transmission of stories from one guardian to another" operates via concrete objects (tape, book, clipping) rather than assertion. However, the final paragraph states theme overtly: "a different kind of current flowed—the quiet transmission of stories from one guardian of knowledge to another." This explains rather than trusts the dramatized moment. The librarian's shift from confusion to wonder is shown, yet the ending lacks ambiguity or a non-literal answer; it confirms rather than reweights.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, grounded in Elias's perceptions and memories. Diction is mostly consistent ("sapphire hush," "ferromagnetic tape reel"), though some phrases lean elevated ("mediaed by a man who had perfected the art of being seen without being seen"). Psychic distance is controlled. The librarian's interiority is appropriately withheld except for observable "expression shifting from confusion to wonder." Minor filter-verb accumulation ("he had learned," "he knew") in expository beats does not materially dull pressure at closure. Voice is competent but not distinctively patterned under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear with varied sentence structure and strong atmospheric detail. However, several paraphrase loops and template patterns appear: "his fingers tracing familiar paths" / "his weathered fingers had discovered"; "the art of uncovering treasures" / "learned the art of"; "methodical nature had served him" / "quickly but methodically." The final two paragraphs contain explanatory scaffolding ("his motivation had always remained clear," "the true illumination came moments later") that could be cut. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but scaffold remains visible. No major artifacts touch the closure beat directly, limiting deduction under the non-closure cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—hidden library dweller leaving clues for a kindred librarian—is evocative but closely echoes familiar secret-benefactor and "guardian of knowledge" templates. The tape fragment and hollowed book are specific, yet the emotional arc (lonely curator finds connection through anonymous gifts) follows a predictable path without transformation. The power outage provides situational texture but does not complicate the plan; everything unfolds as intended. Specificity in setting and objects elevates the piece above generic execution, yet the core synthesis feels derivative without a non-obvious moral calculus or structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias (crawl space dweller) is established early, drives all on-page action, and appears in the closure beat watching the librarian. However, his final action is observation followed by smiling and planning—reaction rather than decision that alters tactics. His caching choice occurs mid-story and succeeds without friction. The character is functionally present across beats but does not make a closure choice that forecloses a path or transforms stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ferromagnetic tape reel fragment is introduced via sense memory in paragraph two, handled again when Elias caches it in the hollowed book mid-story, and appears in the librarian's hands at closure with "expression shifting from confusion to wonder." It triggers Elias's memory and carries historical weight (library founding ceremony). However, its meaning does not evolve on the page; it remains a static clue rather than an object that narrows options or imposes cost. Present in three beats (discovery, caching, librarian's discovery) but functionally similar across all.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sense memory is dramatized on-page when the tape fragment "triggered an unexpected sense memory, transporting him to a time before the library had become his sanctuary," connecting to his father and boyhood curiosity. It primes his motivation to leave the fragment for the librarian. However, it does not constrain a later choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure; the librarian's discovery does not loop back to Elias's sensory experience. The concept shapes one early beat but does not participate in escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical nature" is mentioned once as a label ("His kindly methodical nature had served him well") and echoed in "quickly but methodically" during his retreat. It does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost on the page; instead it summarizes his general competence. No moment shows a trade-off between kindness and method, or where being methodical forecloses a warmer, riskier path. The trait is told rather than demonstrated through pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Caching is central: Elias plans to cache the tape fragment, executes the cache inside the hollowed book mid-story, and the librarian discovers the cached item at closure. The action drives the dominant stake (becoming visible) and links all three structural beats. Removing caching would require a complete rewrite. However, the cache succeeds without complication or visible cost; no alternate tactic is tested or foregone. Essential across setup, middle, and payoff, but frictionless execution prevents the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Uncovering in pipe chases" is signaled early ("He had learned the art of uncovering treasures in pipe chases") and contextualizes how Elias found the tape fragment "during yesterday's exploration in the pipe chases behind the west reading room." The method is mentioned but its mechanics do not matter on the page; we do not see him navigate pipe chases in real time or overcome an obstacle specific to that method. It provides backstory texture but does not shape present attempts or tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is established in the opening line ("sapphire hush of early morning") and sustained through "unexpected darkness," power outage, Elias's flashlight cutting through "dusty darkness," and dawn painting the sky at closure. Darkness conceals Elias and provides his window of opportunity; the return of power ("power lights blinked on") marks the temporal boundary. Setting directly enables his tactics (moving unseen) and the outage tightens the available time. Present in setup, middle (children's section), and closure; indispensable to his approach.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The power outage is introduced early ("the city's lights flickered and died, the outage providing his customary window of opportunity"), creates urgency mid-story ("the city lights flickered briefly outside, signs that power would soon return, and Elias knew his time was running short"), and resolves at closure ("The power lights blinked on"). The timeframe tightens one decision—Elias retracing his steps quickly—but does not complicate his cache or force a trade-off. It pressures pacing but not stakes; his plan succeeds on schedule. Present across all three beats with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to become visible to those who need you" is stated explicitly mid-story and demonstrated through Elias's months of observation, leaving clues, and caching the tape fragment for the librarian. It drives all on-page action. However, the motivation is told in a long explanatory passage ("His motivation had always remained clear: to become visible to those who need you—not to everyone...") rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. No moment shows him weighing visibility against safety or testing whether the librarian truly "needs" him. Functional but under-dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" appears in the opening line ("The sapphire hush of early morning draped itself over the world outside") and recurs near closure ("As dawn began to paint the sky in shades matching the hush he had labored within"). Tone is quiet, contemplative, and consistent with Elias's methodical patience. However, it does not modulate meaningfully under pressure; the hush remains static rather than charged or broken by the librarian's discovery. The reprise links beginning and end but does not reweight the stake or shift cadence at closure.</comment>
