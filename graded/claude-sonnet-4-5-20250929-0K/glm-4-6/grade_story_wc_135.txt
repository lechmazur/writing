<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to compile fragments is declared but rarely tested through consequential micro-choices under pressure. Her "reactively visionary" approach is told rather than dramatized through embodied contradictions. The fisherman and Mara receive concrete gestures (trembling fingers, clouded eyes), but Elara's interiority remains abstract—labels like "obsession" without the granular texture of how that obsession constrains her present choices. The ending grants her success without visible renunciation or felt cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the exhibit assembles fragments across a three-month ellipsis, and the final gathering reweights the stakes through density rather than because/therefore causality. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the community's dispersed memory finds collective acknowledgment—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("absences could never be fully navigated") rather than dramatized with an on-page forfeiture or visible price. Orientation anchors appear late (~150 words before "ivory harbor" and "ocean-spray archivist" cohere), triggering a modest penalty. The two-shard structure (arrival → three months later) is legible, but the ellipsis compresses all escalation into summary, weakening the felt weight of the closure moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "ivory harbor after rain" and "mist-shrouded docks" establish locale, and the recurring image of rain-washed ivory buildings bookends the narrative with purpose. The trumpet valve as micro-object constrains Elara's archival method and charges the closure exhibit, satisfying the constraint-choice test. Spatial choreography is clean (docks, examination table, archive chambers, harbor lights), but sensory detail leans heavily visual without embodying touch, smell, or sound during high-pressure moments. The setting supports rather than actively pressures Elara's choices; her work could proceed similarly in a different locale with minor edits.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—compiling exile memory into collective meaning—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure accumulates through the fisherman's deposit, Kai's recognition, and the community's gradual contributions, but all escalation occurs in summary across the three-month ellipsis rather than on-page turns. No moment narrows Elara's tactical options with visible cost; the "staggered intervals" method is declared effective without dramatizing resistance, failure, or trade-off. The ending grants success ("she had created a space where memory could find its way home") as affirmation rather than hard-won closure shaped by protagonist agency under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of absence and fragmentation as presence emerges organically from the trumpet valve, cut-out photographs, and mid-sentence stories. The final image—memory finding its way home through acknowledged gaps—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. "Navigated absences" recurs with shifting weight, and the exhibit as assembled incompleteness avoids tidy restoration. However, phrases like "absences could never be fully navigated, only acknowledged and understood" and "reactively visionary approach" edge toward thematic summary rather than trusting the dramatized particulars. The concept risks abstraction; grounding it more in Elara's conflicted micro-choices would deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering through Elara's professional lexicon ("archivist," "compile," "staggered intervals") with purposeful diction. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose carries a controlled, elevated register that suits the archival frame, but dialogue (fisherman's explanation, Elara's instruction to Mara) lacks subtext and reads as exposition. Perceptual signature is faint—Elara's way of noticing does not feel character-specific enough to distinguish her gaze under pressure. Free indirect thought is clean, but filter verbs ("she recognized," "she understood") accumulate without voice-driven necessity, dulling immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and no major paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. Information density is moderate; many lines advance setting or theme without propelling action. Stock metaphors recur: "sunlight breaking through clouds after persistent rain," "wave of recognition," "find its way home" lean generic. The phrase "navigated absences" appears five times, shifting from concept to motif, but the repetition borders on churn without fresh inflection each time. Figurative language in the opening ("ocean-spray archivist," "slumped shoulders and weary gait of people who had carried absence across seas") clusters densely, then thins, creating uneven texture. No loops obscure causality, but scaffold phrases like "years measured not by presence but by what was missing" and "the possibility of what might one day fill it" pad without momentum gain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—archivist compiling exile memory through material fragments—offers a fresh angle on collective trauma and return, and the trumpet valve as mute witness provides concrete specificity. "Reactively visionary" and "navigated absences" as coined phrases gesture toward originality but remain under-dramatized, feeling more like prompt fulfillment than organic discovery. The staggered-interval method and the children's shell-game are thoughtful touches, but the emotional arc (dispersed trauma → collective acknowledgment) follows a familiar template without a non-obvious moral calculus or a turn that redefines prior stakes. Transformation is present but modest; swapping the trumpet valve for another charged object would leave the story's logic largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara is the focalizer throughout and makes decisions (arranging shelves, staging staggered reveals, creating the children's game), but these choices are recounted in summary rather than dramatized in beats with visible cost. Her role as archivist frames the story but does not force a consequential trade-off or renunciation on the page. Present in setup, middle, and closure, meeting all three gates, but causal pressure is modest—her approach succeeds without friction. Her decisions shape the exhibit but do not alter her own tactics or foreclose a path, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The trumpet valve appears in three distinct beats: the fisherman's deposit (setup), Kai's recognition drawing the community forward (middle turn), and implicit presence in the final exhibit (closure). Its role as the "moment of separation" witness and hub for community contributions creates clear causal pressure—without it, the collective assembly would lack an anchor. Specificity is high (broken valve, wrapped in sailcloth fragments), and the element is irreplaceable. It narrowly misses higher bands because the closure beat describes the exhibit generally rather than spotlighting the valve's final reweighted meaning with visible cost tied to Elara's renunciation or choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" is named five times and frames the thematic question, but it functions primarily as concept and label rather than shaping on-page tactics or decisions. The exiles' methods (cutting out faces, stopping stories mid-sentence) illustrate the concept in setup, yet these details do not constrain Elara's archival work—she could compile memory without invoking the phrase. The concept echoes at closure ("absences could never be fully navigated, only acknowledged") as summary rather than enabling a visible trade-off or tactical shift. Present in setup and closure but passive in middle development, limiting score to functional-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" appears twice as a label describing Elara's method: once when she perceives patterns in the broken valve, once summarizing her approach at the end. Neither instance dramatizes a trade-off or cost; the trait is declared effective without showing how it constrains her choices or forces a difficult tactic under pressure. The attribute could be swapped for "intuitive," "empathetic," or "holistic" without altering story logic. Present in setup and closure but ornamental in function, capping the score below mid-band despite two-gate appearance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Hearten" appears in Elara's dialogue to Mara ("I cannot hearten everyone at once") and recurs implicitly in the staggered-interval strategy and the children's game, shaping the middle tactics. The action drives the method by which fragments are shared to avoid overwhelming the community, making it causally relevant to one key turn. It is signaled early (within the first half) and contributes to closure logic (the exhibit succeeds because it heartens gradually). However, the action's mechanics are told rather than shown in a beat where resistance tests the approach, and "hearten" is somewhat swappable with "comfort" or "support" without breaking the structure. Two gates plus modest causal work place it solidly in the one-key-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Through staggered intervals" is named explicitly in Elara's instruction to Mara and guides the middle work: she reveals fragments progressively to different groups (those gathering belongings, those at the market). The method shapes tactics by spacing the revelations to avoid trauma overload, making it functionally necessary to the archival success. Signaled in the first half and operative in the middle, meeting two gates. It does not appear or reweight at closure—the final exhibit is described generally without spotlighting the staged reveal's culminating effect. The method is somewhat replaceable (a similar pacing strategy could substitute), and no visible cost is tied to choosing intervals over other approaches, limiting the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "ivory harbor after rain" anchors the opening and closing images, providing atmospheric coherence and a visual motif (mist, rain-washed buildings, harbor lights). The setting establishes locale but does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics—her archival work could proceed identically indoors in another coastal or inland town. The rain and ivory recur as mood rather than pressure. Present in setup and closure (two gates), but the setting remains ornamental, functioning as backdrop rather than micro-environment that forces a decision or charges the final moment with spatial or environmental cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the exile ends" and "three months later" frame the timeframe, and the decree's lifting triggers the exiles' return, setting the story in motion. The time element signals stakes (the community must now process long-deferred memory) but does not create a live clock that narrows Elara's options or escalates pressure—she works across three months in summary without deadline or temporal squeeze. Present in setup (the return) and implicit at closure (the passage of months enables the exhibit), meeting two gates. However, the timeframe is replaceable; the story's logic would hold if the work took weeks or a year, and no visible cost is tied to the duration, capping the score in functional-but-swappable range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To compile fragments into meaning" is named as Elara's obsession in the opening and drives every beat: she arranges shelves, accepts the valve, stages staggered reveals, creates the children's game, and completes the exhibit. The motivation shapes all her on-page actions and is causally indispensable. Signaled early, developed through middle tactics, and delivered at closure, meeting all three gates. However, the desire is told and affirmed rather than dramatized with internal friction—no moment shows Elara torn between competing impulses or paying a visible cost (fatigue, social friction, renunciation) to pursue this goal. The motivation succeeds without visible trade-off, placing it in the essential-across-beats band but below the cost-charged tier.</comment>
