<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to inscribe a cosmic verse remains abstract and label-driven; the transformation at the end is asserted through metaphysical description rather than earned through embodied choice under pressure. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves smoothly through sacred forms without genuine struggle or competing impulses. The "spontaneously anchored" binding and her method of "observing gaps" are told as mystical facts rather than lived constraints that force difficult micro-choices. Diagnostic label-speak pervades the interiority: "transcendent purpose," "pure consciousness," "fundamental gaps"—therapy-speak masquerading as characterization (−0.5).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph and remain stable. The piece attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (transformation/fledging as Earned Stasis variant), but the closure unit lacks visible cost—Lyra's "spontaneously anchored connection... began to loosen" is stated, not dramatized with a price paid on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (mystical density building to transformation), yet the final image delivers assertion ("carrying the verse that would remake reality") rather than a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights prior material with felt consequences. No clear on-page cost is legible at the ending beat (−0.6).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The twilight garden is anchored early with concrete details (crystalline dome, obsidian stones, constellations). Sensory selection remains generic (starlight, moonstone warmth) and does not reflect character urgency or professional filter. The twelve obsidian stones at the garden's center supply a spatial anchor for the climax, meeting the micro-setting test minimally. The moonstone dust speck functions as both object and body-setting when it "dissolved into liquid light," but the transformation feels ornamental rather than constraining a prior choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing her purpose to transcend the Nostalgia Ban through embodied verse—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; Lyra progresses through seventeen sacred forms without friction, and the "spontaneously anchored" magic releases her automatically upon completion. The transformation is convenience rather than earned escalation. Agency is absent: Lyra performs choreographed steps, and the result is granted rather than chosen with visible cost (−0.8 for no escalation under the lens).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of transcending suppression "not by restoring what was lost, but by revealing what had never been known" is stated overtly in the final paragraphs rather than emerging through particulars. The moonstone dust speck and the "gaps" motif recur but do not shift meaning at closure—they are invoked as mystical principles without accumulating pressure. Thematic Echo penalty: "The tide dancer had transcended her art, becoming something new—living scripture that would rewrite the world not through what it said, but through the gaps it created" is direct thesis articulation in the final beat (−0.6).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("immense spaces between particles of existence," "font of knowledge that memory suppression could not touch") that clashes with the embodied dancer's lived idiom, especially during the climactic transformation. Perceptual signature is present—filtered through tide-dancing and starlight observation—but the voice under peak pressure becomes a catalogue of metaphysical assertions rather than sensory immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "gaps between what was known" / "spaces between constellations" / "immense spaces between particles" recycle the same conceptual note without adding pressure. Template cadence clusters: "Her movements drew... from starlight, from the gaps... from the immense spaces" stacks prepositions mechanically. Stock metaphors: "obsidian grace—sharp, elegant, absolute" is decorative rather than precise. Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("began forming," "began to loosen") dull immediacy (−0.9 cumulative for loops, cadence, and stacks). Textual artifact disallows 9+ globally per the rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—exiled dancer inscribes mystical verse to defy a memory ban—synthesizes familiar fantasy tropes (magical exile, body-as-text, forbidden knowledge) without a fresh angle. The "Nostalgia Ban" and "observing gaps" methods remain abstract convenience rather than specific constraints with trade-offs. The transformation feels granted rather than earned through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: the core closely matches writing-prompt templates and lacks transformation through specificity (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lyra's tide-dancing skill is mentioned early and frames her identity, but her choices during the climactic dance are not causally active—she executes seventeen forms without friction or micro-decisions that alter tactics. The skill does not create a key turn; it is backdrop to a transformation granted by magic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The moonstone dust speck appears early (setup), is studied through a magnifying crystal mid-story (development), and dissolves into liquid light at the transformation (payoff). However, its dissolution is ornamental—it does not constrain a prior choice or impose cost. The object is present across three beats but its role is descriptive rather than causal (two-gate participation, −0.5 for swappability and lack of cost).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Elective exile" is backstory context mentioned in the opening but does not shape on-page tactics or choices. Lyra's isolation is a static condition rather than a stake under pressure. The concept is thematic echo only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Spontaneously anchored" is named early and mentioned at closure ("began to loosen"), but the mechanic does not constrain a single on-page action with visible cost. It functions as a magical timer that releases automatically, not a trade-off driver. Label-only trait (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Fledge" is signaled early ("Tonight would be the night she would finally fledge") and the transformation occurs on the page at closure. However, the action is asserted through description rather than a choice that redefines options. It is causally present but does not drive a turn; removing it and substituting "transform" would leave structure intact (setup + payoff, mid-band swappability).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" is introduced early and recurs across several beats (starlight gaps, dust gaps, gaps between thoughts). At closure, the verse exists "in the gaps between comprehension." The method is thematically present but its mechanics do not shape a tactical choice or impose cost—it remains abstract principle. Two-gate participation (setup, thematic payoff) with no middle constraint (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "twilight garden under stars" is anchored early and supplies the stage for the transformation (twelve obsidian stones at center). The garden does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is a vivid but passive frame. Postcard description trends low; the crystalline dome and obsidian circle are scenic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the Nostalgia Ban" is timeline context mentioned in backstory but does not tighten on-page decisions. No live clock or temporal pressure shapes tactics during the transformation sequence. The ban is thematic backdrop only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin" is stated as Lyra's motivation in the opening third and the transformation delivers it at closure. However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—Lyra pursues it without friction or competing wants. The goal is setup + payoff with no middle cost or trade-off (two-gate participation, −0.4 for lack of friction).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Obsidian grace" appears once as a descriptor of the script ("Each letter burned with obsidian grace—sharp, elegant, absolute"). The tone label does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image; it is a single ornamental phrase. Minimal integration (−0.7 for ornamental use, late appearance).</comment>
