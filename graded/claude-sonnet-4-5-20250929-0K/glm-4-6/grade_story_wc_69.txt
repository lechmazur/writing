<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor demonstrates clear motivation and her hierarchical values (music preservation over administrative approval) emerge through micro-choices. However, interiority remains abstract—"expectant resignation" and "weathered fingers" function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The students' transformation lacks granular resistance or individual texture; they shift from "self-consciousness" to "unexpected unity" without dramatized friction. The final "we are all instruments" speech edges toward diagnostic clarity that no teacher would articulate mid-crisis, costing embodied authenticity at a key beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (library, autumn, Eleanor's role). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final lamp-lighting and placement of the rosette, but cost remains conceptual rather than felt—no on-page renunciation or foreclosed path with visible price. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the rehearsal sequence summarizes transformation ("they felt the change") rather than dramatizing a single tightening choice that narrows Eleanor's options or forces a trade-off. Causality is clean but the closure image reweights prior material only weakly, lacking the undeniable pressure required for strong RR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet library is anchored early with sensory detail (dust motes, tall windows, autumn leaves) and constrains choices through its "hushed" atmosphere that students "disturb without destroying." The rosette functions as micro-setting, handled twice (desk examination, held up during rehearsal) and its carved notation system pressures Eleanor's pedagogical tactics. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the autumn framing modulates from gathering darkness to lamp-lit stillness, charging the final image with seasonal metaphor that supports rather than overstates theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving musical tradition and braiding divided voices—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is weak: the administration's skepticism and ancestral hatred are declared but never test Eleanor on the page with a live constraint or forced trade-off. The rehearsal's "perfect fifths" discovery and final chord function as micro turns, yet the piece moves through teaching beats without narrowing Eleanor's options or imposing visible cost. The resolution (students leaving with "quiet conversations") asserts change rather than dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path, leaving pressure diffuse under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—diversity creates harmony—emerges from rehearsal particulars (descendants of feuding families, disparate voices merging). Yet the piece edges toward thesis statement in Eleanor's direct articulations: "diversity creates the most beautiful harmonies, not uniformity" and "we are all instruments" deliver the moral rather than trusting image and action. The rosette's notation system and the final lamp-against-darkness image offer non-literal resonance, but the penultimate paragraph's explicit summary ("creating harmony in a world that too often forgets") replaces scene pressure with thematic echo, triggering a −0.5 deduction for final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Eleanor's perceptual signature—noticing "dust motes," "weathered fingers," "autumn amber"—reads character-specific and her diction ("by subtracting noise," "vanishing arts") establishes consistent register. However, dialogue lacks subtext; Eleanor's lines to the board and choir pursue goals but remain expository rather than evasive or indirect. Student voices are undifferentiated, and the final "we are all instruments" speech shifts into sermonic clarity that feels authorial rather than Eleanor's lived idiom under pressure. Distance control holds, but voice texture flattens at emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high, yet the piece deploys filter-verb stacks ("she had told," "she had painstakingly transcribed," "she whispered") and paraphrase loops across adjacent beats ("By subtracting noise" appears three times with near-identical framing). Template cadence runs: "The zither soundhole rosette [verb phrase]" and "By subtracting noise [consequence]" create mechanical repetition. Stock metaphors ("autumn amber," "bridges across divides") and therapy-speak ("self-consciousness," "inherited grievances") in peak beats dull immediacy. Combined artifacts trigger −0.9 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the filter-verb stack rule, capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—choir teacher uses ancient instrument to heal town divisions—follows a template "music heals rifts" arc without fresh transformation. The rosette's notation system offers specificity, yet the emotional throughline (skeptical admin, hesitant students, achieved harmony) adheres to median choices that evade bold risk. The final image (lamp against darkness, rosette on desk) gestures toward resonance but remains symbolically predictable. No unconventional structural or perspectival risks heighten stakes, and the piece's climax (successful rehearsal) resolves without complication or unexpected cost, keeping the work in the competent-but-familiar band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eleanor is present across all beats and her choices (arranging rehearsal, explaining rosette, coaxing harmony) shape middle development. However, key turns trace to student transformation rather than Eleanor's agency; she observes and facilitates without a closure-scene decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final lamp-lighting and rosette placement read as ritual rather than choice under pressure. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, but swappability (any dedicated teacher) −0.6 and lack of causal closure pressure −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rosette appears in setup (desk, first paragraph), middle (held up during rehearsal to explain notation), and closure (placed back on desk). Its carved notation system constrains Eleanor's pedagogical tactics and its immigrant-family backstory charges thematic weight. However, the object is described and explained more than handled or used to alter a live choice—students don't read the notation or interact with it under pressure. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (final placement) +0.9, but ornamental middle use −0.7 and swappability (any ethnic artifact) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Vanishing arts" frames Eleanor's mission from paragraph one and the rosette embodies it concretely. The concept shapes Eleanor's arguments to the administration and her teaching tactics ("painstakingly transcribed" tunes). However, it functions more as thematic backdrop than live stake—no beat forces Eleanor to choose between preservation and another immediate cost. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (two mentions) +0.9, specificity (Zither, rosette notation) +0.5, but thematic-only middle −0.6 and no closure pressure −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Expectant resignation" appears as a label in paragraph one ("moved between towering shelves with an expectant resignation") and softens once ("Her expectant resignation softened into wonder"). It does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost—Eleanor acts with steady determination throughout, and the trait remains a descriptor rather than a lived contradiction that shapes tactics. Label-only −0.6, no middle development −0.8, no closure participation −1.0, late first dramatization (second half) −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Denote" recurs three times: the rosette's patterns "denote forgotten scales," Eleanor explains the rosette "would denote...tuning and temperament," and Eleanor "had never needed to denote...which arts were worth saving." The term frames exposition rather than driving a turn—Eleanor's key moves (arranging rehearsal, coaxing harmony) do not hinge on acts of notation or designation. Early signal +0.5, three mentions +1.0, but swappability (any verb of indication) −0.7, ornamental use −0.5, no closure pressure −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"By subtracting noise" is seeded early ("subtracting noise from both their conversations and their ancestral melodies") and recurs three times, shaping Eleanor's rehearsal method explicitly. The phrase constrains her teaching tactics (removing hesitation, self-consciousness, divisions) and the final paragraph ties it to closure: "By subtracting noise...her students began to hear...with pristine clarity." However, the method is told rather than shown—no on-page beat dramatizes the act of subtraction with resistance or cost. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but summary-only −0.8, template repetition −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The velvet library anchors location and atmosphere from the opening line and shapes choices: students shuffle into "centuries of quietude," velveteen chairs house descendants, and tall windows filter autumn light during rehearsal. The setting's "traveled stillness" constrains the rehearsal's tone and the final lamp-lighting against "gathering autumn darkness" charges the closure image. Early signal +0.8, three beats (opening, rehearsal, ending) +1.4, causal pressure (quietude affects student behavior) +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, irreplaceability (velvet, autumn specificity) +0.6, but generic "sanctuary" frame −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" appears twice as an abstract frame ("Across unlearning hatred that had divided the town generations ago" and "didn't consciously grasp across unlearning hatred"). It establishes backstory rather than functioning as a live timeframe that tightens present decisions. No clock, no escalating deadline, no temporal constraint—Eleanor's rehearsal sequence unfolds without time pressure. The phrase reads as thematic modifier rather than dramatized temporal stake. Label-only −0.7, no middle development −0.8, no closure participation −1.0, introduced after 30% mark −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Eleanor's desire "to braid diverse voices into harmony" is stated early ("made it her mission") and drives her rehearsal choices (pairing students, coaxing merged chords). The motivation shapes two beats (board argument, rehearsal facilitation) and the final image (students leaving with "new connections"). However, the goal never conflicts with a competing want or cost on the page—Eleanor pursues it without friction, doubt, or trade-off. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but told-only (no embodied want/fear clash) −0.8, no visible cost −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" is seeded in paragraph one ("The traveled stillness of the library persisted") and reprised at closure ("In the traveled stillness of the library, ancient melodies became bridges"). The tone coheres through rehearsal beats (hushed, quietude, whispered discovery) and modulates subtly as autumn darkness gathers, supporting the final lamp-lit image. The phrase charges the ending with layered meaning (stillness that has journeyed, quiet that holds motion). Early signal +0.7, closure reprise +1.2, coherence +0.8, modulation under pressure +0.5, specificity +0.4, but static mid-section (no tonal shift during key turns) −0.4.</comment>
