<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's involuntary truthfulness is established early and causes visible friction ("You look nervous…" / the merchant flees), but the trait doesn't complicate the tower ascent or final choice—he simply retrieves a poem and gives the box away without internal conflict between honesty and his goal. The lacquer box is labeled "the one secret he'd managed to keep," yet no on-page cost or contradiction follows; the claim floats unearned. The girl at the end receives wisdom passively; Elias's final smile reads as satisfaction rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is present (clutching the box, kneeling) but the peak beats lack contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Elias, tower, post-blackout) arrive promptly. The journey up the tower follows a causal chain: riddle → hidden panel → poem → copy → gift. However, the closure—handing the box to the girl and a streetlamp flickering on—lacks visible cost to Elias; he walks away "lighter," which undercuts the felt sacrifice required for RR (Charged Poise or Earned Stasis). The lamp's revival at that exact moment reads as coincidental reward rather than protagonist-driven consequence. The riddle mechanism is introduced late (at the apex) without prior setup, weakening the causal spine.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lightning tower's "gaunt frame," spiral staircase, and hidden maintenance panel anchor space clearly and constrain Elias's path. The lacquer box is handled in multiple beats (clutched, opened, given), charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "honeyed glow," "nectar dusk," the hiss of the compartment. The blackout context and dead drone carcasses create atmospheric pressure. Micro-setting (the box, the matchbox slot) functions as a constraint that shapes the reveal, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder—is signaled early and drives Elias's ascent. The discovery that the log is a poem rather than "technical, cold" constitutes a reversal that reweights his mission. Yet the conflict lacks escalation: no obstacle impedes his climb, the panel is conveniently open, and the riddle solves itself without struggle. The girl's acceptance and the lamp's flicker provide resolution without visible cost or trade-off; Elias loses nothing and gains peace. One meaningful tightening (poem as revelation) is present but agency at closure is minimal—he hands off the burden and departs unburdened.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—wonder versus utilitarian routine, beauty in loss—emerges through the architect's whimsical method, the poem mourning drones "as fallen stars," and the lacquer box repurposed from locket to "city's lost soul." The final image (girl holding the box, lamp flickering) offers a resonant answer: preserving memory can reignite hope. No overt moralizing mars the ending. However, the thematic turn ("sometimes, that's what matters most") edges toward summarizing the lesson rather than trusting the image alone, and the lamp's coincidental revival softens the ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is consistent. Elias's perceptual signature—noticing "honeyed glow," "nectar dusk," smooth lacquer—reflects his preservation mindset. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: his involuntary honesty to the merchant, the soft exchange with the girl. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("the nectar dusk's soft lament," "systemic failure"). Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose modulates appropriately with emotional beats, and the final line ("a small beacon of truth in the twilight") maintains tonal coherence without dropping into summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is generally high: the opening establishes character, curse, blackout, and drones in one paragraph. However, several beats loop or restate: "the one secret he'd managed to keep" and later "his own lacquer box" redundantly anchor the same object; "his honesty forcing him to add" feels like scaffolding. The phrase "nectar dusk" appears twice as a poetic placeholder without advancing pressure. Figurative language is dense in non-peak beats ("flickered out not with a bang, but a sigh") but doesn't obscure causality. No major artifacts touch closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The involuntary-truthfulness trait paired with toll-keeping offers a fresh angle, and the architect's riddle-based maintenance panel is a whimsical, specific detail. The premise—drone beehive blackout—gestures toward steampunk/solarpunk tropes but lacks deep transformation; the drones function as generic tech-failure backstory. The poem-as-log and lacquer-box-as-vessel motifs feel earned. However, the core arc (retrieve knowledge, pass it on, feel lighter) follows a familiar template: the wise keeper gifts wisdom to the next generation. The lamplight flickering on at the moment of transfer is a convenient symbolic flourish. Risk is present but modest; the story doesn't subvert or challenge its own premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (candid toll keeper) drives the ascent and the final gift, shaping two key beats: the climb/discovery and the handoff. His involuntary truthfulness causes the merchant to flee (early cost) and softens into "gentle truth" at the end, reweighting the trait. However, the trait doesn't constrain his core goal; he could complete the tower mission without the curse. The character is present in setup, middle (climb), and closure (gift), satisfying all three gates and contributing causally to two beats, but the truthfulness attribute operates more as flavor than essential constraint on his choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lacquer box appears in beat one (clutched), beat two (opened at apex, note placed inside), and beat three (given to girl), meeting all gates and driving closure. Its transformation from locket-holder to wonder-vessel is explicit and charged. Removing it would collapse the story's through-line. However, the box's mechanics are passive—Elias uses it as a container, not a tool that constrains choice under pressure. It shapes two beats strongly and the ending image, but the girl's acceptance is frictionless, so the cost tied to the box is conceptual rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The drone beehive failure is established as backstory (blackout cause, carcasses in streets) and motivates Elias's mission, satisfying setup. The architect's poem mourns the drones, linking concept to middle development. At closure, the drone wing in the box carries symbolic weight. However, the drones never constrain a present choice or alter tactics; they remain past-tense context. The concept is functional and logically integrated but swappable with any infrastructure failure—solar grid, water system—without breaking the story's structure. Present in all three gates but causal role is weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Involuntarily truthful is demonstrated early (merchant interaction, cost visible) and returns at the end ("his involuntary honesty softening into a gentle truth"), meeting setup and closure gates. The trait constrains one beat (merchant flees) with immediate cost. However, it doesn't pressure the climb or the poem retrieval; Elias narrates and reflects freely without the curse complicating his mission. Middle development is thin—no forced confession at the apex, no strategic workaround. The trait enables characterization but doesn't drive escalation, capping it mid-band despite clear setup and thematic reprise.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The reveal (discovering the architect's poem) reweights Elias's expectation from "dry report" to "the story he needed to tell," a meaningful turn in the middle. The action is present in setup (goal stated), middle (poem found), and closure (shared with girl). However, the revelation itself is passive—Elias reads rather than earns through struggle. The cost is conceptual (relief rather than loss), and the reveal could be replaced with another discovery (a recording, a diagram) without structural breakage. It shapes two beats and participates in closure but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The matchbox/riddle appears only at the apex (late, second third) without prior signal, violating setup gate. Its mechanics matter briefly—the riddle unlocks the panel—but the solution is delivered by Elias reading aloud, not solving; no struggle or cost attaches. Middle development is functional (enables the reveal) but closure doesn't reprise the method. The riddle is whimsical set-dressing rather than a constraint that shapes tactics. Late arrival and ornamental use cap it below 5.0 despite clear causal function in one beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower anchors every beat: Elias begins at its base, ascends the spiral staircase, reaches the apex to find the panel, and descends past the girl. Its verticality and "gaunt frame" supply spatial coherence. The hidden maintenance panel is a micro-setting constraint that enables the reveal. However, the tower doesn't pressure Elias—no locked doors, no competing visitors, no structural danger. It functions as stage rather than obstacle. Present in all three gates and shapes one key beat (panel/reveal), but lacks tactical friction, placing it in the functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The blackout timeframe is established early (post-blackout, drones failed, city dark) and shapes the setting's despair, meeting setup. The timeframe recurs at closure (lamp flickers back to life), creating a before/after bookend. However, no live clock tightens decisions; Elias ascends at leisure, and the narrative skips transit ("Descending the tower, he passed few others") without time pressure. The blackout is context rather than constraint. Present in setup and closure but absent from middle development, capping it near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Preserving wonder is stated early ("his goal was simple: to preserve the memory") and drives every choice: the climb, the poem retrieval, the gift to the girl. The motivation is tested when Elias fears "the log would be technical, cold," then rewarded when it proves poetic, and fulfilled when he passes the box forward. However, the motivation faces no meaningful friction—no temptation to monetize the secret, no cost to giving it away. Wonder versus routine is dramatized through the architect's poem and the girl's fatigue, but Elias's commitment is uncontested. Present in all gates, shapes two beats and closure, but lacks conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Nectar dusk" appears twice and anchors the visual palette (honeyed glow, twilight, first lamp). Tone is elegiac and tender, cohering through the climb and the gift. The phrase itself charges the final image ("a small beacon of truth in the twilight"), modulating from loss (dead drones) to gentle hope (lamp flickers). However, tone is largely static—no modulation under pressure, no tonal contrast during the climb. The piece teaches a lyric, mournful register and holds it, which fits the lens but doesn't deepen. Present in setup and closure, supports the ending image, but lacks dynamic range.</comment>
