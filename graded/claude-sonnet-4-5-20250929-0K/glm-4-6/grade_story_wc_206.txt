<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but never tested through visible contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. Internal conflict is absent; his skills and tools align perfectly with needs without struggle. The climactic repair unfolds as smooth execution rather than a choice that forecloses a path with cost. Embodied emotion is replaced by atmospheric gesture ("fingers… moved with a dancer's grace").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural, but no meaningful tightening occurs—the repair proceeds as foretold without reversal or deepening. Closure registers as a successful technical task ("The nightingale's song returned") without visible cost or a decision that reweights prior material. The ending summarizes triumph rather than landing a decisive image that charges the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is vividly rendered and constrains the repair method (specific frequencies reveal invisible fissures). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful. Spatial choreography remains clear. The chamber functions as micro-setting that enables a key beat, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement, but does not charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reclaim light stolen by midnight) is declared early but faces no on-page opposition or tightening choice. The repair unfolds as predetermined success; coincidence (the stone arrived during an eclipse) solves rather than complicates. No visible price is paid; the protagonist's agency is execution of known skill rather than a decision that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of invisible repair and preservation versus decay emerges from the premise. The final paragraph ("some wonders required neither grand spells…") states the theme rather than allowing the image to resonate without comment. The nightingale's transformed song is a strong particular, but the moralizing frame in the last sentence ("simply the quiet devotion of those who listen to the music in the brokenness") applies −0.5 for explicit thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction drifts into elevated register ("covenant of rust," "celestial magic," "tinkersong wonder") that exceeds a craftsman's lexicon in peak beats. Perceptual signature is generic across paragraphs; no distinct rhythm or bias. Filter verbs ("noting with satisfaction," "memories flooded back") dull immediacy without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "His fingers…"; "The moment came when…"; "As he worked, memories flooded back…"; recycled stems flatten propulsion. Paraphrase loops: "mending what isn't torn" / "fixing the invisible rather than the broken." Figurative density in calm exposition without pattern-teaching ("springs of lapsed time," "midnight's theft," "shadow realm between worlds") applies −0.6. Stock metaphors ("fallen star with a purpose") and filter-verb stacks ("noting with satisfaction") add −0.4. Artifacts touch the ending paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The invisible-repair premise offers a fresh angle on craft-magic fusion. Execution leans on familiar fantasy scaffolding: philosopher's stone, fallen moon, Great Darkening, shadow realm. The nightingale box as town-light vessel and the dishonesty-detecting stone are specific touches. The climax unfolds as foretold technical success without moral calculus or non-obvious synthesis, and the ending's summary frame ("some wonders required neither grand spells…") abstracts rather than particularizes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and central to plot. His choices are execution of known skill rather than decisions that alter tactics under pressure. No on-page moment where he must choose between competing goods or navigate failure. Introduced early and shapes all beats, but swappable with any skilled craftsman without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph three), handled in multiple beats (wilts near dishonesty, tethering in the chamber), and shapes the climactic repair. Its properties (amber glow, truth-detection, light amplification) enable the solution. Not indispensable—another magical catalyst could serve with minor edits. Appears in closure but as one component among many rather than the irreplaceable hinge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Mentioned once ("the covenant of rust") as a phrase Elara whispers, described as "an ancient agreement between preservation and decay" that grants him sight. Does not constrain choices or alter tactics on the page; functions as atmospheric label. Missing middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The stone wilts near dishonesty, protecting Elara from dishonest customers (setup). During the climactic repair, "the amber light bloomed brighter in the absence of deception" (middle beat). Does not constrain a choice with visible cost; the attribute confirms rather than tests. No dishonest customer appears on the page to create friction. Present in two beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tethering is the method Elara uses to restore the nightingale box, signaled in paragraph twelve and executed in the climax. The action is irreplaceable: "tethering stone to mechanism using filaments of starlight" creates the cascade that restores light. Drives the resolution and is central to closure. High causal pressure and closure linkage; not swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Introduced early as Elara's "greatest talent," restated in dialogue ("The wound isn't always where you expect it"), and applied in the climax ("mending what isn't torn"). Shapes the repair method (tracing invisible fissures rather than obvious breaks). Present in setup, middle, and payoff, but the mechanics remain abstract; the reader cannot distinguish this method from ordinary careful craftsmanship on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is introduced early, described in detail, and provides the acoustic conditions that reveal invisible fissures under specific frequencies. Shapes the climactic repair: "creating a tinkersong wonder that filled the resonance chamber with increasing complexity." Essential to method and present in closure. Irreplaceable setting that constrains approach and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Today was critical, as the entire town hung in the balance" declares urgency, but no on-page clock tightens decisions. The repair proceeds at the pace of careful craftsmanship without interruption or deadline pressure. Time is asserted rather than felt. Missing middle constraint and does not shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation is declared early ("to reclaim the light stolen by midnight") and drives all action. Elara's desire is never tested by conflicting wants or visible cost; he executes his plan without friction. The restoration succeeds as intended. Present in setup and payoff but lacks middle friction where the desire must trade off against another value.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Tone is signaled by "tinkersong wonder" and sustained through whimsical diction ("springs of lapsed time," "celestial magic," "minuet dancers"). Consistent but static; does not modulate with pressure or deepen at closure. The final paragraph's summary frame ("some wonders required neither grand spells…") abstracts rather than charging the image with wonder. Present throughout but does not elevate the ending.</comment>
