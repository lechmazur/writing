<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "discover the texture of memories" is stated but never tested by an on-page choice with cost. His filter ("seeing the world not as it was, but as a mosaic of forgotten moments") remains label-only; we see him listening and layering but no micro-choice reveals what he sacrifices or risks. The final pocket-slip with the label offers no visible foreclosure—he continues unchanged. Interiority leans on abstract declarations ("His motivation was singular") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within 120 words. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: fragments layer toward a final reconfiguration. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the label becomes "proof of existence"), but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatically legible—no prior option is foreclosed, no tactic shifts. The poison-label discovery at midpoint and the pocket-slip at the end bracket the structure, but the between-work (docker's laugh, woman's call, porter's prophecy) is summarized rather than shown altering his stance beat by beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vivid and specific ("steel canyons," "corrugated walls"), and the tidal rhythm is woven through ("high tide a blur of activity, low tide a hush"). The poison label—wedged between containers, "brittle paper...edges softened by salt and time"—anchors the climactic layering moment and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (kneeling, holding it to light, slipping into pocket) is clean. The micro-setting (label as object-setting) constrains the protagonist's ritual and supports closure, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (forge identity from fragments) is signaled early but never escalates through on-page resistance or cost. The label discovery at midpoint offers a potential tightening, yet the protagonist's layering proceeds without friction—no fragment contradicts another, no stevedore objects, no inner doubt forces a tradeoff. The ending ("a key, a proof of existence") declares success without showing what path was foreclosed or what tactic changed. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift is sufficient, but here pressure remains flat from first mention to pocket-slip.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of erased identity and narrative reconstruction emerges organically from the container-graveyard setting and the label-layering ritual. The final image ("a man made of stories, forever searching for the first word of his own") offers resonance without overt thesis. However, lines like "Their histories, their textures, were now his armor against the nameless void" veer toward abstract philosophizing, and the closing declaration ("The journey was his name now") states rather than images the theme. The label as "vessel for others" is a strong motif, but its recurrence is functional rather than charged with escalating cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual filter: "The clang of a distant crane was not noise, but the tremor of a story about to be lost." Diction ("monolith," "testimonial," "cartographer of the forgotten") maintains an elevated, melancholic register appropriate to the protagonist's oblique consciousness. No dialogue tests voice distinction. Purposeful compression ("his survival a glitch in the system") and reflection interleaved with sensory anchors (salt, light, gulls) support the lyric mode. Minor filter-verb reliance ("He learned to layer," "He began to layer") in key beats slightly dulls immediacy but remains voice-coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third ("Each container was a monolith, its rusted surface a distorted mirror of the gray sky"). Midpoint scaffolding emerges: "The memory of a docker...became the cause. A young woman's tearful phone call...became the reason. The porter's grumbled prophecy...became the final destination" uses identical syntactic stems across three adjacent lines, triggering template-cadence penalty (−0.4). The final paragraph leans on summary ("he would keep collecting, keep layering") rather than concrete image, flattening propulsion. No paraphrase loops or stock metaphors touch closure, so penalty remains capped at −0.6 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise (bureaucratic death erases a man who rebuilds identity from port fragments) is specific and the container-labyrinth setting fresh. The label-layering ritual—transforming a poison bottle warning into a scaffolded life—offers a non-obvious synthesis. However, the emotional arc (nameless wanderer collects stories, declares himself "made of stories") follows a meditative template without a destabilizing turn. The final image ("forever searching for the first word of his own") feels inevitable but lands as poetic assertion rather than earned surprise. Risk is present in the lyric compression but does not heighten stakes beyond the established mode.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The death-certificate-error survivor frames the premise and drives the protagonist's need to collect fragments. He appears in every paragraph and his nameless status shapes the dominant stake. However, he makes no on-page decision with visible cost—he listens, layers, and pockets the label without friction or tradeoff. Present in setup, middle (label discovery), and ending (pocket-slip), satisfying all three gates, but causal pressure is weak: removing his bureaucratic erasure would not break the story's mechanics, only its metaphor. Functional but lacks the choice-driven cost required for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The poison-bottle label is introduced at midpoint ("wedged between two corrugated walls"), handled in a sustained beat (kneeling, tracing, holding to light), and returns in the ending ("slipped...into his pocket" as "proof of existence"). It anchors the layering ritual and charges the final image. Present in two distinct beats (discovery, pocket-slip) with specificity ("brittle paper, its edges softened by salt and time"). The label's properties—"potent metaphor for his own administrative death"—constrain the ritual and shape closure. Strong integration across setup (implied), development (layering), and payoff, with closure linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Erased histories (the core concept) is stated early ("the world had accepted it, erasing him") and invoked throughout ("graveyard of voices," "wreckage of erased histories"). It frames the protagonist's stake and the label's symbolic charge. However, the concept functions thematically rather than tactically—no on-page moment shows how erasure blocks or enables a specific action. Present in setup, development (implicit in fragment-collecting), and payoff (label as "proof"). Meets two gates (setup, payoff) and resonates at closure, eligible for mid-band, but lacks the choice-constraint required for ≥7.0.</question>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently" is named early ("He filtered reality differently, seeing the world...as a mosaic of forgotten moments") but remains label-only. The filtering does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost—no moment shows him missing a danger or seizing an opportunity others would not. Present in setup and implicit in the ending's perceptual claim, satisfying two gates, but ornamental. Swappable with "sees metaphorically" or "interprets symbolically." Functional mention without tradeoff caps at mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Layering drives the midpoint ritual (tracing the label, assigning docker's laugh, woman's call, porter's prophecy to its history) and is declared as method throughout ("He learned to layer," "began to layer them onto this small, lethal artifact"). Present in setup (method claim), development (label beat), and ending (pocket-slip as culmination). The action shapes two beats and provides the story's central image. However, the layering is summarized rather than shown constraining a choice—no fragment conflicts, no cost to inclusion. Strong presence and closure linkage, but lacks on-page cost and irreplaceability (another metaphor-building action could substitute). Eligible for mid-7s, capped by swappability and summary execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Collecting fragments (overheard stories) is the stated method, introduced early ("By collecting fragments of overheard stories, he built a temporary scaffolding") and enacted in the label beat (docker, woman, porter). Present in setup, development (label layering), and ending (implicit continuation: "he would keep collecting"). The method enables the layering ritual and charges the label's transformation. However, the fragments themselves are summarized in a single paragraph rather than dramatized across distinct beats, and no on-page cost (time, missed opportunity, social friction) accompanies the collecting. Meets all three gates and shapes one major turn, but summary execution and weak causal pressure limit the score. Lyric reprise (opening method claim → final continuation) adds resonance but does not overcome swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is introduced in the opening line ("towering labyrinth of shipping containers"), vivid throughout ("steel canyons," "corrugated walls," "stack...marked with faded symbols"), and provides the micro-setting for the label discovery. The port supplies the label, the tide rhythm, and the spatial pressure ("slanting through the containers like a searchlight"). Present in setup, development (label wedged between walls), and ending (walking deeper into the labyrinth). The setting constrains the protagonist's ritual (label location, spatial privacy) and charges the final image. High specificity and irreplaceability—no generic warehouse or alley could anchor the tidal rhythm or the "graveyard of voices" metaphor. Strong integration with two beats and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The tidal rhythm is named early ("He moved with the rhythm of the tides, high tide a blur of activity, low tide a hush") and reprised at the ending ("As the tide began to turn, marking the end of another day"). Present in setup and payoff, satisfying two gates. The timeframe provides atmospheric color and marks closure, but it does not tighten a decision or alter tactics—the protagonist's layering at the label could occur at any hour. Swappable with "dawn/dusk cycle" or "shift changes." Functional lyric reprise without causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation ("to discover the texture of memories") is stated early ("His motivation was singular") and reprised in the ending's declaration ("forever searching for the first word of his own"). Present in setup and payoff. The desire frames the stake and charges the thematic arc, but it is never dramatized through a conflicted choice—no moment shows him weighing the cost of one fragment over another or sacrificing immediacy for memory. Told rather than shown, and no on-page friction between want and cost. Meets two gates and shapes thematic closure, eligible for mid-band, but lacks the choice-driven pressure required for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Nameless identity (tone) is established in the opening ("He had no name, not anymore") and sustained throughout with consistent diction ("ghost among giants," "nameless void," "a man made of stories"). The tone modulates subtly: melancholic observation in the opening, focused ritual at the label, declarative resolve at the ending. Present in setup, development (label as "key, a proof of existence"), and payoff. The tone charges the final image and coheres across turns. However, it remains a single static mood (elegiac drift) without tension or counter-pressure. Strong coherence and closure linkage, but limited modulation caps at upper-mid band.</comment>
