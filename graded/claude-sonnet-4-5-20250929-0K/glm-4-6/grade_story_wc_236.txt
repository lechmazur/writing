<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's grief and sensory loss anchor her motivation clearly, and the screw reading offers embodied choice under pressure. However, the recovery moment—scent returning at "cedar" and "freesia"—arrives without sufficient cost or resistance; the trembling simply stops. The grandmother's story provides emotional weight, but Elara's interior voice occasionally drifts into therapeutic abstraction ("pain into purpose," "miracles were ordinary") that flattens contradiction. Embodied emotion is strong in the loupe scene but the ending resolves too cleanly without visible foreclosure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and the screw discovery offers a clear tightening. However, the closure—Elara feeling hope and her hands steadying—relies on the scent return as a convenience reset rather than a decisive change with on-page cost. The inscription *L. 1923* provides new knowledge but doesn't narrow Elara's options or extract a visible price; she simply feels better. The causal lens holds through the screw examination but the ending Image recharges prior motifs without demonstrating what Elara has given up or altered in her world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The water clock shop is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail—mist, dripping water, grime-streaked windows—and the loupe functions as micro-setting that constrains Elara's discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout and the fog's lifting mirrors the emotional arc without overt symbolism. The screw's physical texture (worn threads, dimpled metal) charges the final recognition, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting with her grandmother's legacy and her own lost senses—is signaled early and the screw examination provides one meaningful tightening when the inscription is revealed. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off; Elara's breakthrough costs her nothing on the page and no live option is foreclosed. The tears and scent return feel like reward without resistance, and coincidence (the inscription happening to be legible under magnification) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of ordinary miracles and hidden meaning emerges through the screw's inscription and Elara's sensory loss, avoiding direct statement until the final third. However, the ending paragraph states the theme overtly—"miracles were ordinary; they were just hidden"—replacing resonance with summary. The cedar and freesia returns provide charged images but the thematic landing leans on articulation rather than scene pressure, and "hope, etched as clearly as the inscription" risks Thematic Echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature—focusing on texture, light, and the phantom of scent—remains consistent and the narration filters detail through her aromatherapist's lens. Psychic distance is controlled and the prose carries distinct rhythm in sensory passages. However, the final paragraph drifts into summary mode ("she had fixed herself") and the register occasionally elevates beyond Elara's working voice ("occluded view," "unveil," "revelation"). No dialogue present to assess. Focalization remains stable but voice modulation under peak emotion could be sharper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several paraphrase loops appear: "ordinary miracles" recurs three times in the final third without evolving meaning, and the "trembling calm" phrase bookends without transformation. The closing paragraph stacks summary constructions ("she had come here to fix clocks, but instead, she had fixed herself") that restate rather than advance. Figurative density is high throughout without consistent pattern-teaching—"water drops," "soft footfalls on sand," "foreign landscape," "compass"—blurring the closure image. Template stems ("The water clock dripped") recur mechanically. Total artifacts across the final third trigger Q7 penalty and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The aromatherapist-without-scent premise offers a fresh angle and the water clock repair setting is specific, but the emotional recovery arc follows a familiar template: traumatized artisan finds healing through ancestor's artifact. The screw as emotional map is evocative yet the grandmother's story—naming a baby after a lost daughter—reads as archetypal rather than particular. Transformation test: swap the screw for another heirloom and the arc remains largely unchanged. The freesia/cedar scent return feels convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout but her aromatherapist background functions primarily as backstory context for her loss of smell; it does not constrain present choices. She picks up tools and examines the screw, but these actions would work identically for any bereaved artisan. Present in setup and ending, but causal pressure from the specific profession is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The screw is handled in the opening beat, examined under the loupe mid-story (revealing the inscription), and referenced in the closing image. It drives the key discovery and carries reweighted meaning at the end. However, the screw's specific mechanical properties (threads, dimples) do not constrain Elara's tactics; any inscribed heirloom could serve the same function. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement but moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Reading between lines" appears as a phrase early and is enacted when Elara deciphers the inscription, shaping the story's central discovery. However, the concept remains somewhat metaphorical; the "lines" are not literal text but scratches and an engraving. It influences one key turn but does not recur to charge the ending image beyond thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Maps emotional terrain" is stated as description ("its weathered surface charting the emotional terrain of births long past") but the attribute does not constrain Elara's choices. The screw's nicks and scratches are observed but do not enable or block any tactic. Present in setup and thematically relevant but functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Humanize" appears explicitly ("she tried to humanize the woman who had wielded it") and drives Elara's motivation to understand her grandmother. The action of reconstructing her grandmother's humanity through the screw leads to the inscription discovery. However, the term itself is swappable—"understand," "remember," "honor"—without altering structure. Present across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The loupe creates an "occluded view" that reveals the hidden inscription, directly shaping the key turn. The method is signaled early ("occluded view of scratches and worn metal") and its mechanics matter: magnification enables discovery. However, after the inscription is found, the method does not recur or charge the ending. Strong middle development but no closure payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The water clock repair shop is vividly described and provides spatial grounding, but it does not pressure Elara's choices. She could examine the screw in any workshop; the clocks function as atmospheric background (the dripping marking time) rather than constraint or resource. Present throughout but setting does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Morning fog" bookends the story and the mist is described in multiple beats, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions. Elara's examination proceeds without temporal pressure; the fog's lifting is metaphorical rather than causal. Present in setup and ending but does not constrain pacing or urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Unveil ordinary miracles" is stated late ("ordinary miracles waiting to be unveiled," "miracles were ordinary") and frames Elara's thematic realization, but the desire does not create friction. She examines the screw without cost or competing want. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Trembling calm" appears in the opening ("a trembling calm she couldn't shake") and resolves in the closing ("The trembling calm was gone"), modulating from unsteady to firm. The tone supports the arc but remains relatively static mid-story; peak pressure at the inscription discovery does not intensify or break the established mood. Coherent framing but limited charge at closure.</comment>
