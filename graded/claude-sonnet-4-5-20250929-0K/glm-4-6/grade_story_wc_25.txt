<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to prove the whisper theory reads clear, but his confidence throughout flattens internal conflict—he never doubts, missteps, or pays a visible emotional cost. The decision to hand Jenna the coin after winning undercuts stakes rather than earning them; no prior causality shows why he'd forfeit his prize. Jenna's arc from scoffing rival to awed follower happens in a single beat without resistance. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "mask of irritation," "awe," "legends."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The closure lands on-page—Kael proves his theory and opens the chamber—but the cost is unclear: he wins the bet yet immediately gives away the prize without dramatized sacrifice or foreclosed option. Causality holds through the whisper test and key insertion, though the geomagnetic storm and zodiac coin's glowing function feel ornamental rather than pressure-driving. The lens reads Causal with a situational accent (storm as complication), but the storm never tightens tactics or alters Kael's plan. One meaningful tightening occurs (the whisper test), meeting minimum scope, yet the final image ("secrets yet to unfold") tilts toward sequel setup rather than resonant reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly rendered with corrugated sides, storm energy, and metallic acoustics that directly enable the whisper test. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the junction and chamber. The key's "disguised seam" and the chamber's humming walls provide tactile grounding. However, the geomagnetic storm functions mostly as atmospheric decoration—static crackling and whipping hair—without constraining a choice or altering tactics. The zodiac coin's glow and the storm's "feverish pulse" resonate but don't shape the outcome, capping the band below 7.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther—is signaled early and tested on-page via the whisper/shout contrast, delivering one clear tightening. However, Kael's agency feels low-friction: he already possesses the theory, maps, coin, and key; no obstacle forces a trade-off or tactical shift. Jenna's arrival and immediate capitulation after one demonstration deflates opposition. The final handoff of the coin erases the bet's cost rather than deepening it. One earned reversal (the successful test) meets minimum scope, but lack of visible price or foreclosed path holds this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden knowledge and listening emerges from the acoustics and folded-map metaphor, culminating in "whispers become legends." Yet the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "The real prize was proving the theory" and "invitations" feel thesis-stated rather than image-earned. The zodiac lion "watching over them" and "secrets yet to unfold" gesture toward resonance but land as sequel hooks. The whisper/shout contrast offers a non-literal frame, but Kael's unearned generosity and Jenna's instant conversion simplify the thematic question into a clean binary without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization on Kael; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows some texture: "the labyrinth felt alive," "shadows stretching and recoiling." Dialogue ("Ready to lose your coin?") carries goal pursuit, though Jenna's capitulation lacks subtext. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"calculated spontaneity," "feverish pulse"—that feels imposed rather than Kael's lived idiom. Filter verbs ("he realized") appear but don't overwhelm. Rhythmic control is adequate under storm pressure, but recycled phrases ("the storm intensified," "the storm's song") flatten momentum at peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity holds and information advances per sentence, but template cadence dominates: "He unfolded... Pulling out... holding it up" chains identical participial openers across high-pressure beats. Stock metaphors appear without fresh angle: "shadows stretching and recoiling like living things," "mask of irritation," "city of steel giants." Paraphrase loop near the end: "the labyrinth was alive" stated twice in close succession without added pressure. The whisper-test beat delivers propulsion, but overwriting at closure ("where whispers became legends") and redundant storm descriptions dull the final image. No severe artifacts touch causality, keeping this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The labyrinth-as-sound-map premise offers a fresh angle, and the whisper/shout inversion avoids the obvious. However, the geomagnetic storm and zodiac coin feel like checklist additions rather than organic synthesis—both ornamental to the core conflict. The rival-worker setup and bet structure follow predictable template beats: skeptic challenges, protagonist demonstrates once, skeptic concedes immediately. Kael's unearned coin handoff and Jenna's "Next time, I'm bringing my own key" quip deflate risk into banter. The "secrets yet to unfold" ending signals sequel rather than transformation, and no bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's role as maintenance worker frames his map knowledge and labyrinth navigation, enabling the chamber discovery. His choices drive the whisper test and key insertion (two beats), shaping the closure. However, his expertise functions as convenient competence without visible struggle or trade-off—he already knows the solution. Removing "maintenance worker" and substituting "labyrinth explorer" would require only minor edits. The trait appears early, touches middle and ending, and constrains setting access, placing it in the essential-across-beats band, though swappability and lack of on-page cost prevent higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in three distinct beats: Kael holds it early, it glows to identify Jenna's approach, and he hands it to her at the end. Yet its Leo emblem and "identifies people's walks" function remain vague—how does a coin identify footsteps? The glow serves as convenient plot signal without cost. The final handoff reweights the object thematically (generosity over possession) but undercuts the bet's stakes. The coin is present setup to payoff and touches closure, eligible above 6.0, but its mechanics are decorative and it could be replaced by any tracking device with minimal rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Folded maps appear twice: Kael unfolds one to trace his path and references cross-referencing maps with coin responses. The final paragraph asserts "folded maps suddenly made sense—they weren't just guides; they were invitations," but this thematic claim lacks on-page demonstration—no map-folding mechanic alters a choice or constrains tactics. The concept feels ornamental, a metaphor stated rather than enacted. Introduced early but no middle causal pressure; the ending reference is summary-only. Swappable with "layered maps" or "encrypted maps" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The trait "identifies people's walks" enables the coin to signal Jenna's approach ("faint, rhythmic tread"), but this single use is passive—Kael doesn't act differently based on the identification; he was already waiting. No cost or constraint tied to the ability; it functions as convenient tracking. The trait appears mid-story (past 40% mark) without setup, violating the early-signal expectation. One functional beat but no closure participation or causal pressure beyond minor convenience. Cap at 4.6 for late intro; swappability and ornamental use lower further.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The challenge structures the entire plot: Kael accepts Jenna's bet, tests the whisper theory on-page, and wins. The wager creates the central stake and drives both characters to the junction. The whisper/shout demonstration is the story's clearest causal turn, and the bet's resolution (Kael's victory) anchors the ending. Removing the challenge would collapse the conflict. However, the immediate handoff of the prize erases the cost, and the challenge could be swapped for any demonstration bet without deep structural change. Strong setup, middle test, and payoff meet all three gates; causal pressure and closure linkage push into the essential band, but swappability holds shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The key appears early ("heavy in his other pocket"), its mystery primes midpoint speculation, and Kael inserts it to open the central chamber at closure—three beats, all gates. The key's "disguised seam" mechanic matters on-page, and the revelation that it's "for the labyrinth's heart" reframes prior setup. However, the key solves a lock-finding problem the reader didn't see Kael struggle with; no failed attempts or visible cost tied to its use. Removing the key would require inventing another access method, so specificity is moderate. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement; lack of dramatized cost caps below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth provides the acoustics that enable the whisper test—a direct causal link—and the "corrugated sides," "metallic walls," and "chamber" structure every beat. The maze's layout forces navigation, and the central chamber serves as the closure location. Kael's profession and the setting's verticality ("towering") constrain movement. The setting is irreplaceable: swap for an open field or cave and the sound mechanics break. Early setup, middle navigation pressure, and ending payoff meet all gates. Strong causal involvement and closure charge place this in the essential-across-beats band; hairline shy of indispensable due to the lack of a visible environmental cost (stamina, injury, resource loss).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm appears in opening imagery ("humming with... energy," "crackling with static") and the closing line ("storm began to subside"), framing the story. However, it never tightens a decision or alters tactics—Kael's plan proceeds unchanged regardless of storm intensity. The storm functions as atmospheric decoration: whipping hair, static, "feverish pulse." No middle beat shows the storm complicating navigation or forcing a trade-off. Swappable with "heavy fog" or "night" without structural loss. Present at setup and payoff, missing development; ornamental use and lack of causal pressure cap below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to prove the whisper theory is stated early, tested on-page in the central demonstration beat, and confirmed at closure ("You win"). The wager dramatizes the desire with a tangible stake (the rare coin). However, no internal friction appears—Kael never doubts his theory or faces a cost to test it. Jenna's scoffing provides external pressure, but her instant capitulation deflates the conflict. The motivation drives two key beats (bet acceptance, whisper test) and the ending, meeting all gates. Lack of contradictory impulse or visible trade-off (he wins and still hands over the coin without sacrifice) holds this shy of 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Calculated spontaneity" appears once as a descriptor of Kael's movement ("deliberate yet fluid"), establishing tone. The storm's energy and the labyrinth's "alive" quality support a charged atmosphere. However, tone remains static—no modulation under pressure or shift at closure. The descriptor feels imposed rather than embodied through rhythm or diction. The final image ("whispers became legends") drifts into grandiosity rather than sustaining the calculated/spontaneous tension. Present at setup, no development or payoff modulation. Functional but ornamental; replacing "calculated spontaneity" with "confident ease" requires minimal edit. One mention, no pressure variation, cap mid-band.</comment>
