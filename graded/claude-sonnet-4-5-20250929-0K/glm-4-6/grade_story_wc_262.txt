<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crystal gazer's motivation is clear and his spatial imagination creates a distinct perceptual signature, but interiority often drifts into abstraction ("concepts of them, embodied in the fleeting expressions") rather than embodied contradiction. The final peace feels unearned—no on-page micro-choice demonstrates what he gives up or forecloses by accepting his unused love as "contribution." Internal conflict is more declared than dramatized in simultaneous impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive early. The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens by the second paragraph and holds it through closure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the gazer's shift from burden to peace), but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no on-page forfeiture or visible trade-off makes the "before/after" felt with pressure. The final realization that unused love is "archived in moments of non-existence" reweights the premise, but the protagonist's own reservoir simply dissolves into acceptance without a dramatized friction or loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The projection booth is anchored early with vivid, selective detail (scent of aged film and ozone, hushed thunder). The film strip constrains the gazer's method and returns with reweighted meaning at closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects his psychometric focus. The setting pressures his method but does not force a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, keeping it just below high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—locating where unused love is stored—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the gazer discovers the answer resides in "when" rather than "where," but this realization arrives through passive perception, not a choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off. No visible price is paid; the gazer simply releases the film strip and gains peace. Agency is observation, not decision or renunciation with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the film-strip particulars and the liminal-space concept. The final image—unused love archived in moments of non-existence—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The goodbye-letters metaphor integrates cleanly. However, the ending edges toward abstract philosophizing ("contribution to that great, silent archive") rather than grounding the realization in a concrete choice or sensory particular that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, psychic distance controlled, and the perceptual signature (spatially imaginative, seeing "infinite, folded spaces") is distinctive. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("temporal residue seep into his skin," "贡献" is a non-English character insertion—likely an artifact). Under peak stress the voice remains consistent, but the final paragraph's syntax ("a strange and powerful peace") flattens slightly. No head-hopping; filter verbs are acceptable and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentences generally advance. However, paraphrase loops appear: "He had his answer" is immediately restated as "its profound simplicity was staggering." The phrase "hushed thunder" recurs three times without reweighting. The non-English character "贡献" (contribution) in the final paragraph is a clear artifact. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle: "coiled like a silver serpent" then "edges cool and smooth" (serpents are not metallic). Apply −0.6 for loops and artifact presence in closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—psychometry on outtakes to locate unused love—is specific and non-obvious. The answer (archived in liminal "when" rather than "where") feels earned in hindsight. However, the goodbye-letters metaphor and the lonely-artist archetype lean on familiar templates. The piece transforms the trope through the film-strip particulars and the folded-space lens, but the final emotional resolution (burden to peace) is a well-worn arc. Solid synthesis with modest risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The crystal gazer is present throughout and his desire drives the quest. However, his key action is passive perception—he picks up the film, closes his eyes, and receives the answer. No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup and payoff are clear, but middle development lacks a choice under pressure. Cap at 4.6 (late agency); adjust down for observational rather than decisional role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The film strip appears early (setup), is handled in the psychometry beat (development), and is released at closure with reweighted meaning (payoff). All three gates met. It enables the method and its "coiled serpent" image bookends with "no longer just an object but a map." Two distinct beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage present. Irreplaceability is moderate—another personal object could serve. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Goodbye letters are framed as "performances for an audience of one who had already walked away" and "written in motion" within the film outtakes. The concept appears in the middle third and shapes the thematic answer but does not constrain a tactical choice or alter on-page options. Payoff is thematic and metaphorical; the gazer does not write, send, or renounce a letter. Setup weak, closure participation indirect. Mid-band for conceptual presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is labeled twice: opening and when he "focused harder, his spatially imaginative mind pushing past the celluloid surface." It enables his perception of folded spaces and liminal moments, which supplies the answer. However, this trait is never constrained or tested—no cost, no alternative he must reject. Setup and payoff present; development is label-only. Two-gate integration, no visible trade-off. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Incubate" appears in method description ("psychometry reading, an intimate communion where the past would incubate within his mind") and at closure ("preserved, incubating in their perfect, tragic potential"). Two beats, both thematic. The action does not drive a turn or force a choice; it describes the process. Setup and payoff clear, development indirect. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, earning ~6.3; causal pressure weak. Adjust to 6.7 for closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is named early as "his method" and is enacted on-page: he picks up the film, lets "temporal residue seep into his skin," and experiences the ghostly melody and visual flashes. All three gates met. The method enables discovery but involves no friction, failed attempt, or adaptation under pressure. Two beats (setup, execution), causal enablement, closure linkage indirect. Solid integration, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The projection booth is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (scent, hushed thunder, workbench). Setup strong. It houses the gazer and the film strip but does not constrain his method or supply a resource that alters his discovery—any quiet room would serve. The booth fades during psychometry and "solidifies" at closure, a purposeful reprise that frames the return. Two gates (setup, payoff), micro-setting qualifies, but no middle development or causal pressure. Lyric framing earns mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Forgotten lyrics search for tune" appears as an internal auditory motif: "a tune for which forgotten lyrics searched endlessly" and at closure "the forgotten lyrics of that internal song had found their tune at last." Setup and payoff present, but the timeframe does not track duration or tighten decisions. The search is a metaphorical parallel, not a live clock. Two-gate lyric reprise without causal pressure or middle beat. Cap ~4.6; adjust slightly for thematic charge at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation—to find where unused love is stored—is named early, repeated at midpoint ("his spatially imaginative mind pushing past the celluloid surface, trying to isolate the physical location"), and answered at closure. All three gates met. The desire drives his psychometry and frames the thematic payoff. However, no on-page friction or competing want tests the motivation; he simply receives the answer. Setup, development (active search), and payoff present; causal pressure moderate. Strong integration, modest cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" appears three times: opening ("hushed thunder vibrating through the walls"), middle ("each one humming with a quiet intensity, like the hushed thunder of a storm that never breaks"), and closure echo ("heavy and resonant as the final, fading bass note"). Tone is consistent and modulates with the gazer's discovery, charging the final image. Three touches, all three gates, coherent through turns. Deduct −0.3 for repetition without reweighting (the phrase itself does not evolve). Adjust to 6.1.</comment>
