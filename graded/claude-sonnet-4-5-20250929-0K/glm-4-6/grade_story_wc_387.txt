<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and present throughout, but her interior life leans heavily on abstract philosophical labels ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity") rather than embodied contradiction. The final realization is delivered as summary exposition ("she realized then") without dramatized micro-choices showing the shift. Her action—following fireflies—demonstrates agency, but the internal arc feels more like stated appreciation than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of lyric resonance (whispering parapet → tea whisk → fireflies → loom → return) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when Elara's perception is "forever altered." However, the cost is asserted ("demure audacity had not been in vain") rather than shown through a decision that forecloses an option. Orientation is established early (who, where, when). The accumulation deepens understanding, but the final image lacks felt or visible sacrifice—she simply gains insight and returns unchanged in circumstance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The whispering parapet, glistening stones, and firefly-lit loom are vivid and purposeful, returning at closure to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent (parapet → archway → lanes → workshop → return). The bamboo tea whisk and loom serve as micro-settings that constrain attention and shape the climactic recognition, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, sensory detail skews heavily visual; wet earth and old wood/metal are mentioned but not integrated into choices or tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort—is signaled early and sustained. The journey tightens as fireflies "intensify" and "acknowledge her presence," then lead her to the loom revelation. However, escalation is largely atmospheric; no live option is narrowed or trade-off forced. The fireflies cooperate rather than resist, and Elara's discovery costs her nothing on the page—no stamina loss, no social risk, no renunciation. The tightening is conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—hidden patterns and interconnected effort—emerges from the loom/net echo and firefly guidance without overt moralizing. The final image (whisk in sash, parapet as "center of a beautifully woven universe") offers a resonant answer. However, the penultimate paragraph ("treasure of appreciation, which was far greater") edges into summary thesis, and "scintillatingly somber giver of the moon path's secret" feels like authorial intrusion. The piece resists false complexity but leans on abstraction ("connective tissue between all things") rather than concrete particulars at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and purpose-driven ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity"), though these phrases repeat without modulation and border on over-writing. The perceptual signature—philosophical, attentive to craft metaphors—is distinct. However, register occasionally drifts into essay-like abstraction ("cosmic echo of effort and form," "exquisite, hidden truth") that flattens immediacy under pressure. No dialogue present; interior voice is coherent but leans decorative in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, but overwriting pervades the piece: "scintillatingly somber" appears three times, "demure audacity" twice, and figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff ("living stars," "language she was determined to understand," "cipher written in light," "cosmic echo"). Mixed metaphor: fireflies as "language" and "cipher" and "map" blur coherence. Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences open with "The" + noun + past-tense verb. Paraphrase loops: "her demure audacity had not been in vain; it had opened a door" restates across two clauses. Peak beats (loom discovery, return to parapet) are dulled by stacked modifiers and abstract summary rather than concrete action. Apply −1.2 cumulative for density, coherence slip, and template runs; final-third artifact presence disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The net-mender philosopher frame and firefly-as-guide premise offer a specific synthesis, but the core emotional arc—quiet artist follows natural phenomenon to gain aesthetic insight—is familiar. Transformation test: the plot and arc function unchanged with different objects (butterflies, stars) and professions. The loom/net echo provides one fresh inflection, yet the ending ("treasure of appreciation") resolves into a safe, affirming universal without risk or counter-pressure. No bold structural risk; the journey is linear and cooperative. Mid-band fit for a competent but derivative premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Net-mender philosopher: Present in opening and closing beats, shaping Elara's perceptual lens and motivating the search for patterns. The loom discovery directly mirrors her craft, creating thematic resonance. However, her occupation does not constrain a key choice or tactic—she observes rather than acts on net-mending knowledge. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak (no middle choice enabled by this trait). Score reflects functional presence with thematic linkage but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Bamboo tea whisk: Used in opening beat (resting beside cup, tines damp), lifted as a "conductor" mid-journey, set on the loom as an offering, tucked into sash at closure. Four touches across beats, with symbolic reprise at end. However, the whisk does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—it is handled but remains ornamental. Setup, development (lifted/used), and payoff (tucked away) gates met, but no causal pressure or cost connection. Mid-band for presence and return without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Hidden patterns: The concept drives the entire journey—Elara seeks to understand firefly patterns, follows moon paths, and discovers the loom's "hidden pattern made manifest." It shapes her stake and the ending realization ("the most profound patterns are often those we fail to see"). All three gates met with strong causal linkage and closure participation. However, the concept is more thematic frame than tactical constraint; it does not narrow options or impose visible cost. Score reflects essential thematic role and closure charge, falling short of indispensability due to abstract rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Scintillatingly somber: Label appears three times but never constrains or enables an action. The attribute is asserted ("matched her own scintillatingly somber mood," "Her scintillatingly somber heart swelled," "The scintillatingly somber giver") without embodied consequence or visible tradeoff. No setup gate (mentioned in beat one but not dramatized); no development gate (does not shape a middle choice); weak payoff (repeated label only). Ornamental use; swappable with any melancholy descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Whistle: Elara whistles "to conduct," hoping to attune to firefly rhythm; fireflies respond by intensifying and becoming "more deliberate." She whistles again at closure "to express her gratitude." Two functional beats (inciting and closing), framing the journey. However, the whistle does not drive a major turn—fireflies cooperate without this action being tested or refined. Setup and payoff gates met; development weak (no middle beat where whistling alters tactics). Score reflects purposeful early signal and charged reprise, but limited causal essentiality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>By following moon paths: Signaled early ("resolved to follow the moon paths"), method is described ("silver trails the fireflies seemed to trace"), and executed throughout the middle journey (parapet → archway → lanes → workshop). All three gates met. However, "moon paths" is metaphorical rather than mechanically constrained—she simply walks where fireflies go. The method does not impose a tactical cost or enable a choice another approach could not. Functional across beats, but swappable with "following the fireflies" without structural change. Mid-band for clear presence and sustained use without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Whispering parapet after rain: Opens and closes the story, with "slick" stones and "quiet resonance" anchoring Elara's ritual and return. The setting provides a departure point and reflective sanctuary, charging the final image ("center of a beautifully woven universe"). However, the parapet does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it is atmospheric anchor rather than tactical pressure. Setup and payoff gates strongly met; development gate absent (no middle beat where the parapet's features matter). Score reflects strong framing and closure charge without causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>During firefly season: Timeframe is established early ("peak of firefly season") and sustained (fireflies present throughout, "last firelight flickered out" as dawn approaches). The season provides the necessary condition for the journey. However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Elara has no competing clock, and the fireflies cooperate. Dawn's arrival is descriptive rather than a deadline forcing choice. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak (no middle beat where time pressure alters tactics). Functional frame without tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To appreciate hidden effort: Motivation stated early ("simple: to appreciate the hidden effort"), sustained through the loom discovery ("revealing the connective tissue"), and fulfilled at closure ("treasure of appreciation"). All three gates met, shaping the dominant stake. However, the desire is told more than dramatized in conflicted choices—Elara never weighs this goal against a competing want or cost. No visible friction or trade-off on the page. Score reflects clear presence and thematic integration without embodied tension or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Demure audacity: Phrase appears twice ("With a demure audacity," "Her demure audacity had not been in vain") but tone is asserted rather than modulated through syntax or choice. The story's voice is consistently elevated and reflective, without tonal shift under pressure or contrast between demure restraint and bold action. No embodied dramatization of the oxymoron—Elara's journey is cooperative and affirming, lacking tension between caution and risk. Label-only use; swappable with "quiet determination." Setup and weak payoff gates; no development gate.</comment>
