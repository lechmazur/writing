<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's phobia and adaptive nature are asserted repeatedly but never constrain a specific choice with visible cost. Interior states are labeled ("his need to outwit," "a flicker of hope") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final confrontation resolves via "the seashell's whispers turned into a confession" without dramatizing what changes or what the protagonist risked. Motivation remains abstract; the claim "vulnerability is power" arrives as theme statement rather than earned discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who this person is, what "transformative betrayal" means, and why he's in the library remain vague past 120 words; apply −0.4. The closure unit ("he had outwitted himself") is asserted without showing what choice or renunciation occurred on the page or what cost was paid. Causality is weak: the protagonist "struck—not with violence, but with the seashell's whispers turned into a confession" without dramatizing the act or its consequence. No legible Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The rusted library and stars are evoked repeatedly but remain decorative postcards. Spatial choreography is unclear—kneeling beside a child's cast, then confronting the betrayer in "the ruins of their old laboratory" with no transition. The seashell half and child's cast are handled physically in multiple beats, qualifying micro-setting use, but neither constrains a tactical choice or charges the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaim identity stolen by betrayal—is declared but never tested by a live dilemma with visible cost. The protagonist works "methodically" to decrypt notes, yet no reversal narrows options; the betrayer's "confidence faltered" without showing what the protagonist risked or lost. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does agency: the climax summarizes rather than dramatizes a turn, and the claimed victory arrives without prior escalation or earned price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly: "Vulnerability is power," "you forgot that even the most broken things can be rebuilt," and "he had outwitted himself." These are prompt-label declarations rather than insights earned from concrete struggle. No recurring image reweights prior material; the seashell and child's cast are described but never used to constrain choice or resonate at closure. The final paragraph moralizes rather than letting scene pressure speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>POV distance is stable, but register drifts into therapy-speak ("his phobia screamed," "vulnerability wasn't weakness but a weapon") without earning the language through prior embodiment. Dialogue appears twice and feels serviceable but generic ("You're too late," "You underestimated me"). Perceptual signature is thin—stars, rust, and whispers recur as stock images without character-specific selection. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he realized") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "trust was a luxury he couldn't afford, not after the betrayal that had left him hollow" restates the premise without advancing pressure; "its whispers silenced, its purpose fulfilled" is synonym churn. Template cadence runs dominate: "The library's doors…," "The seashell lay…," "The rusted library…" across adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("stars like scattered salt," "stacks loomed like skeletons") and elevated diction ("trembling certainty," "ozone") clash with the POV's urgency. Apply −1.2 for multiple artifact types, −0.5 additional for touching closure ("he had outwitted himself").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—identity betrayal, cryptic map, phobia-driven quest—reads as template assembly without transformation. The seashell's "whispers" and child's cast as map are intriguing prompts, but their resolution (a confession that "unraveled everything") is summarized rather than dramatized with fresh mechanics. The protagonist's arc from fear to "trembling certainty" is stated rather than shown through specific, non-obvious synthesis. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The phobia-ridden stunt double is mentioned throughout but makes no on-page choice altered by the phobia. The attribute is ornamental; removing "stunt double" or "phobia" would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half is handled across multiple beats (clutched, whispers urging trust, placed on table at end) and seed-to-final reprise reweights meaning slightly. It does not constrain a middle choice or causally enable the climax; the protagonist's action at closure is independent of the object's properties. Cap 4.6 for missing setup role (late causal pressure).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal is declared as backstory and echoed thematically but never dramatized on the page. No scene shows the betrayal altering present tactics or forcing a dilemma. It functions as exposition rather than a live stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" is asserted ("his adaptive nature asserting itself") without a visible tradeoff or cost. The trait is label-only; no on-page action demonstrates adaptation under constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Outwit" is named at closure ("he had outwitted his betrayer—he had outwitted himself") but the mechanics are summarized, not shown. The action does not shape middle beats; it is invoked retrospectively. Cap 3.0 for late, summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged notes on a child's cast is signaled early and described across beats ("his fingers tracing the letters," "the letters resolving into words"). The method does not visibly constrain an attempt or force a tactical choice; the protagonist "worked methodically" without error or cost. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is seeded early, reprised at closure ("The rusted library faded behind him, the stars a final farewell"), and described across beats. It does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters a choice. The setting frames mood but remains postcard.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After discovering you're not who you thought" is backstory exposition, not a live timeframe. No ticking clock or deadline shapes present decisions. The element is invoked but not functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To prove that vulnerability is power" is stated overtly in the decrypted notes and again at closure. The desire is told, not dramatized through a choice with friction between wants and costs. Cap 3.4 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Trembling certainty" appears repeatedly as mood label ("a trembling certainty in his eyes," "his heart full of a trembling certainty"). The tone is coherent but static, not modulating with pressure turns. It charges the final image slightly through repetition, lifting it above ornamental into functional reprise.</comment>
