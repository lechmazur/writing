<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's interiority relies heavily on atmospheric descriptors ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") that label rather than embody internal contradiction. The "mildly obsessed" trait is declared but never constrains a choice with visible cost—he simply continues mapping without friction. His shift from "documentation of an ending to revelation of a beginning" occurs off-page; we're told the discovery "changed everything" but see no micro-choice or behavioral pivot. The final whisper "I am ready" asserts acceptance without dramatizing the competing impulses that would make it costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of atmospheric layering and celestial countdown, and closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing—the endless night as "full of something" rather than empty. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive adequately by the opening paragraph. However, the decisive reweighting happens in summary ("his understanding became complete") rather than through a concrete image or gesture that makes the cost undeniable on the page. The "flaking gold leaf booklet glowed softly" offers a visual moment, but it follows rather than enacts the shift, weakening the felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The fort's "cold stone embrasure," "ancient timbers groaning," and "storm-tossed ridge" provide spatial grounding and weather pressure. The booklet is handled across multiple beats, evolving from record to map to glowing artifact, which qualifies as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (bruised violet sky, pebble-shore, ambered hush), though some phrases ("flaking gold leaf") repeat without functional variation. The setting does not constrain a tactical choice mid-story, preventing entry to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the map before the last star dies—is signaled early and tightens through the celestial countdown timeframe. One meaningful pressure point occurs when Kaelen discovers concentric circles suggesting a center, which "changed everything" and accelerates his work. However, this shift is told rather than shown through a concrete choice or trade-off, and the final "I am ready" moment arrives without on-page resistance or visible cost. Escalation reads more as accumulative urgency than a choice that narrows options, fitting the Accumulative lens but lacking the dramatized price that would lift the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly from particulars: mapping darkness as architecture of silence, the night as gateway rather than void. The concentric-circles discovery reweights the premise from ending to beginning without thesis-statement. The final image ("completed map illuminating not a path through darkness but a doorway into it") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, phrases like "marbled hush within him where past and future merged" and "summarizing not just silence but the spaces between silences" drift toward abstract philosophizing rather than rooting insight in embodied experience, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-limited distance and a consistent contemplative register. Diction ("ambered hush," "marbled hush," "storm-tossed ridge," "flaking gold leaf booklet") recurs across beats in identical phrasing, creating template cadence that flattens rhythmic variety. Perceptual signature is atmospheric but not character-specific—the oracle's noticing could belong to any poetic observer. The prose maintains clarity and avoids head-hopping, but the repeated modifiers and parallel constructions ("the ambered hush," "the marbled hush") reduce sentence-level propulsion under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean, but paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "flaking gold leaf booklet" appears five times in identical phrasing; "ambered hush" and "marbled hush" recur without variation; sentence stems repeat ("Kaelen's method," "Kaelen's fingers," "Kaelen had"). The phrasing "the pebble-shore oracle" and "the fort's commander" substitute descriptors for names, creating distance without voice motivation. High figurative density ("bruised violet sky," "wind's persistent fingers," "overlapping silhouettes," "gateway," "doorway") in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching triggers overwriting penalties. Information density is moderate, but scaffold and loop artifacts touch multiple beats including near-closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—mapping darkness itself as the stars die—offers a fresh angle on apocalypse-witness material, and the inversion (night as full rather than empty, map as key rather than record) provides a non-obvious turn. Execution, however, leans on stock fantasy-oracle framing: ancient booklet, stone fort, mentor's technique, predecessor's madness. The "pebbles as repositories of memory" and "whispered secrets from the shore" gesture toward world-building without integrating into the map's mechanics or closure. Emotional specificity is subordinated to atmospheric tone, making the transformation test marginal—swap the oracle for another contemplative figure and the arc holds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kaelen (pebble-shore oracle) is present throughout and his mapping activity frames all beats. Setup: named and located by paragraph one. Development: the concentric-circles discovery (paragraph 14) is attributed to him, though the "changed everything" claim is summary. Closure: he whispers "I am ready" and his understanding "became complete" in the final beats. However, his choices are all continuation—he keeps mapping—with no on-page decision that narrows options or alters tactics. The final whisper is declaration, not a choice with visible cost. Functional but not causal-driving; no distinct cost tied to his agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The flaking gold leaf booklet appears in setup (paragraph two), development (paragraphs 5, 8, 14, 18, 19), and closure (final paragraph, where it "glowed softly"). It evolves from record to map to illuminated artifact, meeting the reweighted-meaning test. Handled on the page: Kaelen's quill moves across it, he records observations, the pattern of concentric circles reveals itself within its pages. It enables the mapping method and charges the final image. Strong integration across beats and ending, though the glowing is described rather than shown altering a choice, preventing top-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Ambered hush appears in setup (paragraph 5: "ambered hush of the observation chamber") and closure (paragraphs 18, 20: "ambered hush of the chamber," "ambered hush"). It recurs as atmospheric descriptor but does not shape a choice or constrain tactics—no beat turns on the presence or absence of this quality. The term remains ornamental tone-setting rather than a stake or method that alters options. Early seed with final reprise qualifies for lyric resonance, but without mid-scene pressure or cost connection the score remains low-functional.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Mildly obsessed is declared in paragraph 4 ("Kaelen was only mildly obsessed") with contrast to his predecessor's madness. It appears again in paragraph 19 as "mild obsession transforming into profound purpose." The trait is label-only; no on-page action is constrained or enabled by this specific degree of obsession—he maps continuously without a visible tradeoff between obsession and, say, rest, safety, or doubt. The shift to "profound purpose" is told, not dramatized through choice. Functional presence across setup and closure, but swappable with "determined" or "focused" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Retell appears in setup (paragraph 6: "he retold to the silence") as part of his ritual. Development: paragraph 6 again references the "ritual of summarizing silence" taught by his mentor. Closure: paragraph 16 says he is "summarizing not just silence but the spaces between silences." The action recurs and ties to his method, but no major turn traces causally to this specific act—removing "retell" and substituting "record" or "note" would not break the map's logic or the ending. Functional and thematically consistent, but mechanically replaceable, placing it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>By summarizing silence is seeded in setup (paragraph 6: "ritual of summarizing silence, a technique his mentor had taught him"). Development: paragraph 7 says his method is "unconventional: he listened to what the night withheld, then translated those gaps." Closure: paragraph 16 mentions "summarizing not just silence but the spaces between silences." The method is described and its mechanics matter thematically, but no beat shows him applying this technique in a way that narrows options or creates cost—he simply continues. Present across all three gates, but summary-only use without on-page pressure caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Storm-tossed ridge fort is named in setup (paragraph 3: "storm-tossed ridge fort creaked around him") and closure (paragraph 21: "fort's storm-tossed ridge stood silent"). The fort provides spatial anchor and weather pressure (wind, storm intensifies), and the embrasure gives him access to the sky. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Kaelen could map in any high, windowed location. The storm is noted but ignored (paragraph 9), undercutting its tactical relevance. Early and final presence with atmospheric function, but no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>When only one star remains appears in setup (paragraph 10: "When only one star remained") and drives the urgency across development (paragraphs 16, 18, 19, 20, 21: "only one star remained," "the final star pulsed weakly," "last star flickered," "star finally surrendered"). The timeframe tightens decisions—Kaelen's work accelerates "for soon there would be no celestial reference points left." Closure beat (paragraph 21) hinges on the star's surrender. The clock is live and tracked, shaping tactics and charging the final moment. Strong integration across all three gates with clear pressure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>To draw a map of an endless night is stated in setup (implicit in paragraphs 3–5: "mapping the endless night," "his obsession with mapping"). Development: paragraph 12 says "he was not charting physical space but… the architecture of silence itself." Closure: paragraph 22 says "his map of endless night nearly complete." The desire is present throughout and frames all activity, but it is never dramatized as conflicted—no friction between mapping and, say, survival, doubt, or connection. The motivation drives action but without visible cost or competing want, limiting the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Marbled hush appears in setup (paragraph 9: "marbled hush within him") and is echoed by "ambered hush" across multiple beats. The tone is consistently contemplative and atmospheric, with elevated diction and slow pacing. However, the tone does not modulate meaningfully with pressure—paragraph 19's "renewed urgency" is declared but the prose rhythm and register remain static. The final image sustains the hushed, poetic quality without a cadence shift or intensification that would charge it. Coherent and consistent, but single-mood without the dynamic range to reach higher bands.</comment>
