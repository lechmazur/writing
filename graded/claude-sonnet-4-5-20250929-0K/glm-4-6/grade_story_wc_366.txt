<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Jonah's reticence is established but his interior world consists largely of observation without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "warmly observant nature" trait remains label-only; we're told he notices details but never see a moment where this trait constrains a choice or creates friction. The final action—placing sea glass and stacking stones—feels like symbolic gesture rather than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a path. His emotional progression from isolation to connection is asserted through summary reflection rather than dramatized through embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: recurring images (letters, sea glass, stone stacking) layer toward a final reconfiguration. The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration—Jonah's understanding shifts from solitary watchfulness to acknowledged connection—but the cost remains abstract ("weight of his reticence lifted ever so slightly") rather than a visible forfeiture or choice that narrows options on the page. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the dock scene. The escalation is atmospheric accumulation rather than a causal tightening, which fits the lens, but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the stone-stacking and sea glass placement read as thematic echo rather than a moment that makes a before/after legible with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse, lantern room, and sea-glass object are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (saltwater scent on letters, aquamarine fragments scattering). The haunted lantern room supplies atmospheric pressure and the setting guides Jonah's movement up the spiral stairs, but the environment doesn't constrain a key choice—he relights the lamp without obstacle and the "ghosts" remain decorative. The sea glass on the windowsill charges the final image with visual specificity, narrowly meeting the 9+ gate requirement that an object must charge the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—relighting the lamp to restore safety—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition; Jonah simply works to relight it and succeeds without dramatized cost or a trade-off that narrows options. The anonymous letters provide thematic texture but don't create on-page pressure that forces a difficult choice. The final stone-stacking is a gesture of acknowledgment rather than a decision under duress. No reversal or tightening choice appears; the piece drifts from observation to symbolic action without a moment where agency forecloses a live path with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of connection versus isolation emerges through recurring images (letters, sea glass, stone patterns) rather than direct statement, which is positive. However, the final paragraph edges into moralizing: "safety wasn't just about physical light; it was about knowing someone somewhere was watching, was caring" reads as thematic summary rather than resonant image. The "luminescent ache" motif is poetic but remains abstract; the piece gestures toward complexity (loneliness, yearning) without embodying it in a non-obvious moral calculus or a closure image that reweights prior material without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited to Jonah; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("luminescent ache," "mist-kissed waves") that is consistent but occasionally drifts into generic literary phrasing ("the quiet language of the sea"). Perceptual signature is present in Jonah's attention to small details (ink scent, sea glass texture) but the diction doesn't modulate under pressure—every sentence maintains the same stately rhythm regardless of urgency. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Brief purposeful compression in the final sequence ("I am here, too") works, but the overall texture reads as polished surface rather than a mind under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Significant paraphrase loops and template cadence across the piece: "The letters had been a lifeline, a way to protect…" followed immediately by "The letters had taught him that safety wasn't just…" (adjacent sentences restating theme). Stock metaphors pervade peak beats: "the sea could never quite fulfill," "fragile light within," "luminescent ache." Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to hum," "felt heavier," "seemed less menacing") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. Register drifts into elevated diction ("desolation of the open sea," "testament to the luminescent ache") that clashes with the working skipper's presumed lexicon. Apply −1.2 for combined artifacts (loops, stock metaphor strings, filter stacks) per patterned-artifact penalty pack; disallow 9+ globally per the rule that artifacts in the final third trigger caps.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—lighthouse keeper receives anonymous letters, discovers silent companionship through symbolic gestures—follows a familiar template of solitary figure finding connection through mysterious correspondence. The "haunted lantern room" and "ghosts of the sea" tropes are invoked but not transformed; the supernatural possibility is raised then left decorative. Jonah's arc from reticence to openness proceeds without a non-obvious moral calculus or specific lived detail that would distinguish this from numerous lighthouse-solitude stories. The stone-stacking and sea glass motifs are purposeful but not fresh enough to overcome the template structure; the emotional territory (loneliness, yearning, quiet understanding) is explored through generic abstraction rather than irreplaceable particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Jonah is present throughout and his observation drives the accumulation of details, but his reticence functions more as a trait label than a constraint that creates key turns. He notices, climbs, relights the lamp, and leaves tokens—all actions consistent with his role but none requiring a decision that narrows options or imposes visible cost. His choice to stack stones and place sea glass is symbolic acknowledgment rather than a turn that redefines stakes. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but his agency remains passive observation throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in three distinct beats: found in the crate (tactile comfort), grows warm during lamp-relighting (mysterious charge), placed on windowsill (closure offering). Its changing state (cool → warm) and final placement charge the ending image with visual specificity. However, the sea glass doesn't constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it remains a symbolic object whose meaning is asserted ("carried the weight of those words") rather than demonstrated through causal pressure. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement, but lacks irreplaceability—any talismanic object could serve the same function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Anonymous letters shape the premise and provide backstory motivation (why Jonah returns, why he leaves tokens), and the final stone-stacking gesture closes the loop of silent correspondence. The letters constrain Jonah's worldview and enable his interpretive framework ("the letter writer was here"), but they don't create on-page tactical pressure or force a difficult choice. The chain is referenced throughout (setup, development via reflection, closure via symbolic reply) but remains thematic backdrop rather than a source of escalating stakes. Functional across all three gates but swappable with any mysterious ongoing correspondence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "warmly observant" attribute is stated early ("Jonah's warmly observant nature, a trait he masked behind his reticence, allowed him to notice the subtle details") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. We're told he notices ink scent, penmanship, timing of letters, but these observations don't force a trade-off or alter his tactics. The trait functions as character decoration rather than a pressure point; removing it would require only minor label edits without affecting any beat's outcome. Label-only mention without visible consequence caps score in the low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Protect" appears in two forms: relighting the lamp to protect sailors (physical safety) and protecting "the fragile solace" through letter exchange (emotional safety). The lamp-relighting is the story's central action but proceeds without obstacle or cost; the emotional protection is summarized in reflection ("a way to protect his own heart from the desolation"). The action shapes the middle beat (climbing stairs, working to relight) and connects to closure (lamp burns, he sails away reassured), but it's easily swappable with "restore," "maintain," or "preserve" without structural impact. Functional role across gates but lacks specificity that would make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stone-stacking is introduced via reflection mid-story ("a way of stacking stones as messages outside the tower"), used once on-page ("he stacked three stones in a triangular pattern"), and explicitly framed as closure communication ("I am here, too"). The method enables the final beat's meaning—Jonah's reply in the silent correspondence—but its mechanics are told rather than dramatized, and the reader never sees how the pattern "only the sender would understand" creates constraint or risk. Present in setup (via summary), development (as method), and closure (performed on-page), but the single on-page use and lack of tactical pressure keep it in mid-band despite closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is described with atmospheric detail ("walls echoing with the whispers of keepers past," "air grew heavy with an unspoken sorrow") and Jonah climbs the spiral stairs as the central spatial move. However, the haunting remains decorative—ghosts are mentioned but don't constrain Jonah's actions or supply resources that affect outcome. The room provides location for the lamp-relighting but any elevated workspace would serve the same function. Setup and middle involvement present, but no closure pressure; the "ghosts were finally leaning in" is asserted atmosphere rather than a factor that alters the final choice or image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story begins explicitly "after the lamp had flickered out" and the immediate task is to relight it, establishing a clear temporal frame and urgency. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions or create tactical pressure—Jonah climbs, works, succeeds without time constraint or consequence for delay. The "tonight" framing provides setup, the relighting action occurs in the middle, and the lamp's restored glow persists through closure, meeting all three gates. But the clock never alters moves or forces trade-offs; elapsed time is untracked and sailors at risk remain abstract. Functional presence across beats but lacks the live pressure that would elevate score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To bottle the feeling of safety" is stated explicitly mid-story and connects to both the lamp (physical beacon) and the letter exchange (emotional anchor). The motivation is told through reflection ("not just for the sailors at sea, but for himself") rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. We don't see Jonah struggle between competing wants or face friction between this desire and its cost; he simply enacts symbolic gestures (relighting, placing sea glass, stacking stones) that affirm the feeling. Present in setup (emerging motivation), development (reflection), and closure (achieved through symbolic acts), but the lack of on-page conflict or trade-off keeps it in low-functional band despite thematic centrality.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "luminescent ache" phrase recurs ("lantern room seemed to hum with a luminescent ache," "testament to the luminescent ache that bound them all") and the tone remains consistently melancholic-yet-hopeful throughout, modulating from uncertainty (dark lamp, heavy air) to fragile resolution (light spilling, "night didn't feel empty"). The tone charges the final image—aquamarine fragments across walls, promise of connection—with coherent atmospheric weight. However, the phrase itself is abstract poeticism rather than a concrete tonal signature; the ache is asserted rather than embodied in syntactic rhythm or perceptual texture. Strong lyric reprise (early → final) that reweights the stake with undeniable pressure, reaching the upper edge of mid-band per the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>
