<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—preservation and reawakening—but his internal life remains generic. The progression from copyist to conductor lacks contradictory impulses; he simply succeeds at each step without meaningful hesitation or cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is thin: "heart pounded" and closing eyes are the sole physical markers in a story dense with abstraction. The final smile and completed work read as unearned satisfaction rather than a choice weighted by genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late: who Elias is and where he works emerge gradually across the opening third, though the alcove and radio are signaled early. The story follows an accumulative lens—lyric fragments coalesce into instruction, dust responds to song—and closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the hall transforms from tomb to library, Elias shifts from copyist to composer). Cost is implied in the broadcast's disappearance and the crystal's dimming, but the final image offers renewal without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. One meaningful deepening occurs when the crystal hum becomes instruction, but the causal chain relies on convenient magic rather than constrained choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ember alcove and mist are vivid and recurring, grounding the piece in a specific micro-setting. Sensory details—dust like velvet, dial glow, humming crystal—are purposeful and filtered through Elias's preservationist focus. The alcove's embers and the orchestra pit function as spatial anchors that shift meaning at closure, charging the final image. However, the "story famine" timeframe remains abstract backdrop rather than world logic that constrains action, and the broader city is featureless.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reawakening stories after the famine—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure accumulates through the broadcast's elusive signal, the lyric instruction, and the crystal's discovery, leading to the dust animation sequence. However, escalation lacks agency-driven reversals: each step succeeds without credible resistance or trade-off. The climax (singing to animate dust) unfolds as wish-fulfillment; no live option is foreclosed, and the resolution (renewed magic, world reawakened) arrives without visible cost or complication. One tightening occurs when the lyrics coalesce into a map, but it does not narrow options or raise stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—stories as living memory, preservation as renewal—emerges organically from the dust-as-archive conceit and the pirate broadcast as resistance. The crystal and dust motifs recur with shifting meaning, and the final image (hall as library, Elias as conductor) offers a resonant answer to the famine without overt moralizing. However, the closing lines veer toward thematic summary ("The world began to remember") rather than trusting the image. "Thistled calm" as tonal frame is mentioned once at the very end, too late to charge prior material. The piece avoids platitudes but lacks the ambiguity or counterweight to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and clear, with access confined to Elias throughout. Diction is elevated and lyric-inflected ("cloak of forgotten time," "thistled calm") but remains consistent in register. Perceptual signature is thin: Elias notices archives and music but his way of seeing is generic preservationist rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears; no second voice to test idiom. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he realized") and abstraction ("renewed magic," "luminous quiet") dilute immediacy in peak beats. Psychic distance holds steady but lacks modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally maintained, but the prose carries significant line-level debt. Template cadence and paraphrase loops proliferate: "The broadcast's singer never spoke, only sang" / "The broadcast's voice was gone, but the dust remained aglow"; "Elias smiled, his work complete" / "His diligence had paid off"; multiple sentences open with "The broadcast" or "Elias [verb]." Stock metaphors ("mist curled around him like a cloak," "dust like velvet") and abstraction ("renewed magic," "luminous quiet," "thistled calm") flatten the closure beats. Information density is uneven: the middle third moves briskly, but the final quarter recycles the same image (dust glowing, stories whispering) across four paragraphs without new pressure. Filter-verb stacks in the climax ("He'd been," "he realized," "he began to hum") dull immediacy. No single artifact alone disqualifies higher scores, but the accumulation—particularly in the final third—crosses the −0.8 threshold and triggers the artifact cap that disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—dust animated by song to break a story famine—offers a fresh synthesis of archive-as-memory and music-as-magic. The pirate broadcast framing and the crystal-as-catalyst add specificity. However, execution relies on familiar beats: a lone preserver discovers a hidden object that unlocks latent power, then succeeds without complication. The "teaching dust to tell stories" motivation and the hall-as-tomb-to-library transformation echo genre templates (post-apocalyptic keeper, magical reawakening) without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. Elias's arc is linear wish-fulfillment rather than a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is present in the lyric register and mosaic pacing, but the safety of unearned success and ornamental magic undercuts boldness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias the copyist is present throughout and his actions (listening, transcribing, singing) drive each beat. Setup is immediate; development includes the lyric-instruction turn and the crystal discovery; closure shows him writing new lyrics and conducting the dust chorus. However, his choices lack cost or constraint: each decision succeeds without trade-off, and his occupation as copyist does not impose a visible friction (e.g., perfectionism vs. improvisation). The character shapes the plot but does not face a decision that narrows options or alters tactics under pressure. Gates: all three present. Positives: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9. Frictions: swappability (curator, librarian, archivist would function identically) −0.6, no visible cost −0.5, ornamental occupation (copyist skill never tested) −0.4. Band guidance and limiter: strong presence but replaceable role caps mid-6s; lack of cost-driven choice prevents ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The shortwave radio and its dial glow appear in the opening third, recur when the glow pulses brighter to deliver the lyric instruction, and are present at closure ("dial glow gone, but its purpose fulfilled"). Setup, development, and closure gates are met. The dial glow's brightness shift signals the instruction beat, a causal turn. However, the radio itself is passive: Elias listens but does not tune, repair, or otherwise manipulate it; the object acts on him rather than being used under pressure. The closure mention is summary rather than a charged image. Positives: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal trigger +0.8, closure mention +0.4. Frictions: passive use (no on-page handling beyond listening) −0.7, closure summary rather than charged reprise −0.5. Band guidance: two-gate minimum met, causal role in one key turn and closure mention allow mid-6s, but lack of tactile use and swappability (any signal device) cap below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast is introduced early, recurs as the source of the elusive lyrics and the instruction beat, and is named at closure as having found "its final chorus." Setup, development, and closure gates are met. The concept shapes Elias's goal (follow the broadcast's guidance) and provides the lyric instruction that leads to the crystal. However, the broadcast's mechanics remain abstract—how it defies the famine, why it teaches Elias, what cost it pays—and it functions as convenient oracle rather than a pressure that constrains tactics. The concept is thematic backdrop more than a stake Elias must navigate with trade-offs. Positives: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal trigger (instruction) +0.7, closure mention +0.5. Frictions: abstract mechanics (no on-page resistance or cost) −0.7, oracle convenience (no friction or failure) −0.6. Band guidance: concept present across arc but does not impose constraint or friction; mid-5s fit for thematic presence without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" is mentioned twice: the dial glow is "secretly luminous" in the alcove, and the crystal is "luminous" when discovered. The trait describes rather than constrains; luminosity does not enable or block an action, and no cost is tied to secrecy. Setup gate is met (mentioned early), but development and closure gates are absent—the attribute does not shape a middle choice and is not reweighted at the ending. The trait is label-only and swappable (glowing, radiant, bright). Positives: early mention +0.3. Frictions: ornamental (no action pressure) −0.8, swappability −0.6, missing middle and closure gates cap at 2.8 per gate rules; ornamental use alone would cap at 4.6, but missing closure gate is the binding limiter. Final: 2.8 + early mention credit nets mid-3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Cloak" appears once as simile ("mist curled around him like a cloak") in the opening third. It does not recur, is not handled or used, and plays no role in any turn or the closure. Setup gate is weakly met (simile mention), but development and closure gates are absent. The image is stock metaphor, easily replaceable, and ornamental. Positives: early mention (simile) +0.2. Frictions: ornamental (no action) −0.9, swappability (shroud, veil, etc.) −0.7, missing development and closure gates cap at 2.8 per gate rules. The ornamental use and one-time simile place it in the low band even with early presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Via elusive song lyrics" is signaled early (broadcast's method), recurs when Elias transcribes shifting lyrics, becomes the instruction ("Find the ember where mist meets memory"), and is etched into his mind for the climactic singing. Setup, development, and closure gates are all met. The method shapes multiple beats: listening, transcribing, the instruction turn, and the final song that animates the dust. However, the mechanics remain vague—why lyrics are elusive, how they shift, what cost their elusiveness imposes—and Elias succeeds without friction (the lyrics "coalesce" conveniently when needed). Positives: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (instruction changes tactics) +0.9, closure participation (he sings the lyrics) +1.0. Frictions: vague mechanics (no friction or failure from elusiveness) −0.7, convenient resolution (no cost to mastery) −0.6, swappability (cryptic instructions, riddles) −0.5. Band guidance: strong presence and causal role allow mid-to-high 6s, but lack of cost and vague mechanics prevent ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove in mist is introduced early as Elias's retreat, recurs as the site of the radio and the crystal discovery, and is named in the lyric instruction ("Find the ember where mist meets memory"). Setup, development, and closure gates are met. The alcove functions as micro-setting that constrains access (tucked-away space) and supplies the key resource (the crystal hidden there). The embers "burned brighter, fueled by the renewed magic" at closure, charging the final image. The mist outside thins as a consequence, linking setting to stakes. Positives: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (hidden crystal location) +0.9, closure charge (embers brighten, mist thins) +1.2, specificity (ember + mist combination) +0.5. Frictions: none significant; the setting does real work. Band guidance: strong causal role, closure linkage, and specificity place it solidly in the 7+ range. No cost directly tied to the setting itself (e.g., embers fading as trade-off) prevents 8+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the story famine" is mentioned in the opening line and recurs thematically (the famine "choked the world's imagination," "broken" by the end). Setup gate is met. However, the timeframe does not impose a visible constraint or deadline on Elias's actions; "decades" of silence is backdrop, and the present-tense sequence has no ticking clock. Development and closure gates are weak: the famine is named at closure ("The story famine had broken") but as thematic summary rather than a reweighted temporal pressure. The timeframe is swappable (post-war, post-plague) and does not shape tactics. Positives: early signal +0.5, closure mention +0.3. Frictions: abstract (no on-page time pressure) −0.8, swappability −0.6, missing development gate (no middle tightening) cap at 3.4 per gate rules, but the thematic closure mention lifts slightly within that constraint. Final: low 4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To teach dust to tell stories" is named early as Elias's motivation, recurs when the broadcast says "The dust remembers, but it needs a song," and is fulfilled at closure when the dust dances and whispers tales. Setup, development, and closure gates are met. The motivation drives his nightly radio listening, the crystal quest, and the climactic singing. However, the desire is never dramatized as conflicted—no competing pull, no cost to pursuing it, no moment where teaching the dust requires a sacrifice. The motivation is told and then enacted without friction. Positives: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal driver +0.8, closure fulfillment +0.8. Frictions: no on-page conflict or trade-off tied to the motivation −0.9, convenient wish-fulfillment (no failure or cost) −0.8. Band guidance: present across arc and linked to closure, but lack of dramatized friction caps mid-to-high 5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" appears once in the final paragraph ("not with a roar, but with a thistled calm, as gentle as dust motes in the sun"). It is introduced at closure only—setup and development gates are absent. The phrase is evocative but does not modulate with earlier pressure or charge prior beats; the story's tone throughout is lyric and gentle, making the final label redundant rather than reweighting. The neologism "thistled" (prickly + calm) is specific but arrives too late to integrate. Positives: specificity +0.4, closure mention +0.3. Frictions: late first appearance (final paragraph) −0.9, ornamental (does not modulate or reweight prior tone) −0.7, missing setup and development gates cap at 2.8 per gate rules; however, the lyric closure mention and specificity lift slightly within ornamental range. Final: mid-4s, acknowledging the evocative phrase but penalizing late arrival and lack of integration.</comment>
