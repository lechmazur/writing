<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's socially perceptive trait and whimsical nature are asserted but her choices under pressure remain reactive rather than internally conflicted—she "needed to discover meaning" is declared motivation, and the mandala work reads as therapeutic process without visible competing impulses or trade-offs dramatized on the page. The tile flake drives her action but her decision to "interject into the unlearning" feels like a granted insight rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. Interiority leans toward labeled states ("lilac and anxiety," "reverent curiosity") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under stress. The ending smile and purpose-finding read as resolution without renunciation or visible price paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story anchors who (Elara, chalk artist), where (whispering grotto), and when (during the unlearning) within the opening lines, satisfying the Orientation Test. A meaningful tightening occurs when Elara positions the tile flake at the mandala's center and the emergent hush responds, shifting from passive observation to active participation. However, the closure—Elara "understanding" and discovering meaning—lands as conceptual insight without visible, felt, or social cost on the page; the final smile and claim that "the unlearning had never been about forgetting" reweights the premise abstractly but the price (what she forfeited, what option closed) remains unclear. Under an Accumulative lens, the density increase through mandala work is present but the Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elara paid to achieve this reconnection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly established with sensory detail (misty air, damp environment, curved surfaces, ethereal rhythms) filtered through Elara's artistic perception, and the emergent hush alters the grotto's nature as a recurring constraint that shapes her actions. The tile flake's physical presence (sparkled sheen, warmth, vibration) functions as micro-setting, anchoring tactile interaction across multiple beats. The grotto's whispering-gallery acoustics inform her mandala's circular formations, and the environment directly charges the closure image when the hush "shifts around her like a living thing." The setting exceeds postcard description and supplies resources that affect outcome, meeting the 9+ quick test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover meaning in the mess"—is signaled early and Elara's agency (creating the mandala, positioning the tile flake) drives the tightening when the emergent hush responds. One meaningful escalation occurs: her realization that she must "not fight it but interject into its flow" changes tactics and the patterns reveal a method. However, the final act lacks visible trade-off or price; the whispers return and she smiles without forfeiting an option or paying a dramatized cost, reading as convenient empowerment rather than earned choice with stakes. The Cost Proof Test in Q4 is not met: no sentence shows what Elara sacrificed or risked to achieve reconnection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The central question—what is the unlearning and how can meaning persist—emerges organically from Elara's mandala work and the tile flake's energy, avoiding meta-commentary. The final insight ("the unlearning had never been about forgetting…making space to discover meaning in what remains") offers a thematic reweighting but arrives as articulated thesis rather than resonant image, crossing into mild Thematic Echo territory. The mandala's glowing light and "reconnection and rebirth" lean toward abstract symbolism rather than a non-literal answer grounded in particulars. Theme integrates with conflict but the closure statement edges toward philosophizing in place of scene pressure, triggering a modest penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single stable POV with Elara's perceptual signature evident in artistic filtering ("texture of lilac and anxiety," "hues...infused with lilac unease"). Diction remains largely consistent and voice-motivated, though occasional register drift into elevated abstraction ("emergent hush," "ethereal rhythms," "terrifyingly significant") pushes beyond a chalk artist's lived lexicon without clear character grounding. No dialogue present; internal texture conveys urgency through rhythm and sand-mandala focus. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose reflects Elara's whimsical yet socially perceptive nature through selective attention to patterns and sounds. Minor elevation at peak beats slightly dilutes immediacy but does not obscure focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs degrade momentum: "Her fingers…danced" / "Her fingers…began to work"; "The emergent hush…" repeated across adjacent paragraphs; "Her socially perceptive nature/mind" functions as synonym churn. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh specificity ("like ghosts," "like a living thing," "struck with the suddenness of lightning"). Some lines serve scaffold rather than advance pressure: "It wasn't magic, not exactly—it was something more fundamental" recaps without adding detail. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to breathe," "seemed to vibrate," "seemed muted") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. The artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("glowed with the light of reconnection and rebirth"), triggering the elevated penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—artist interjecting into collective forgetting via sand mandala and mystical tile—combines familiar visionary-artist and memory-erasure tropes without a sharp, non-obvious synthesis. "The unlearning" reads as abstract placeholder rather than lived-in social change with specific rules or consequences that complicate choice. The emotional arc (anxiety → purpose → understanding) follows a predictable template without genuine mistakes or blind spots that compound. The mandala as mystical interface and the final claim that forgetting creates space for new meaning lean on New Age convention without transformation through character-specific stakes or world logic. Swappability is high: substitute "weaver," "painter," or "singer" and the plot structure holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's identity as whimsical chalk artist frames expectation and her artistic hand pauses mid-stroke when she encounters the tile, but her choices after that moment (building the mandala, positioning the flake) could plausibly belong to any mystically inclined artisan. The "whimsical" trait colors tone but does not constrain a key turn with visible cost; her observation drives exposition more than decision-driven escalation. Present across all three gates but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tile flake is introduced early (setup), handled and repositioned in the mandala's center (development), and grows warmer at closure, enabling the whispers to return. It appears in at least three beats with evolving use, and the story signals its otherworldly sheen and energy as unique properties. However, removing it and substituting a generic mystical object (crystal, rune, shard) would require only minor edits; its specific "whispering gallery" nature is asserted but not causally distinct from any conduit. No visible cost is tied uniquely to this object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Emergent hush is named early, recurs as atmospheric constraint throughout, and Elara's realization that she must "interject into its flow" references the concept directly at the climax. It shapes her tactics (humming is muted, mandala channels are revealed) and the hush "shifts around her" at closure. Present in all three gates and integral to the ending image. However, "emergent hush" functions primarily as mood label; its mechanics (why it absorbs sound, how it differs from ordinary silence) remain abstract, limiting causal traction and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Socially perceptive trait is asserted twice ("her socially perceptive nature allowed her to notice subtleties," "Her socially perceptive mind registered") but both instances describe observation rather than enabling or constraining a choice with cost. The trait does not alter her tactics or create friction; it functions as character label without on-page tradeoff. No closure linkage and no beat involvement beyond exposition.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Interject" is mentioned once in the clarity-moment beat ("she must…interject into its flow") and again at closure ("began to interject into the unlearning itself"), framing the major turn. The action drives the mandala's convergence and the hush's response, and it redefines Elara's stance from passive observation to active participation. However, the verb is somewhat swappable (insert, merge, channel) and the cost of interjecting—what she risked or paid—is not shown on the page, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sand mandala is signaled early as "most precious tools," its creation occupies multiple beats with specific detail (spiral formations, violet to indigo hues, channels revealed), and it directly shapes the ending when positioned with the tile flake, the patterns "glowing" and enabling whispers. The method appears in all three gates and its mechanics (circular formations mirroring grotto architecture, convergence point) matter causally. Specificity is moderate; a ritual circle or drawing could substitute with modest edits, and no unique cost is tied to sand versus other media.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Whispering grotto in mist is anchored immediately, its curved surfaces and acoustics inform the mandala's circular design, and the emergent hush altering the grotto's echoes creates the pressure that drives Elara's search. The setting supplies both constraint (sound absorption) and resource (tile flake found on cavern floor), and the final image of whispers returning through the grotto's patterns charges closure. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure and specificity; the grotto's unique acoustic properties are irreplaceable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"During the unlearning" is named in the opening and recurs as context ("this strange era," "since the unlearning began," "the unlearning had taken so much"), but the timeframe imposes no live clock or deadline that alters Elara's moves. The unlearning functions as backdrop premise rather than tightening constraint; Elara works "hours unnoticed" without urgency or countdown. Present in setup and thematically at closure, but minimal development or tactical pressure tied to temporal progression.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to discover meaning in the mess" is declared early ("her motivation suddenly crystallizing") and drives the mandala work across multiple beats, culminating in the closure insight. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no friction between this desire and a competing cost (safety, rest, doubt) appears on the page. The motivation shapes the action sequence but lacks visible tradeoff or embodied struggle, keeping it functional but mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lilac unease is named twice ("texture of lilac and anxiety," "lilac unease that had defined her days") and modulates slightly as Elara gains purpose (final breath "tasted of lilac and courage"). Tone is coherent and surfaces in the ending, but "lilac" functions as decorative color label rather than a sensory or emotional quality that charges the final image with specificity. The shift from unease to courage is asserted rather than emergent from rhythm or cadence change, limiting integration.</comment>
