<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to cradle empathy in arms of steel") is evocative but remains abstract throughout; her contradiction as "gentle radical" is asserted more than dramatized through simultaneous competing impulses in scene. The retrocognitive trap functions primarily as background texture rather than constraining on-page choices with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present ("tessera's jagged edges bit into her skin") but interiority leans toward poetic declaration ("aberrant mercy") rather than concrete character-particular thought under pressure. The renaming action at closure feels more like ritual execution than a choice that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: tessera placement, renaming gestures, and the final whisper build density toward a closure image of restoration. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elara's endurance and ritual work reconfigure the plaza from graveyard to "garden waiting for its first bloom"—but the cost remains largely asserted rather than concretely felt on the page. The phrase "The world listened" implies reweighting, yet no prior choice was visibly foreclosed or traded off to make that shift legible as a before/after with pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ancient plaza, shattered sky, skeletal walls, and defiant minaret anchor a vivid post-apocalyptic setting. The mosaic stepping stone and tessera constrain Elara's physical action (tracing, fitting, pressing) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("warm coldness," "tessera's jagged edges") and filtered through POV. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The micro-setting (mosaic, tessera, stone void) directly shapes the ritual action and closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming the plaza through renaming—is signaled early. Pressure is sustained through Elara's retrocognitive loop and the physical ritual, but escalation reads more as iterative accumulation (first stone, next stone, implicit continuation) than a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The tessera placement is a single meaningful gesture, sufficient for this length, yet the cost of her choice (what path is foreclosed?) remains implied rather than made visible on the page. Agency is present in her deliberate ritual work, but no live alternative is dramatized and rejected.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of restoration through renaming emerges from concrete action (tessera placement, whispering new names) rather than abstract statement. "Aberrant mercy" functions thematically but leans toward poetic assertion; the concept reweights the ending without stating a moral. The final image—"The world listened"—offers a resonant non-literal answer, though the conceptual cost (what is risked or given up to achieve this mercy?) remains oblique. The retrocognitive trap and "empathy in arms of steel" add thematic texture but are not dramatized through competing on-page choices that embody the contradiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyric register ("gentle radical," "warm coldness," "litany of hope"). Perceptual signature is poetic and elevated, filtering the ruined world through Elara's ritual focus. Diction remains consistently elevated ("defiant minaret," "witnesses to her act") but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("strange prayer," "aberrant mercy") that feels more authorial than character-particular under stress. No dialogue; internal voice is coherent. Psychic distance is consistent, though some lines ("That was the nature of her curse") read as external commentary rather than embodied thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor voice and image effectively ("ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" / "The world listened"). Minor paraphrase loop detected: "retrocognitively trapped" is introduced, then immediately restated as "looping back to the fire"; "aberrant mercy" appears twice in adjacent beats without added pressure (−0.3). Some phrases lean toward stock lyricism ("fire of her own making, one that did not destroy but restored") and elevated diction occasionally stalls momentum. Information density is moderate; several sentences do double duty (setting + interiority), but the middle section recycles renaming gestures without advancing causality. Clarity and propulsion are steady overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—post-apocalyptic restoration through renaming—offers a lyric angle on familiar ruin-and-recovery material. "Gentle radical" and "aberrant mercy" are evocative contradictions, but the core emotional arc (trauma survivor ritually healing a broken world) follows a recognizable template without sharp transformation. The retrocognitive trap and mosaic tessera add specificity, yet the narrative's iterative structure (place tessera, rename, move to next stone, repeat) does not yield a non-obvious turn or escalation. The synthesis is coherent and the final image is resonant, but the piece does not take bold structural or thematic risks that heighten stakes beyond its familiar frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character "gentle radical" is present as a label and descriptor but does not create a key on-page turn through a decision between competing impulses. The contradiction is asserted ("soft and unyielding") rather than dramatized in a moment where gentleness and radicalism pull Elara in opposing directions with visible cost. She moves through the ritual without facing a choice that tests this duality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The minaret mosaic tessera appears in multiple beats: held in her palm (opening), pressed into the stone void (middle), and its warmth "seeping into her skin" (closing). It enables the ritual action, carries scorched color as a token of loss, and charges the final image. The object's jagged edges ground her physically and its placement drives the central gesture. Removing it would break the story's closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named twice and shapes the thematic lens—seeing beauty in decay, offering hope where none is deserved—but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page choice with visible cost. It functions as a framing concept and is integrated into the ending's resonance, yet swapping it for "transformative compassion" would require only minor line edits without altering the ritual action or closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is introduced early and provides psychological texture (looping back to the fire, remembering flames). It explains her presence and motivation but does not constrain an on-page action with visible tradeoff. The trait is closer to backstory anchor than a live pressure; Elara does not struggle against the loop or make a choice because of it during the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The action "rename" drives the central ritual: Elara renames the Lion of Judgment as "the Watcher of Dawn," whispers another name at the close, and commits to renaming "every broken thing." The renaming redefines the plaza's meaning and underpins the closure image. Removing this action would collapse the narrative arc and thematic payoff. It appears in setup, middle gesture, and closure, with escalating scope ("next stone," "whole plaza").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method "via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone" is signaled early ("fingers tracing the chipped patterns"), used in the key middle beat (fitting the tessera into "the stone's largest chip"), and grounds the physical mechanics of the ritual. The patterns guide her work and supply the void that receives the tessera. The method shapes the attempt and is inseparable from the renaming action, though it does not itself escalate or complicate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" anchors all action, supplies the mosaic stepping stone and minaret as key resources, and transforms from graveyard to "garden waiting for its first bloom" by the ending. The setting's ruined state pressures Elara's motivation and the ritual work occurs within and upon it. The sky and plaza charge the final image and the space's transformation is the visible outcome of her labor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the great fire" is present in the opening and establishes the world's post-catastrophe state. It primes Elara's retrocognitive trap and the loss encoded in the tessera. However, it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the ritual unfolds without temporal pressure or urgency. The fire is historical context rather than an active constraint on present tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation "to cradle empathy in arms of steel" is named as her "strange prayer" and echoed in the closing line ("empathy wrapped in steel"). It frames her renaming work and the ending's testament. The phrasing is evocative and thematically integrated, yet the motivation is not visibly conflicted or tested on the page—no moment dramatizes a friction between empathy and steel, or a cost paid to hold both simultaneously.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone "warm coldness" is introduced as "a paradox that mirrored her own soul," repeated as "warm coldness enveloped her" mid-scene, and charged in the closing tessera moment ("the tessera's warmth seeping into her skin"). The oxymoron modulates with the ritual's progress from desolation to tentative hope and charges the final image with simultaneous comfort and loss. The tone is coherent and purposeful, though it operates more as atmospheric texture than a force that shapes choices.</comment>
