<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to collect emotional burdens is declared but never tested through on-page choice or contradiction. The calcification process unfolds as predetermined ritual rather than decision under pressure; no competing impulse or visible cost shapes her agency. Interiority remains abstract ("fractal-weaving senses," "dimensional angles") without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The transformation earns a static vessel state rather than alteration through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the first third and signals a clear stake: Elara's transformation to collect burdens. However, the closure unit—her becoming a permanent vessel after collecting 4,817 burdens—arrives without visible cost; the calcification is framed as fulfillment rather than sacrifice, and no prior option is foreclosed on the page. The causal lens weakens when "boundary-lessly trapped" shifts from metaphor to literal constraint without dramatized consequence. The ending recounts completion ("her work...never complete, only temporarily paused") but does not reweight prior material with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bronze grotto and starlight establish a vivid, purposeful micro-setting that constrains Elara's transformation (precise orientation, convergence point). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("metallic veins pulse like sleeping circuits") and filtered through her fractal perception. However, spatial choreography remains static; the lamp placement and body arrangement occur without tactile interaction or evolving environmental pressure. The grotto charges the closure image but does not alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transformation to collect burdens—is signaled early but unfolds without reversal, tightening, or trade-off. The calcification proceeds as scripted ritual; no live option is foreclosed, and the cost (permanent stasis) is told rather than felt. The burdens manifest as catalog (child's fear, old woman's loneliness, nation's guilt) without pressure on Elara's agency. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist choice narrow options or raise price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of burden and understanding emerges through the transformation conceit, and the final image ("absorbs and radiates understanding") gestures at resonance. However, the ending states the thematic premise ("work of a fractal weaver is never complete") rather than charging it through particulars. The burden catalog (threads, spheres, crystalline structures) feels decorative rather than inextricable from Elara's arc. No non-literal answer to the central question reweights prior material; the resolution is literal fulfillment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a consistent elevated register ("whalebone reverie," "shingled hush") that reads as purposeful stylization. Perceptual signature is present (fractal-weaving lens) but remains uniform under pressure rather than modulating with stress. Diction occasionally drifts into abstractness ("layered awareness," "dimensional structure") that flattens immediacy. No dialogue; voice texture is distinct but does not degrade or tighten through the transformation arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "boundary-lessly trapped," "whalebone reverie," and "shingled hush" recur without functional variation, creating decorative loops. Mixed metaphors ("whalebone reverie of the grotto") and elevated diction ("impossible geometries," "mathematical seasons") obscure rather than sharpen the transformation moment. Template cadence in the burden catalog (three parallel constructions) and paraphrase loops ("layered silence"/"layered awareness") dull propulsion. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the closure image, reducing density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The fractal-weaver premise and calcification method offer a non-obvious synthesis of mathematical craft and emotional burden. However, the transformation follows a predetermined arc without risk or surprise; removing "fractal weaver" and substituting another esoteric role would not alter the emotional logic. The burden catalog (fear as threads, loneliness as spheres) reads as ornamental illustration rather than specific insight. Tone and diction remain safely elevated throughout, avoiding bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as fractal weaver frames the premise, but her choices do not create turns. The transformation unfolds as ritual she executes rather than decides under pressure; no competing impulse or visible cost alters tactics. Present in closure (becomes vessel) but as outcome rather than agent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The kerosene lamp burner appears in three beats: initial setup (cast shadows), placement at fulcrum, and extinguishing at dawn. It marks transition but does not constrain choice or enable tactics under stress. The final mention ("no longer needed its light") reprises without reweighting prior material. Functional but replaceable with any light source.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" appears twice as atmospheric descriptor (layered silence, then layered awareness) but does not shape stakes or narrow options. The concept remains thematic ornament rather than constraint or enabler. No on-page choice turns on this property of the grotto.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" is introduced early and reprised twice, framing Elara's state. However, it does not constrain action or create visible trade-off; she proceeds with her plan without friction from this condition. The trait remains label-level until the ending, where it becomes static descriptor rather than lived cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Calcification is signaled early ("must calcify her mortal form"), executed at the transformation beat, and completes the ending (stone-like surface). The process defines the story's central turn and shapes the closure image. However, it unfolds without resistance or on-page cost; removing calcification would require structural rewrite, but the emotional arc (willing transformation to permanence) could proceed via other methods.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is mentioned once at setup ("arranging her body according to impossible geometries") and implied at the transformation beat. The method is signaled but its mechanics remain abstract; no failed attempt or recalibration dramatizes how orientation matters. Present in one key beat but does not shape multiple tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is established early, supplies the transformation mechanism (starlight, central vein, convergence point), and anchors the closure image. Setting provides concrete constraints (fulcrum placement, starlight zenith) that enable the ritual. However, the space remains static; no environmental pressure alters Elara's choices mid-scene. Essential to transformation but not to conflict.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" frames the opening and reprises in the final paragraph ("until the next snowmelt"). The timeframe signals seasonal cycle but does not tighten decisions or create urgency within the transformation scene. Time remains atmospheric rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to collect burdens is stated early ("consumed her waking moments"), drives the transformation ritual, and culminates in the catalog (4,817 burdens collected). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice; no friction between want and cost appears on the page. Present across all three gates but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" appears twice (grotto's call, dawn return) as tonal anchor. The tone remains elevated and dreamlike throughout without modulation under pressure. Coherent but static; the final image does not charge or reweight the tone established at opening. Purposeful but not transformative.</comment>
