<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is stated rather than embodied through micro-choices under pressure. Interior life relies heavily on abstract labels ("unkindled solace," "blissfully aberrant nature") rather than concrete, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final merging of the chimera's halves is asserted as transformation without earned causality from prior struggle; the protagonist moves through set-pieces without visible costs that foreclose paths. Embodied emotion is absent—no physicalized fear, exhaustion, or doubt that would ground the fantastical premise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early but "chimera twin discoverer" remains abstract. The drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural but collapses into summary sequencing without causal pressure or pattern-taught compression. Closure lacks visible cost: the twin "feels whole" and finds peace, but no prior path is foreclosed on the page—what did they renounce or pay? The garden's appearance and the chimera's merge happen by assertion, not earned through protagonist agency or a resonant reconfiguration with felt stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The carnival ship setting supplies vivid images (carousel horses, fog, rusted railing, engine room) but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. No environmental feature narrows a choice or alters tactics; the emerald swatch card opens paths conveniently without resistance. The garden of forgotten names appears as wish-fulfillment rather than hard-won destination shaped by prior spatial or resource limits. Sensory detail is present but ornamental, not filtered through urgency or POV-specific priority.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (find the garden of forgotten names) is declared early but never tested by a visible tradeoff. The ship's fog "fights back" in one beat, but the twin tears free with a convenient "surge of strength" rather than through a costly tactical choice. No meaningful tightening occurs; obstacles dissolve on cue. The narrative threads are "recaptured" without showing what must be sacrificed or what option is foreclosed. Under any lens, escalation is absent and agency remains decorative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through repeated abstractions ("trapped freedom," "unkindled solace," "blissfully aberrant") rather than concrete particulars. The final paragraph explicitly states the moral: "freedom was not the absence of chains, but the courage to be broken and beautiful"—a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure. The garden's names and the chimera's merger function as symbols without dramatized cost or counter-reading. Subtext is absent; every meaning is declared rather than implied through image or gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and third-person limited, but the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature—diction and syntax do not reflect the protagonist's fractured, chimeric nature in word choice or rhythm. Figurative language ("dying stars," "fruit from ethereal trees") feels generic rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("saw," "felt," "knew") appear frequently without voice motivation. The prose does not degrade under stress or modulate with emotional peaks; it remains uniformly elevated and abstract throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "unkindled solace" appears six times with minimal reweighting, "narrative threads" and "trapped freedom" recur as labels without evolving function. Template cadence dominates the second half: "The twin [verb], [object]" structures repeat across a dozen sentences without pattern-taught purpose. Stock metaphors ("flickered like dying stars," "curled around") dull specificity. The final third carries heavy scaffold: "And in that moment, they understood" and "The story was theirs now" are thesis statements that stall momentum. Minimal artifact penalty (−0.8) applied in Q7 per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap; closure beat itself is not exempted but the summary mode extends through it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Core premise (fractured identity seeks wholeness in a liminal carnival space) follows a familiar template without fresh synthesis. The emerald swatch card, narrative threads, and garden of forgotten names function as prompt-fulfillment tokens rather than irreplaceable story logic. The ending's resolution—chimera becomes whole, solace replaces solace—offers surface closure without risk or non-obvious insight. No lived detail, moral calculus, or perspectival choice transforms the material beyond the assignment's checklist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The chimera twin discoverer is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. They board, observe, step forward, and recapture threads without visible tradeoff. The final merging is asserted rather than earned by prior decision. Label-only trait use and swappability (any seeker could fulfill this role) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The emerald swatch card appears in three beats (pressed to ticket booth, hovers in engine room, fades at end) but its mechanics remain vague—why does it pulse, how does it "recapture" threads? It enables progress without resistance or cost. Present across the arc but functionally decorative; no unique property constrains a choice. Early signal and spaced touches earn mid-band, but swappability and ornamental use prevent higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Unkindled solace" is mentioned six times as a label but never shapes an on-page choice or tactic. It functions as atmospheric dressing rather than a constraint or resource. The concept is claimed as the twin's guide in summary but does not narrow options or create visible cost. Ornamental and summary-only use with no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Blissfully aberrant" appears twice as a descriptor (the ship's nature, the twin's existence) but does not enable or constrain any action. No cost or tradeoff is tied to this trait on the page. Label-only mention without dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Recapture" appears in three beats (stated motivation, engine-room action, final thread) and frames the protagonist's goal. The engine-room scene shows the twin swiping the card through threads to "recapture the ship's fragmented story," which triggers the garden's appearance—a key turn. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown, and no visible cost attaches to the act. Present early, drives one major beat, shapes the ending, but swappability (any retrieval action could substitute) and summary treatment limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Through narrative threads" is mentioned in five beats (memories unfolding, hidden paths revealed, convergence in engine room, recapture, final alteration) and functions as the method by which the twin navigates and ultimately recaptures the ship's story. The threads are shown twice (ticket booth ripple, engine-room web) with some physicality, though mechanics remain vague. Present early and throughout, but the method does not constrain attempts or impose cost—it enables progress without friction. Functional involvement in two beats and closure linkage earn mid-band; lack of resistance and swappability prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival ship is anchored early (rusted railing, carousel horses, fog, ticket booth, engine room) and present throughout. Spatial progression (edge → interior → engine room) structures the sequence, and the ship dissolves at the climax—a clear payoff. However, no ship feature constrains a choice or alters tactics; the environment supplies atmosphere but not resource or obstacle. Present across all three gates with some causal involvement (dissolves when threads recaptured), but lack of tactical pressure limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"As memories alter" appears four times as a refrain marking transitions but does not function as a live clock that tightens decisions. The phrase signals passage without imposing urgency or cost; the twin moves at narrative convenience. Timeframe is present as motif but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Decorative recurrence without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To find the garden of forgotten names" is stated early as the twin's motivation, mentioned in three beats, and fulfilled at the ending when the garden appears and the twin plucks a name. The desire drives the sequence and shapes the closure image. However, no on-page friction tests this want—no moment where the twin must choose between the garden and another value. Present across setup, middle reference, and payoff; drives the arc but lacks dramatized conflict or cost, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Trapped freedom" is mentioned five times (stated early, applied to the ship's crew, claimed by the twin, released at the end) and frames the thematic concern. Tone is coherent but static; the oxymoron is asserted rather than modulated through pressure. The final line ("its trapped freedom finally released") offers closure participation but without tonal shift or charge—it repeats the phrase rather than reweighting it through image or action. Present throughout with closure linkage, but ornamental repetition and lack of tonal escalation prevent higher reach.</comment>
