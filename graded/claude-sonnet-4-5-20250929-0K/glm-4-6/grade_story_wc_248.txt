<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's arc from arsonist to restorer is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final match-burning reads as symbolic reversal without visible cost—she walks away at peace, undermining any genuine renunciation or trade-off. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive mind") and the mother's promise remains abstract motivation never tested by on-page friction. Emotional progression is linear summary rather than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive quickly (Elara, mountains, cartographer's shed) but causality is weakly motivated: she "finds" each fragment conveniently, paints it, then finds the next in a loop that reads as checklist rather than because/therefore linkage. The closure—burning the scroll to "free the promise"—lacks visible cost; she achieves peace without forfeiting a live option or facing genuine consequence. The inferred lens (Causal) demands tighter linkage; the piece delivers episodic accumulation without escalation that narrows her choices or changes her knowledge in a way that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The archive is vividly sketched ("dust and forgotten ink," wax-sealed scrolls) and the cave behind a waterfall provides spatial grounding. However, setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—none of the locations pressure her choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The body and tools (paints, linen) are mentioned but do not constrain a key choice or charge the closure image, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing the forgotten promise—is signaled early but never tightened by genuine opposition or trade-off. Each fragment discovery is convenient; no reversal forces Elara to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price that alters later tactics. The final burning is framed as absolution rather than sacrifice, and she walks away at peace, rendering the resolution feelgood rather than earned. One micro-turn (discovering the map beneath the defaced eyes) does not constitute escalation when no cost accrues.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of destruction versus restoration emerges from the arson/restorer contrast, but the final paragraph moralizes directly ("A lending library arsonist turned restorer, she had finally found peace") instead of letting the image resonate. The scroll-burning attempt at paradox (burning to free) lands as symbolic convenience rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars. Subtext is thin; most meaning is stated rather than dramatized through gesture or withheld choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Voice carries a consistent literary register ("volcanic tenderness of cooling lava," "analytically intuitive mind") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are inapplicable. POV remains stable third-limited, and filter verbs are managed acceptably. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices archives and tapestries but her way of seeing lacks idiosyncratic bias that would mark her as distinct from another aesthete protagonist.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean at the sentence level but suffers from paraphrase loops ("She had to portray her" / "she painted a mural" / "Again, she painted it") and template cadence in the fragment-discovery sequence. Stock metaphors ("volcanic tenderness," "eyes like storm clouds") recur without fresh vehicle logic. Information density is modest—many lines restate Elara's process rather than advancing pressure. The final paragraph stacks summary ("turned restorer," "found peace," "led her home") where a charged image would serve closure better.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—arsonist redeems herself by restoring lost civilization—follows a familiar redemption template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The trail of paintings and the final scroll-burning aim for symbolic weight but feel orchestrated rather than inevitable. Specificity (wax seals, tapestry fragments, waterfall cave) adds texture but does not synthesize into a fresh angle; the emotional arc (guilt → peace) is linear and predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara's arsonist past is introduced early (signal +0.5) and mentioned at closure (burning the scroll), but her choices in the present are passive discovery rather than active decisions that create key turns. The arson is backstory color, not a constraint or driver of on-page tactics. Late reprise without causal middle work and high swappability (any guilt-driven seeker) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears early (signal +0.5), drives the discovery beats (involvement +0.4), and recurs across multiple finds (beat count +0.9). However, it functions as a passive clue rather than an object whose handling constrains choice or whose properties change tactics. No visible cost is tied to it, and it could be swapped for scrolls or maps with minor edits (swappability −0.5). Closure linkage is weak; the final scroll, not the tapestry, anchors the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait appears as the final tapestry (late first appearance −0.6) and shapes the map discovery, but it does not constrain earlier choices or tactics. It echoes theme (self-erasure/restoration) more than driving stakes on the page (ornamental use −0.6). The concept is present in two beats (discovery + restoration painting) but lacks causal pressure or visible cost linkage, and it could be replaced by any defaced artifact holding hidden information.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is mentioned once as a label ("her analytically intuitive mind") without enabling or constraining any on-page action. No tradeoff or cost is dramatized; it reads as attribute decoration (ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.3). Swappable with "sharp" or "perceptive" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Portrayal (painting the murals) appears early (signal +0.5), drives three discovery beats (involvement +0.9), and recurs at closure (magnum opus painting). However, the act is methodical execution rather than a choice under pressure that redefines options. No visible cost accrues from the painting itself—she simply works for weeks. Causal pressure is modest; the paintings lead her forward but do not narrow or risk anything. Closure linkage is present but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The trail of artistic creations is signaled early (signal +0.5) and used across multiple beats (involvement +0.9), but its mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized in a way that shapes tactics under pressure. She paints, finds the next clue, repeats—mechanics do not constrain or complicate her path (causal pressure minimal). Closure participation is weak; the trail delivers her to the scroll but does not charge the final image. Swappable with any puzzle-trail method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The archive is introduced early (signal +0.5) and provides the discovery beats (involvement +0.9). However, it functions as a container rather than a setting whose spatial or resource constraints alter tactics. The cave behind the waterfall adds a second location but similarly lacks pressure on her choices (ornamental −0.6). Closure occurs in the cave, offering weak linkage (+0.3), but the setting could be any hidden repository without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" anchors the timeframe early (signal +0.3) but the six-year gap and the weeks of work are told without tightening decisions or creating urgency. No clock pressures her tactics; time is vague and untracked (ornamental −0.8). The timeframe could be "recently" or "years ago" with no impact on causality or closure (swappability −0.6).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The forgotten promise to her mother is signaled early (signal +0.5) and drives the search across beats (involvement +0.9), but it remains abstract—never dramatized as a conflicting want versus cost. At closure, she rescues the scroll "not just for her mother, but for the world," diluting the personal stake (summary-only −0.5). The motivation could be replaced by personal curiosity or academic mission with minor edits (swappability −0.5). Friction between desire and price is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" is named in the opening and echoed once ("tender volcano of hope and rage"), but tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. The prose maintains a consistent literary-elegiac register throughout without tonal shift that reflects escalation or cost (static mood −0.7). The phrase reads as decorative metaphor rather than an embodied tonal stance that constrains or colors her choices (ornamental −0.6).</comment>
