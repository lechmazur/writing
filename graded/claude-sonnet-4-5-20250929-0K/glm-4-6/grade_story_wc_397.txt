<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arthur's motivation is clear and philosophically coherent—seeking the sound of endings rather than silence—but his interior life relies heavily on abstract formulations ("fold in patience," "cumulative texture of a thousand small surrenders") that label rather than embody contradiction under pressure. The parasol tip functions as an anchoring object, yet his engagement with it remains observational; no on-page micro-choice visibly alters his stance until the final realization, which arrives as epiphany rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The other volunteers are sketched but apply no relational pressure; Arthur remains a solitary observer whose change feels more conceptual than felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who (Arthur), where (drift-ice marina), and when (after waking changed, now in disaster aftermath) within the first third. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): Arthur sought the frequency of finality but discovers "the sound of what continues," reweighting his quest with the felt cost that he must now engage with endurance rather than escape. The woman's shanty provides the textural turn that shifts meaning. One minor causality slip: Arthur's decision to become a "euthanasia tourist" and then pivot to disaster relief lacks on-page motivation for the second move—told as fact rather than dramatized choice—creating a small gap in the causal chain before the marina arrival.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vivid and particular: buckled harbor, crushed boats, salt and melting bergs supply sensory specificity filtered through Arthur's philosophical lens. The parasol tip—delicate ivory stained dark—provides sharp tactile contrast to the rough wool coat and slushy mire, and its recurrence in his pocket constrains his attention across beats. The oil drum fire and the woman's position staring at the water where her husband's boat was anchor the final beat spatially. Environment shapes Arthur's observation and charges the closure image when he realizes endurance is the sound he sought, making the setting functional rather than merely decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Arthur's search for "the sound of approaching endings," signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through immersion in wreckage, handling the parasol tip, and observing the community's weariness until the shanty moment reweights his understanding. One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman sings—a beat that transforms his quest from seeking finality to recognizing endurance. The escalation is textural rather than causal; Arthur's agency is observational and reflective, not decision-driven, so the tightening relies on interpretive realization rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The cost is conceptual (his quest inverted) but the price to Arthur personally remains oblique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—the paradox that endings are marked by what continues rather than what stops—emerges from particulars: the parasol tip (a finite relic), the crushed boats, the shanty that survives shipwrecks. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "the sound of what continues" reweights Arthur's quest without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing the parasol tip, the woman's stare at the empty water) and the contrast between sterile Zurich clinic and messy communal grief. One weakness: "a fold in patience beginning to form within him, a deep crease of Understanding" edges toward abstract thesis-statement rather than letting the shanty moment alone carry the weight, though it stops short of outright sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Arthur as focalizer; no head-hopping. Voice carries a philosophical, slightly elevated register consistent with a former software architect seeking esoteric meaning: "endings cast a long, audible shadow, a frequency only a mind untethered from the present could detect." Perceptual signature is present—Arthur notices contrasts (sterile/messy, finite/collective)—and psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to observational stance. One diction slip: "windborne solace" appears in narration as a label rather than emerging from Arthur's perception, feeling imposed by prompt rather than organic. Dialogue (the shanty) is brief but effective, carrying subtext of resilience without over-explanation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is dense ("salt, sorrow, and the strange, clean scent of melting bergs"), but the piece carries moderate overwriting in figurative clusters: "gripped reality loosely…slipping through his fingers like sand," "world suddenly thinner…seams where reality was poorly stitched," "frequency only a mind untethered from the present could detect" all appear in the opening, stacking metaphors without clear pattern-teaching. Mid-passage phrases like "fold in patience," "cumulative texture of a thousand small surrenders," and "untethered him completely" elevate diction in ways that blur concrete action. Paraphrase loop: "He believed that endings cast a long, audible shadow" followed closely by "trying to discern the hum of collapse, the specific resonance" restates the quest without added pressure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but density of abstraction in peak beats (the realization moment) dulls immediacy slightly. Apply −0.8 for figurative density and paraphrase in non-closure beats, plus −0.3 for elevated register drift in the Understanding line.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The inversion—seeking the sound of endings but finding the sound of continuation—is conceptually fresh and the euthanasia-tourist-to-disaster-volunteer arc offers a non-obvious angle. The parasol tip as counterpoint (single finite life vs. collective endurance) is specific and purposeful. However, the "changed man seeks meaning through proximity to death/disaster" premise echoes a familiar template, and the philosophical register risks abstraction over lived detail in key beats. The woman's shanty moment feels earned in hindsight, but Arthur's passive observation throughout limits bold risk-taking; his transformation is more interpretive than agentive. Transformation test: the emotional arc could function with different disaster/object pairings with moderate edits, suggesting mid-band freshness rather than indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Arthur as euthanasia tourist is established early (setup ✓) and frames his quest, but the label does little causal work after the Zurich rejection; the disaster relief pivot supersedes it without on-page decision cost. The trait surfaces briefly in his motivation but does not constrain a choice or shape a turn. Present in one beat (Zurich mention) and thematically, but swappable with "grief-seeker" or similar. Missing middle development and closure participation; mentioned but not active.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The parasol tip appears in at least three beats: discovery in the mire (setup ✓), pressing it in his pocket as anchor (development ✓), and feeling it warmer/"not an end, but a question mark" at closure (payoff ✓). Its delicate, out-of-place quality contrasts with the rough landscape and its historical resonance (polite promenades vs. collective disaster) charges the theme. The object is handled on the page and its meaning shifts from finite relic to question mark. Strong lyric reprise, but causal pressure is indirect—it anchors Arthur's attention rather than enabling/constraining a tactical choice. Specificity and thematic linkage elevate it into the 6.5–7.0 range; irreplaceability is moderate (another small relic could serve similarly).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is named once explicitly mid-story and the concept of accumulated endurance permeates Arthur's realization at closure. Setup is implicit in his quest for endings; development occurs when he observes "a thousand small surrenders"; payoff lands when he grasps that continuation is the sound he sought. However, "fold in patience" functions more as thematic echo than mechanical stake—Arthur does not wrestle with his own patience on the page or make a choice constrained by it. The concept shapes interpretation but not tactics or a visible cost, keeping it in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is established in the opening and bookended at closure ("still gripped reality loosely, but now…less like sand and more like water"), fulfilling setup and payoff. The trait is labeled as causing him to seek esoteric meaning, but on the page it does not visibly enable or constrain an action with cost—Arthur's choices (volunteer, observe, press the parasol tip) would read the same without this specific framing. Label-only mention without middle development or on-page tradeoff. Late first-third introduction as abstract descriptor; no beat where the trait alters a tactic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Trawl" is signaled early ("began to trawl the world…through disaster relief volunteering") and frames his method, leading him to the marina (development ✓). The trawling action enables the setting and thus the encounters that shift his understanding (closure linkage ✓). However, once at the marina the verb recedes; the story does not return to the trawling decision or show multiple sites, so its mechanics remain summary. Functional across two beats (decision → marina arrival → realization), but swappable with "search" or "wander" without major structural loss. Mid-band for enabling the core situation but lacking moment-to-moment causal texture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is announced early (setup ✓), places Arthur in the marina sorting nets and salvaging items (development ✓), and the community's response to disaster directly shapes his final insight (payoff ✓). The method's mechanics—sorting tangled nets, working alongside other volunteers—appear on the page and pressure his observation. The shanty sung by a woman volunteer crystallizes the theme. Causal role is moderate: the method delivers the setting and encounters but is not irreplaceable (other proximity-to-grief scenarios could serve). Scores in the 6s for all-three-gate presence and clear contribution to closure, but swappability and lack of unique mechanics cap it below 7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is introduced early with vivid detail (buckled harbor, crushed boats, melting bergs; setup ✓), supplies the wreckage Arthur sorts and the parasol tip he finds (development ✓), and the oil drum fire and the woman's position at the water anchor the shanty moment that completes his arc (payoff ✓). The setting's particulars—slushy mire, rough conditions, communal labor—constrain Arthur's actions and the environment's scale (hundreds of boats, splintered community) charges the collective-endurance theme. Specificity is high; another disaster type would shift tone and thematic weight. Strong integration across all three gates and clear pressure on choices and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after waking up changed" is established in the opening (setup ✓) and frames Arthur's existential shift, but the story does not track time pressure or use elapsed duration to tighten decisions. The marina work spans "days" and "one afternoon" / "one evening" without a clock that alters tactics. The timeframe is present as backstory anchor but does not constrain a choice or participate in closure; it could be omitted or generalized without structural loss. Missing middle and closure gates; functional context but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To learn the sound of approaching endings" is Arthur's stated motivation from early on (setup ✓), drives his disaster relief work and observation throughout (development ✓), and the shanty moment inverts his understanding—discovering the sound is continuation, not cessation—at closure (payoff ✓). The motivation is told and restated rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; Arthur pursues it consistently without friction or visible cost until the realization. The desire shapes his choices (volunteer, observe, listen) and the final insight directly answers it, but the lack of on-page struggle or competing impulse keeps it from higher bands. All three gates met with clear thematic payoff, but told-only mode and no dramatized cost limiter apply.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" appears as narratorial label mid-story ("his strange form of windborne solace") without clear setup in Arthur's perception. Tone is contemplative and quietly elegiac—matching the theme of enduring grief—and modulates subtly from Arthur's initial terror ("terrifying") to the calmer observation at the marina to the final image of water cupped in hands. The tone charges the closure image by framing the shift from seeking silence to hearing continuation. However, "windborne" feels imposed rather than organic to Arthur's voice, and the solace is told rather than shown through sensory or emotional texture. Setup weak, development present through tonal consistency, payoff moderate. Lyric reprise path without strong mid-scene use; closure linkage lifts it into mid-5s.</comment>
