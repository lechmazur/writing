<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The pianist's motivation is stated rather than enacted through contradictory impulses. His "steely longing" and wish to "surprise fate" remain abstract labels; we never see him hesitate, doubt, or pay a visible emotional price for manipulating time. The final peace feels unearned because no prior struggle or renunciation forecloses a path with cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart pounding," "chest tight") without character-particular embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when emerge slowly across the first third without early anchoring (−0.4). The closure unit—clock repaired, pianist at peace—asserts a Resonant Reconfiguration but no visible cost appears on the page: what did he forfeit or foreclose to bend time? The mechanics (film reel, bioluminescence, tidal pull) are told rather than causally demonstrated, and the protagonist's agency is passive observation of gears turning. No meaningful tightening narrows options before the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tidal arbor and its bioluminescent flora provide vivid sensory anchors and the compasses constrain one action (alignment with the clock). However, the arbor functions mainly as postcard atmosphere; its "unseen forces" and tidal mechanics remain vague and do not pressure tactics in the climax. The station and fog-shrouded city set mood but spatial choreography inside the arbor is unclear. Micro-setting (the clock itself) does charge the final image, lifting the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rewinding time to fix the clock—is signaled early but never faces opposition or cost. The pianist encounters no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and pays no price; the arbor and film reel cooperate without resistance. The gears simply turn when he presses the clock, a coincidental resolution that undercuts agency. No reversal or tightening narrows options; pressure remains static from midpoint to end.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of time's flexibility and fate's malleability emerges through the clock metaphor, but the final image states rather than earns insight ("time would remember how to bend"). The broken-to-whole clock is symbolic convenience introduced late without prior particular grounding. The ending moralizes ("he had not bent fate… reminded it of its own flexibility") in place of dramatized resonance. Subtext is minimal; gesture and silence do not carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register ("wistful," "forgotten dreams," "horizon invited night") that fits the tone, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("unseen forces," "credibility of possibility"). Dialogue is absent. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is consistent but the voice lacks distinct texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is grammatically clean and reads smoothly, but scaffold and paraphrase loops appear throughout: "The pianist was a strategically creative man, and he had devised a method" immediately precedes the method's description; "The clock struck midnight—again—and everything stilled" is followed by "The pianist stepped back." Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching ("notes dissolving into haze," "day bled into night," "salt and forgotten dreams") but mixed metaphors are avoided. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate rather than advance (−0.6 for loops and density drift).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise—magical arbor above a train station where time can be manipulated—echoes familiar fantasy templates (hidden worlds, time manipulation, broken clocks as metaphor). The film-reel-as-map and bioluminescent projector add surface detail but do not transform the stock quest structure. The pianist's final peace and the clock's repair offer no non-obvious synthesis or risk. Emotional truth is undercut by the lack of genuine struggle or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Present throughout and makes one causal move (pressing the clock), but his choices are passive and untested. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure participation +0.7, but swappability (any character could press a clock) −0.6, summary-only interiority −0.4. Total neighborhood ~4.0, rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The clock appears in two beats (described broken, then repaired) and anchors the closure image. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, but its repair is coincidental (projector alignment causes it) rather than earned by the pianist's sacrifice, reducing causal pressure. Swappable with any broken mechanism −0.5. Total ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The compasses appear twice (spin erratically, then steady) but do not shape stakes or tactics; they merely illustrate the arbor's energy without constraining choice. Ornamental use −0.8, late middle appearance −0.3, no closure participation −1.0. Total ~2.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" is a label-only trait mentioned once without demonstration; the pianist's plan (threading film through a projector) is told rather than shown as creative problem-solving. No visible cost or trade-off tied to the trait. Label-only −0.7, no beat involvement beyond summary −0.5. Total ~2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Refuge" is abstract and appears only in one sentence ("He had found his refuge") without dramatized action. It does not create a turn or redefine options; the pianist's peace is asserted, not enacted. Late first appearance −0.6, summary-only −0.6, swappability (easily replaced with "solace" or "rest") −0.6. Total ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The film reel is introduced early (second paragraph), threaded through the projector in the climax, and its hidden map drives the central action across two beats. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (reveals clock design) +0.8, but the mechanics are told rather than shown and the reel resolves a problem (broken clock) it did not help create −0.8. Total ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tidal arbor frames the entire second half, provides the bioluminescence that powers the projector, and its "tidal pull" is stated to manipulate time. Early signal +0.6, three beats (climb, projection, finale) +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but the mechanics remain vague and do not pressure tactics in a visible way −0.6. Total ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The horizon/night timeframe is poetic but vague; no ticking clock tightens decisions. Mentioned in opening and closing lines, creating a lyric reprise +0.5, but time does not constrain tactics or alter choices. Ornamental −0.7, no middle development −1.0. Total ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Surprise fate with an unplanned encore" is stated explicitly but never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between desire and cost. Early signal +0.5, closure reference +0.4, but told-only with no on-page struggle −0.8, no visible cost or trade-off −0.6. Total ~3.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Steely longing" is coherent across the piece (wistful opening, determined climb, lighter heart at end) and modulates with the arc. Present throughout +0.8, modulation across beats +0.6, charges final image (peace after longing) +0.9, but the tone is stated in labels rather than embodied in syntax or rhythm under pressure −0.5. Total ~5.7.</comment>
