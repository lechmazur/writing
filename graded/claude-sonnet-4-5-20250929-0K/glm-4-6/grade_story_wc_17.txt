<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation ("to discover what walls dream about") is declared but never genuinely tested by competing desires or concrete cost. His interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("felt its silent reverberations in his bones," "sensitively perceptive to the point of ruin") rather than embodied contradiction. The woman's story is absorbed passively; no on-page choice forces him to renounce a live option or pay a visible price. The ending declares him "chosen" without dramatizing what he forfeits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—ivy-veiled passage, manor, fireplace, chamber accumulate without a stable anchor until well past 120 words; apply −0.4. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layered images and mood shifts), but closure lacks a decisive reweighting: Elian walks away feeling "chosen" and vowing to return, which defers consequence rather than landing it. The film negative's revelation (the woman was also a cartographer) arrives as summary exposition, not a turn that narrows options. Cost is asserted ("legacy's burden") but not made visible in a forfeited path or altered state.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, damp walls, and hearth are vivid and recur across beats. The film negative strip appears physically ("coiled like a snake," "slid… into his pocket"), and the ivy's final "lean in" charges the exit moment. However, the passage does not constrain a choice—Elian moves through it without spatial friction—and the manor's geography remains vague (unclear how diaries found "yesterday" relate to today's corridor). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, lifting the score into the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("discover what walls dream about") is signaled early but remains abstract. The only on-page reversal is the wall glimpse of the woman's face, which Elian passively receives rather than pursues through agency. No decision forecloses an option or incurs a trade-off; he pockets the negative, sees a vision, and walks away resolved to return. Pressure does not tighten—each beat accumulates mood without narrowing tactics or raising cost. The ending resets rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges (legacy as witness, walls as memory vessels) through concrete images: the film negative, half-burned diaries, the woman's trapped face. The final line ("legacy's burden was not weight—he was direction") veers into meta-commentary that states rather than enacts. The woman's fate is told in summary ("walls swallowing her joy until only despair remained") rather than tested against Elian's choices. Thematic echoes are present but lack tension; the piece does not complicate its premise or allow counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric ("ivy-veiled," "brittle leaves that clung to the stone like stubborn secrets"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction disconnected from Elian's immediacy ("sensitively perceptive to the point of ruin," "legacy's burden made visible"). No dialogue appears. The prose maintains psychic distance and tense; no head-hopping. However, peak beats rely on passive reception ("felt a shiver," "images flood his mind") rather than active perceptual signature under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops: "half-burned diaries… edges singed but ink miraculously legible" restates within two lines; "sensitively perceptive" appears twice in distinct phrasings without added pressure. Template stems recur ("he'd heard," "he'd found," "he realized") across adjacent sentences. Figurative language stacks at closure ("ivy rustling like distant applause," "fluttered in his mind's eye," "legacy's burden was not weight—he was direction") without coherent vehicle. Apply −1.0 for loops and stems, −0.4 for mixed metaphor density at closure: total −1.4, capping mid-4s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise (cartographer of echoes, walls that dream) offers a fresh frame, but execution leans on stock gothic atmosphere: ivy-veiled manor, half-burned diaries, ghostly woman in water. The woman's identical profession (also a cartographer) is convenient rather than transformed. The climate-shift frame is mentioned twice but does not alter world logic or stakes. The ending declares mercy and chosen-ness without a non-obvious synthesis or risk that complicates the initial concept.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and his profession frames the narrative, but his choices are passive: he walks, kneels, touches walls, and pockets the negative. No decision driven by his cartography alters tactics or forecloses an option. Setup and development gates met; payoff is thematic declaration rather than causal action. Cap 4.6 for passivity; subtract −0.8 for swappability (any investigator role fits), −0.7 for no cost tied to the profession: 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The film negative appears mid-story (chamber scene), is handled on-page ("knelt," "unraveled," "slid… into his pocket"), and returns in the final paragraph ("burned in his pocket"). Setup missed; development and payoff gates met. One distinct beat (discovery) +0.4; closure linkage weak (mentioned but not shaping the final image) +0.3; late first appearance −0.4; no causal pressure (does not narrow options) −0.5: base ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Legacy's burden is declared multiple times ("legacy's burden," "chains," final paragraph moralizing) but never constrains a choice or imposes on-page cost. Elian feels burdened, then "chosen," with no visible trade-off. Setup via woman's story; no middle development; payoff is thematic assertion. Two-gate allowance caps at ~6.0; subtract −0.8 for ornamental/label-only use, −0.6 for summary resolution, −0.4 for thematic echo in final paragraph: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is labeled twice and asserted ("felt its silent reverberations," "sensitively perceptive to the point of ruin") but never enables or constrains an action with cost. No on-page moment where heightened perception forces a trade-off or mistake. Setup and closure mention present; no middle development gate. Cap 4.6; subtract −0.6 for label-only, −0.6 for no cost: 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glimpse of the woman's face in the wall is the story's lone reversal, prompting Elian to reach out and receive her history. Setup (anticipation via diaries); development (the glimpse itself); payoff (understanding and resolve). One distinct beat +0.4; causal linkage modest (triggers interior flood, not a decision) +0.5; closure linkage indirect (memory informs resolve) +0.4; swappability moderate (could be voice, scent) −0.5: base ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Half-burned diaries are discovered "yesterday" (backstory) and reference the film negative and humming room. Setup clear; development via exposition ("he'd found references"); payoff indirect (diaries inform his search). One beat (past discovery recounted) +0.4; causal pressure weak (they guide but do not constrain) +0.3; early signal +0.5; summary-only −0.6: base ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage frames entry and exit, recurs visually, and the ivy "leans in" at closure. Setup and payoff gates met; no middle development (passage does not alter a choice). Lyric reprise present; causal pressure absent (Elian moves through without friction) −0.8; closure linkage atmospheric only +0.4; swappability high (any corridor) −0.6: base ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After the climate shifts" is mentioned twice as mood-setting context but does not tighten a decision, constrain resources, or alter world logic. Setup present; no development or payoff gates. One mention +0.2; ornamental use −0.8; no causal work −1.0; missing two gates (cap 2.8 per missing closure): 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation is declared early ("to discover what walls dream about") and frames his search, but it is never tested by a competing desire or obstacle that forces a choice. Setup and development (he pursues it) present; payoff is assertion ("wasn't madness—it was mercy"). One beat (ongoing) +0.4; no friction between wants −0.8; told-only resolution −0.6; thematic echo at end −0.3: base ~5.1.</comment>
