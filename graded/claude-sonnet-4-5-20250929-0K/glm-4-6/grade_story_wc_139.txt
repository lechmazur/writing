<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation—balancing her father's karmic debt—is concrete and drives her choices through the rescue. Internal contradiction appears when she handles the dangerous ink pot ("testing it on herself during a moment of despair that had nearly cost her everything") yet her present caution feels muted. The ending choice to give away the ink pot carries visible cost (surrendering her inheritance and tool) but arrives without embodied hesitation or competing impulse in the moment. Elena remains functional pressure but lacks distinct voice or micro-choices that would elevate the relationship as crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly: Maya in the prep room with the ink pot, helping Elena escape. The piece follows a causal lens (Maya's plan → guard manipulation → escape), and closure delivers a decisive change (Maya relinquishes the ink pot, forecloses her father's legacy tool). However, the cost at closure feels asserted rather than dramatized—Maya "presses the object back" without on-page hesitation, internal tug, or visible price beyond the gesture itself. The prior "moment of despair that had nearly cost her everything" is told in summary, weakening the ink pot's established danger and thus the stakes of giving it away.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room supplies concrete resources (refrigerated units hiding Elena, embalming equipment framing the space, UV light in Maya's sleeve) and the setting's "deathly vitality" charges the final image of redemption amid death work. Spatial choreography is clear (prep room → corridor → alley). The ink pot as micro-setting object constrains Maya's tactics (careful not to touch it, precise UV activation). The phrase "deathly vitality" recurs but remains more atmospheric than a constraint that alters a key choice, limiting the setting's causal grip on the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: get Elena out before her pursuers realize she's alive. One meaningful tightening occurs when the guard approaches and Maya must execute the ink-symbol trick within the ninety-second window. Agency is present (Maya's plan, her activation of the ink), and the escape succeeds on-page. The cost, however, is back-loaded to the ink pot handoff rather than embedded in the breach itself—no visible trade-off during the guard manipulation (no stamina drain, no risk of touching the ink, no narrow miss). The phrase "mathematics of fairness" is told as motive but never tested by competing pressures or a forced choice between goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of redemption via "redirected skill" and balancing scales emerges from Maya's choice to help without taking. The ink pot's journey from inherited deception tool to asylum aid offers a concrete thematic arc. The final exchange with Elena ("People who don't need incentive to do what's right" / Maya pressing it back) edges toward thematic statement rather than image-driven resonance. The phrase "mathematics of a fair trade" recurs but remains more label than dramatized moral calculus—no moment on the page where Maya visibly weighs unequal goods or accepts an unfair cost to preserve fairness, weakening the premise's thematic bite.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maya; distance is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("deathly vitality," "karmic account her father had overdrawn") that reads more authorial than character-particular under crisis pressure. Dialogue is functional and goal-driven ("You ready?" / "Now") but Elena's lines ("There are good people…") veer toward thematic spokesperson rather than embodied stress response. The phrase "her mouth tightened" is embodied, but much interiority is summary ("Maya's motivation was simple yet complex") rather than enacted perception. No head-hopping; filter verbs are light.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and moves efficiently; no major loops or scaffold. Two moments show slight template cadence: "Unlike him, she was honest, brutally so, which had made her childhood difficult and her adulthood even harder" and the exposition block opening paragraph stack similar "father/inheritance/legacy" restatements. Figurative language is controlled except "deathly vitality" appears three times without evolving meaning, and "liquefied rigid thinking" as metaphor for the ink's effect is told rather than shown in the guard's behavior (he simply becomes "vacant" with no micro-moment of thought-shift). Information density is generally high; no significant artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—con artist's honest child uses inherited trickery for asylum rescue—offers a fresh moral angle. The vintage ink pot with psychoactive properties adds specificity. However, the "liquefies rigid thinking" mechanism reads more like a prompt fulfill than an earned world rule (no prior hint, no cost or side effect explored on-page beyond Maya's vague past "despair"). The structure (prep room sanctuary, timed security loop, UV-activated symbols) is competent but follows familiar heist beats without a turn that grows from character flaw or thematic irony. The ending gesture—handing over the tool—is emotionally clear but narratively predictable, and the "mathematics" motif is never quantified or tested in a non-obvious choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maya (con artist's honest child) frames the story, makes the key tactical choices (plan the breach, apply the ink, hand over the pot), and her inherited skill vs. moral stance drives the thematic spine. Present in setup (inheritance), middle (executing the trick), and closure (renouncing the tool). Her honesty is told more than tested—no on-page moment where lying would solve a problem and she refuses, limiting the "honest" half of the element. The choice to give away the ink pot is a clear decision that alters her future options (no tool, no inheritance leverage), earning mid-7 range, but the lack of embodied internal conflict at that beat caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vintage ink pot appears in beat one (Maya clutches it), beat two (she dips a brush, paints symbols, activates with UV light), and beat three (she hands it to Elena at closure). Its psychoactive property enables the breach and its relinquishment carries visible cost (Maya surrenders her inheritance and rescue tool). The object's danger is established in summary ("testing it on herself…nearly cost her everything") but not dramatized on-page, and the UV-activation mechanic arrives without prior setup, weakening irreplaceability slightly. Still, the ink pot drives two major beats and charges the final image, placing it solidly in the essential range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Political asylum (Elena as geneticist refugee fleeing execution) sets the dominant stake and shapes all tactics on the page: hiding in morgue, escaping before cremation, meeting contact for documents. The concept is present in setup (Elena's backstory), middle (the breach itself), and closure (Elena departs with asylum pathway secured). The asylum element is not merely thematic—it defines why Elena is in the morgue, why the timeline is urgent, and why the contact waits in the alley. Removing "asylum" would require a different core conflict. The element would score higher if the regime's specific threat or Elena's geneticist work constrained a mid-story choice, but it drives the main action throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" is the ink's stated property, signaled early and used in the middle beat (guard becomes "pliable," his vigilance dissolves for ninety seconds). The trait enables the breach and Maya describes the effect aloud. However, the mechanism is told rather than shown—we don't see the guard's thoughts shift or any specific moment of cognitive loosening, just a summary ("his expression shifting from vigilant to vacant"). The cost of using the ink (risk of self-exposure, precise timing) is gestured at but not tested on-page. The trait is functional but could be replaced with "makes people drowsy" or "creates hallucinations" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Breach" structures the middle act: Maya explains the breach method, executes it (ink symbols + UV light + guard manipulation), and she and Elena pass through the security door. The action is present in setup (Maya's explanation), middle (the execution), and closure (they exit to the alley, breach complete). The breach is causal—it enables the escape—and the method (waiting for the security loop reset, using the ink) is specific enough that a different action (e.g., disguise, bribe) would require rewriting core tactics. The breach itself carries no visible cost or complication (it succeeds as planned with no setback), capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Waiting actively" is named in Maya's dialogue ("We'll get out by waiting actively—being present but patient until the exact moment the security system resets its loop") and the piece describes weeks of study to find the timing. The method is present in setup (explained) and middle (the guard's patrol timing is tracked), but the "active" component is vague—Maya paints symbols and activates UV light, which reads more as tactical execution than patient waiting. The method shapes the plan but is not irreplaceable (a distraction or key-code hack would serve similarly). It does not return at closure with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is anchored early (cold steel table, embalming equipment, fluorescent lights, refrigerated units) and supplies key resources: Elena hides in the morgue units, the prep room grants access to corridors and security, the alley behind the crematorium is the exit point. The setting is present in setup, middle (corridors, viewing rooms), and closure (alley departure). Spatial choreography is clear. The "deathly vitality" phrase charges the atmosphere but the environment does not constrain a choice—Maya's plan works as described with no setting-imposed obstacle or trade-off. The setting is essential context but somewhat swappable (a lab, warehouse, or hospital could serve with similar edits).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To find the mathematics of a fair trade" is Maya's stated motivation, present in the opening exposition ("to balance the scales her father had tipped") and the closing exchange (she insists Elena keep the ink pot "when the mathematics of fairness requires a catalyst"). The motive explains why Maya helps without taking, but it is never dramatized as a friction—no moment where Maya is tempted to exploit, no competing desire, no cost she must accept to preserve fairness. The phrase recurs as a label rather than a lived tension. The handoff at closure aligns with the motive but arrives without internal conflict, limiting integration to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" is named three times ("the deathly vitality of the prep room where life and death coexisted in strange harmony," "the deathly vitality of the space somehow energizing Maya's determination") and the funeral home setting embodies the oxymoron (life-saving work in a death space). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (clinical in the prep room, urgent during the breach, quieter in the alley). However, the phrase itself is more decorative than pressure-shaping—it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with conceptual cost. The tone supports the theme but could be replaced with "morbid energy" or "clinical calm" without structural loss.</comment>
