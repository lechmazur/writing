<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's dual identity as crisis actor/survivor is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her mission to document small gestures remains abstract—we see her walk and trace dust, but these actions feel performed rather than emerging from embodied internal conflict. The "benevolently ruthless" label and "nomadic penumbra" are announced but never constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on therapeutic distance ("crisis survivor self," "actor in her") that flattens immediacy at peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with a walk-through reflection structure. Orientation anchors (National Archives rotunda, interregnum timeframe, Elara alone) arrive early. However, no meaningful pressure tightens: Elara enters with her documentary mission already formed and leaves having traced three words in dust without any dramatized cost or foreclosed path. The chessboard's missing pawns function as static metaphor rather than a pressure point that alters her stance. The ending recapitulates theme ("luminous absence") but offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or felt cost—she will continue this work, unchanged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery amplifies footsteps and breathing, creating sensory texture that supports the reflective tone. The chessboard without pawns is handled (she kneels, traces empty squares) and charges the final metaphor of "luminous absence." Spatial choreography is clear throughout the single location. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or shift tactics—it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a force that pressures Elara's documentary mission.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to document unrecorded gestures—is signaled early but never tested. Elara walks, traces words, remembers, and departs; no reversal or tightening narrows her options or raises cost. The interregnum is declared but imposes no clock or urgency. Her "unbinding" of trauma from performance is asserted in reflection, not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Without agency under pressure, escalation cannot occur.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of absence as revelation and the unrecorded as history emerges through the chessboard metaphor and dust-traced words. However, thematic statements dominate the final third ("the most powerful histories are written not in words, but in the spaces between them"), replacing scene pressure with thesis. The missing pawns as metaphor for forgotten stories is coherent but arrives fully interpreted rather than earned through Elara's dramatized experience. No ambiguity or counter-reading complicates the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and consistent but generic—phrases like "dandelion seeds on wind," "luminous void," and "carry it softly, making it sound like a prayer" could belong to any literary narrator rather than Elara's distinct perceptual signature. The prose abstracts her interiority into therapeutic labels ("crisis actor training," "nomadic penumbra actualizing") that reduce character-specific texture. Under the reflective pressure of remembering trauma, the voice maintains uniform lyricism without degradation or compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: the final paragraph restates the preceding material ("small gestures—the luminous absences that revealed more than presence ever could"), and multiple sentences across beats recycle the same content (e.g., lines about her dual identity as actor/survivor). Template cadence in the third paragraph ("the way a hand trembled…the slight hesitation…the tiny gestures") and the penultimate paragraph ("the way a lover's thumb…the slight smile…the deep breath") imposes mechanical rhythm. Stock metaphors ("dandelion seeds on wind," "toppled kings") and elevated diction ("benevolently ruthless," "luminous void") cluster without fresh specificity. Filter-verb stacks ("had once pretended," "had been paid," "had finally learned") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch multiple beats including the closure section, triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The crisis-actor-as-historian premise combines recognizable elements (dual identity, archive setting, interregnum) without a fresh synthesis. The chessboard missing pawns and dust-traced words are purposeful images but function as illustrative metaphor rather than driving non-obvious turns. The "nomadic penumbra" and "benevolently ruthless" labels read as prompt compliance rather than lived detail. Emotional honesty is undercut by therapeutic abstraction; the piece hedges toward the safety middle by declaring complexity without dramatizing contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Crisis actor/survivor dual identity is introduced in the opening and referenced throughout, but Elara makes no on-page choice shaped by this duality. The tension between performed and authentic identity is told rather than dramatized through a decision that alters tactics. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The chessboard without pawns appears in two beats: Elara approaches and kneels to trace empty squares. It functions as metaphor for forgotten stories and "luminous absence," reprised in the final paragraph. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—she observes and interprets but does not act differently because of it. The object shapes theme but not agency.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Nomadic penumbra" is labeled twice (paragraphs 1 and 5) as her state between performed and authentic identities, but it remains abstract. The concept does not shape an on-page stake or alter her tactics; it functions as thematic claim rather than a pressure that narrows options. Ornamental use with no causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is declared in paragraph 2 as her documentary mission's character, but no on-page action demonstrates the trade-off between benevolence and ruthlessness. The label does not constrain a choice or reveal cost. It remains a descriptor without visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears in paragraph 4 as Elara's purpose—to unbind trauma from performance and trapped stories from archives. However, the unbinding itself is not dramatized; she traces words and reflects, but no beat shows her actively releasing, confronting, or transforming something with cost. The action is announced but not executed on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Walking to spell words is signaled early (paragraph 1: "each step spelling words") and used in three beats: "survive" (paragraph 3), "remember" (paragraph 5), and "gesture" (paragraph 6). The method is purposeful and specific. However, it does not enable or constrain a choice—the spelled words function as thematic statement rather than altering her tactics or options. Present across beats but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The whispering gallery amplifies sound (footsteps, breathing) and is mentioned in four beats (paragraphs 1, 2, 4, 5). It creates atmospheric texture and charges Elara's final words with resonance ("making it sound like a prayer"). However, the gallery does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters her actions—it enriches tone but does not pressure tactics. Present early, reprised at closure, but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The interregnum is declared in paragraph 1 and referenced in paragraphs 2 and 5 as the pause "between governments" and "between narratives." It frames Elara's purpose (documenting the unofficial during official silence) but imposes no clock or urgency. No choice is tightened because the interregum is ending or beginning. The timeframe provides thematic context but does not alter tactics or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elara's desire to become the historian of small gestures is stated in paragraph 2 and sustained across multiple beats. However, the motivation is told and illustrated (she documents trembling hands, hesitations, gestures) rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. No on-page friction tests her commitment or forces her to choose between this mission and another need. Present and coherent but not under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" appears as a phrase in paragraphs 4 and 6, shaping the reflective, elegiac tone. The tone remains stable throughout—contemplative, elevated, mournful—and modulates only slightly in the final image to "prayer" register. It coheres across beats and charges the final metaphor, but the tone does not shift under pressure or reveal contradiction. Consistent mood that supports theme without dynamic range.</comment>
