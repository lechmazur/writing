<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is presented through consistent sensory detail (blindness, touch-based perception) and his work carries visible micro-choices. However, interiority remains thin—his calm is asserted repeatedly rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final satisfaction reads as generic label ("the calm in his chest deepening into satisfaction") rather than a character-specific emotional texture. No meaningful internal conflict complicates the repair work; competence is untroubled by genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive early (workshop, Elias, drone). The piece lacks a legible closure unit with cost: the drone is fixed, Elias smiles, and the ending recycles prior calm without a decisive change, renunciation, or repricing that forecloses a path. The ship's departure functions as ambient tempo marker rather than a tightening constraint that alters Elias' tactics. Under a presumed Accumulative lens, no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake at closure; the final image ("his artistry immortalized in the hum of a machine reborn") is thematic assertion rather than an on-page reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot, fountain, and workshop are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (water refraction, drip of fountain, rusted tracks). The fountain's refraction patterns guide one diagnostic choice mid-story. However, the environment does not constrain the final beat—Elias completes the repair without spatial or material friction. The ship's horn and depot clock mark time but do not alter access or pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the drone's guidance before the ship departs—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias discovers the backup flaw via refraction. Yet the ship's deadline imposes no visible cost or tactic change; Elias finishes calmly, the drone lifts off, and no trade-off or foreclosed path is legible on the page. The repair unfolds as a sequence of solved micro-problems without escalating pressure or a final choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Theme of restoration and seeing-with-hands emerges from concrete action (touch-based diagnostics, refraction method). The artificial hummingbird's return and "song of direction" offer a lyric reprise. However, the ending explicitly states the theme ("his artistry immortalized," "a man who saw with his hands") rather than letting the final image carry it. No counter-reading or moral ambiguity complicates the resolution; the piece concludes with affirmed competence and untroubled satisfaction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is anchored in Elias' tactile focus and auditory cues. Voice modulates with task phases (diagnostic, patching, testing) but emotional range is narrow—calm throughout. The single line of dialogue ("There") is functional but minimal. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("magnetic calm," "immortalized," "symphony of repaired things") that reads more authorial than character-bound. Filter verbs ("seemed to still," "felt") are present but do not obscure immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is maintained. However, template cadence recurs across multiple beats: "The drone's [X], [detail]" and "Elias [verb], [description]" structures proliferate. Paraphrase loops are visible: "The mist outside thickened, but inside, Elias' world was clear" echoes "The depot's mist coated the rails once more, but inside, there was only clarity." Stock metaphors ("his fingers dancing over," "a magnetic calm," "a symphony of repaired things") appear in high-density clusters without fresh specificity. The closure beat carries figurative language ("his artistry immortalized," "a map for the future") that abstracts rather than grounds the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The blind artisan repairing via refraction patterns offers a fresh synthesis. However, the plot structure (problem introduced → diagnosed → solved → affirmed) follows a template arc without complication or risk. The ship's maiden voyage and mist function as ambient atmosphere rather than integrated pressure. Emotional trajectory is linear and untroubled; no bold risk or unconventional perspectival choice heightens stakes. The ending's "immortalized" and "symphony" phrasing leans generic rather than particular to this voice and world.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (heartfelt artisan) is present throughout and makes micro-choices (reattaching wire, adjusting sensor, patching circuit). His decisions advance the repair sequence in at least three beats. However, choices do not create reversals or alter broader tactics—each fix is additive rather than reweighting prior material. The character shapes beats but not the arc's direction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The artificial hummingbird drone is handled across multiple beats (initial examination, wing patching, sensor adjustment, wire reattachment, test flight, final return). Its state evolves from broken to functional. The drone's return to the workbench at closure with "wings now whole" offers a charged reprise that confirms restoration. The object is causally active in the middle and present at the ending, meeting the three-gate model.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The repair shop (workshop) frames all action and supplies tools (fountain for refraction, workbench, synthetic thread). The setting shapes Elias' diagnostic method in one key beat (fountain refraction reveals the backup flaw). It is present at setup and closure but does not constrain final tactics—Elias completes the work without spatial or resource friction at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Oversees while blind" is established early via spectacles that bring no sight and touch-based perception. The attribute enables Elias' tactile and auditory methods but imposes no visible cost or tradeoff on the page. Blindness is presented as a compensated condition rather than a constraint that complicates a choice or the closure beat. The trait is functional but does not narrow options or raise stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Patch" is the dominant action: Elias patches wings with synthetic thread, patches a circuit board, and performs a "quick patch" to the guidance system. The action recurs across at least three beats and directly enables the drone's restored flight. Patching is causally necessary to the resolution. However, the specific act of patching does not create a reversal or cost; it is additive problem-solving rather than a choice that redefines options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Examining light refraction through water features is signaled early (fountain as diagnostic tool) and used in one key beat: "the water's refraction patterns shifted, revealing a flaw in the drone's guidance system—a backup Elias had overlooked." The method shapes one diagnostic turn. It is present at setup and used in development but does not appear at closure—Elias runs a final check via tactile tracing, not refraction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot is vividly rendered (mist, rusted tracks, rafters, fountain) and persists across the story. The depot supplies the fountain resource used in one diagnostic beat. However, the setting does not pressure the final choice—mist "lifts" and "coats the rails once more" as ambient texture rather than a constraint that alters Elias' moves at closure. Postcard atmosphere dominates over micro-setting friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The ship's anchor lifting for maiden voyage is mentioned in four beats (horn echoes, departure looms, horn blares again, horn fades). The timeframe is present but does not tighten Elias' decisions—he works "not with urgency, but with resolve," and finishes calmly before the ship fully departs. The deadline is declared but not dramatized as a constraint that alters tactics or imposes cost. Setup and closure participation are met, but development lacks pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To decode feedback into direction" is stated early as Elias' motivation and the drone's restored feedback becomes "a song of direction" at the end. The desire is present at setup and closure. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Elias pursues the goal without friction between competing impulses; the motivation frames the task but does not undergo transformation or repricing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Magnetic calm" is asserted repeatedly ("his voice a magnetic calm," "the calm in his chest," "his calm unwavering"). The tone is static rather than modulating under pressure—Elias remains calm throughout diagnosis, patching, and completion. No tonal shift reweights the final image; the ending recycles earlier calm ("Elias closed his eyes, the calm in his heart a mirror of the still water"). The tone is thematically present but does not charge the closure or reflect escalation.</comment>
