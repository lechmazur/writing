<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The balladeer's motivation—articulating unspoken needs—is established but remains abstract rather than embodied through conflicting impulses. Interior state relies heavily on stock mystical imagery ("driftingly alert," "suspended in that strange timeless moment") without character-particular contradiction. The ghost relationship is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending returns him to prior state with a smile, suggesting satisfaction rather than earned renunciation or change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: atmospheric details and the encoding process build density toward completion. Orientation anchors arrive late (~180 words before "courtyard above clouds" clarifies the where), triggering a −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (task completion and descent), but the cost is conceptual only—"another bridge between worlds strengthened"—without a visible price that forecloses options or alters tactics. The work is circular: he arrives to encode, encodes, departs satisfied, with no meaningful tightening or deepening of the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds and the flower press bolt plate offer vivid sensory anchors, but spatial choreography remains vague (how he accesses the wall, his physical perch). The storm timeframe pressures the work pace in the middle section. Late orientation (anchors unclear until ~180 words) triggers the Q2 penalty and caps this category at 7.0 per the Orientation Test. The bolt plate constrains the encoding method and charges the final beat when tucked away, meeting micro-setting standards, but the courtyard itself functions mostly as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—completing the ghost's message before the storm closes the window—is signaled and tightens once ("worked faster, his movements becoming almost frantic"). However, the escalation remains atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist choice; the storm intensifies externally, and he simply finishes on time. No reversal or trade-off; the resolution is smooth completion without visible cost. The ghost's approval and the balladeer's smile confirm success without forfeiture, trending toward satisfied closure rather than earned pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme of bridging digital and physical realms, and articulating unspoken needs, is declared multiple times ("to articulate unspoken needs," "another bridge between worlds strengthened") rather than emerging from action. The flower press bolt plate and graffiti method are vivid particulars, but the ending moralizes: "another unspoken need successfully articulated." The storm and courtyard remain symbolic conveniences without complicating the thematic question. No counter-reading or ambiguity; the piece closes with a thesis statement in the penultimate sentence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and atmospheric with controlled diction ("driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder"), maintaining a mystical register throughout. Psychic distance remains stable in third-person limited. However, the perceptual signature is generic mystical rather than character-particular; the balladeer's noticing does not reflect distinct bias. Compression and patterned phrasing (e.g., "the seldom-heard balladeer" recurs as a stock anchor) read as purposeful, though some constructions veer into elevated abstraction ("ephemeral workspace") that slightly tensions the otherwise grounded POV.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is solid, with varied sentence rhythm and vivid figurative language ("white sea of vapor," "spectral shadows"). However, heavy ornamental layering in early paragraphs—multiple metaphors per sentence without pattern-teaching—slows momentum: "symbols of forgotten languages and mathematical equations that seemed to shift" adds texture but not pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "articulate unspoken needs" recurs three times across the piece, including the final beat, dulling closure. Template stems recur: "The [noun] [verb]" anchors many sentences. Apply −0.6 for combined loop and density issues, and −0.3 for closure-beat repetition of "articulate," totaling −0.9 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—encoding messages for a digital ghost via graffiti art above clouds—is vivid but combines familiar tropes (artist-mystic, ghost communication, cryptic symbols) without transforming them through specific lived consequence. The balladeer's role as translator and the flower press bolt plate offer detail, but the emotional arc is generic satisfaction: he completes his task, descends content, with no risk or cost. The "tinkersong wonder" and "seldom-heard" labels gesture toward specificity without grounding it in choice. Transformation test: the arc works unchanged with a different artist, ghost, and method.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The balladeer is present throughout and his choices (dipping brush, working faster, tucking the bolt plate away) drive the encoding sequence. Setup clear in the opening. However, his decisions are procedural—execute the task—without a trade-off or turn that alters tactics. The ending returns him to prior state with a smile, suggesting no decisive change. Two-of-three gates (setup, development, closure presence) met, but causal pressure is low: the storm tightens externally, not via his choices. Swappable with another artist-mystic archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate appears in the opening paragraph (setup) and is handled twice: once as a guide during encoding and once when tucked away at closure. It constrains method (its markings align with constellations, it channels energy) and charges the ending when he stores it to prevent unintentional alignment. All three gates met (setup, middle use, closure). However, its "shifting symbols" and energy-channeling properties remain abstract; no visible cost tied to its use. Irreplaceability is mid: a similar mystical tool could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The ghost in code is introduced early (setup in paragraph two) and shapes the dominant stake: the balladeer encodes its transmission. It appears at closure as a "transparent figure of light and data points nodding in approval." All three gates met. However, the ghost's presence is told rather than dramatized; it does not constrain choices or create friction. The digital-ethereal split is declared but not tested on the page. Swappable with any mystical patron or unseen recipient.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" is introduced early and repeated three times, including at closure ("Driftingly alert even now"). Setup and closure gates met; middle development absent. The trait enables perception of patterns "invisible in ordinary consciousness," but this is told rather than shown through a specific tradeoff or mistake. No visible cost: the state grants advantage without friction. Swappable with "heightened awareness" or similar mystical-focus labels.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Encoding is the central action, signaled early and occupying the bulk of the middle section. It shapes the dominant stake (complete the message before the storm closes) and drives multiple beats: dipping the brush, forming symbols, working faster. Closure hinges on task completion. Three gates met with strong beat involvement. However, the action itself is procedural—executing a known method—without a turn or adaptation that redefines options. Swappable with "paint" or "inscribe" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Graffiti art is introduced in the setup ("through messages encoded in graffiti art") and executed across multiple beats in the middle, with the completed work appearing at closure. Three gates met. The method constrains execution (brushstrokes, color frequencies, visual math) and charges the final image when the mist will conceal it until morning. However, the mechanics remain abstract—"visual representation of mathematical concepts"—without a specific constraint that alters tactics. Swappable with "calligraphy" or "symbolic painting."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is introduced early (setup) and pressures the work via the storm's approach (development). Closure occurs as he descends, the mist concealing his work. Three gates met. The setting supplies a clock (storm window) and isolation, both affecting tactics. However, the courtyard's "above clouds" feature is scenic rather than causal; the work could occur in any secluded elevated space. Micro-setting (the wall he paints) is functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "between lightning and thunder" timeframe is introduced in the opening and mentioned again mid-story ("between the brief illuminations"). Setup and development gates met; closure absent—the ending shifts to "time to retreat" without returning to the lightning-thunder suspension. The frame supplies atmosphere and a rhythm (flashes reveal the work), but it does not tighten decisions with a live countdown. The storm's intensification serves as a soft clock. Swappable with "during the storm" with negligible impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The motivation to "articulate unspoken needs" is declared early (setup) and repeated at closure ("another unspoken need successfully articulated"). It drives the dominant stake (complete the ghost's message). Three gates met. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or a cost. The balladeer experiences "joy" and satisfaction without friction between want and price. The final beat restates the motivation as summary, not embodied choice. Swappable with "fulfill the ghost's request."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" appears once mid-story as a label for the balladeer's craft. Setup gate missed (not established early); development gate met (colors the emotional beat of the work); closure gate missed (the ending shifts to satisfaction and descent without returning to "wonder"). One gate met, capping at ~3.4, but the single mention does color a key beat, lifting slightly. The tone is told rather than embodied in rhythm or diction. Swappable with "creative joy" or "artistic flow."</comment>
