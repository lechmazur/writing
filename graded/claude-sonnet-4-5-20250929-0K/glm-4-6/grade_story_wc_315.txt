<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The seeker remains an abstraction—"attentively inventive" and "motivation pulsed beneath their ribs" are labels without contradiction or embodied choice. The leap at the end feels like demonstration rather than a decision earned by prior pressure; no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges. Interiority relies on therapy-speak ("preserve trust under pressure") and stock phrasing ("prayers, revisions of a life spent watching"). The parachute buckle relic is mentioned but never constrains a choice or reveals character under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after ~200 words of lyric description, applying the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The leap offers a physical act but no clear cost or option-foreclosure; the voice calling the seeker's name at the end feels like externally granted resolution rather than earned consequence. The piece accumulates texture but the closure unit (the leap and radio contact) does not reweight prior material with visible cost. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the final image does not charge prior motifs with new pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor, fog-sea canopy, and parachute harness are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (thin air, cold buckle, distant insect hum). However, setting remains largely atmospheric; the arbor does not constrain the leap or alter tactics. The parachute buckle appears repeatedly but functions as symbolic anchor rather than a tool that shapes choice. Spatial choreography is clear and the body is present, lifting the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"preserve trust under pressure"—is declared but never tested on the page. The seeker's leap is the only action, yet it does not narrow options or reveal a trade-off; the radio voice at the end arrives as gift rather than consequence. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs; the piece lingers in contemplation without pressure rising or tactics changing. Coincidence (the voice calling) supplies the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—trust, solitude, pattern-seeking—emerges from images and the seeker's ritual, avoiding overt statement until the final thought "trust...was not just preserved but earned, one leap at a time," which edges into summary. The parachute buckle relic and the arbor's spiral pattern recur but do not reweight meaning at closure; they remain symbolic tokens. The final image (seeker floating, revising stars) offers lyric resonance but no conceptual cost or non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("archipelago in a sea of fog," "soundless echoes") but consistent throughout, fitting the meditative mode. However, the prose leans toward abstraction ("watcher's burden," "prayers, revisions") and template cadence ("The seeker adjusted...," "The seeker stood...," "The seeker smiled...") flattens rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is present (tracing bark, feeling insect wings) but not character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative or elevated language ("archipelago in a sea of fog," "threads of what others missed," "vacuum of freefall," "ghosts," "pendulum of rhythm") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (−0.5). Template cadence runs ("The seeker adjusted...," "The seeker's mind...," "The seeker stood...," "The seeker smiled...") across multiple beats apply −0.5. Paraphrase loops appear ("patterns in constellations, whispers in static, logic in chaos" echoes "the patterns they sought" and "revising the stars into new constellations"). Information density is low—many lines restate the seeker's solitude and pattern-seeking without advancing situation. Cumulative artifact penalty in Q7: −1.2, and the final-third presence of these patterns disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—solitary watcher on a sky-tree—offers visual novelty but the emotional arc (lonely seeker finds connection) follows a familiar template. The parachute leap and radio voice do not transform the pattern; the leap feels like demonstration rather than a choice growing from prior constraint. Specific details (parachute buckle relic, spiral bark pattern, new moon sliver) are present but ornamental. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece chooses lyric safety over decisive synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The midnight pattern seeker is present throughout and performs the leap, but makes no key choices that alter tactics or foreclose options. Observation dominates; the decision to jump is unmotivated and consequence-free. Present in closure (floating down) but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The parachute buckle appears in four beats (adjustment, memory, tightening, final swing) but remains static—a relic described rather than used. It does not constrain choice or evolve in meaning; the final "pendulum of rhythm" is decorative. Swappable with any other harness component.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The watcher's burden is named three times and shapes the thematic frame (solitude, trust, invisible connections) but does not constrain on-page choices or alter tactics. It functions as atmospheric concept rather than stake-driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Attentively inventive is a label applied once ("their mind forever unraveling the threads of what others missed") without demonstrating a tradeoff or enabling a specific action. No cost or constraint tied to this trait appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Revise appears in three beats (muscle memory, rechecking knots, revising stars) but the action does not drive turns or redefine options. The seeker rechecks and adjusts but nothing changes as a result. Easily swappable with "prepare" or "adjust."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Remembering through muscle memory is signaled twice (buckle click, body tension before leap) and briefly shapes the seeker's ritual, but the mechanics do not affect outcome or constrain choice. Present in setup and middle but absent from closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor above the clouds is established early and frames the leap, providing vertical scale and fog-sea imagery. It supplies the branch and drop but does not constrain tactics or alter the outcome; the seeker could jump from any high place. Present in setup, middle, and closure image ("arbor shrinking below") with modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>After the radio static clears is mentioned in the opening and recurs at the end (static returns with a voice) but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Time is vague ("hours," "tonight") and the clearing of static does not alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>To preserve trust under pressure is declared as motivation ("pulsed beneath their ribs") and echoed at the end ("trust...was not just preserved but earned") but never dramatized in friction or choice. The seeker has no conflicting want or visible cost tied to trust. Told rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Soundless echo as tone is coherent throughout—silence, profound quiet, "sound had abandoned even echoes," whispers, static—and modulates slightly (silence → radio voice). The tone charges the final image ("soundless echoes, but tonight, one was theirs to keep") with modest resonance, though the effect remains largely atmospheric.</comment>
