<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to reclaim his art is clear, but interiority leans heavily on abstract declarations ("hollow ache," "fierce, cathartic release") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to resume his art feels inevitable from the opening, with no visible internal conflict or competing impulse dramatized in scene. The mnemonic gift is label-only; it never constrains a choice or creates a tactical problem on the page. Emotional progression is asserted through metaphor rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through symbolic objects (charcoal, box, painting) toward a final image of reclaimed creativity. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: he accepts his calling), but the cost is asserted ("weight of his decision settling in") rather than legibly paid through forfeited options or visible sacrifice. Orientation is clear early (cave, artist, exile). The Orientation Test is waived. However, the escalation is largely atmospheric; no meaningful tightening of options occurs between the box discovery and the final sketching.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered with auroral light and refracting crystals, and it charges the final image when the light shifts from tears to reverence. The cave's sensory detail (humming crystals, smooth stone wall) supports the protagonist's act of creation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or create a tactical obstacle; it functions primarily as symbolic backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming suppressed creativity—is signaled early but never genuinely tested by competing wants or costs. The protagonist retrieves the charcoal and immediately sketches; no on-page reversal narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The "laughter" that mocked his gift is backstory summary, and its resolution is told rather than dramatized. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require a deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost, but the final act is a straightforward fulfillment of intent with no visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of inescapable callings emerges through the charcoal, cave, and the protagonist's return to art, and the final image (charcoal-stained fingers as blessing, not curse) reconfigures the opening frame. However, thematic articulation is overt: "inescapable callings could not be silenced forever," "The broken lock… had been a metaphor, and he had finally turned the key." These lines state the theme rather than letting it arise from particulars. The ending offers resonance but leans on explicit summation in the final third.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, and the perceptual filter (artist's eye, memory-laden perspective) is consistent. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("auroral sorrow," "testament to the inescapable callings," "quiet certainty of a man who had reclaimed his soul") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is consistent, but the prose does not modulate under pressure; peak beats (discovering the box, final sketching) retain the same lyric, distanced cadence as exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "hollow ache" / "sorrow in his chest," "charcoal-fingered" / "charcoal-stained fingers," "auroral sorrow" recycled across multiple beats without evolution. Template cadence: "He reached… his fingers trembling… He rose… He would leave… He rose again." The final third contains heavy scaffold ("The broken lock… had been a metaphor," "The auroral sorrow had lifted"). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching, and mixed metaphors appear: creativity "uncorked… like molten lava," lock as metaphor for a key he "turned." These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure beats. Apply −1.4 in Q7 for pervasive loops and template runs, plus −0.3 for metaphor muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—artist in exile rediscovers his gift via a hidden charcoal stick—is a familiar redemption arc executed without fresh inflection. The cave, crystals, and painting-with-hidden-box feel like checklist elements rather than organic synthesis. The "inescapable calling" frame is stated repeatedly rather than dramatized through unexpected choices. The final turn (he will leave and continue his art) is telegraphed from the opening and arrives without surprise or cost that complicates the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The artist is present throughout and his arc (exile → reclamation) structures the piece. However, his choices are passive fulfillment of intent: he retrieves the box, opens it, and sketches. No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a competing path. He is the lens, not the locus of choice-driven turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The broken lock appears once in passing ("The lock on the back was broken, its combination scattered") and never returns or constrains action. It does not shape a beat, and "scattered" combination has no narrative consequence. The protagonist pries the painting open with no resistance. Missing setup as functional object, missing development, missing closure participation. Cap 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Inescapable callings" is stated multiple times as theme and motivation, framing the opening and closing. It shapes the protagonist's intent to return to his art. However, it is articulated through summary and metaphor rather than tested by competing desires or tactical friction. It does not narrow options in a dramatized beat. Present in setup and payoff, but development is told rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The mnemonic gift is mentioned twice: opening ("mnemonically gifted mind retaining every detail") and during sketching ("his memory spilling onto the surface"). It enables the final act (portraits from memory) but imposes no cost, creates no tradeoff, and does not constrain a choice. Label-only trait. Present in setup and payoff, missing development as active constraint. Cap 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Rectify" appears in the opening as his stated purpose ("to rectify the hollow ache") and is fulfilled at closure ("He had rectified the betrayal of his gift"). It frames the arc and the final release. However, the act of rectification—sketching the portraits—is not a choice under pressure; it is the uncontested execution of his intent. Present in setup and payoff, shapes the ending image, but does not constrain a middle beat or create visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The painting with the hidden cavity is introduced early, conceals the charcoal box, and is pried open to reveal the key object. It appears in setup and development, and its mechanics (frame, cavity, box) drive the midpoint discovery. However, it does not return at closure or reweight the final image. The final line mentions it only in dismissal ("The painting… now lay face down, its significance diminished"). Present in two beats, causal pressure in one, but no closure linkage. Two of three gates met; lyric reprise is negative (diminishment), not reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The subterranean crystal cave is established in the opening, provides the stone wall for sketching, and is present throughout. The crystals hum, refract light, and shift from "tears" to "light" at closure, charging the final image with the transformation. The cave does not constrain a choice or create a tactical obstacle, but it supplies the canvas (stone wall) and the atmospheric charge that marks the emotional arc. Setup, development (stone wall use), and payoff (light shift) all present. Causal involvement in the final act elevates the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the last echo of laughter fades" is invoked once in backstory ("the laughter… its echoes replaced by the quiet hum") but never tightens decisions or creates urgency. The protagonist acts at his own pace with no time pressure or clock. Missing setup as active constraint, missing development, ornamental mention at closure. Cap 2.8, reduced to 2.1 for purely retrospective, non-tactical use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to uncork suppressed creativity is stated early ("to uncork the creativity he had sealed away") and drives the arc from retrieval to final sketching. It reappears at closure ("uncorking the creativity that had simmered beneath the surface like molten lava"). However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. The protagonist's desire faces no on-page friction; he simply enacts it. Present in setup, development (box discovery), and payoff, but lacks dramatized conflict between want and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is introduced early, recurs throughout ("The cave pulsed with auroral sorrow," "The auroral sorrow had lifted"), and shifts at closure from sorrow to reverence/light. Tone is coherent and modulates with the arc. However, the phrase is repeated without evolving meaning until the final beat, and its shift is asserted ("had transformed into something like reverence") rather than enacted through image alone. Present in setup, development, and payoff; charges the final image but leans on summary to articulate the change.</comment>
