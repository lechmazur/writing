<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is dense with label-only abstractions ("scientifically romantic mind," "alchemical focus") rather than embodied contradiction. The protagonist performs elaborate light-weaving but her emotional state during the act remains summarized ("resolve hardening") without specific tension between competing impulses. Kael's whispered secret is never dramatized—we never learn what it is or see Elara wrestle with its implications in concrete terms. The final choice to "return differently" is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story opens with orientation debt: we don't learn who Elara is, where precisely the ember nexus sits, or what the pocket-sun actually does until well past the 120-word mark. The closure hinges on "capturing the density of presence" and "returning differently," but these operations remain metaphorical—no concrete before/after options are legible. Kael's secret, the inciting incident, is withheld entirely, preventing the reader from tracing causal pressure. The ending asserts transformation ("as it was meant to be remembered") without showing what changed or what was foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ember nexus supplies vivid imagery ("last light of day bled into the earth's molten veins") and the nautilus columella is handled on the page, but neither constrains Elara's choices—she could perform her light-weaving anywhere. The pocket-sun's warmth and the nexus's flicker create atmosphere but don't alter tactics or supply a resource that affects outcome. Spatial choreography is vague; we never learn how close Kael stands or what physical actions Elara's hands perform beyond "practiced" and "guided."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to capture the density of presence"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; she begins her work "methodical yet impassioned" and completes it without friction, error, or trade-off. Kael's secret should escalate pressure, but because it's never disclosed, it can't create a live dilemma. The resolution is convenience: Elara succeeds at her undefined task with no visible cost, and the final image ("their light did not fade") asserts triumph without dramatizing what was risked or lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of memory-as-alchemy and "returning differently" to revalue the past emerges from the imagery, but the final image offers no non-literal answer—it states the theme overtly ("as it was meant to be remembered: infinite, radiant"). The nautilus spiral and pocket-sun recur, yet their meaning doesn't shift; they remain static symbols. The piece avoids moralizing, but the thematic gesture is told rather than earned through specific contradiction or cost on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable and employs elevated, lyric diction ("temporal elasticity," "immutable decisions") that fits the alchemical register, though it occasionally tips into abstraction without grounding. POV remains clean; no head-hopping. Kael's single line of dialogue ("I found it") is functional but generic. The prose rhythm modulates with the scene's intensity, yet perceptual signature is thin—Elara's way of noticing (light, spirals, resolve) feels more thematic than character-particular. The voice is competent but not distinctive enough to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose carries significant overwriting: nearly every sentence in the central beat stacks metaphor ("threads of memory, a whisper of laughter, a flicker of devotion") without concrete action anchors. Paraphrase loops appear ("not just observation, but transformation" / "she couldn't simply record it; she had to return differently"). Filter verbs and abstract nominalization ("the sheer, unrepeatable weight," "the essence of their shared history") dull immediacy. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "She [verb]," and synonym churn recycles "resolve," "essence," "density" without added pressure. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and warranting deduction beyond baseline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise—an alchemist who revalues memory through light—offers a fantasy-lyric synthesis, but the execution leans on familiar metaphors (spirals, light-as-memory, twilight as threshold) without transformation. The whispered-secret frame is archetypal, and because the secret's content is withheld, no fresh moral calculus emerges. The ending's assertion of "infinite, radiant" permanence is emotionally generic. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material; the piece plays safely within lyric-fantasy conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara observes, interprets, and performs alchemical work, but her decisions don't create key turns—she succeeds at her task without friction. Setup present, middle involvement (the light-weaving), but no closure choice that alters options. Swappable with another artist-protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The columella appears in the opening third ("clutched… in her other hand"), is used as the framework's axis during the light-weaving, and settles "into its new function" at the end. Three beats, but the object's spiral property is described rather than mechanically constraining her technique. Functional across the arc but not indispensable—another spiral object could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Palette of resolve" is named mid-story and treated as a metaphor for decision-making ("not a collection of pigments, but a spectrum of immutable decisions"). It doesn't shape on-page tactics or create a trade-off; resolve is asserted to "harden" without friction. Present thematically but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Scientifically romantic" is labeled twice but never constrains or enables action with cost. We don't see Elara torn between empirical rigor and intuitive leap, or pay a price for blending the two modes. Label-only trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Revalue" is signaled ("she had to revalue everything") and the ending asserts that memory was "revalued… from something fleeting into something tangible." The action is thematic rather than plot-driving; no major turn traces to a specific act of revaluation. Swappable with "transform" or "capture."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"By returning differently" is named and glossed ("a refusal to accept the past as immutable; instead, she revisited it, altered its emotional weight"). The method is described but its mechanics never constrain her process—she performs the work once, successfully. Present in setup and closure gloss but not developed as a challenge or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ember nexus is present in the opening third, supplies vivid imagery and "latent energy," and the final paragraph anchors the memory "at twilight" between "earth's fire and the sky's surrender." Two beats with atmospheric charge. However, the setting doesn't pressure Elara's choices—she could perform this work elsewhere. Lyric reprise that reweights the frame but doesn't alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The secret-whisper moment is signaled in the opening beat and frames the work's purpose. The timeframe is present but doesn't tighten decisions—Elara has as much time as she needs to weave light. No live clock that alters moves; the "moment" is more thematic anchor than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>"To capture the density of presence" is stated early and repeated. The desire drives Elara's activity but is never dramatized as conflicted—she pursues it without friction, cost, or trade-off between what she wants and what it demands. Told-only motivation without on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tone blends lyric formality with present-tense urgency ("The ember nexus flickered… as if the world itself awaited her response"). It modulates slightly—heightening during the light-weaving—and the final image sustains the charged atmosphere. Coherent across turns, but static rather than dynamically responsive to escalation. Mid-band for consistency without transformation.</comment>
