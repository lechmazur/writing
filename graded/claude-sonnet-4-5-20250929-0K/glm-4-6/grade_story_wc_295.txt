<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode inscriptions is established, but her choices remain reactive throughout—she witnesses, asks, listens. The professor drives the key revelation; Elara's "healing words" trait is asserted twice but never dramatized with visible cost or constraint. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves smoothly from anxiety to understanding without embodied struggle or micro-choices that foreclose options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal-Situational Hybrid—the piece attempts causal linkage (telegram → inscriptions → prophecy) but relies heavily on exposition dump in dialogue. Orientation is clear by the opening. Closure reads as Charged Poise (they will decode together, "armed with knowledge and companionship"), but the cost is conceptual and future-facing rather than felt on the page; no live option is visibly foreclosed in the final image. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows Elara paying a price or surrendering a path at closure—only the promise of future burden.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Observatory anchors early with brass fittings, telescope, western window, star charts. The daylily telegram and star charts appear multiple times and charge the ending image slightly. However, the environment does not constrain a choice; Elara and Whitmore could have this conversation anywhere. Sensory detail (moonlight, dim light, sunrise) remains decorative rather than pressuring tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode the temple inscriptions. One tightening occurs when Whitmore reveals the prophecy and his wife's death, shifting Elara's understanding. However, Elara's agency is minimal—she asks a question, the professor explains, and they collaborate. No on-page decision narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost; the resolution is a mutual agreement to share work, not a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme of shared burdens is stated directly multiple times ("shared burden," "burden wasn't hers alone") rather than emerging through image and action. The final paragraph summarizes theme ("transforming a frightening burden into manageable knowledge") instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer. The daylily reprise and variable stars carry some weight, but the piece ends in exposition rather than charged image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; POV remains stable on Elara. Voice is competent but generic literary-default without distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is functional and advances plot but carries minimal subtext; the professor's confession arrives as exposition. "Words traveled through him, easing the weight" tells the healing effect rather than showing it through his reaction or altered behavior.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean and readable. Paraphrase loops appear: "growing anxiety over the temple inscriptions" / "temple inscriptions...their meanings just beyond her grasp" and "shared burden" / "burden...carried alone" / "burden wasn't hers alone" recycle the same content across paragraphs (−0.4). Filter-verb reliance ("witnessed," "realized," "knew") flattens immediacy in key beats. Sentence rhythm varies adequately; no major clarity failures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Core premise—lucid dream chronicler decoding temple prophecies via variable stars—reads as a stock fantasy/mystery template without fresh synthesis. The "healing with words" attribute is label-only; the variable stars remain vague mechanics. Emotional arc (isolated researcher finds mentor support) follows a familiar path without specific transformation. The daylily-pressed telegram offers a grace note but not enough to lift the piece into original territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara as lucid dream chronicler is established early (setup gate met), but her dream-chronicling ability never creates a turn or constrains a choice. She observes, asks one question, and accepts collaboration. Her profession is ornamental; swapping "dream chronicler" for "astronomer" or "linguist" changes nothing. Late limiter: the role does not drive middle development or closure participation causally.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Daylily-pressed telegram appears in three beats (setup, revelation, final image) and carries reweighted meaning—mother's death → wife's prophecy → shared work. Causal pressure is moderate: Elara picks it up to explain the professor's wife sent it, shifting his grief. Closure linkage is weak; the telegram is mentioned but does not shape the final decision. Swappable with "letter" or "note" with minor edits (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Shared burdens is stated explicitly five times and frames the resolution, meeting setup and payoff gates. However, it operates as theme claim rather than on-page constraint or choice driver. No visible cost or trade-off is tied to burden-sharing; Elara and Whitmore simply agree to work together. Mid-development is absent—no beat where burden-sharing alters tactics under pressure. Label-only use (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Heals with words" appears twice as assertion ("strange healing properties," "words traveled through him, easing the weight") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Elara does not choose between speaking and silence, nor does her healing create friction or trade-off. The professor's reaction is told, not shown. Ornamental trait (−0.8), label-only (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Witnessing the professor triggers the central revelation and conversation, meeting all three gates (setup implicit, development via discovery, payoff via shared understanding). The action is irreplaceable—Elara must see him to initiate the turn. However, it does not drive escalation or impose cost; she asks a question and he explains. Two-beat involvement (discovery, conversation) with causal pressure, but no closure transformation beyond framing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Variable stars are mentioned throughout (setup met) and link telegram to inscriptions, providing the conceptual bridge. However, mechanics remain vague—how stars encode prophecy is never specified. They shape Elara's research goal (middle development weak) but do not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure. Present in final image ("continued their pulsing dance") but decoratively. Swappable with "celestial patterns" (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Celestial mapping observatory anchors early and reappears in five beats (telescope, window, star charts, midnight, sunrise dome). It houses the action and supplies props (charts, telegram) but does not constrain choice—the conversation could occur in any shared workspace. The observatory charges the "midnight solace" tone and final image ("observatory dome"), creating lyric resonance. Micro-setting allowance applies; modest causal role (one beat: Elara finds him at the charts).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"When understanding dawns" is signaled late (final third: "precisely when understanding dawned") and functions as summary rather than live clock. Time markers (midnight, "through the rest of that night," sunrise) track duration but do not tighten decisions. Understanding is declared, not earned through incremental choices. Setup and payoff gates met weakly; middle development absent (−0.5). Introduced after 40% (−0.4 cap applies at 4.6), but "dawn" motif in final line lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Decoding temple inscriptions is Elara's stated goal from paragraph three, driving her research and anxiety (setup met). The revelation that inscriptions encode warnings via variable stars (middle development met) reframes the goal. Closure: decoding continues collaboratively, altering the how but not abandoning the goal (payoff met). Causal pressure moderate—goal drives the scene but creates no on-page friction or choice with visible cost. Three-beat involvement; felt as dominant stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Midnight solace is signaled in the opening (moonlight, midnight clock strike) and bookends the piece ("midnight solace...carried her through darkness," sunrise). Tone is contemplative and gently melancholic, stable across beats without modulation under pressure. The tone charges the final image (sunrise, collaboration, hope) but does not shift to reflect escalation or cost. Lyric coherence is strong; lack of tonal pressure work limits the score.</comment>
