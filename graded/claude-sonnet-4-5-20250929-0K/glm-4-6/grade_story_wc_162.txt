<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elea's motivation (understanding thresholds) is stated but never tested through concrete on-page choice with visible cost. The "featherly determined" trait appears as a label recycled three times without constraining action. Interiority consists largely of abstract philosophizing ("necessary distances," "sacred thresholds") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The ending offers acceptance of a guardian role, but no prior choice or renunciation earned this shift with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elea is and what the prism terrace means emerge slowly through ~200 words of atmospheric drift. The dominant stake—why thresholds feel sacred—resolves via epiphany ("she realized with sudden clarity") rather than causal pressure. The piece attempts Accumulative mode but lacks a meaningful tightening or cadence shift; the final image recycles "featherly determined" and restates the premise without reweighting prior material or making cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The prism terrace, wood grain, and logbook are vividly described but function as postcard elements; they do not constrain a single on-page choice. Spatial choreography is vague—Elea kneels, moves to the edge, stands—without coherent distance or object placement. The "fractured light" and "drifting" recur as texture but never alter tactics or charge the closure image with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (why thresholds feel sacred) is signaled early but never escalates through reversal or tightening. Elea encounters no opposition, makes no trade-off, and pays no price; she simply arrives at understanding. The logbook, wood grain, and father's voice offer clues but do not resist or complicate her path. The ending delivers philosophical acceptance without narrowing options or foreclosing a live alternative with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" and "sacred thresholds" are asserted thematically in nearly every paragraph, creating redundant loops rather than emergent resonance. The final image restates the premise ("some distances, once crossed, could never be un-crossed") without a non-literal answer or reweighting of prior material. Subtext is thin; the logbook codes and wood grain analysis remain decorative rather than dramatized with moral calculus or conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The perceptual signature ("featherly determined fingers," "fractured hush," "prism light") recurs but flattens into template phrasing rather than character-particular idiom. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("paradoxically bound everything together," "invisible threads across possible worlds") that exceeds a reflective child's plausible lexicon under stress. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Psychic distance remains stable, and the POV modesty is mostly controlled, preventing a lower score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "necessary distances" and "sacred thresholds" cycle across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("Elea [verb], [object]") appear in five consecutive beats. Stock metaphors ("water disturbed by stones," "invisible threads") and filter-verb stacks ("could feel," "could hear," "swore she could hear") dull immediacy in peak moments. The final third recycles "featherly determined" and "fractured hush" without fresh propulsion, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—post-butterfly-effect world, maze architect's child as threshold guardian—combines familiar SFF templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Featherly determined," "prism terrace," and "pilot logbook weather code" read as prompt-fulfillment tokens rather than organic synthesis. The ending restates the setup ("some distances must remain unbridged") without a fresh inflection or risk that heightens stakes. Proximity to stock wisdom ("all mazes teach patience," "being lost was simply wandering") lowers originality further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elea is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She kneels, traces patterns, moves, stands, and smiles—all observation and acceptance without agency. The "lost child" descriptor appears once without causal relevance. Late first paragraph introduction and zero beat involvement beyond atmospheric presence cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The pilot logbook appears in three beats (finding it, reading the code, final mention) and offers the key insight ("threshold between worlds," "some distances must remain unbridged"). However, it resolves a thematic question it did not help create; Elea's search for threshold meaning precedes the logbook's discovery. The weather code constrains no choice and exacts no cost—Elea simply reads and understands. Swappable with any cryptic heirloom journal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is seeded early, recurs in five beats, and anchors the thematic resolution. It shapes Elea's understanding (a middle realization) and the final acceptance of her guardian role. Yet it remains thematic echo rather than a stake that narrows on-page options or exacts visible cost; Elea never faces a choice between bridging or honoring a distance. The concept participates in closure but does not drive causal pressure, limiting the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears three times as a label (fingers, heart, smile/watch) without enabling or constraining a single action. No choice or tactic hinges on this attribute; it functions as decorative diction. Introduced early but swappable with "resolute" or "steadfast" with zero structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears in two beats: Elea "could intuit connections" (trait statement) and later tries "to intuit the moment of divergence" (wood-pressing scene). The action does not drive a major turn—understanding arrives via the logbook instead. Easily replaceable with "sense" or "perceive" without altering story logic. Present and functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Wood grain analysis is signaled early ("analyzing the grain"), used in two middle beats (tracing patterns, pressing the threshold wood), and mentioned at closure ("traced one more pattern"). The method's mechanics remain vague—what grain patterns reveal is never dramatized—so it does not shape tactics or impose cost. The logbook provides the insight instead. Functional but swappable with any reflective study method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The prism terrace frames the entire scene, recurs in six beats, and anchors the final image ("drifting onward, carrying its quiet guardian"). Yet it supplies no resource or constraint that alters Elea's choices; she moves freely across it without spatial pressure. The "drifting" quality suggests instability but never tests her physically or temporally. Atmospheric anchor without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" bookends the piece (opening and final third) but remains a static backdrop. No urgency, countdown, or temporal tightening shapes Elea's decisions. The timeframe does not escalate pressure or constrain tactics; Elea has unlimited leisure to study and reflect. Mentioned but inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The desire to understand why thresholds feel sacred is stated early, recurs in three beats, and receives thematic resolution ("that was why thresholds felt sacred"). However, this motivation is never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction with cost. Elea encounters no competing want, no obstacle, and pays no price for the answer. Told-only throughout, limiting integration to mid-band despite closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is seeded in the opening, recurs in four beats ("hush after great changes," "broke the fractured hush"), and modulates with the ending smile—a shift from stillness to acceptance. The tone remains coherent and charges the final image with quiet resolve. Yet it does not vary with pressure or stakes; the same contemplative register pervades all beats, preventing higher elevation. Solid lyric reprise but static across the arc.</comment>
