<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The engineer remains an abstraction delivering orchestrated interiority rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. "Logically emotional state—the mind's precise calculations harmonizing with the heart's unyielding resolve" is diagnostic label-speak that names rather than embodies the trait. No genuine internal conflict emerges; he executes a plan without friction, cost, or mistake. The final stance feels declared rather than earned through visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening sentence. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the ritual unfolds through description and atmosphere rather than reversals. Closure registers as Conceptual Repricing—the marina transforms from graveyard to cathedral, the artifact is safe—but the cost remains abstract ("vigilance renewed") rather than a visible forfeiture or changed option on the page. The "because/therefore" chain is weak; the key does its work without resistance or tactical adjustment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with "fractured ice," "skeletal shadows," and "cracks no longer signs of decay but pathways of light." The glowing ice in the final third charges the closure image. However, the setting does not constrain a tactical choice; the engineer kneels and presses the key without environmental friction. The fleeting sunset functions as backdrop rather than ticking clock that narrows options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting the artifact from "discordant hum of human greed"—is signaled early but never materializes as on-page opposition. No reversal or meaningful tightening occurs; the engineer performs the ritual, it succeeds, he returns. The "shift in his bones" and transformation of the marina are asserted outcomes rather than pressure points that test commitment or force trade-offs. Agency is execution, not decision under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of resonance/absolution emerges through repeated motifs (vibrations, frequency, harmony vs. discord). The final image of ice as cathedral and the engineer as "keeper of vibrations" offers some reweighting. However, the piece leans on prompt-language abstractions—"sonic absolution," "vibrational matching," "logically emotional"—rather than earning insight through concrete, contradictory particulars. The closing paragraph edges toward thematic summary: "a reminder that protection was not always about fighting but about aligning."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Single-POV omniscient narration maintains stable distance and a distinct lyric register. Perceptual signature reads filtered through the engineer's expertise ("vibrations so pure they could unravel the very fabric of regret"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("fleshly and ethereal," "sacred glow," "cathedral of ice") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue. Psychic distance remains consistent; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: "azure-coat," "fleeting golden sunset," "hues of fire and forgiveness," "skeletal shadows," "fleshly and ethereal," "cathedral of ice" cluster figurative language without pattern-teaching or restraint (density penalty −0.6). Paraphrase loops: "not a door but a state of being" / "not of sound...but of vibrations"; "his mission complete but his vigilance renewed" / "knew his work was far from over." Template cadence in the final third: "The marina was...The engineer breathed...The key lay...As he walked..." (−0.5). Propulsion stalls under ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Core premise—mystical engineer performs protective ritual at icy outpost—reads as a composite of familiar elements without fresh synthesis. "Sonic absolution," "vibrational matching," "crypt keeper's key" function as prompt labels rather than story-specific discoveries. The ritual succeeds without surprise or cost, and the final transformation ("graveyard to cathedral") lands as expected metaphor. No risk-taking or non-obvious turn; execution trends toward safe, atmospheric execution of the checklist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The azure-coat lighthouse engineer is present throughout and performs the climactic ritual, but his choices do not create turns—he executes a predetermined plan without tactical adaptation. The coat color appears in setup and closure as descriptor. Functional presence but replaceable agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The crypt keeper's key is introduced early, handled in two beats (warming in palm, pressed into ice), and triggers the sonic absolution. Its cryptic engravings glow, and it lies "still in the ice, its purpose fulfilled" at closure. However, its mechanics are asserted rather than tactically negotiated, and it could be swapped for any mystical tool with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Sonic absolution is named early and described at length, but its mechanics remain abstract ("vibrations so pure they could unravel the very fabric of regret"). The process unfolds as atmospheric description rather than a constraint that shapes the engineer's tactics or forces a trade-off. Theme-level presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" appears once as a diagnostic label ("his logically emotional state—the mind's precise calculations harmonizing with the heart's unyielding resolve") without constraining an on-page action or creating visible cost. The engineer's behavior reads as calm competence throughout; no enacted contradiction between logic and emotion.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Adapt" is mentioned once in exposition ("learning to adapt not by force but by resonance") but does not drive a major turn. The engineer performs the ritual as planned; no mid-scene adaptation to unexpected resistance occurs. Swappable with "align" or "attune" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Vibrational matching is introduced in the first third ("aligning his own inner frequency with the world around him") and enacted when the engineer "attuned himself to the vibration" at the ritual's peak. However, the method is told rather than shown through tactical choices; the engineer's trembling and closed eyes are the only embodied signs. Functional but generic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is present from the opening, supplies the fissure where the key is pressed, and transforms into a "cathedral of ice" at closure. The setting charges the final image. However, it does not constrain the engineer's choices—he walks, kneels, and completes the ritual without environmental friction or resource scarcity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The fleeting golden sunset is named in the opening and its passing ("last sliver of sun dipped below the horizon") marks the ritual's completion. However, time does not tighten decisions; the engineer moves at his own pace with no clock pressure or risk of missing the window. Atmospheric marker rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>To protect the sacred artifact is stated early ("his motivation burned as clearly as the horizon") and referenced at closure ("the artifact was safe for another cycle"). The desire drives the ritual but faces no on-page friction or competing want. The greed that "had already breached the marina's frozen shores" never materializes as opposition, reducing dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" appears once mid-story ("the air grew thick, charged with a presence both fleshly and ethereal") and the tone attempts lyric mysticism throughout ("hues of fire and forgiveness," "cathedral of ice"). Coherent but static; the register does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image in a distinct way—it remains uniformly elevated.</comment>
