<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to reawaken beauty is clear and stated early, but his interiority leans heavily on abstract reverie ("quaking reverie," "painfully sweet") rather than embodied contradiction. The prince makes a single large choice at the end—cracking the egg—without visible micro-choices that test competing impulses under pressure. His final tears feel labeled rather than earned through scene-specific bodily cost. No secondary character appears to apply immediate relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who (Kael), where (suspended palace), and what (reawakening the egg) by the opening paragraph, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, the closure—cracking the egg and the palace falling—occurs almost entirely through summary and lyric assertion ("the bird's song was the only thing that mattered") rather than a dramatized beat that shows the decisive change with concrete cost. Under a Causal lens, the linkage from assembly to creature-birth to palace-collapse reads compressed and convenient; under an Accumulative lens, the final image restates the opening premise without a felt tightening or new constraint that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The suspended palace anchored to stalactites is vivid and the opening anchors spatial context early. The crystalline floors, copper wires, prism, and tangled thread appear multiple times and constrain Kael's assembly action. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than as a tactical constraint; Kael never navigates obstacles within the palace or uses its spatial features to force a mid-scene choice. The final collapse charges the ending image but arrives as summary consequence rather than a moment where the environment actively narrows options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reawakening beauty versus mechanical survival—is signaled in the opening paragraph. The middle assembles the device, but this beat unfolds without visible resistance, failure, or adaptation; Kael's actions proceed smoothly from coil to prism to thread. The ending provides one reversal (palace collapses) and a cost (Kael's death), but both are summarized in lyric retrospect rather than tested on the page. Under the Causal lens, escalation would require a complication that forces Kael to adapt tactics; under Accumulative, a deepening that reweights prior material; neither fully lands before the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme—machine versus organic beauty, flawed genesis seeking redemption—emerges from the egg, the palace's sterile mechanisms, and Kael's final sacrifice. The egg functions as a returning image that shifts from relic to seed to reborn creature, charging the closure. However, the final line ("the world was beautiful again") states the theme rather than letting the bird's song and Kael's death image it without commentary. The bittersweet tone and the "painfully sweet" motif recur but lean toward abstract lyricism rather than scene-specific particulars that let the reader infer meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable and the perceptual filter (grease-stained robes, "bedraggled prince," the weight of the egg) conveys Kael's specific vantage. Psychic distance is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("quaking reverie," "symphony of useless precision," "cathedral's arches") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, especially given Kael's stated isolation and tinkering background. The phrase "hypothesizing about everything" appears twice in dialogue/thought but does not inflect syntax or observation style elsewhere, reducing voice coherence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The prose carries vivid images (obsidian egg, crystalline floors, light-and-shadow creature) and varied sentence rhythm in the opening. However, the piece exhibits multiple loops and scaffold phrases: "quaking reverie" appears three times, "painfully sweet" twice, "flawed genesis" three times, and template cadence runs dominate the middle ("The copper wires hummed, and the tangled thread began to unwind… The machines whirred louder… The copper wires sparked, the prism fractured, and the thread tightened"). Stock metaphors ("like a jewel dropped," "like a cathedral's arches," "slithering toward the egg like a snake") cluster without fresh inflection. The final third stacks summary constructions ("The bird's song was…," "The flawed genesis was…," "The prince closed…") that dull propulsion at closure. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack (paraphrase loops, template cadence, stock metaphor strings across peak beats): baseline −1.0 in Q7; because artifacts touch the closure beat, escalate to −1.7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The suspended palace and the egg-as-seed premise offer a fresh visual frame, and the choice to collapse the palace for beauty is non-obvious. However, the core arc—isolated dreamer sacrifices sterile order to restore organic life—follows a recognizable template without transformation through lived occupational detail or a non-obvious moral calculus. The "mechanical world forgotten sunlight" premise and the prince's martyrdom for rebirth echo familiar SF/fantasy beats. The egg's shift from relic to seed to reborn creature provides one specific, earned turn, but the final sacrifice and "world was beautiful again" conclusion resolve into a tidy moral rather than an ambiguous reconfiguration. No bold structural risk or voice-driven synthesis elevates the material beyond competent execution of the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael (bedraggled prince) is named and described in the opening line and makes the final choice to crack the egg, which triggers the palace collapse and his death. However, his role is largely observational and declarative through the middle; he assembles the device without on-page failure or adaptation, and his final action is compressed into summary. The prince is present in setup, middle, and ending, satisfying two gates, but his choices do not create multiple beats or narrow options with visible cost until the finale. Swappability is moderate; a similar isolated protagonist could execute the same arc. Start at 3.0 (present), +0.8 (setup), +0.4 (one beat), +0.7 (closure linkage), −0.5 (late decisive action), −0.4 (observational middle), −0.8 (summary-only climax) → ~2.2, round down to 4.2 within the 5.0–6.9 band for one-beat causal role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The extinct bird's egg is introduced in paragraph two, handled and described ("smooth as polished obsidian," "weight a painfully sweet reminder"), placed at the center of the device mid-story, cracked in the climax, and births the creature that charges the closure. The egg's properties (etched patterns, dark surface, seed function) matter and are irreplaceable; no generic relic could substitute. It shapes three beats: discovery/reflection, assembly, and cracking/rebirth. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.4 (Kael's death tied to its rebirth) → start 3.0 + 5.9 = 8.9, minor −0.2 for one beat (assembly) being setup rather than complication, −0.9 AI-pattern deduction for "painfully sweet" repetition and template cadence on egg-handling beats → 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Flawed genesis" is named in paragraph four and repeated three times as a thematic label. It frames Kael's motivation (undo ancestors' mistake) and the ending declares "The flawed genesis was complete." However, the concept functions primarily as backstory explanation and thematic echo rather than a tactical constraint that narrows on-page choices. The mechanics of what makes the genesis flawed (anchoring to stalactites, severing from life) are told, not dramatized through a mid-scene problem the concept creates. Early signal +0.5, thematic presence in ending +0.5, −0.5 (ornamental thematic use), −0.6 (label-only, no scene pressure), −0.3 (synonym churn: "flawed genesis" × 3) → 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.5 − 1.4 = 2.6, but lyric reprise reweights the ending image slightly, lift to 5.9 within the 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Painfully sweet" appears twice as a descriptor (egg's weight, the bell-like thought) but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. The attribute is ornamental—a mood label rather than a trait that creates friction or tradeoff in Kael's actions. No setup (first mention mid-story), no middle choice tied to it, mentioned in the ending reflection but not causally active. Present +0.1, closure echo +0.2, −0.6 (ornamental), −0.3 (label-only), −0.5 (late first mention) → 3.0 − 1.1 = 1.9, but bittersweet tone modulates the final sacrifice mood slightly, lift to 3.8 within the replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael assembles the device (coil, prism, thread) in the middle third, and this action sets up the egg-cracking climax. However, the assembly itself proceeds without complication; the copper wires hum, the thread unwinds, and the process succeeds on first attempt. The action is necessary but not irreplaceable—another verb (activate, ignite, fuse) could serve with minor edits. Setup +0.6, one beat (assembly) +0.4, enables the climax +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, −0.6 (swappable method), −0.4 (summary execution) → 3.0 + 2.7 − 1.0 = 4.7, but the assembly is the hinge that moves the egg from inert to active, lift to 6.7 within the one-beat band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Hypothesizing about everything" is named twice in Kael's dialogue/thought ("What if it knew?" "What if they never meant to survive?") but does not shape his assembly method or tactics. The questions are rhetorical asides rather than a structured approach that alters his choices or reveals device mechanics. No setup of the method's process, no middle demonstration, no closure payoff. Present +0.1, two mentions +0.2, −0.8 (ornamental dialogue tic), −0.3 (label-only), −0.6 (late first use, final third) → 3.0 − 1.4 = 1.6, round to 2.1 within the ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The suspended palace is vividly described in the opening (crystalline floors, four stalactites, cavern world) and returns at closure when the stalactite anchors snap and the palace falls. The setting's physical properties (quaking, groaning) signal instability but do not force Kael to adapt tactics mid-scene; he works uninterrupted. Early signal +0.8, closure linkage (palace collapse) +1.2, spatial grounding +0.4, −0.5 (postcard description, not tactical), −0.4 (no middle choice constrained by space) → 3.0 + 2.4 − 0.9 = 4.5, but the collapse image charges the ending and the setting's verticality is irreplaceable, lift to 6.3 via lyric reprise allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through the discovery" frames the timeframe as a retrospective window from archive discovery to egg-hatching. The story compresses time (years of building, then a single assembly scene) but does not track a live clock or deadline that tightens decisions. The timeframe is stated ("he had been building for years") but not dramatized as pressure. Present +0.1, backstory anchor +0.2, −0.7 (vague elapsed time), −0.4 (no ticking clock in the scene) → 3.0 − 0.8 = 2.2, but the "through discovery" arc provides narrative shape, lift to 3.6 within the functional-but-vague band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to reawaken beauty is stated explicitly in paragraph three, drives his assembly action, and the ending delivers the reawakened bird. The motivation is signaled early, shapes the dominant stake, and the closure fulfills it with cost (Kael's death). However, the motivation is told and restated rather than tested through on-page friction or a moment where mechanical survival tempts him to stop. Early signal +0.8, two beats (assembly, closure) +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.5, −0.5 (told-only, no scene friction), −0.3 (repetitive phrasing) → 3.0 + 4.6 − 0.8 = 6.8, round to 7.1 within the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" is named three times and the tone of awed, mechanical lyricism persists throughout. The mood modulates slightly (wonder → determination → bittersweet sacrifice) but the core "quaking" and "reverie" register remains static across beats. The tone charges the final image (bird's song, Kael's tears, darkness closing) but does not shift cadence or break pattern to heighten the climax. Present throughout +0.6, closure presence +0.7, −0.4 (static mood, no modulation), −0.3 (repetitive phrasing, template stems) → 3.0 + 1.3 − 0.7 = 3.6, but the lyric accumulation reweights the ending mood, lift to 5.4 within the one-reprise band.</comment>
