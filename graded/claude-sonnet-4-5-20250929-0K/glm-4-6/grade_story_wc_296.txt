<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The druid's interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("layers of wilderness wisdom," "frozen confession") rather than embodied contradiction. The guilt-driven motivation is told in summary at the climax ("he had loved and lost, and the guilt had frozen him in place") instead of emerging through micro-choices under pressure. The "guarded heart now open" resolution feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path. Emotional progression is largely linear summary without credible irrationality or conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first 120 words, avoiding penalties. The piece tracks a single continuous scene with a dominant stake (confronting frozen guilt). However, the closure relies on summary declaration ("he had found himself") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost; the vortex simply "vanished" and the lake became "calm" without visible consequences that alter later options. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; the ending offers theme claims but no legible price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "cursed lake" and "orchard vortex" are vividly described with purposeful sensory detail ("cold seeping into his bones," "warlike serenity"). The flesh-eating plant seed's warmth and glow anchor micro-setting tactility. However, spatial choreography remains generic; the vortex does not constrain a specific choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—it simply disappears at closure. The environment decorates rather than pressures, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (confronting frozen guilt) is signaled early. Pressure is declared ("vortex pulled him in") but the druid's agency consists of a single forward step and spell repetition without visible trade-offs or narrowing options. The seed "fulfilled" its purpose off-stage (it "fell from his hand, sinking into the depths") without showing what that purpose was or what the druid risked or lost. The resolution summarizes emotional release without demonstrating a choice that forecloses a path with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of confronting buried truth emerges organically from the druid's journey, and the vortex/mirror motif recurs purposefully. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("strength lay not in hiding, but in facing the storm") and the ending summarizes theme rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer through image. The "frozen confession, finally free" and "mirrors no longer mattered" are abstract declarations that replace scene pressure with theme statements, triggering a −0.5 penalty in this category.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("wilderness wisdom," physicality anchored in "worn boots," tactile seed). However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions under pressure ("warlike serenity," "layers of wilderness wisdom") that feel externally imposed rather than character-filtered. The final paragraph's summary tone ("The druid smiled, a rare and genuine expression") flattens immediacy. No dialogue present; voice is serviceable but lacks rhythmic control under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The druid had always been guarded" / "The druid had always found lost things" / "The druid had always believed"; "The vortex churned" / "The vortex spun faster" / "the vortex pulled him in" / "The orchard's vortex stilled." Template cadence with "The druid [verb]" stems appears in nine sentences, triggering a −0.6 deduction. The final third contains synonym churn ("frozen confession" repeated, "swirling" recurs) and scaffold phrasing ("The druid turned away," "The druid walked into"). Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 for loops and stems, escalated to −1.2 because artifacts touch the closure beat. Disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise (guilt-frozen druid confronts magical vortex to reclaim self) follows a familiar template: wounded loner seeks redemption through symbolic trial. The "flesh-eating plant seed" and "orchard vortex" supply surface novelty, but their function is generic (magical key). The transformation test fails: the emotional arc (guarded → open) works unchanged with different names and objects. No unconventional structural or perspectival risk; the ending's wisdom ("strength lay not in hiding") is a platitude. Derivative premise without transformation via lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus triggers a −1.0 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The guarded druid is named early and his emotional state (guarded, guilt-frozen) frames expectation. However, his on-page choices are minimal: one step forward, whispering a failed spell, and allowing the vortex to "overwhelm him." These are passive submissions rather than decisions that alter tactics or narrow options. The "guarded" trait is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Present functionally but does not create key turns; swappable with "wounded" or "isolated" protagonist. Setup gate met, middle development weak, closure participation is label-only summary.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The flesh-eating plant seed appears in beat one (druid's palm), beat two (grows warmer as he approaches), beat three (begins to glow, casts shadows, pulses in circles), and beat four (falls into lake, "purpose fulfilled"). Four touches across the arc. However, its mechanics remain opaque—what does a flesh-eating plant seed do in a spell, and why does it need to sink? Its "hunger for life" metaphor is declared post-hoc, not shown. It enables the vortex moment but does not constrain a visible choice or impose a cost. All three gates met; causal involvement in middle beats; closure linkage weak (it disappears before resolution). Specific properties (warmth, glow, jagged edges) matter but swappability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Frozen confession" is introduced early ("the frozen confession within him demanded to be heard") and returns at closure ("his frozen confession, finally free"). However, it functions as a theme label rather than a stake that shapes on-page tactics. The druid does not grapple with whether to confess, to whom, or at what cost; he simply "allowed" the truth to surface. The concept is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development absent. Lyric reprise without mid-scene causal pressure; score in the 4.0–4.9 band per guidance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Finds lost things—keys, memories, even forgotten paths" is mentioned once in exposition. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action; the druid does not use this ability to navigate the vortex or recover the seed. The trait is asserted as backstory flavor without tactical consequence. At closure, "he had found himself" is a thematic echo, not a demonstrated use of the ability with cost. Ornamental mention; missing all three gates. Cap at 2.8 per missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unbend" is seeded early ("the trees within its grasp bending and unbending") and becomes the druid's climactic action ("for the first time, he allowed himself to unbend"). The physical metaphor (rigid → flexible) mirrors his emotional arc (guarded → open). However, "unbend" is a passive internal shift, not a visible action with clear mechanics or cost. The druid does not perform a physical unbending or make a choice that trades one option for another. Setup, middle (tree image), and closure gates all met; causal linkage moderate; specificity moderate. Three gates plus closure linkage and early signal, but swappability is high (could be "open," "yield," "release").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Through expanding circles" appears once when the seed's light pulses "in expanding circles, each wave pushing deeper into the orchard's center." The method is named and visualized but does not shape prior attempts or constrain tactics—it simply occurs at the climax. Mechanics are gestural (light waves) without cost or trade-off. Missing setup and middle development gates; closure participation is present but passive. Single beat involvement; late first appearance (well past midpoint); causal pressure weak. Functional but replaceable; could be "spiraling beams" or "rippling light" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "swirling orchard vortex at the heart of a cursed lake" is introduced in the opening sentence and dominates the spatial frame throughout. It pressures the druid's approach ("the vortex pulled him in") and its stilling marks the closure ("The orchard's vortex stilled"). However, the vortex does not supply resources or impose navigational constraints; it is a symbolic obstacle that disappears without consequence. The druid does not adapt tactics based on vortex behavior. Setup, middle presence (spins faster, trees bend), and closure gates met; beat involvement across three moments; causal pressure moderate; specificity high ("orchard," "cursed lake") but the vortex's mechanics remain vague.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the magic trick fails" anchors the opening ("the magic trick that had failed moments ago") and establishes urgency. However, elapsed time is never tracked; the druid's actions (step forward, whisper spell, enter water, emerge) unfold in vague sequence without a tightening clock. The timeframe does not alter decisions or tactics; the druid proceeds at a steady pace without time pressure forcing trade-offs. Setup gate met; middle and closure development weak. Present as backstory anchor but does not function as live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To discover what mirrors don't show" is stated twice ("his motivation had always been to discover what mirrors don't show"; "the mirrors no longer mattered"). The desire frames the druid's quest but is never dramatized through conflicting choices or visible cost. What does he sacrifice to pursue this discovery? The motivation is told as philosophical premise rather than shown through friction between wants and fears. Setup and payoff gates met; middle friction absent. Lyric reprise without on-page struggle; swappable with "find hidden truths" or "see past illusions."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Warlike serenity" is named twice ("the vortex churned with a warlike serenity"; "The warlike serenity of the vortex had taught him") and shapes the atmospheric register throughout (violent motion presented as calm). Tone is coherent and purposeful, modulating from tense approach to quiet resolution. However, the oxymoron is declared rather than embodied in sentence rhythm or image; the prose does not enact the tension between war and serenity. Tone charges the thematic claim at the end but does not modulate dynamically under pressure. Setup, middle consistency, and closure linkage present; causal pressure on choice weak; specificity moderate.</comment>
