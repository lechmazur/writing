<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is signaled early and her firefighter/arsonist's daughter duality is clear, but her arc is more declared than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The planting action feels symbolic rather than choice-driven under pressure; no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from the sapling decision itself. Interiority leans toward therapy-speak ("scars could sing," "unyielding compassion grafted onto the world") rather than embodied contradiction. The final walk away lacks a genuine alteration or renunciation that would register as earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through interwoven images (lagoon, sand, coin, sapling) toward a final resonant tableau. Orientation is present by the opening lines (who, where, when), satisfying the test. However, closure lacks a decisive reweighting or visible cost; the ending restates the premise ("from ashes, something beautiful") without a felt price or shift in options. One meaningful deepening via the coin-tying ritual is present, but it does not narrow tactics or foreclose a path—it decorates the symbolic argument.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, black sand, and dunes anchor setting vividly and early. Sensory detail is selective and serves the meditative tone; the lagoon's mirroring surface recurs purposefully. The sapling planting engages the environment tactically (cool grains, damp burlap), and the black sand's exposure during cloud migration links timeframe to place. Micro-setting via the coin and sapling constrains one choice (the tying ritual), lifting the score above decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving scars can sing through acts of rebirth—is signaled early. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens but does not tighten or escalate; the planting unfolds without opposition or cost. The coin-tying ritual offers one modest deepening, yet no reversal or trade-off narrows options. Agency is present (Elara plants, ties the thread) but feels symbolic rather than forced by conflict, and the ending restates rather than transforms the premise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—regeneration after destruction, scars as testimony—is woven through image and action, not bald statement, which is a strength. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic echo: "scars...were no longer wounds but notes in a symphony of resilience" and "a scar was beginning to sing its first, clear note" sound prompt-adjacent and slightly over-articulated. The ending offers little non-literal complexity; it restates the premise rather than repricing it through an earned particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara throughout. Voice carries a lyric, measured texture ("kelp-drift peace," "obsidian surface") that suits the reflective tone. Distance is consistent, with no head-hopping. However, peak moments ("weight of her history—not as a curse, but as a tool") lean toward summary rather than immediate perception, and the perceptual signature is less character-specific than genre-poetic. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with purposeful rhythm and varied syntax. Metaphoric density is high ("kelp-drift peace," "coin a small arc of red") but remains coherent. Two frictions: the phrase "scars could sing" is repeated across beats without evolution (paraphrase loop), and the final paragraph stacks summary-like constructions ("not as a curse, but as a tool," "no longer wounds but notes") that dull immediacy. These do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion at closure, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The arsonist's daughter/firefighter pairing is not new, and the symbolic planting + coin ritual feels familiar in eco-redemption narratives. Specificity (obsidian lagoon, volcanic black sand, foreign coin) adds texture, yet the emotional arc and thematic resolution remain template-level: destruction → rebirth via symbolic act. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode, which is a strength, but no turn or inflection surprises or reweights prior material in a non-obvious way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is named early and her firefighter/arsonist's daughter identity frames the premise. She makes one on-page choice (planting the sapling, tying the coin), but the act feels symbolic rather than a decision under pressure that alters tactics. Her role is more vehicle for theme than agent of key turns; observation and reflection dominate over consequential choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Black sand is signaled early ("annual migration…black sand from the volcanic beach…most exposed"), handled during the planting ("cool grains sifting through her fingers"), and mentioned in the closure beat ("black sand from her knees," "small arc of red in the dark sand"). It appears in three spaced beats and serves as grounding material, but its volcanic origin does not constrain or enable a choice beyond setting texture. Stronger integration than decoration, yet not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" is named explicitly ("her creed," "unyielding compassion grafted onto the world") and shapes Elara's stated motive, but it remains thematic rather than tactical. No on-page choice tests or costs the attribute; it is asserted in summary rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or prices. Present and consistent, but swappable with a near-synonym without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" appears in the opening line ("moved with the grace of a flame…her steps alert") and recurs late ("a firefighter, gracefully alert and ready for the next call"). It is label-only; no action constrained or enabled by the trait is visible. The phrase decorates rather than driving a beat or choice. Static mention without cost or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Graft" is introduced early ("Her work was a kind of graft, a careful splicing of hope onto barren ground") and repeated late ("unyielding compassion grafted onto the world"). It directly shapes the sapling planting, the central physical action, and metaphorically frames the closure image. The act is specific to the prompt and not easily swappable; removing it would break the story's symbolic spine. Two beats, closure linkage, causal presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The coin drilled and strung on red thread is carried ("evidence of her creed," "her mother had taught her"), unwrapped mid-scene, and tied around the sapling's base. It is handled across two beats, but its mechanics (foreign, drilled, red thread) do not alter the planting's outcome or constrain a choice. The method is present and purposeful but swappable with another heirloom object. Lyric reprise in the ending ("small arc of red in the dark sand") reweights slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon beneath dunes is anchored early and recurs as mirroring surface across beats. It frames the scene spatially and supplies the black sand resource. The lagoon's stillness charges the meditative tone and appears in the final image ("obsidian lagoon reflected it all"), contributing to closure resonance. Two-gate involvement (setup, payoff) with texture and closure linkage, but no middle choice constrained by the setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"During the migration of clouds" is named twice: opening and midpoint ("annual migration of clouds…black sand…most exposed"). It provides a seasonal window for sand exposure but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. The clouds' "slow, solemn march" mirrors rather than pressures Elara's action. Present as framing device, but time does not alter tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To prove that scars can sing" is stated explicitly early ("Her purpose was clear") and repeated in the closure beat ("scars…were no longer wounds but notes…a scar was beginning to sing"). The motivation drives the planting symbolically, but no on-page friction tests or costs the desire. It is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible sacrifice. One causal beat (planting as proof) without middle development or pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" is named twice (opening and late: "kelp-drift peace settled over her again") and shapes the story's meditative, reflective tone throughout. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (history's weight, then release), charging the final tableau with quiet resolution. It does not constrain action but supports the Accumulative lens and recurs with reweighted calm at closure. Two-gate reprise with closure resonance.</comment>
