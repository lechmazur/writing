<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The knight remains a vessel for abstract concepts rather than a character with embodied contradictions. Interiority consists largely of stock phrasing ("the weight of his allegiance settle," "shivering bliss") without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The final "smile" and transformation into "keeper of what could be" arrive as declaration rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses a concrete path. Motivation is told repeatedly but never tested by a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, when remain vague past 120 words, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The closure unit (unsnapping the gear → dawn shatters endless night) lacks visible cost: the knight suffers no loss, makes no trade-off, and the transformation happens to him rather than through a choice that narrows options. Drive lens defaults to Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift reconfigures the stake with felt price. The gear's removal functions as a mechanical trigger without dramatized consequence that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse and orchard are described with vivid, fantastical detail (glass panes magnifying endless night, fruits pulsing, tree hung with gears), but setting remains postcard backdrop rather than constraint. The knight moves "through forgotten patterns" without spatial choreography that tracks his position or limits his options. The gear tree at center could be anywhere; no environmental feature forces a tactical choice or charges the final image with grounded cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to capture the shape of possibility"—is declared but never tested on the page by a choice with alternatives and price. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the knight walks forward, finds the gear, removes it, and succeeds without friction. The marionette program "guides him" via passive pull rather than forcing a decision between competing goods. Escalation is asserted ("reality shifted," "time stretching") but not dramatized through agency or cost that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of possibility and allegiance is stated overtly ("murmured allegiance," "devotion to the future," "keeper of what could be") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "a living testament to the power of belief" and "the most forgotten patterns could lead to the most profound truths" replace scene pressure with summary. The gear and program function as symbolic tokens without constraining choice or accumulating pressure that charges the closure image with non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is generic fantasy-register rather than character-specific: "factually mystical," "liquid thoughts," "shivering bliss," "endless becoming." Lexicon drifts into elevated abstraction ("allegiance settle," "testament to the power of belief") that no medieval knight would articulate mid-crisis. Template cadence pervades: "The knight [verb]" opens eight sentences in the final third, flattening rhythm. No distinct voice emerges; prose reads as committee narration serving the prompt rather than the focalizer's lived perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "capture the shape of possibility, to see what could be before it wasn't" restates the same idea; "murmured allegiance" repeats five times with synonym churn (whisper, promise, declaration). Template cadence dominates the final third with "The knight [verb]" stems across consecutive sentences (−0.4 to −0.6). Stock metaphors pile without clarity: "time stretching like taffy," "magic spread like wildfire," "light catching the new sun." Filter-verb stacks ("felt the pull," "felt the weight," "felt foreign") dull immediacy in peak beats (−0.5, disallowing 9+ globally). Information density is low; many sentences restate prior claims without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—withdrawn knight in mystical orchard seeks abstract goal via symbolic objects—follows a familiar fantasy template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.5 to −1.5 derivative adjustment). The marionette program and gear function as quest tokens rather than elements with irreplaceable properties that shape choice. "Shivering bliss" and "factually mystical" aim for freshness but remain ornamental labels. No inflection or turn grows inevitably from prior particulars; the knight's success is declared rather than earned through risk that heightens stakes.</comment>
