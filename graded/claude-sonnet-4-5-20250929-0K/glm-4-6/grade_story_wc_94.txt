<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The poet's motivation ("to understand the cartography of scars") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The reflective interiority dominates without micro-choices that test his values under pressure; his decision to open the envelope lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives. "Furiously tranquil" is named but never embodied in action or physiological detail. The final stance—descending as a cartographer—feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesce only after ~150 words, violating the 120-word anchor test (−0.4). The "vigil in pause" ending with the timer's click offers a micro turn, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with visible cost, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page; the poet's departure is asserted, not dramatized as a choice that forecloses a path. The accumulative lens is suggested but never coheres into a legible tightening or deepening at closure. Cost is claimed ("burden transformed into purpose") but not shown in a concrete sentence or image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory and swirling clouds supply vivid sensory anchors, filtered through the poet's awe. The darkroom timer and envelope constrain handling in discrete beats. However, spatial choreography inside the dome remains vague (stone table, glass edge, stairs appear without prior setup), and the setting does not force a tactical choice at closure—it remains backdrop. The micro-setting (body, timer, envelope) charges beats but does not drive the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bearing witness and mapping scars—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete on-page consequence tests it. Opening the envelope is framed as defiance, yet no antagonist or cost materializes; the poem's release is emotional summary, not a visible trade-off. The storm and timer supply texture but do not escalate pressure or narrow options. The ending declares purpose without an earned turn or felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cartography-of-scars motif recurs (clouds as ink, scars as maps, poem as guide) and attempts thematic resonance, but the final image—"scars would remain, and he would tell their stories"—states the theme rather than embodying it in a non-literal action. The envelope's opening and the timer's click offer small particulars, yet the piece leans toward allegory (censorship, storms, maps) without grounding abstraction in a specific, embodied cost. Subtext operates in the storm and sealed poem, lifting the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping, and diction ("furiously tranquil," "rarefy," "liminal space") aspires to a poetic register. However, the voice shifts between lyric elevation ("storm-kissed wonder") and expository summary ("his motivation burned clear") without a character-specific perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he mused," "he wondered") cluster in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as authored rather than filtered through the poet's distinct idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "scars… a map" / "scars were not so different—maps survival etches"; "cartography of scars" recurs four times without added pressure. Template cadence: "He felt… he mused… he wondered… he smiled" across consecutive beats (−0.5). Register drift into elevated diction ("rarefy," "liminal," "cartography") clashes with the urgency of the vigil (−0.4). Stock metaphors ("clouds like ink," "wound reopening") and filter-verb stacks in high-reflection beats dull line-level momentum (−0.3). Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The censored-poet-in-observatory premise and storm-as-metaphor-for-turmoil are familiar templates executed without fresh transformation. The cartography-of-scars conceit recurs but never acquires non-obvious specificity; the poet's descent and promise to "tell their stories, one verse at a time" resolves into generic artistic commitment. The darkroom timer and bus timetable offer quirky particulars, yet their integration feels checklist-driven rather than inevitable. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The censored poet is named and his goal stated early (setup ✓). He opens the envelope (middle beat ✓) and decides to descend (closure presence ✓). However, his choices are asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost; the envelope-opening and departure do not narrow options or transform tactics on the page. The character observes and reflects more than he acts under pressure. Score: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The darkroom timer appears early on the stone table, ticks through the vigil (two beats ✓), and clicks off at the vigil's end (closure mention ✓). Yet its function as a "marker of darkness" is metaphorical only; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Its click coincides with the poet's release but does not cause or complicate it. Score: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "vigil in pause" frames the opening and the timer marks its end (setup and closure ✓). The poet waits for the vigil to end, but the pause itself does not shape on-page stakes or tactics; it functions as atmospheric framing. The vigil's conclusion is timed by the clock, not tested by choice. Score: 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is named once ("He felt furiously tranquil") and echoed at the end ("furiously tranquil, and stepped away"). No on-page action embodies the contradiction or trades one pole against the other; it remains a label without cost. Score: 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Rarefy" appears once in mid-reflection: "a pause… where truths could rarefy, distill into their purest form." It describes the observatory's function but does not drive a turn or constrain a choice. The poet's actions (opening envelope, descending) are independent of rarefaction. Swappable with "clarify" or "crystallize." Score: 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The sealed envelope wedged in the bus timetable is introduced early (setup ✓), handled when the poet slides it open (middle beat ✓), and its poem lightens his pocket at closure (payoff ✓). The timetable supplies thematic texture ("routes abandoned, stories untold") but does not mechanically shape the poet's tactics. The envelope's opening is the story's hinge; the timetable itself is ornamental. Score: 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is anchored early (setup ✓), supplies the dome's glass and stone table for mid-scene beats (development ✓), and frames the poet's descent at closure (payoff ✓). The storm and elevation charge atmosphere and the final image ("clouds closed in again"), but the setting does not force a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The micro-setting (body, timer, envelope) does more causal work than the observatory itself. Score: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"When masks slip" is invoked once in reflection ("It was when masks slip… that the true face of power reveals itself") but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The vigil's end is marked by the timer, not by a slipping mask. The timeframe remains abstract. Score: 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the cartography of scars" is stated early (setup ✓), echoed in the cloud-and-scar reflection (middle ✓), and declared fulfilled at closure ("each scar a star in the constellation of his art"). Yet the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicting on-page choices; no friction between want and cost appears. Score: 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" is named once and approximated in descriptions of lightning, clouds, and awe. The tone holds lyric elevation throughout and modulates slightly at closure (from vigil to departure). However, the tone does not tighten under pressure or charge the final image with undeniable force; it remains atmospheric. Score: 5.1.</comment>
