<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in her unique gift, but interiority leans heavily on atmospheric description rather than embodied contradiction. The final satisfaction ("pensive mirth... quiet satisfaction") feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle—she succeeds without meaningful resistance. Micro-choices are present (sitting, tracing, beginning the ritual) but lack visceral cost or risk that would elevate the ending's renunciation. The protagonist's competence is unbalanced by genuine struggle; no mistake compounds before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density and the resurrection of the orchard, then recedes in a mirrored fade. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elara accepts the transience of her vision—but the cost is asserted ("purpose fulfilled") rather than dramatized with a forfeited option or visible price. Orientation anchors early (ruined orchard, fog, Elara's role). The single tightening (light ritual) deepens texture but does not narrow options or force a trade-off, limiting closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ruined orchard and fresco fragment anchor setting vividly, and sensory detail is purposeful (fog, moss, skeletal trees, "tiny ghosts" of breath). The fragment functions as a recurring object that charges the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains a stage for Elara's unchallenged gift. Spatial choreography is clean; tone supports the concept. The fragment's warmth at the end is a micro-constraint on meaning but does not reshape options under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscover lost joy) is signaled early, and the light-ritual beat constitutes one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, escalation is absent—Elara's process unfolds without complication, reversal, or visible cost. The waning energy is mentioned ("her energy waned") but does not force a trade-off or foreclose a path. The resolution is a successful display followed by a satisfied exit; no price alters later tactics or charges the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (memory, transience, resurrection through art) emerges from particulars and avoids overt moralizing. The fragment's image ("child's upturned face") and the final tucking-away gesture create a resonant closing note. However, the ending asserts thematic resolution ("even things lost... can be brought back into the light") in near-prompt language rather than letting the image speak. Subtext operates in gesture (tracing, tucking) but the protagonist's internal arc lacks friction—no ambiguity or trade-off sharpens the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled diction ("pensive mirth," "conduits for feeling") that remains consistent. POV is stable single-third; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is strong (artist's eye, chemical metaphor). However, at peak stress the prose does not compress or shift rhythm—syntax remains uniform and elevated even during the light-waning moment. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("she imagined," "she saw") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy here.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, mild scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "Her smile was one of pensive mirth; the process was always a gamble" closely echoes the earlier descriptor, and "pensive mirth" recurs three times without charged reweighting. Figurative language is dense ("exposed film," "chemical emulsions," "conduits for feeling") but remains coherent. Register is elevated and consistent. No major clarity breaks, but the final paragraph over-explains ("a reminder that even things lost...") where image alone would suffice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "paints with light" gift and fresco-memory mechanic offer a fresh synthesis, and the accumulative structure (resurrection then fade) fits the theme. However, the core premise (artist resurrects lost joy through magical talent) lacks friction or moral calculus—Elara's gift works smoothly, and the orchard's transience imposes no on-page cost. The ending recedes to a safe middle: satisfied departure with no renunciation or bold risk. Transformation test: swap "light" for "music" or "words" and the emotional arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (sitting, ritual, tucking fragment) create the narrative spine. However, her decisions do not alter tactics or face resistance—she succeeds without complication. Present in closure (tucking fragment, satisfied exit) but the final act is consequence, not active choice that redefines options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fresco fragment appears early (setup), is handled in multiple beats (half-buried discovery, lap placement, tracing, final tucking), and its warmth reweights meaning at the end ("its purpose fulfilled"). It enables the ritual and charges the closure image. Strong integration, though the fragment does not constrain a choice under pressure—it functions as a key rather than a cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "exposed film" metaphor appears once ("she imagined the fragment not as rock and pigment, but as exposed film, its chemical emulsions holding latent images"). It colors her internal process but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page—removing it would leave the light-ritual mechanic unchanged. Present as theme echo, not structural driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is signaled early, demonstrated in the ritual (light from fingertips, resurrection sequence), and present at closure (light dances out). It enables the central action but imposes no visible cost—her energy wanes briefly without altering tactics or forfeiting an option. The trait is causal across two beats (ritual, fade) but lacks a felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Display" drives the ritual beat (scene "began to display itself") and the ending references the display's conclusion ("light show flickered," "last mote of light"). The action is causally central and shapes two beats (resurrection, fade). However, swapping "display" for "project" or "reveal" would not alter structure. Strong presence, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "internal knowledge network" is mentioned once ("her internal knowledge network firing... a vast web of artistic history, chemical theory, and intuitive leaps"). It colors her interiority but does not shape on-page choices or outcomes—its mechanics remain abstract. Functional label, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district frames every beat (skeletal trees, collapsed cottages, fog) and the resurrected orchard is the visual climax. Present in closure (trees return to skeletal, fog swirls). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it functions as stage and subject. Strong atmospheric integration, limited tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" appears in the opening sentence and is referenced at the end ("Her daydream was over"). The timeframe is asserted but not tracked or used to tighten decisions—no live clock, no urgency. Ornamental framing device without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To rediscover lost joy" is stated early ("her motivation, sharp and tender as a splinter") and the ending claims fulfillment ("She had touched the lost joy she sought"). The motivation drives the ritual beat and is present at closure. However, it is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no friction between want and cost. Functional stake, limited on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Pensive mirth" recurs three times (opening air description, Elara's smile, final satisfaction), creating a tonal through-line. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (bittersweet → gamble → quiet satisfaction). However, the mood remains static across beats—no pressure-driven shift charges the final image. Purposeful but repetitive rather than escalating.</comment>
