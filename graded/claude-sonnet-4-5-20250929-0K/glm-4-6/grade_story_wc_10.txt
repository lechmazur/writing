<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and consistent—she wants to translate silence into music—but her internal experience remains abstract. The piece tells us she "had lost so much" and that "her motivation burned as brightly," yet we never see contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The final moment feels declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure; the scanner "displayed a cascade of colors" and she simply closes the case, with the emotional arc summarized ("her heart full, her purpose clear") rather than dramatized through embodied tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (who, where, when) within the first paragraph and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the protagonist works through multiple tuning forks, thermal patterns accumulate, and the final scanner display offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the experiment succeeds and silence is "rectified." However, the cost remains asserted rather than legible on the page—"her hands trembling with the weight of discovery" and "her heart full" are labels, not visible forfeitures or altered options. The closure lands, but the felt price is thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vividly established with specific details (frost-kissed panes, orchids under glass, thermal scanner) and the setting does constrain choice: the protagonist selects the conservatory as her sanctuary, and the plants serve as her test subjects. The tuning fork case and scanner function as micro-setting elements that shape her method. The spatial choreography is clear, though the conservatory itself remains more backdrop than active pressure; it provides resources but does not force tactical adjustments in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early—rectifying silence into music—and the piece shows one meaningful tightening when the thermal scanner finally "displayed a cascade of colors, a symphony of warmth that pulsed in time with the vibrations." However, this tightening arrives without visible cost or trade-off; the protagonist works "for hours" without encountering a substantive obstacle or forced choice that narrows options. The resolution feels convenient rather than earned by prior struggle; no live option is foreclosed, and the protagonist's agency consists of persistence rather than a high-stakes decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of translating silence into music emerges from the protagonist's experiment, and the final image—"The world had taken her hearing, but she had given it a new song"—attempts a resonant closure. Yet the piece repeatedly states its theme rather than letting it arise from particulars: "to translate silence into music," "rectified the emptiness," "filled it with the music of survival." The ending paragraph becomes a thematic summary ("And in the end, that was all that mattered") rather than a non-literal answer. The unshaken marvels recur but function as ornamental symbols rather than images that constrain choice or charge the closure with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prose establishes a distinct texture through phrases like "phantom symphony of chaos," "winterglass conservatory," and "unshaken marvels." However, the narration frequently slips into elevated register that feels imposed rather than filtered through the protagonist's mind: "The tyranny of nothingness," "a chorus of unshaken marvels joining in her experiment," and "her purpose clear" read as authorial commentary. The single line of dialogue ("If you can feel warmth, you can feel song") is voice-appropriate but isolated. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—observations are lyrical but not distinctly hers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The prose carries significant scaffold and paraphrase loops: "The capsize survivor" opens eight sentences, creating template cadence; "unshaken marvels" recurs five times without functional variance; "tuning fork case" appears in four separate beats, often restating its presence without advancing pressure. Sentences frequently paraphrase: "She had done it—transformed silence into a form of music, a language of heat and harmony" immediately follows the scanner display, adding no new information. The final third stacks summary statements ("her heart full, her purpose clear," "that was all that mattered") that dull the closure image. Mixed metaphors appear: "clung to like a life raft in the aftermath of the flood" conflates shipwreck with flood. These artifacts pervade the ending, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—a deaf survivor using thermal scans to translate emotion into sound—offers a fresh synthesis, and the winterglass conservatory provides a specific setting. However, the emotional arc and resolution follow a template: solitary protagonist overcomes loss through unconventional method, succeeds after patient effort, and closes with a declaration of resilience. The piece does not transform this frame through non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail; the protagonist encounters no substantive obstacle, and the final image (sun setting in "hues of orange and gold," night "would not be silent—not anymore") leans on stock uplift. The thermal-mapping method is mentioned but not developed with verifiable specificity; we see colors on a scanner but not the mechanics or constraints that would make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The capsize survivor is present throughout and her past trauma frames the story, but her choices on the page are minimal: she selects tuning forks, strikes them, and observes the scanner. The key turn—the scanner displaying a cascade of colors—occurs without a decision that alters tactics; she simply persists until success arrives. She appears in the setup, middle, and ending, satisfying two gates, but her agency does not drive causal pressure or constrain options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tuning fork case appears in setup ("Clutched in her hand"), development ("clicked open, revealing its polished contents"), and closure ("closed her tuning fork case, her hands trembling"). It enables the method by housing the calibrated forks, and its closure at the end mirrors the protagonist's sense of completion. However, the case itself is a container; the forks do the causal work. The case's presence is consistent but its specific properties do not constrain choice or shift meaning—any container would serve the same function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" recurs five times, always referring to the orchids or plants in the conservatory. The phrase is present in setup, middle, and ending, but it functions as a descriptor rather than shaping stakes or tactics. The protagonist treats the plants as test subjects for vibrations, but their status as "unshaken" (resilient, thriving) does not alter her method or create friction. The concept remains thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" appears twice: once describing the protagonist's gestures ("her gestures silently expressive") and once her tear ("A tear traced her cheek, silently expressive of both grief and wonder"). The trait is label-only; it does not constrain action or enable a choice with visible cost. Her deafness shapes the premise, but "silently expressive" itself is ornamental—removing the phrase would not alter any beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Rectify" appears three times, framing the protagonist's goal: "determined to rectify its absence," "to rectify the silence into a language," and "She had rectified the emptiness." The action is stated but not dramatized through a key turn; she works steadily until success arrives. The verb is thematically consistent but could be swapped for "restore," "translate," or "transform" with minor edits. It does not shape the method or impose a unique cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions via thermal scans is signaled early ("heat-mapping emotions, using thermal scans to translate the warmth of memories into sound") and reappears in the middle beat when the scanner "displayed patterns of red and blue as it mapped the flowers' thermal signatures." At closure, the scanner "displayed a cascade of colors, a symphony of warmth." The method is present in setup, development, and ending, and it enables the final success. However, its mechanics remain vague—how does warmth become sound?—and the method does not impose constraints or force tactical adjustments; the protagonist simply applies it until it works.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is established in the opening line and recurs throughout: "her sanctuary," "this winterglass conservatory," "glass-walled haven," "her stage." It provides the plants that serve as test subjects and the controlled environment for the experiment. The setting appears in setup, middle, and ending, and it enables the protagonist's method. However, the conservatory does not constrain choice or create friction; any greenhouse with plants would serve. The glass and frost imagery charge the atmosphere but do not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After noise becomes impossible" is mentioned in the second sentence ("after noise became impossible, silence reigned") and implied throughout by the protagonist's deafness. However, the timeframe is static—there is no live clock or tightening deadline. The protagonist works "for hours" without time pressure altering her choices. The phrase frames the premise but does not shape escalation or tactics; it functions as backstory context rather than an active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate silence into music" is stated early and drives the protagonist's actions throughout: she selects tuning forks, strikes them, and monitors the thermal scanner. It appears in setup, development, and ending, and the final success ("transformed silence into a form of music") directly fulfills it. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses; we never see friction between her want and competing costs or fears. The motivation is consistent but not charged with visible trade-offs.</comment>
