<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dealer shows internal texture through their work with the blotter petal and the shift from subsuming to amplifying emotions, but the transformation feels more asserted than dramatically earned. The chemist's "fierce, quiet determination to heal" arrives without sufficient prior setup, making the dealer's pivot feel prompted rather than character-driven. Interiority relies on abstract concepts ("affectionate detachment," "professionally thorough") that remain label-only without embodied contradiction under pressure. The final smile and shift in methodology read as clean epiphany rather than costly choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is functional but drifts: "amber grotto at dusk" anchors setting, but the relationship between dealer and chemist (client left hours ago yet dealer communes with residual grief) creates unclear spatial and temporal logic. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—dealer shifts from subsuming to amplifying—but the decision lacks visible cost; the "quiet satisfaction" and warmer grotto suggest reward rather than foreclosure. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (static electricity, blotter petal, amber light recur), yet the final tightening comes from an unmotivated internal shift rather than pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The amber grotto at dusk provides consistent atmospheric anchoring with recurring sensory detail (thickening light, shimmering walls, static electricity). However, the setting remains largely decorative; spatial choreography is vague (polished stone table, walls that close in and then feel warmer) without constraining the dealer's choices. The blotter petal functions more as symbolic object than spatial element. The grotto shifts from workplace to sanctuary via assertion rather than through environmental pressure that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to subsume or amplify the chemist's emotion—is signaled but arrives late (final third). The dealer's initial motivation ("to fuse insight with empathy, even if the empathy was borrowed") never faces on-page friction; the shift to amplifying occurs without visible trade-off or cost to their business model. The chemist's absence throughout the scene means all pressure is internal reflection rather than situational complication. No meaningful tightening narrows options; the dealer simply decides differently without foreclosing a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of authenticity versus counterfeit emerges through the dealer's craft, and the blotter petal's shift from sorrow to possibility offers a concrete image. However, the ending states its thesis overtly: "even counterfeit emotions could become real," "carry the seeds of truth"—thematic echo that replaces earned resonance. The chemist's "gratitude miles away" and the dealer's "quiet satisfaction" resolve complexity into tidy affirmation. The half-truths motif is declared more than dramatized; no resistant counter-reading complicates the moral arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on the dealer with controlled distance. Voice carries some texture ("delicate dance of half truths," "dry, brittle thing, like old parchment") but drifts into generic elevated register during key moments ("communion with their craft," "bridge between brokenness and wholeness"). Perceptual signature is present in the static-electricity sensing but underused; most observations are declarative rather than filtered through the dealer's professional lens. Free indirect style is clean, though peak beats rely on summary rather than immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "The amber grotto at dusk" opens three separate beats; "professionally thorough" and "sensing through the static electricity" recur as label reminders rather than varied dramatization. The transformation "completed" appears at story open, midpoint, and close without clear differentiation. Figurative language is frequent but often mixed: light "thickening like honey" pairs awkwardly with walls that "shimmer" and later "close in" then "wrap around them like a blanket." Stock phrases cluster in emotional beats: "fierce, quiet determination," "quiet act of communion," "quiet satisfaction."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The counterfeit-emotion-dealer premise offers surface novelty but executes through familiar beats: morally ambiguous merchant meets noble client and experiences redemptive shift. The fragrance-chemist detail and static-electricity method provide texture but remain ornamental rather than shaping the choice architecture. The transformation from subsuming to amplifying emotions follows a predictable redemptive arc without resistant friction or cost. Specific details (blotter petal, discontinued perfume) add color but could swap for other memory-holder objects without altering the emotional trajectory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dealer appears in all beats and makes the key choice to amplify rather than subsume, satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, the decision lacks visible cost or trade-off—no lost income, professional risk, or sacrifice dramatized on the page. The shift reads as moral clarity rather than difficult renunciation. Present across structure but causally soft at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Blotter petal is handled in multiple beats: picked up from table, held during sensing work, set down during the pivot, slipped into pocket at close. Returns with reweighted meaning (sorrow → possibility) and charges the final image. However, its mechanics (how it holds memory, why frilled edge matters) remain vague, and the chemist's determination is discovered rather than earned through prior petal interaction. Strong lyric reprise but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Half truths" are declared as the dealer's signature method and appear in exposition ("not grief, but the memory of salt"; "close enough to truth to satisfy"), but the concept does not constrain on-page choices. The dealer's shift involves amplifying hope rather than crafting a new half-truth, so the core concept is sidestepped at closure. Thematic presence without tactical shaping; mid-low integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Professionally thorough" is used as a label three times but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. The dealer performs their work carefully, but thoroughness does not create friction (e.g., missing a quick shortcut, over-analyzing and delaying). The trait functions as character summary rather than tactical pressure. Mentioned but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Subsume" is the dealer's established method and the story's central tension pivots on choosing not to subsume. Setup and development are present (dealer prepares to subsume, feels the chemist's grief settle into their chest), and the refusal shapes closure. However, the act of subsuming itself is never shown on the page—only its anticipation and avoidance—so the action is more conceptual than dramatized. Causal role is clear but execution is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Static electricity is mentioned in opening, midpoint ("sensing through the static electricity"), and near close ("static electricity softened"). Mechanics are vague; it signals longing and the charge intensifies with emotion, but the method does not shape the dealer's tactical choices—no moment where interference, loss of signal, or overload complicates the work. Present as atmospheric device without problem-solving role; functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Amber grotto at dusk appears in opening and closing lines and recurs throughout as atmospheric anchor. The light "thickening," walls "shimmering" and later "closing in" then "warmer" track emotional progression, and the final image ("no longer just a workplace, but a sanctuary") reweights the space. However, the setting does not constrain the dealer's choices—no spatial limit, resource, or environmental pressure alters tactics. Lyric reprise with thematic charge but minimal causal force.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"As the transformation completed" appears at story open, suggesting the timeframe brackets the action, but the phrase recurs at midpoint and close without clear differentiation. The chemist "left hours ago," so live time pressure is absent; the dealer works at leisure. No clock or deadline tightens decisions. The transformation is an ongoing state rather than a ticking constraint; time is vague and does not alter moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation is declared early ("to fuse insight with empathy") and the dealer's final shift embodies the fusion by amplifying hope rather than just selling product. However, the desire is not dramatized through conflicting choices or on-page friction—no scene where empathy costs the dealer a sale or insight alienates a client. The motivation is told and then fulfilled without visible struggle. Setup and payoff present; development weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is declared early ("as if cradling a stranger's child") and modulates at closure when the dealer smiles with "genuine expression" and the tone shifts to sanctuary warmth. However, throughout the middle beats the tone is more earnest reflection than detached; the dealer's internal monologue is emotionally engaged rather than professionally distanced. Tone stated at start and purposefully broken at end, but the middle does not sustain the detachment, weakening coherence.</comment>
