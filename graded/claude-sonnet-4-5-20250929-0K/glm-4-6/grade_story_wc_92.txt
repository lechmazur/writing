<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena's sentinel role is established but her interior life remains thin—she observes coded messages and makes decisions, yet emotional embodiment is largely absent. The final choice to join the revolution lacks earned contradiction; we never see her wrestle with conflicting loyalties in scene, only a summary statement that "loyalty lay with the commanders or with the truth." The bronze quill holder functions as a plot key but never constrains a micro-choice or reveals character under pressure. Secondary characters appear only at the end as exposition vehicles, applying no relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal but linkage is weak: Elena decodes messages, follows a trail, and descends—each beat advances via convenient discovery rather than because/therefore pressure. Orientation anchors (Elena, luminous fort courtyard, twilight blackout) arrive early. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the blackout reframed as transformation, not attack) but cost is absent—Elena nods and accepts the engineers' claim with no visible price, forfeited path, or embodied friction. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) is waived; the Cost proof test fails (no sentence shows Elena paying a price at closure), triggering −0.6 in Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The luminous fort, twilight emergency torches, and glow-stone technology provide vivid anchors. The bronze quill holder's "cool metal" and the half-painted sundial's "coded angles" are handled on the page. Spatial choreography (courtyard → eastern wall → hidden panel → circular chamber) tracks cleanly. The cradle of sparks as micro-setting charges the final image, lifting the score above mid-band despite some reliance on visual catalogs (e.g., "pulsing stones") that could deepen with scent, sound, or tactile resistance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protect the fort or join the revolution—is signaled early but never tightens into a meaningful trade-off. Elena deciphers, follows, and descends without facing a single on-page obstacle or cost; the engineers simply explain the plot when she arrives. No reversal or deepening narrows options; coincidental access (the hidden panel, unguarded passage, engineers waiting) replaces protagonist agency. The final "decision" is a summary nod, not a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of silent revolution versus corruption emerges through the coded sundial and cradle-of-sparks imagery. The final engineer's line ("we spark a silent revolution that returns light to everyone") states the thesis rather than allowing the scene to embody it, and the bronze quill holder's symbolic recurrence (family heirloom → key → defensive hold) remains ornamental rather than reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in Elena's cautious descent but the ending explains rather than resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—"her sentinel instincts alert," "calmly inventive mind raced"—without character-specific idiom. The dialogue at closure ("You received our messages then") is functional but flat, carrying no subtext or goal pursuit. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("winking hush of the twilight courtyard") that clashes with the tactical urgency. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "considered") stack in high-pressure beats without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "Elena had always been calmly inventive" / "Elena's calmly inventive mind raced"; "the bronze quill holder...felt cool" / "the bronze quill holder...its cool metal"; "the blackout was no accident" / "the blackout was intentionally triggered." Template cadence dominates mid-story ("Elena approached cautiously...Elena discovered...Elena had always felt...Elena paused"). Stock metaphors ("cradle of sparks," "winking hush") appear without transformation. Sentence openings repeat stems across adjacent lines. Aggregate artifact penalty: −1.4 in Q7; artifacts appear in final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise—loyal sentinel uncovers corruption via coded artifact—follows a familiar template without fresh inflection. The bronze quill holder as heirloom + puzzle key, the half-painted sundial, and the "cradle of sparks" feel assembled rather than inevitable. The engineers' waiting explanation at the end replaces discovery with exposition. No turn arises from Elena's specific traits or prior choices; the plot could unfold identically with a different protagonist and minor prop swaps.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elena is identified as "vigilant lock sentinel" in the opening line and her role gates access to the hidden panel, but her sentinel skills never constrain a choice or create a trade-off. She observes, decodes, and follows—decisions that any curious character could make. The role is present across beats but swappable; remove "sentinel" and substitute "engineer" or "scribe" with negligible edits. Caps: introduced early (no late penalty), but replaceable (cap 3.8) and no specific cost tied to the role (disqualifies ≥7.0).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder appears in four beats: retrieved from pouch (observational), clutched while approaching sundial, aligned with sundial to decode messages (functional), placed into wall recess to open passage (causal key). It shapes two middle turns (decoding, unlocking) and appears at closure ("still held defensively") but without reweighted meaning—it remains a static tool. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure cameo +0.2; swappability (any heirloom key) −0.5, ornamental reprise −0.3. Band: 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"The cradle of sparks" is named in paragraph ~40% as Elena's historical memory, reappears as the coded sundial's target, and becomes the literal chamber at closure where engineers manipulate the core stone. It frames the final setting and justifies the engineers' presence, but never alters Elena's tactics—she follows the trail without obstacle. Late first appearance (past 40% mark) caps at 4.6; present in setup (memory), middle (sundial target), and payoff (chamber); functional but does not narrow options or impose cost. Band: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is declared twice as a summary trait ("Elena had always been calmly inventive" / "Elena's calmly inventive mind raced") but never demonstrated through a specific on-page action with cost. No scene shows her improvising under pressure or trading caution for invention. Label-only mentions (−0.6), no beat involvement, no causal pressure, no closure linkage. Band: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Intrigue" is whispered as Elena deciphers the first coded message, naming the action that drives the middle sequence: following secret meetings, uncovering corruption, approaching the forbidden chamber. It appears early (~25%), shapes two beats (decoding, descent decision), and justifies the final confrontation. The action itself is generic (investigate conspiracy) and could be swapped for "espionage" or "surveillance" with negligible impact. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, closure link +0.4; swappability −0.6. Band: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The half-painted sundial is introduced early (paragraph ~15%), its coded angles guide Elena's decoding (middle beat), and the memory of those angles persists as she descends ("the coded angles from the sundial still fresh in her mind"). The mechanics matter: aligning the quill holder with specific angles unlocks the messages. It participates in setup, middle choice, and closure (mental anchor). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, specificity +0.4; no closure image payoff −0.4, method explained rather than shown −0.3. Band: 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight is anchored in the opening line and sustained: emergency torches create dim light that reveals the sundial's angles, the blackout disrupts patrols (enabling Elena's movement), twilight deepening pressures timing. The setting enables two tactical choices (visibility for decoding, disrupted patrols for stealth) and the pulsing stones in the final chamber echo the fort's glow-stone core. Setup present, middle choices constrained, closure setting active. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure link +0.9; postcard description in places −0.4. Band: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The blackout is named in the opening and recurs as context (disrupted patrols, emergency torches, engineers' plot trigger), framing the story's present. It enables Elena's movement and justifies the engineers' access, but never tightens a decision—no countdown, no risk of power returning mid-descent, no visible time pressure at closure. Present across beats but passive. Early signal +0.5, three mentions +0.6, enables tactics +0.5; no live clock or escalating urgency −0.8, summary-only at closure −0.4. Band: 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To spark a silent revolution" is named explicitly in the final engineer's dialogue, not demonstrated through Elena's prior choices. Her motivation reads as duty (protect the fort) until the summary decision ("the revolution might be necessary after all") substitutes for dramatized conflict. The phrase "silent revolution" recurs but remains abstract—no friction between revolutionary desire and cost, no on-page trade-off. Late explicit naming (final paragraph) −0.8, told rather than shown −0.7, no middle choice driven by this want −0.5; closure mention +0.3. Band: 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Winking hush" appears once as a descriptor ("the winking hush of the twilight courtyard") in paragraph ~50%, labeling the atmosphere without modulating through turns. The tone remains static—cautious observation throughout—with no cadence shift at closure to charge the final image. The phrase itself is ornamental, neither taught as a pattern nor paid off. Single mention (−0.6), ornamental (−0.7), no closure charge (−0.8); present but inert. Band: 3.6.</comment>
