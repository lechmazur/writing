<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her trait ("orderly intuitive") receives mention, but her internal conflict remains largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The dual allegiance is stated early but never forces a painful on-page choice where she must sacrifice one value for another. Emotions are mostly summarized ("hope waver") rather than embodied through perception and physical response. The foundation stone chip functions as a symbolic anchor but doesn't constrain her decisions with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening and tracks a causal sequence (graffiti network → community preparation → negotiation shift). However, the closure—developers showing "genuine curiosity" and negotiations beginning "with unexpected openness"—lands off-page and is told rather than dramatized, weakening the cost visibility. The lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texturing, but the final beat doesn't deliver a decisive on-page change or a felt price; the moonlit chip moment is contemplative recurrence without new friction. Privatization's threat drives setup but the resolution lacks an enacted turn or renunciation with legible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The floating carnival is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (neon, glow paint, artificial snow) and the raft structure pressures choices through spatial choreography. The foundation stone chip as micro-object recurs and charges the final image with moonlight texture. However, the setting often serves as backdrop rather than active constraint—the developers' barges arrive but don't force tactical shifts tied to specific raft geography or carnivalesque infrastructure in the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserve carnival culture against privatization) is signaled early. The graffiti network constitutes a tightening move, and the solstice performance represents escalation. Yet the key reversal—developers' shift to "unexpected openness"—occurs off-page and is summarized, not dramatized, undercutting agency and visible cost. The protagonist's endurance and coordination efforts matter, but the final negotiation beat lacks on-page friction or a trade-off that forecloses a live option with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (community adaptation vs. soul preservation) emerges from concrete events and the graffiti-as-armor metaphor integrates with action. The solstice performance dramatizes preservation through specific techniques (navigation in acrobatics, founding stories in fire-eating). However, the ending image—chip on windowsill, preparing to paint again—feels contemplative rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer; the "adapt without losing its soul" thesis is stated in the penultimate paragraph, tilting toward summary. The developers' curiosity pivot hints at complexity but isn't explored through their choices on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature includes pattern-spotting ("gossip traveled like current") and carnivalesque idiom ("buoyant," "float through storms"). However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("carnivalesque spirit," "plausible deniability," "living organism") that dilutes immediacy. No dialogue appears. Some filter verbs ("felt her hope waver," "noticed developers watching") are acceptable but cluster in emotional beats, slightly dulling texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong sensory detail. Opening and closing images bookend effectively. However, paraphrase loops appear: "reorganize the scattered pockets of resistance into something coherent" closely echoes "reorganization accelerated" without added pressure; "dual allegiance tore at her" is restated as "dual allegiance evolved" with minimal dramatization between. Template cadence in the graffiti-spread paragraph ("Performers received…mechanics learned…elders found") stacks parallel structures without variation. Stock metaphor "lapping at their borders" and "float through storms" reduce originality. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The floating carnival premise and graffiti-network method offer fresh synthesis. Specific carnivalesque detail (tightropers, fire-eaters, glow paint on walkway undersides) avoids generic backdrop. However, the gentrification-vs.-tradition arc follows a familiar template, and the resolution—developers softened by authentic spectacle—feels predictable without bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus. The foundation stone chip as talisman and the "culture shock absorber" role function but don't transform expectations. Transformation test: the plot's emotional arc could port to other threatened communities with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara as "culture shock absorber" is named early and her coordinating role (painting graffiti, organizing resistance) drives middle beats. However, her choices tend toward execution of an established plan rather than decisions under conflicting pressure that alter tactics. The role is functional but could be swapped for "community organizer" or "cultural liaison" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in three distinct beats: clutched in pocket (setup), signature glyph in graffiti (middle), and windowsill with moonlight (closure). Its "porous surface held salt and sweat of generations" provides tactile specificity. However, it never constrains a choice or imposes cost—Mara doesn't trade it, risk it, or face a decision where possessing it matters. The final reprise reweights it lyrically ("silver veins of possibility") but without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dual allegiance (preservation vs. survival math) is stated early and named again at midpoint ("dual allegiance evolved"). It shapes Mara's motivation but never forces an on-page choice where she must sacrifice one loyalty for the other. The resolution claims synthesis ("weaving them into something resilient") without dramatizing the friction or cost of that weaving in a particular decision.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is labeled once ("Her orderly intuitive nature allowed her to see patterns invisible to others") and demonstrated through pattern-spotting (gossip flow, performer adaptation). However, the trait doesn't constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost—no moment where intuition leads her astray or where imposing order sacrifices spontaneity. The label functions as character color without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reorganize" is signaled early ("reorganize the scattered pockets of resistance") and executed through the graffiti network across 47 rafts, driving the middle sequence. The solstice performance reflects coordinated preservation. However, the privatization outcome hinges on developers' off-page shift rather than a reorganization tactic creating the turn. The action is essential to setup and middle but doesn't redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Graffiti art as encoding method is introduced at the fog-morning beat, detailed with coordinates and "layered meanings for different audiences," and shown spreading across 47 rafts. It structures the middle escalation and the "graffiti had transformed the carnival's aesthetics into armor" at the arrival of developers. However, the method's mechanics don't shape the final negotiation—no moment where a specific encoded message alters the developers' stance on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The perpetual carnival on rafts is anchored early with neon, tightropers, data-miners, and Ferris wheel. The floating structure enables the graffiti network (undersides of walkways, 47 rafts) and the developers' barges "cast long shadows across the vibrant chaos," creating spatial pressure. The solstice performance uses the central platform. The setting is integral to tactics and atmosphere, though it doesn't force a tactical pivot at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Before privatization" is established early and the developers' arrival provides a deadline. The winter solstice anchors the climax with a ceremonial clock. However, time pressure doesn't tighten Mara's decisions—she has "weeks" to spread graffiti, and the solstice performance occurs as planned without a scramble or sacrifice. The timeframe situates stakes but doesn't compress choices with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to navigate gentrification" is named early and her actions (graffiti coordination, artifact storage, solstice preparation) dramatize it across beats. "Hopeful desperation fueling her mission" ties emotion to the goal. However, friction between this desire and other costs (personal risk, community dissent, tactical trade-offs) is told rather than enacted. The motivation drives setup and middle but doesn't crystallize in a conflicted choice at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is named once and modeled through "hope waver" at the developers' arrival and the moonlit "silver veins of possibility" at closure. Tone oscillates appropriately between threat (shadows, lapping waves) and resilience (performers, paint, carnival motion). However, the emotional register stays measured rather than intensifying under pressure; the final beat relaxes into contemplation without charging the image with urgent ambivalence or visible cost of that hope.</comment>
