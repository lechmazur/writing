<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains a functional protagonist but lacks embodied contradiction or internal conflict. Her choices flow smoothly from competence to victory without genuine struggle or cost—she discovers the solution, implements it, and succeeds without visible trade-offs or foreclosed paths. The "cautiously hopeful" attribute appears only as a label in narration rather than constraining decisions. Interiority relies on summary and telling ("she had to interfere") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story lacks on-page closure with felt cost. Elara's plan succeeds off-page during an ellipsis ("working through the night"), and the final paragraphs summarize outcomes rather than dramatizing a decisive moment. The causal chain is linear and unearned: she identifies the problem, devises a solution, and wins without reversal, complication, or visible sacrifice. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but the ending offers no reconfiguration or cost—only distant aftermath and abstract hope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The university radio station and astronomical charts provide functional setting anchors, and the control room is introduced early with selective detail (headphones, dim glow, charts). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara uses the facility without friction, and the subsonic generator appears as a convenient solution rather than a spatially embedded resource. The setting remains backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (stopping cosmic manipulation) is declared but never tested on the page. Elara faces no opposition, resource scarcity, or tactical dilemma—she conceives the plan and executes it in a single ellipsis. The "power plays among university departments" and "community divisions" are told-only background without bearing on her choices. No reversal, tightening, or visible cost appears; coincidence (she happens to have the right technology) solves the problem.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of manipulation versus evidence emerges through the premise but never deepens or complicates. Elara's victory is tidy and unambiguous: the bad signals stop, humanity is saved, no moral trade-off or lingering ambiguity remains. The final paragraph shifts into meta-commentary ("ethereal grit," "celestial silence was victory enough") that asserts meaning rather than earning it through image or action. The cosmic tricksters remain abstract antagonists without thematic friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter (astronomical charts, signal patterns) is character-appropriate for a signal interpreter. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("ethereal grit," "manufactured cosmic suggestions") that feels more thematic assertion than character thought. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Psychic distance stays consistent but generic; Elara's internal texture lacks idiosyncrasy or stress-driven compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean and grammatical but leans heavily on summary and abstraction. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "These patterns contained...formulas and musical sequences" is followed by three claims of what "various factions" saw, all in parallel structure. The climax is told in past-perfect summary ("had programmed," "began losing") rather than immediate scene. Template cadence runs through exposition blocks ("The power plays...intensified," "She had to interfere"). Line-level clarity is adequate, but information density is low—many sentences restate stakes without advancing action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The premise (cosmic tricksters manipulating humanity via signals) is high-concept but executed through familiar beats: lone scientist sees the truth, others misinterpret, she acts alone and wins. The subsonic solution arrives conveniently without prior constraint or cost. The "cautiously hopeful" framing and "ethereal grit" tone feel prompted rather than emergent. No turn surprises or transforms the setup; the arc proceeds linearly from problem to unearned solution.</comment>
