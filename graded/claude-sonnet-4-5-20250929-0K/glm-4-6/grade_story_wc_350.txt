<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is label-heavy ("harmonious choral librarian," "empathetically decisive") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Her motivation to "construct bridges from silos" is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no internal friction appears on the page. The fifteen-year backstory and her nightly ritual are recounted but never tested by a live choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. Emotional states remain static and summarized rather than embodied through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure unit: the story summarizes outcomes (fifteen cooperative agreements, three festivals, a charter) rather than dramatizing a decisive change, renunciation, or final image that reweights prior material with visible cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by early lines, waiving the Orientation Test penalty. Causality is largely expository; the broadcast sequence and farmer responses are told in summary, not shown through because/therefore linkage. The ending reports results rather than landing a moment where options narrow or meaning shifts with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower is vividly described (spiral staircase, celestial dials, star-faced clocks) and anchors the single scene. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's professional lens. However, the environment remains a postcard backdrop; no spatial element constrains a choice or pressures the broadcast action. The cuckoo clock weight and transmission mechanism are handled but do not alter tactics or charge the final image with embodied cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rehabilitating the grain elevator communication network—is signaled early but never tightened or tested on the page. No reversal or deepening choice narrows options; the broadcast proceeds as planned with summarized success. Farmers respond, but their signals arrive off-stage without complication or cost to Elara's tactics. The resolution is told ("fifteen new cooperative agreements") rather than earned through a protagonist decision that forecloses a path with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of community connection and linguistic bridges is articulated directly ("not just in preserving stories, but in catalyzing new ones") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes ("voices—like knowledge—were meant to be shared, not shelved"), replacing scene pressure with thesis statement. The interspersed languages motif is mentioned but not developed through specific friction or a non-obvious moral calculus. No resonant final image reweights prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara. Diction carries some texture ("vigorous tender," "whiskundi") but also slips into elevated register that feels imposed ("catalyzing new ones," "abstract notion materialized"). The single line of Ukrainian dialogue appears without functional subtext or character pressure. Narrative certainty is omniscient in tone, summarizing fifteen years and fifteen counties without interiority that reveals Elara's perceptual signature or selective bias under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops: "Her work to construct bridges...began fifteen years ago" / "Her motivation to construct bridges...had never been merely academic" / "What began as an abstract notion—to construct bridges from silos—had materialized." Synonym churn ("harmonious choral librarian," "empathetically decisive fingers," "vigorous tender quality") stacks modifiers without concrete action. Stock metaphors ("threads of community weaving") and label-only trait mentions ("empathetically decisive") appear in multiple beats. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: −1.2 for loops and template stems across high-frequency beats, plus −0.3 for stock phrasing. Information density is low; many sentences restate the rehabilitation project without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—librarian uses old grain elevator communication network to reconnect farming communities—reads as a template "quirky vocation restores lost tradition" plot without a fresh inflection. The fifteen-language interspersing and astronomical clock tower setting are present but feel ornamental rather than transformative. No bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus; emotional arc could transfer to any restoration project with name changes. The ending's summarized outcomes (cooperative agreements, festivals) replace scene-specific resonance with generic success metrics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara is named early and present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or narrows options. Her broadcast proceeds as planned; summarized responses arrive off-stage. Label-only characterization and no closure-scene agency cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The cuckoo clock weight is introduced early as her "tuning counterweight for three decades," used in calibration mid-scene, and mentioned at dawn return. However, its mechanics do not constrain a choice or shift meaning; it serves as a recurring prop without causal pressure. Functional across beats but swappable with any pendular tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Grain elevator talks are named and described but never dramatized on the page. The broadcast's content and farmer responses are summarized, not shown through scene pressure. The concept frames the project but does not change Elara's options or tactics in this window.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Empathetically decisive" appears as a label in one line ("Her empathetically decisive fingers adjusted...combining technical precision with an almost maternal care") but never constrains an on-page action with visible cost. No tradeoff or friction tied to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Rehabilitate" is named multiple times and contextualizes Elara's fifteen-year effort, but the action itself is told in summary. No on-page rehabilitation beat dramatizes friction or redefines options. Backstory anchor without present-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Interspersing languages is signaled early, demonstrated in the broadcast sequence with one Ukrainian phrase, and named ("whiskundi"). However, the mechanics do not shape on-page attempts or complicate the transmission; it succeeds as planned. Functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower anchors the single scene from the opening spiral staircase through the midnight chime to dawn descent. Its celestial dials and timekeeping mechanisms provide spatial coherence. The tower's restricted archives backstory seeds the project. However, no tower feature constrains Elara's broadcast choice or alters tactics; it remains a vivid container rather than a pressure source.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Under the hush of borrowed starlight" appears in the opening and closing as a lyric frame. Time markers (twilight, midnight chime, three a.m., dawn) are present but do not tighten decisions; the broadcast unfolds on schedule without clock-driven pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"To construct bridges from silos" is stated three times but never dramatized as a conflicted desire. No on-page friction between want and cost; the motivation is told and achieved in summary without testing Elara's hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Vigorous tender" is named twice and colors some description ("her heart beating in the vigorous tender rhythm"). Tone remains stable—celebratory and earnest—but does not modulate with pressure or charge the ending image. Single static mood without tonal shift that reweights the stake.</comment>
