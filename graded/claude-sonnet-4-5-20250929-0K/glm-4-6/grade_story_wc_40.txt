<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scholar's motivation is established early (decode the pattern of growth) and embodied through his interaction with the crystal. His reticence is claimed but not dramatized through genuine internal contradiction—he moves smoothly from hypothesis to experiment to understanding without visible cost or struggle. The "weathered innocence" feels label-only; his choices flow linearly without the friction of competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final acceptance of his role as "final witness" lands as epiphany rather than earned renunciation with foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear by line two. The piece accumulates through crystal-mediated sound memories that deepen the scholar's understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): he grasps his role as witness and claims the crystal with resolve. Cost is conceptual—the shift from analyzer to witness—but the price feels asserted rather than visibly paid through forfeited options on the page. One meaningful deepening is present; the pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is anchored immediately with sensory specificity (chill, fogged glass, suspended hush). The crystal as micro-setting object constrains the scholar's method and charges the final image when he closes his hand around it, feeling its "residual hum." Spatial choreography (window, central table, podium, seat) tracks cleanly. Setting detail reflects POV priority (untouched books, disassembled chandelier) and the environment directly enables his experiment, satisfying the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: decode the pattern of language's death. The crystal experiment provides one meaningful deepening (from hypothesis to understanding via "Growth" and "Silence"). However, the scholar faces no genuine opposition or trade-off; the crystal delivers answers without resistance or cost to his method. Agency at closure is passive reception ("letting the sounds wash over him") rather than a choice that forecloses paths. Under the Accumulative lens, one tightening is sufficient, but visible price is missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the geometry of decay, the "ghost choir" of preserved moments, language's ending as graceful falling away. The crystal testifies through fractured sound rather than data, embodying the shift from analysis to witness. The final understanding avoids moralizing and offers a resonant answer to the central question. However, the scholar's epiphany ("not to analyze or explain, but to be the final witness") edges toward thematic summary rather than fully dramatized insight earned through friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is elevated and consistent ("reticent scholar," "weathered innocence," "sonically reflective"), matching an antiquarian register. Perceptual signature is evident in how he notices book spines, crystal facets, and layered sounds. However, register occasionally drifts into purple ornament ("a tiny cloud in a world," "its heights lost in a suspended hush") that prioritizes texture over clarity under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overwriting in the opening: "the first light finger the spines," "suspended hush, a stillness so profound it seemed to absorb all sound and breath" stacks figurative language without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loop: "this silence he had come to study, this quiet aftermath" restates without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the crystal's discovery paragraph ("It didn't just...it seemed to...to hold"). The closure beat ("Its work was done, its story told") offers clarity, limiting deductions, but density of ornament and loops in the first half trigger −0.6 baseline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise (sonically reflective crystal preserving library sounds after language's end) offers a fresh synthesis of speculative concept and elegiac tone. The scholar-as-witness shift provides a non-obvious angle. However, the execution relies on convenient props (crystal happens to remember sound, experiment succeeds immediately without complication) and the ending's "final witness" role feels familiar rather than transformed. The piece commits to its premise but does not push it into uncomfortable or surprising territory with genuine risk.</comment>
