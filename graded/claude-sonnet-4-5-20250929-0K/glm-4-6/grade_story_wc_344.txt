<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation remains abstract throughout—"rhythm of repair" never crystallizes into a concrete decision with visible cost. Her interior life consists of poetic declarations rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene: "she'd been searching for this moment forever" tells us drive without showing the friction that would make it credible. The closure choice (assembling gears) feels unmotivated because no prior beat established why *this* locksmith would succeed where others failed, or what personal capability she risked. Tears freeze on her lashes as pure sentiment without embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but "frozen library above clouds" and "lunar-eclipse locksmith" remain metaphoric rather than spatial or functional until past the first third. The closure—gears fusing into "a perfect mechanism"—lands as a told outcome rather than a dramatized reversal; no on-page beat shows *how* her assembly differs from mere description of the act. The piece gestures toward Accumulative design (mirrors pulse, fragments dissolve) but the final image ("she felt whole") summarizes emotional cost rather than making it legible through action or renunciation. Cost-proof test fails: no sentence at closure shows what she lost or foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The frozen library supplies vivid atmosphere—crystalline windows, frost-coated walls, icy floor—but remains postcard description that does not constrain choice. The clockmaker's gear assortment sits on a pedestal and the mirrors pulse, yet neither object's spatial position alters her access or tactics. The hall of mirrors "stretched before her" without coherent choreography of distance or movement that would test her approach. Micro-setting allowance applies (gears, mirrors as charged objects) but they do not block or enable a meaningful on-page action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"learn the rhythm of repair"—is declared but never tested by a live obstacle or tightening choice. She works "quickly, her movements precise," yet no beat shows a misstep, a competing demand, or a visible price paid for success. The mirrors shatter and reform, but these are environmental flourishes rather than escalation driven by protagonist agency. The piece offers atmospheric intensification (groaning library, kaleidoscope of images) in place of a causal turn that narrows options or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of repair and fractured time is asserted rather than earned: "fixing herself" and "fractures in her own heart" are stated in near-moralizing terms at closure. The clockmaker's gears recur but function as a thematic token rather than a motif that constrains choice or accumulates pressure. The final image—"she felt whole"—delivers a tidy resolution that flattens the ambiguity the piece gestured toward earlier. No non-literal answer emerges; the text tells us the answer instead of offering a resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register ("driftwood nostalgia," "hauntingly bright") but verges on purple density in peak beats: mirrors "erupted into a kaleidoscope" while she "worked quickly, her movements precise." Perceptual signature is generic—"otherworldly energy," "soft hush"—rather than character-specific. Psychic distance holds stable but does not modulate with pressure; the same ornate diction persists in both reflection and action. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: figurative language in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff ("driftwood nostalgia," "lunar-eclipse locksmith," "hauntingly bright," "vortex," "kaleidoscope"). Paraphrase loops cluster in the second half: "fixing things—it was about fixing herself" and "not just for clocks or eclipses, but for the fractures in her own heart." Template cadence appears in the opening: "The frozen library... was a place... where the shelves were lined... and the air tasted..." Artifacts touch the closure beat ("her sanctuary, her masterpiece, her answer"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—mystical library plus metaphoric repair work—reads as a familiar template (magical workshop, emotional healing through symbolic craft) without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Rhythm of repair" and "fractures in her own heart" are abstracted rather than grounded in particular loss or trade-off. The lunar-eclipse locksmith title offers surface novelty but does not generate fresh stakes; her occupation never constrains or enables a beat. The ending's wholeness feels like median safety rather than a bold, earned synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith is present throughout and performs the central action (assembling gears), satisfying setup and closure gates. However, her choices do not create key turns—she encounters no obstacle that forces a decision altering tactics. Her locksmith identity is mentioned but never used on the page; eclipse knowledge similarly remains ornamental. She observes, works, and succeeds without visible friction. Late-appearance penalty does not apply (present from the opening), but swappability and lack of causal pressure cap the score: another craftsperson could replace her with minor edits. No cost tied specifically to her locksmith skill or eclipse expertise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The clockmaker's gear assortment appears early (pedestal at hall's center), is handled in two beats (she withdraws a small gear, then a larger gear with symbols), and is present at closure (fused into "a single, perfect mechanism"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the gears' specific properties do not constrain her assembly process—no beat shows a gear that resists, requires a trade-off, or alters her approach. The final fusion is told rather than dramatized. Causal pressure is weak: gears could be replaced with another symbolic object without breaking story logic. Lyric reprise (first mention → closure mention) reweights meaning slightly, lifting the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The hall of mirrors is present early and frames the middle action (she moves through it, mirrors pulse and shatter). Setup and development gates met; closure participation is weak (mirrors reform as she leaves, but do not shape her final realization). The concept does not alter her tactics—she reaches the pedestal without navigating reflections as obstacle. Mirrors show her past (father teaching her to pick a lock) but this is backdrop, not a choice-point. Swappability: the hall could be replaced with another symbolic space (labyrinth, vault) without major structural change. Some causal involvement (mirrors pulse as she works) prevents a lower score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Hauntingly bright" is mentioned twice (hall of mirrors "hauntingly bright," final mirrors "hauntingly bright glow now warm") but functions as atmospheric label rather than a trait that constrains or enables action. No on-page beat shows the brightness blinding her to a danger, forcing her to shield her eyes and alter approach, or enabling her to see a hidden detail. The attribute does not involve a tradeoff. Setup and closure gates met (first third and ending), but development gate missed—no middle choice turns on this quality. Label-only use and no cost connection lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Uncap" appears once: "Uncapping her leather pouch, she withdrew a small gear." The action is present and causally enables the gear assembly, satisfying minimal setup. However, it is not returned to or reweighted; the mechanics of uncapping do not matter to later beats. Easily swappable: she could simply "reach into" the pouch with no structural impact. The action does not redefine options or carry a visible cost. Late-first-appearance penalty does not apply (occurs in the first third), but swappability and single-mention use cap the score below mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner" are mentioned in the opening paragraph as backstory that led her to the library. The method is signaled early (setup gate met) but never shown on the page—she does not consult the prophecies, compare symbols on gears to prophecy text, or use them to guide a mid-scene choice. Development and payoff gates missed. The prophecies are ornamental origin rather than a means that shapes attempts. Told-only and no beat involvement keep the score low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds is present throughout, providing vivid sensory detail (frost-coated walls, icy floor, crystalline windows, groaning structure). Setup and closure gates met (anchored early, present at end when "frost began to melt"). However, the setting does not pressure choices—she moves freely, and the cold does not impede her work or force a tactical adjustment. The library supplies atmosphere but not constraint. Micro-setting allowance applies (pedestal, mirrors as spatial elements), yet neither alters her access. Some causal involvement (library groans as mirrors pulse) and closure participation (melting frost as resolution marker) lift the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Under the soft hush of a distant morning" appears in the opening and closing lines, bracketing the story. The timeframe is poetic rather than functional—no on-page beat shows dawn approaching, light changing, or a deadline tightening her choices. Setup and closure gates met, but development gate missed: time does not alter tactics. Vague and untracked: "distant morning" could be hours or minutes, and the elapsed duration never constrains her work. Lyric reprise reweights tone slightly (morning "brightened" at the end), preventing a lower score, but the element remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To learn the rhythm of repair" is stated explicitly in the opening ("She was here to learn the rhythm of repair") and returned to at closure ("She had learned the rhythm of repair"). Setup and payoff gates met. Development is weak: no middle beat dramatizes her *trying* the rhythm and failing, or choosing between two repair approaches with different costs. The motivation is told rather than conflicted in choices—she works "quickly, her movements precise" without friction. Some causal involvement (her work is goal-directed) and closure linkage (final realization) lift the score into low-mid band, but lack of on-page struggle caps it below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Driftwood nostalgia" is named in the opening line and implicitly returned to at closure ("no longer a place of driftwood nostalgia"). Setup and payoff gates met. The tone—wistful, frozen-in-time melancholy—holds through the first half but does not modulate meaningfully with pressure: the prose maintains the same elevated, figurative register whether she is reflecting or assembling gears. Closure participation is present (tone explicitly shifts from nostalgia to warmth) but the shift is told ("now warm") rather than charged through image. Static mood through middle beats caps the score; the final reprise lifts it slightly.</comment>
