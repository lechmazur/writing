<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The bell ringer's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("texture of connection," "weight of absence") rather than embodied contradiction. Motivation remains declarative—told through quasi-philosophical musings—without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses under pressure. The smile described as "powerfully gentle" is a label, not an embodied reaction, and the final stance ("resonance we choose to share") feels like an announced epiphany rather than one earned through dramatized struggle. No visible cost forecloses a path; the journey inward is asserted, not forced by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the bell ringer's realization that "the artificial pilgrimage had revealed itself as a journey inward," but this shift is told rather than shown through a causal turn that narrows options. The lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image—light and sound merging—does not reweight prior material with legible cost; it simply restates the premise. No visible forfeiture or constraint shapes the ending, so the closure reads as thematic declaration rather than a felt reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly anchored with golden shadows, glass shelves, and tuning forks labeled by date. The carbide lamp lens functions as a recurring object that bends light and charges the final image, meeting the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the lab's response (shelves humming, instruments shivering) integrates setting into action. However, the environment does not constrain a choice with cost—it amplifies mood without forcing a tradeoff—which caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to discover the texture of connection") is signaled early but remains abstract. The bell ringer moves through the lab, strikes a tuning fork, and steps into the light—yet none of these actions narrow options or force a tradeoff with visible cost. The lab's harmonic shift and the lens glowing are responses, not obstacles. No live option is foreclosed; the protagonist's agency is observational and declarative ("sound is the key") rather than tested by resistance. One beat of pressure (the question "Why do we only measure what is gone?") gestures toward conflict but does not escalate or deepen through causal linkage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (connection via sound/silence) emerges from recurring images (golden shadows, the lens, vibration) and the bell ringer's questions. The final declaration—"the texture of connection is the resonance we choose to share"—attempts a non-literal answer but tips into overt statement rather than earning resonance through prior particulars. The phrase "artificial pilgrimage" is reweighted at the end ("no longer a search, but a creation"), yet the shift feels asserted rather than paid for by on-page cost. The piece resists tidy morals in the middle beats but delivers a sermonic closing paragraph that flattens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, anchored to the bell ringer's perceptions. Diction leans elevated ("cascade of harmonics," "sanctuary of music reborn") and risks register drift from the character's immediate experience during peak beats. The whispered question and the laugh carry some vocal texture, but much of the interiority reads as thematic narration rather than character-particular thought. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("feeling," "letting") are present but not excessive. The voice is consistent but not distinct enough to feel irreplaceable, and the final lines veer into meta-commentary that obscures the POV's grounded experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching: "memories caught in amber," "dissonant chord," "symphony yet to come." Multiple paraphrase loops appear—"The bell ringer smiled," then "The bell ringer smiled again"; "artificial pilgrimage" is restated across three adjacent lines near the end without new pressure. Template cadence runs: "The bell ringer [verb]" opens numerous sentences. Stock metaphors ("miniature sun," "halo of warmth") and therapy-speak ("emotional aftereffect," "creation") dull immediacy. Cumulative artifact penalty (loops, template stems, stock metaphor strings) totals approximately −1.2, and the presence of artifacts in the closure paragraph triggers the additional penalty, pushing total deduction to −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The premise—bell ringer in a laboratory of lost sounds seeking connection through vibration—offers some freshness in its synthesis of sensory elements. However, the emotional arc (discovery that the journey is inward, not outward) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived specificity. The carbide lens and tuning forks are vivid particulars, but the ending's assertion that "connection is the resonance we choose to share" reads as abstraction that could apply to many stories. No bold structural risk elevates the execution; the piece plays safely within lyric-accumulative norms without a non-obvious turn that redefines prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade>comment>The prism-song bell ringer is present throughout and makes several moves (clutching the lens, striking a tuning fork, stepping into the light circle), but these are observational and declarative rather than choices that alter tactics under opposition. The character's decisions do not create key turns; instead, the environment responds to gestures. No visible cost is tied to the character's agency. Swappable with "seeker" or "pilgrim" without major structural change. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causally passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The miner's carbide lamp lens appears in the opening (pressed to light, refracting spectrum), recurs in the middle (pulsing faintly, turning in hand), and charges the final third (glowing, shining like a miniature sun, dimming after work is done). It bends light to cast a circle the bell ringer steps into, and its transformation (warped → smooth, dim → bright → dim) tracks the narrative arc. However, it does not constrain a choice with cost—it enables and symbolizes rather than forcing a tradeoff. Present across all three gates; lyric reprise reweights meaning. Causal pressure is light; closure linkage is present but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The artificial pilgrimage is named early, recurs in the middle ("What if the pilgrimage is not artificial?"), and is declared resolved at the end ("had ended... had been the first note"). However, it functions as thematic label rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. No choice is constrained by pilgrimage mechanics; the concept is told and reweighted via assertion, not dramatized through resource limits or trade-offs. Swappable with "quest" or "journey" without altering action. Present in setup and ending; no middle development that changes options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" is mentioned twice: once as description of the smile ("a powerfully gentle expression") and once in the final lines ("powerfully gentle"). It functions as a label for tone rather than constraining or enabling an on-page action with cost. No visible tradeoff arises from gentleness limiting force or vice versa. Ornamental; swappable with "calm" or "serene." Setup and ending mention only; no middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Propel" appears explicitly once: "letting the vibration propel them—not forward, but into the resonance of the room." This triggers the lab's response (shelves humming, instruments shivering) and leads to the lens glowing, which charges the ending. The action shapes one key turn (stepping into resonance) and is present at closure. However, it could be swapped for "immerse" or "draw" without breaking logic; the mechanics of propulsion are not specific. Causal role in one major beat; closure linkage present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Questioning assumptions" is signaled early ("What if the pilgrimage is not artificial?") and recurs ("Why do we only measure what is gone?", "Assumptions are the cages we build"). The method appears in setup, middle, and ending, but it does not shape tactics—questions are rhetorical flourishes rather than mechanics that alter choices under opposition. The story tells us this is the method, yet discovery proceeds through gesture (striking the fork, stepping into light) rather than through structured inquiry with cost. Present across all three gates but functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is anchored early (golden shadows, glass shelves, silent instruments, tuning forks) and supplies resources (the tuning fork, the light, the lens placement) that affect action. The lab responds to vibration (walls trembling, shelves humming), which charges the middle and ending. Setting is present in setup, middle, and ending, and its transformation (silent → reawakened) tracks the arc. However, it does not constrain a choice with cost—it amplifies rather than limits. Causal role in two beats; closure linkage strong. Specificity high; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the power grid stabilizes" is mentioned once in the opening and once at the very end ("as the power grid hummed quietly outside"). It frames the premise (loss of electrical hum leaving silence) but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. No clock pressure; time remains vague. The element sets context but does not alter moves. Ornamental; swappable with any post-crisis marker. Setup and ending mention only; no middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of connection" is named early as the goal and recurs throughout ("What is connection?", "the texture of connection is the resonance we choose to share"). The desire drives the bell ringer's moves (examining the lens, striking the fork, stepping into light) and is present at closure. However, the motivation remains abstract and is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No friction between what is wanted and what must be paid. Present in setup, middle, and ending; causal role in shaping attempts, but told rather than shown through trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Golden shadows appear in the opening, recur in the middle ("golden shadows danced," "golden shadows deepened"), and charge the ending ("golden shadows stretched, twisting into new shapes," "golden shadows bowed"). Tone modulates with pressure (deepening as intensity rises, bowing at closure) and remains coherent across beats. The imagery reweights the lab's transformation and supports the final reconfiguration. However, it is not causally indispensable—the arc could function with "amber light" or "warm glow." Present across all three gates; lyric reprise strong; specificity moderate.</comment>
