<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The painter's interiority is developed through concrete sensory detail (trembling hands, stiffening bristles) and the shell as a charged object, but the core motivation to "find something that couldn't be broken" arrives late and feels abstract. The lowering of the shell into the tide pool reads as a deliberate renunciation with cost, but the epiphany that follows—"the shell had never been about preserving the past; it had been about letting it go"—skirts therapy-speak and articulates the arc too cleanly. Internal contradiction is present (keeping vs. releasing) but resolved through narrated insight rather than embodied struggle. The character remains observational through most beats; agency clusters at the cave sequence without prior micro-choices that narrow options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early (painter, quay), but "after the mirror cracks" as timeframe remains vague until retrospective explanation. The wrong turn into the cave network provides a clear spatial transition, and the piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens by midpoint. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the shell's release and the painter's acceptance, with the final image of the cracked mirror reframed as "possibilities." Cost is gestured at ("the weight of that promise lift slightly") but remains diffuse; the specific price paid—what path is foreclosed, what is lost—never lands in a concrete image or action. The "temporary eternity" motif recurs but functions as thematic echo rather than causal constraint. Escalation is more textural deepening than causal tightening, consistent with the inferred lens, but the closure reconfiguration lacks the sharp felt cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The quay, cliffs, and coastal cave network are vividly rendered with phosphorescent moss, tide pools, and sea-to-earth scent shifts. Spatial choreography is coherent through the descent and cave sequence. The tide pool functions as micro-setting that constrains the shell's release and charges the final act, satisfying the 9+ gate test. However, the studio mirror is introduced only in retrospective summary, weakening its presence as a recurring anchor. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the painter's attention (bristles, salt, damp earth), and the cave's "quiet energy" and "droplets like tiny metronomes" avoid generic postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—fulfilling a promise to find something unbreakable—is signaled through backstory but not tested by external pressure or a tightening choice until the cave sequence. The shell's release narrows options (he lets go of preservation), but the act feels self-directed rather than forced by escalating conflict. No antagonist or opposition complicates the painter's path; coincidence (the wrong turn) enables rather than complicates resolution. The accumulative lens allows for deepening rather than causal escalation, and the final act does alter the protagonist's stance, but cost remains abstract ("lighter than they'd been in years") without a visible forfeiture or tradeoff that charges the image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the shell, mirror, and cave as particulars rather than stated thesis, and "temporary eternity" recurs with shifting resonance. However, the final paragraph edges into overt articulation: "it was the promise that had painted him" and "some things aren't meant for canvas; they're meant for memory, fleeting and eternal all at once." The piece resists a tidy moral but still telegraphs its thematic coordinates. The shell's release offers a non-literal answer to the central question of letting go, and the cracked mirror reframed as "possibilities" adds quiet resonance. Subtext operates in the painter's aloofness and the cave's silence, but epiphany language ("he realized") summarizes rather than dramatizes insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. The painter's perceptual signature—focused on light, texture, rhythm—is distinct and color-charged ("hues he'd tried to capture his whole life"). No dialogue appears, so those bullets are N/A. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he realized") cluster in reflective beats but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy in action moments. Diction fits the painter's lexicon without register drift. However, repetitive sentence stems weaken texture: "He'd always been…," "He'd painted…," "He'd spent his life…" create template cadence in the final third. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains clean focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear in adjacent lines: "intimately aloof, even to himself, keeping his thoughts and dreams locked away like treasures in a vault" restates the same idea; "fleeting and eternal all at once" echoes "temporary eternity" without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the final third ("He'd always been…," "He'd painted…," "He'd spent his life…"). Stock metaphors ("spiderweb of fractures," "ink into parchment") cluster without fresh transformation. The closing beat is burdened by these artifacts, applying the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Clarity and momentum are otherwise serviceable, with vivid images (phosphorescent moss, tide pools as "scattered jewels"), but the prose does not achieve high information density or propulsion under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The painter-releases-object-to-let-go-of-past is a familiar template, and the piece does not sufficiently transform it through occupational specificity, world logic, or non-obvious moral calculus. The cave discovery via wrong turn and the mirror-as-fracture metaphor are stock moves. Emotional specificity is present in the shell's painted sunset and the painter's trembling hands, but the arc's shape—lonely artist finds peace through symbolic act—reads derivative. The "temporary eternity" phrase is a clever coinage but does not synthesize into a fresh perspective that redefines prior material. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the design.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The painter is present throughout, makes the key choice to release the shell, and his reflection on the promise shapes the ending. His nostalgic attachment to the quay and decades-long practice frame the opening, and his descent into the cave and final act of letting go drive the closure. Early signal strong; beat involvement spans setup, middle, and ending; causal pressure moderate (the choice alters his internal stance but is not forced by external opposition); closure linkage clear. Swappability low—removing the painter's specific history and the quay setting would hollow the arc. Slight friction: the painter remains observational through much of the middle, with agency clustering late.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The painted seashell is introduced early (paragraph 1), handled in the cave beat (lowered into tide pool), and its "ghost" lingers in the final image. Early signal strong; beat involvement spans setup, cave act, and ending reflection; causal pressure moderate (the act of releasing it precipitates the closure reconfiguration); closure linkage strong (the shell's release is the pivotal act and its "essence remained" charges the final lines). Specificity high—its painted spirals and sunset memory are irreplaceable. Cost connection present but diffuse (letting go of preservation). Minor friction: the shell is more symbolic anchor than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Temporary eternity" is named twice—once in the cave beat ("a temporary eternity carved into stone") and once near the end ("wasn't a contradiction; it was the only kind that mattered"). It functions as thematic echo rather than stake-shaping constraint. No clear early signal; first explicit mention at ~60% mark. Beat involvement limited to two reflective passages; does not narrow options or enable tactics on the page. Closure linkage weak—the phrase recurs but does not transform prior material or charge the final image with new cost. Swappability high; a similar paradox (e.g., "fleeting permanence") could replace it. Ornamental use predominates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Intimately aloof" is mentioned once in the cave beat ("He'd always been intimately aloof, even to himself, keeping his thoughts and dreams locked away") as a label without prior dramatization. No early signal; no middle development; no visible cost tied to the trait on the page. The painter's distance is shown through his solitary practice and internal focus, but the phrase itself does not constrain or enable a choice. Summary-only use; swappable with "guarded" or "solitary" without structural loss. Late label triggers cap at 4.6; ornamental mention and lack of beat involvement push lower.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The reveal—that "the shell had never been about preserving the past; it had been about letting it go"—occurs in the cave beat and precipitates the closure reconfiguration. Late first appearance (~70% mark); no early signal or middle development. Beat involvement limited to the cave sequence and ending reflection. Causal pressure moderate—the realization shifts the painter's stance and enables the release. Closure linkage strong. Swappability moderate—"recognition" or "acceptance" could serve similar function. Cost connection present but told rather than shown. Late arrival and summary-only treatment cap at ~6.0; closure linkage lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The wrong turn is signaled early ("his feet betrayed him—a wrong turn down an alley") and directly enables the cave discovery, which provides the setting for the shell's release and the closure reconfiguration. Early signal strong; beat involvement spans the descent and cave sequence; causal pressure high (without the wrong turn, no cave, no release). Closure linkage strong—the method shapes the ending's charge. Specificity moderate—"wrong turn" is a familiar device, but the alley-to-cliff descent is concretely staged. Slight friction: the turn is passive (feet betray, not an active choice), reducing agency credit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is introduced at ~40% mark, vividly rendered (phosphorescent moss, tide pools, droplets), and provides the setting for the shell's release. Late first appearance triggers cap at 4.6, but strong integration at closure elevates. Beat involvement spans cave discovery and release act; the tide pool as micro-setting constrains the shell's placement and charges the final image. Causal pressure moderate—the cave enables but does not force the choice. Closure linkage strong. Specificity high—phosphorescent moss and "scattered jewels" are irreplaceable details. Late arrival and moderate pressure limit upside, but closure participation and specificity lift above cap guidance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the mirror cracks" is mentioned retrospectively in the cave beat ("the day the mirror had cracked... That was the day he'd made his promise") but does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions. No early signal; the mirror is introduced as backstory summary, not as a present constraint. Beat involvement limited to one reflective passage. No causal pressure—time does not narrow options or alter tactics on the page. Swappability high—any past turning point (e.g., "after his wife left") could anchor the promise. Summary-only use and lack of present-tense pressure keep score low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The hidden promise ("to find something that couldn't be broken, something that would outlast even his own memory") is revealed in the cave beat and drives the closure act. Late first appearance (~50% mark); no early signal. Beat involvement spans cave reflection and ending resolution. Causal pressure moderate—the promise frames the shell's release and the painter's acceptance. Closure linkage strong—the promise's fulfillment "not in perfection, but in acceptance" charges the final lines. Cost connection present (letting go of the unbreakable). Friction: the promise is told rather than shown through prior micro-choices, and its late reveal reduces setup credit. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure lift above late-penalty baseline.</comment>
