<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is established through concrete action (carving) and embodied grief responses, with the calloused hands detail anchoring her transformation. The motivation to carve while processing loss feels genuine, and micro-choices (lifting tools, tracing the mane) reveal hierarchy of values. However, interiority occasionally drifts into therapeutic abstraction ("to re-member, to physically gather what scattered in shock") that reads more conceptual than character-particular. The final renunciation—accepting that love "transforms but does not end"—feels somewhat delivered rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around density increase and pattern reinforcement (rain, rust-hued peace, carving gestures) that reweights the dominant stake of transforming grief into artifact. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the completed carving as both "record and resurrection," with felt cost in the acceptance that memory becomes object. Orientation anchors (loft, workbench, kettle) arrive early and remain stable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the figure "seemed almost alive," crystallizing the paradox. Minor slip: the cost could be more viscerally legible in the final image rather than stated in the closing paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight functions as both atmosphere and recurring constraint, filtering light that makes the carving "seem almost alive" and charging the final image. The workbench micro-setting anchors all action, with ash wood shavings and tool weight providing tactile grounding. The kettle's boil imposes a live time constraint that shapes work rhythm. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (circus smell after rain). The loft's "rust-hued peace" modulates from stated tone to embodied setting detail. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-location scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harvesting lessons from loss through carving—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara moves from shaping wood to recognizing Tomas emerging in "the way he carried himself," forcing confrontation with absence made present. The kettle's whistle creates a measured pressure point. However, escalation relies heavily on accumulation rather than a choice that narrows options with visible tradeoff. The resolution (completed carving) feels inevitable rather than hard-won, with cost more conceptual than dramatized in a decisive beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through grief emerges organically from carving action and the "here and gone" paradox. The lion-tamer/carver parallel (domination vs. understanding) offers fresh thematic texture. However, the final paragraph over-articulates theme: "love transforms but does not end, and the work of hands can make space for heart to heal" states rather than dramatizes the question. The "herbarium of moments, crystallized time" metaphor stack occasionally tips toward announced philosophy. The piece invites reflection but delivers some of its meaning through direct assertion rather than resonant image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elara's perceptual signature (tracing raindrops, feeling grain like life-lines) establishing distinct texture. Voice carries elevated diction ("liminal space," "harvested lessons") that occasionally drifts above immediate embodied perception into philosophical register during high-pressure beats. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during carving, wider during reflection). No dialogue to assess. The prose rhythm supports emotional beats, though some constructions ("hauntingly practical response to loss that surprised everyone") slip into summary telling where scene pressure would sharpen impact.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. However, pattern-taught figurative language appears in most sentences ("autumn rust-hued peace," "soft snow," "life-lines mapping possibilities," "herbarium of moments") without clear escalation, creating a texture that ornaments rather than propels at peak beats. Mild paraphrase loop: "both here and gone" is restated as "was and is" and "record and resurrection." The final paragraph stacks summary statements about theme rather than letting the completed carving image land. No severe clarity breaks, but density of metaphor in reflective mode slows momentum. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative density without pressure payoff and mild loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The widow-as-carver premise offers a fresh angle on grief processing, and the lion-tamer parallel (control through understanding) provides specific texture. However, the core emotional arc—art as healing from loss—follows a familiar template without significant transformation. The "crystallized time" frame and rust-hued peace motifs feel aesthetically purposeful but not structurally indispensable; a similar arc could function with different craft or metaphors. Particulars (ash wood, kettle timer, skylight) ground the piece but don't generate an inevitability that transforms the premise into something non-obvious.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choice to carve while the kettle boils frames the action. Her decision to work "not to forget but to re-member" drives the scene. However, most beats involve observation and reflection rather than choices that alter tactics with cost. The widow identity informs motivation but could be replaced by "grieving partner" without fundamental structural change. Present in closure (signing initials, acknowledging what she's made) but more as narrator than active agent in that final moment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ash wood blank is handled in multiple beats: lifted, shaped, traced, and finally completed. It evolves from "pale and waiting" to containing Tomas's essence, then signed artifact. The material (ash) and its grain ("life-lines") shape micro-choices during carving. Returns with reweighted meaning in the closure image as "both a record and a resurrection." Strong causal role and closure linkage. Minor deduction: the blank itself could be oak or another wood without breaking story logic; the symbolic fit of "ash" (death/resurrection) is apt but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is signaled early (raindrops racing across skylight) and threaded through: Tomas's presence "both here and gone," the "was and is" threshold, and the final carving as paradox artifact. It shapes the central stake (containing what cannot be contained) and charges the ending's emotional logic. However, it functions more as thematic frame than a mechanic that changes on-page options or tactics. Present in closure as conceptual foundation. Would reach higher with a beat where the paradox forces a visible choice rather than remaining interpretive layer.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" is applied once as descriptor ("hauntingly practical response to loss") and once in the closure paragraph ("hauntingly practical in its ability to hold"). It characterizes Elara's approach but doesn't constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. The trait is told rather than dramatized through a moment where practicality conflicts with emotional impulse. Label-only use without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Contain" appears throughout: "to contain not merely his image but the essence," "her method was not to forget but to re-member, to physically gather," and final closure "hauntingly practical in its ability to hold what couldn't be held." The action drives the carving beats and the central paradox. However, "contain" could be replaced with "capture," "preserve," or "hold" without redefining options; the concept matters more than this exact verb. Present in closure and shapes two beats (initial carving, final reflection), but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Crystallized time" is introduced midpoint ("capturing through crystallized time what death could not take") and returns in the final paragraph ("Through crystallized time, she had harvested another lesson"). It names the method but doesn't shape how Elara carves or what choices she makes during the scene. The mechanics (how time is crystallized through carving) remain metaphorical rather than tactical. Present in closure as thematic claim but arrives late and doesn't alter attempts. Lyric resonance between setup and final reprise partially compensates for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is established in the opening line and returns throughout: light filtering through wet glass makes the carving "seem almost alive," rain's rhythm provides atmospheric pressure, and the space's "rust-hued peace" frames emotional tone. The loft as single location constrains action to carving work. Skylight participates in closure (carving "sat in the changing light through the rain-beaded skylight"). Strong setup and closure presence, though the setting affects atmosphere more than tactics. The workbench functions as effective micro-setting; skylight adds texture without altering available moves.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The kettle timeframe is signaled early ("She would work while it boiled, a measured timeframe that disciplined what might otherwise become endless meandering") and creates one beat punctuation (whistle pierces concentration). However, elapsed time remains vague—no sense of urgency or tightening as boil approaches. After the whistle, the clock disappears; "when the kettle cooled" in the closure paragraph is retrospective rather than live pressure. Setup present but middle development weak; closure reference is summary. A live countdown would drive tactics; here it functions as occasional frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To harvest lessons from loss" is named explicitly and drives Elara's choice to carve rather than "dissolve." The motivation shapes the scene's central action and recurs in closure ("harvested another lesson from loss"). However, it's stated more than dramatized through friction—no beat where the desire to learn conflicts with raw grief or costs something tangible. The motivation reads coherent but the harvesting metaphor remains conceptual rather than tested. Present across beats and ending but lacks on-page struggle between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" is established early as Elara's "deliberately cultivated" tone and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("the loft bathed in the rust-hued peace that had sustained her"). Tone modulates subtly: begins calm, tightens during carving focus, breathes during tea break, and resolves into acceptance. Coherent through turns and charges the final image by framing the completed carving in that same sustained peace. The color/mood fusion is specific and consistent. Strong closure linkage; the tone itself becomes artifact of Elara's transformation process.</comment>
