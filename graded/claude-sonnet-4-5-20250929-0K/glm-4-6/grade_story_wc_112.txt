<question>1</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elias remains thinly sketched—his "personal and quiet" motivation to prove sideways time lacks embodied stakes or internal contradiction. The obliging sky mechanic label sits inert; we never see what makes him obliging or how his mechanical expertise conflicts with temporal theory. Dr. Chen is a foil without her own pressure. The piece tells us Elias allows himself "a small smile" but never dramatizes the cost of years spent proving an unorthodox theory or what he sacrifices tonight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal sequence—levers activate the nexus, projections materialize, the third lever triggers insight—but the final "proof" lands as assertion rather than dramatized discovery with visible cost. The closure reads as conceptual repricing (time branches at nexus points), yet no tactical price or foreclosed path appears on the page; Elias simply transmits data and feels satisfied. Escalation is present (three levers, intensifying projections) but the stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The research station, viewport, dome, and habitat provide spatial grounding. The magnetic nexus's "mechanically warm" surfaces recur across beats and charge the final moment, creating micro-setting specificity. The xenobiology specimens (winged creatures from Kepler-186f) anchor the nocturnal timeframe but do not constrain Elias's choices. Sensory detail leans visual (purple glow, holographic auroras); twilight-to-night progression is clear and modulates atmosphere without forcing a clock-driven decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prove time moves sideways—is signaled early and pursued through lever pulls. Yet the escalation is mechanical rather than agonistic: each lever simply intensifies the display without a complicating reversal or visible tradeoff. No resource is spent, no alternate hypothesis ruled out with cost, no relationship strained. The final transmission to Earth occurs effortlessly; convenience plotting replaces earned discovery. One tightening (third lever shift in perception) exists but carries no felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The time-moves-sideways premise emerges through imagery (parallel projections, branching realities) rather than on-the-nose statement. The "icy warmth of discovery" and "mechanically warm" levers recur but trend toward decorative paradox rather than embodied tension. The final line attempts thematic closure ("the icy warmth of discovery was enough") yet the discovery itself was not shown with friction or moral weight. No ambiguity lingers; the piece declares success without counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elias. Diction drifts into stock science-fiction register: "obliging sky mechanic," "subdued awakening," "mechanically warm," "icy warmth" recur as phrase-objects rather than voice-inflected perception. Dr. Chen's single line of dialogue ("Ready, Elias?") and her whispered response feel functional rather than individuated. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") cluster without voice motivation. The perceptual signature is generic operator-technician rather than a singular mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template cadence and phrase recycling pervade: "mechanically warm" appears four times, "icy warmth" twice, "subdued awakening" and "obliging sky mechanic" recur without reweighting. Paraphrase loops ("the nexus pulsed more intensely, its warmth radiating...creating that perfect icy warmth") and synonym churn ("The device fascinated Elias—mechanically warm to the touch...its smooth surfaces emanating a gentle heat") dull momentum. Opening stems repeat ("Elias adjusted," "Elias positioned," "Elias nodded," "Elias allowed"). Artifacts cluster in closure beats ("icy warmth of discovery," "subdued awakening"), disallowing high-band entry. Apply −1.4 for patterned artifacts plus −0.3 for closure-beat contamination; cumulative −1.7 in Q7 and global 9+ disallowed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise (time moves sideways, proven via lab experiment) follows template discovery-story logic without transformation. Stock phrases ("scientific history might be rewritten tonight," "change everything") replace specific stakes. The xenobiology station and winged alien creatures are set-dressing; removing them leaves the plot intact. No bold risk or lived detail differentiates this from median science-fiction procedural. The ending's satisfaction is declared rather than earned through contradiction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias ("obliging sky mechanic") calibrates gauges in the opening, pulls levers across middle beats, and transmits findings at the end—present in all three gates. Yet his "obliging" trait never constrains a choice or creates friction; he could be "meticulous" or "determined" with identical plot. The label appears twice ("obliging sky mechanic stepping back," "the obliging sky mechanic who had maintained") without shaping tactics. He observes and operates but does not face a trade-off tied to being obliging. Functional but replaceable: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is present from paragraph one (twilight glow), handled across three lever-pull beats (middle development), and reaches "peak intensity" in the closure paragraph (payoff). Its "mechanically warm" attribute recurs and the final image ties Elias's proof to the nexus's state. However, the nexus is passive: Elias activates it; it does not resist, require adaptation, or impose cost. Removing "magnetic nexus" and substituting "temporal field generator" would not alter causality. Three gates met, causal presence in multiple beats, closure linkage—but swappability and lack of constraint cap the score: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Subdued awakening" appears twice as a thematic label ("subdued awakening occurring somewhere between conscious thought," "this moment of subdued awakening") but does not drive a choice or tactic. The third lever triggers Elias's insight, but the insight is told ("something shifted in Elias's perception") rather than dramatized with cost. The concept echoes in tone but does not shape stakes or constrain moves. Ornamental mention, no causal pressure: 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Mechanically warm" is mentioned four times (nexus surfaces, levers) and establishes atmosphere, but the warmth never enables or constrains an action. Elias does not hesitate due to heat, adjust technique, or suffer consequence. The attribute is descriptive only, not tactical. Present across beats but label-only, no cost: 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lever-pulling structures the entire middle sequence: first lever materializes holograms, second intensifies the nexus, third shifts Elias's perception, final lever documents findings. Each lever advances plot causally and the third lever anchors the conceptual turn. Setup (control panel positioned), development (three pulls with escalating effects), and payoff (final lever transmits proof) are all present. However, any similar sequential input (buttons, switches, voice commands) could substitute with minor edits. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but moderate swappability: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Through holographic principles" appears once ("channel energy through holographic principles") as a method label and again when "holographic projections materialized." The mechanics are not explained, do not constrain Elias's approach, and could be replaced with "quantum," "electromagnetic," or "harmonic" with no plot change. The holograms display temporal data but the principle itself is inert. Mentioned but not operationalized: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station is established in the opening (viewport, dome, habitat with nocturnal specimens) and remains the sole location throughout. The station provides spatial coherence and the specimens frame the nocturnal timeframe, but neither the station's layout nor its resources constrain Elias's experiment or alter tactics. Dr. Chen walks through a doorway; the habitat creatures "remain blissfully unaware"—setting as backdrop, not crucible. Setup clear, no middle constraint, closure unaffected: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"The hush of beating wings at rest" appears in the opening (nocturnal specimens motionless) and returns once in the middle ("The hush of beating wings at rest in the neighboring habitat suddenly felt significant"). The phrase evokes stillness but does not impose a deadline or tighten decisions. Twilight deepens to night across the sequence, but the clock does not pressure Elias; he proceeds at will. Timeframe is tracked but not leveraged: 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To prove that time moves sideways" is stated early ("Elias's motivation remained personal and quiet") and drives his lever-pulling and final transmission. Setup and payoff are present; the motivation is consistent. However, it is told rather than dramatized with conflicting desires or visible sacrifice. No cost tied to the years spent, no relationship strained, no alternate path foreclosed. Desire present, friction absent: 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Icy warmth" appears twice ("perfect icy warmth that had come to define their most profound discoveries," "the icy warmth of discovery was enough") alongside repeated "mechanically warm" mentions. The paradoxical tone is asserted but not embodied in syntax or rhythm; the prose remains declarative and even-tempered throughout. No modulation under pressure, no tonal charge in the final image—static mood: 3.9.</comment>
