<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains abstract throughout—"meticulous route mapper" is a label, not a lived persona. His "analytically artistic mind" is asserted but never shown through contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The mirrors scene gestures at buried bad habits but summarizes rather than dramatizes internal conflict. Motivation is declared (find fortress of truths) but never tested by a competing desire or forfeiture with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words (Q2 −0.4, Q3 capped at 7.0, Q6 at 7.8). The closure—walking away from the open fortress because "truths are in the journey"—is told moralizing that replaces scene pressure and lacks visible cost (the punch dissolves conveniently, no forfeiture dramatized). Drive lens is ambiguous: the arrows and cracks suggest causal breadcrumbs, but the ending asserts accumulative theme without a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options. Application of Orientation Test: −0.4; closure thesis statement in final third triggers additional −0.5 in Q5, cross-cap all categories at 8.3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "starlit vault in mist" and phantom platform create atmospheric pressure, and the cracks/arrows function as micro-setting that guides movement. The fortress spires and hall of mirrors are vivid but remain postcard backdrops—no tactile interaction or constraint on choice. Spatial choreography is coherent (tracks, gate, hall), but the mist and fog are recycled without evolving causally. Cap applied per Orientation Test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (find the fortress) is signaled early. Pressure is declared ("test of resolve," "price demanded") but never materialized in a trade-off or forfeiture with on-page cost. The gate opens when he presses the punch—no choice, no competing option, no visible price paid. The mirrors crack as he passes without him making a decision that forecloses a path. Under any lens, escalation is asserted ("heart racing," "trembling") rather than caused by narrowing options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Theme is over-articulated throughout: "mysteries unravel only when you're trembling," "truths he sought were in the journey, not the destination," "greatest mystery was himself." The final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("unraveling mysteries wasn't about answers—it was about the courage to ask"), replacing scene resonance with thesis statement (−0.6). Thematic Echo in closure paragraph: additional −0.5. No subtext—every motif is decoded on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—diction ("meticulous," "analytically artistic," "uncanny geometry") drifts into elevated register not anchored in character. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is consistent but externalized: we are told he "dared" and "understood" without interior texture or contradictory thought. Cap applied per Orientation Test (7.8 max).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "arrows led" / "arrows ahead glowed" / "arrows stopped" / "arrows faded"; "phantom ticket punch" recycled six times with synonym churn ("clutched," "warmed," "vibrated," "dissolved"). Template cadence in opening third: "His breath frosted as he traced... His analytically artistic mind saw... He clutched... He'd mapped... He dared..." (−0.6). Stock metaphors: "shroud," "needles of judgment," "hall of mirrors." Figurative density in most sentences without payoff (−0.4). Artifacts touch closure (punch "dissolved into mist"): cumulative −1.7 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—phantom train platform, symbolic journey to confront buried truths—is a widely used template (hero's journey to metaphorical fortress). The mirrors showing buried selves, the dissolving key-object, and "journey not destination" moralizing are stock moves executed without fresh specificity. No risky structural choice or perspectival surprise. The "cracks forming arrows" could have been singular but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "meticulous route mapper" is mentioned in the opening line and reappears as "his meticulous route mapping done" near the end, but he makes no on-page choice shaped by route-mapping skill. He follows arrows passively; the trait is label-only without constraining or enabling action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phantom train ticket punch appears in three beats: clutched in pocket (setup), vibrates and warms (middle), pressed to gate as key (payoff). It enables the gate-opening but arrives as convenience—no cost tied to using it, and it dissolves without consequence. Swappable with any magical key. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff; middle beat is passive sensation) caps ~6.0; lack of cost and swappability lower to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unraveling mysteries" is named in the opening and closing paragraphs as theme but never shapes on-page tactics or choices. The protagonist does not solve, deduce, or puzzle—arrows guide him passively. The concept is ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Analytically artistic" is asserted twice ("His analytically artistic mind saw patterns everywhere," final third recap) but never demonstrated through contradictory perception, choice, or cost. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Dare" recurs as verb or gerund nine times, shaping three beats: daring to follow arrows (opening), daring to step onto tracks (middle), daring to press punch to gate (climax), and daring to take first step into dawn (closure). The action drives key turns, but "dare" is interchangeable with "choose" or "risk" without altering structure. Early signal, beat involvement (three), closure linkage present; swappability and lack of unique cost cap at 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Cracks in pavement forming arrows" appear in the opening (traced by lantern), converge on platform, glow faintly as he follows, stop at gate, then fade after gate opens. The method is signaled early and guides two moves (following to platform, following to gate), satisfying setup and development. Missing strong closure participation—they "fade" passively without charging the final image. Two-gate eligibility ~6.0; passive fadeout and no causal cost in final choice lower to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Starlit vault in mist" frames the opening and closing lines. The mist thickens and parts twice, and the vault is reclaimed ("his now") in the final paragraph. The setting creates atmosphere but does not constrain choice—tracks, gate, and hall could exist anywhere. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake (ownership of space) with mild closure linkage. Early setup, weak middle pressure, lyric payoff: 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"The hour that divides bad habits and new starts" is named in the opening and "the hour chimed again" in the closing paragraph. No live clock tightens decisions; time is metaphorical, not tracked. Setup and lyric reprise present, but no middle pressure or tactical cost. Two-gate lyric allowance ~5.5; metaphor-only use without urgency lowers to 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To find the fortress of unspoken truths" is declared in the opening, visualized when the fortress appears, and resolved when he walks away from it in the final third. The motive drives three beats (following arrows, pressing punch, choosing to leave), but no friction between want and cost is dramatized—he gets the fortress open without sacrifice, then moralizes about journey over destination. Early signal, beat involvement (three), closure linkage; lack of on-page conflict or forfeiture caps at 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Trembling" recurs six times across opening, middle, and close; "certainty" appears three times, often paired ("trembling certainty," "certainty steadied his trembling hands," final image "trembling certainty"). The tone modulates slightly under pressure but remains static—no cadence shift or ironic inversion at closure. The final line recycles the phrase without reweighting it. Setup, modest middle presence, closure reprise without transformation: 4.8.</comment>
