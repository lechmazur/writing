<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The adjuster's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("bruised awe," "profound privilege") rather than embodied sensation. No meaningful internal conflict appears; the character executes a predetermined task without hesitation or cost to his own stance. The final "thought" is pure summary rather than a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words—no concrete spatial grounding or temporal anchor beyond "dusk" and metaphoric "final ripple." The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the piece offers declarative summary rather than dramatized pressure accumulation. Closure presents a Conceptual Repricing (the lullaby preserving meaning), yet the cost is asserted ("transformed it") rather than shown through a before/after shift in the adjuster's options or state. The causality is a straight line with no reversal or tightening that narrows choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting provides atmospheric detail but does not constrain a single choice or tactic. The spiral staircase, lantern room, and pane of hush remain postcard elements. The puppet head is handled twice (pressed against the pane, then floating in void) and charges the final image with its "cracks now filled with light," meeting micro-setting participation. Spatial choreography is coherent but underutilized for pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving humanity's meaning—is declared but never tested by opposition or scarcity. The adjuster faces no dilemma; he was "instructed to delay" but chooses to "vouchsafe something more" without visible friction or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows his options. The mechanism "slows, and then stops" without resistance, rendering the climax a fulfillment rather than a hard-won turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in endings, meaning salvaged from loss) is stated overtly in the final paragraphs rather than arising from dramatized particulars. The puppet head's "beautifully flawed" quality and nested patterns appear as illustrative symbols rather than emergent insight. The ending offers thematic summary ("testament to all that had mattered") instead of a resonant image that reweights prior material without explication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register. Perceptual signature is generic—"weathered fingers," "bruised awe"—without idiosyncratic texture. Diction drifts into abstract/corporate phrasing ("vouchsafe," "collective memory," "framework of existence") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue present to judge. Psychic distance is constant but lacks modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops: "pane of hush" and "nested patterns" each recur 8+ times with minimal functional variation. Template cadence dominates: "As he ascended…," "As the porcelain made contact…," "When he reached…," "When the final ripple came…" The final third stacks filter verbs ("felt," "thought," "watched") and summary constructions ("had not prevented," "had succeeded," "had pledged"). Synonym churn on "lullaby," "hush," "ripple." Baseline −1.2 for pervasive loops and stems; closure beat is touched by summary phrasing, triggering the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise (last human preserves meaning at universe's end) is a widely used template. The nested-pattern mechanism and broken-puppet motif offer surface novelty but function as illustrative ornament rather than transforming the familiar arc. No bold risk or synthesis evident; the adjuster executes his task without moral friction or surprise. Derivative Premise Guardrail: −0.8 for template reliance without fresh moral calculus or lived specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout but decisions are predetermined. He climbs, sings, presses the puppet—no meaningful choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Swappable with "last guardian" or similar archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Appears early (pocket), used twice (pressed against pane, floating in void), and charges the final image ("cracks now filled with light"). Causal role in one major beat (merging with pane to transmit lullaby). Strong closure linkage but middle development is thin—mostly carried as symbol rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Signaled early, shapes the mechanism (barrier against void), and appears in closure. However, its mechanics remain vague—why does it "vibrate," how does it amplify the lullaby? Functions more as thematic label than tactical constraint. One key turn (puppet merge), present at end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Label-only. The puppet is described as "beautifully flawed" with "perfect imperfections," but these traits do not enable or constrain any action. The cracks become vessels for light at the end, a metaphoric payoff without prior cost or tactical use of the flaw.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The act of vouchsafing (preserving meaning) is the story's thesis but occurs as declaration rather than dramatized struggle. Mentioned late in explicit form ("vouchsafe humanity something more," "vouchsafe meaning"). No middle development; swappable with "preserve" or "grant."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Nested patterns appear early on the walls, erupt across the pane at contact, and weave the lullaby into "silence itself." Mechanics are asserted rather than shown, but the method is integral to the final image (sphere of memory, patterns preserving the song). Two beats: wall observation, pane eruption.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Present throughout, provides vertical ascent and the lantern room mechanism. Does not constrain choice—the adjuster climbs without obstacle. Dusk coloring is atmospheric but inert. Could be replaced with another isolated vertical structure (tower, spire) with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Time is metaphoric and untethered. "Final ripple" is mentioned repeatedly but never functions as a live deadline that alters his moves. He sings without duration pressure, and the ripple "expands and retreats" passively. Vague rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stated early ("simple: to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes"), drives the song action at closure. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No friction between duty and personal stake. One key turn (singing), present at end, but lacks middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Tone label "bruised awe" appears twice and the prose sustains an elevated, reverent register. Modulation is minimal—no tonal shift under pressure. The single mood (awe/reverence) is consistent but static, and the final image relies on the label rather than earning the feeling through rhythm or image alone.</comment>
