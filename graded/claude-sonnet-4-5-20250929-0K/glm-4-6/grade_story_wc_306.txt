<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's "cloak of doubt" is established as both condition and tool, but remains somewhat abstract; his interior during the chime-selection beat shows professional care yet lacks embodied contradiction acting simultaneously. Lyra's "sincerely insincere" trait is declared more than dramatized—her tears and posture shift read as performed emotion rather than contradictory impulses in conflict. The brother exists only in reference, which limits relational pressure. Minor penalty for diagnostic phrasing ("protected vulnerability" as method label).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure—Lyra leaving the shard and Elian incorporating it into his toolkit—functions as Earned Stasis with a visible reconfiguration: she no longer needs the void-object, he gains an instrument. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the chime sequence and shard's symbolic weight deepen rather than reverse in causal chain. Cost is legible in Lyra's relinquishment and Elian's acceptance of doubt as mantle. One meaningful deepening present; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse spire, chimes, and hollow mirror shard constrain the method and charge the ending image when Elian decides to hang the shard among the chimes. Sensory detail is selective and integrated: "misting breath," "breaking glass" voice, wind circulating the spire. The campfire below serves as temporal anchor. Micro-setting (the shard, the chime apparatus) alters tactics and participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate criteria for constraint and final image charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—helping Lyra's brother welcome nuance into certainty—is signaled early and pursued through the chime arrangement. One meaningful deepening occurs when the chime melody provokes Lyra's tears and her decision to leave the shard. Agency lies in Elian's method and Lyra's renunciation, both on-page. Cost is visible in her tearful release and his acceptance of the artifact. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no reversals required, and the resolution is earned by protagonist method.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—doubt as precision instrument, certainty as locked room—emerges from the chime mechanics and shard imagery without overt statement until the very end ("welcome nuance into the desperate safety of their certainty"). The final image of hanging the shard reweights Elian's doubt from liability to essential tool, a Conceptual Repricing that answers the premise. Subtext operates in the chimes' "key through the mail slot" metaphor and Lyra's shift from performance to nascent grace. Minor penalty for the closing sentence's thematic summary, which edges toward moralizing (−0.3).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stable throughout, with clean focalization on Elian and filter-appropriate access to Lyra's exterior. Perceptual signature is present ("soft weight," "void that seemed to absorb light") but could be more idiosyncratic. Dialogue is sparse, functional, and carries subtext ("You're the one they call the Keeper" / "I am"). Register occasionally elevates beyond the immediate scene needs ("apology delivered as a threat," "orchestra"), though it remains mostly voice-coherent. No head-hopping; distance modulates appropriately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the chime-selection beat. However, several constructions repeat stems: "He would…," "She was…" patterns appear in quick succession. The phrase "sincerely insincere" and "her wide, pleading eyes at odds with the rigid set of her jaw" exemplify overwriting—figurative density in a single descriptive moment without pattern payoff. Minor paraphrase loop: "her voice was barely a whisper itself" directly after "Ask him…her voice." These artifacts cluster but do not obscure closure (−0.6 in Q7).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Conscience for hire" combined with wind-chime divination offers a non-obvious synthesis; the "hollow mirror shard" that reflects nothing is a fresh image. The method—translating queries into harmonic sequences—avoids stock conflict templates. However, the lighthouse-keeper-as-solitary-professional and the "cloak of doubt" veer toward familiar metaphor territory. The ending's reconfiguration (doubt as mantle, shard as new chime) feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the indirect confrontation method elevates originality modestly (+0.2).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian frames the premise, selects chimes (a decision that narrows options for Lyra's brother), and decides to incorporate the shard at closure—three distinct beats. His profession shapes the stakes and his final choice alters his toolkit with visible consequence. Present early, developed in the middle selection beat, and participates in closure. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong; cost tied to his acceptance of the artifact.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shard is introduced early (Lyra withdraws it), described with specific properties (void, worn edges), and returned at closure when Lyra leaves it and Elian decides to hang it among the chimes. It appears in three beats: introduction, thematic explanation, and final incorporation. The ending image would lose specificity without it. Closure linkage and irreplaceability are strong; visible cost in Lyra's relinquishment and Elian's curatorial choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Cloak of doubt" is introduced early as Elian's perpetual state and essential qualification. It shapes his professional stance and is reframed at closure as "mantle, essential and true." However, it does not constrain a middle choice with visible tradeoff—it remains more thematic accent than tactical constraint. Present in setup and payoff (two gates); lyric reprise reweights meaning but lacks middle beat involvement (−0.4 for missing development gate).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Lyra is described as "sincerely insincere" in the opening beat, with visual cues (wide eyes vs. rigid jaw). The trait colors her entrance but does not constrain or enable a subsequent choice with visible cost—her later tears and posture shift are played straight, without ironic layering. Present early but remains ornamental; no middle development or closure participation. Swappable with "conflicted" or similar (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unhook the past" is Elian's stated task and frames the request, but the action performed on-page is chime arrangement and shard relinquishment—neither labeled "unhooking" in scene. The term is metaphorical setup rather than a dramatized, specific action. Present early as framing metaphor, absent in middle beats as distinct action, and not directly referenced at closure. Functional but replaceable with "release" or "let go" (cap 3.8).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Chime mechanics introduced early (hanging from rafters, made of varied materials), explained in the method paragraph, and executed in the selection beat where Elian chooses four chimes and arranges a sequence that provokes Lyra's response. The method drives the central turn and is indispensable to the closure effect—without it, the resolution collapses. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure and specificity. Cost tied to Lyra's emotional shift and Elian's interpretive labor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse at dawn anchors who/where/when early and supplies the chime apparatus (hanging from rafters), which is essential to the method. The breezes circling the spire enable the chime tones. At closure, Elian looks out the window at the risen sun, and the environment charges the final image. Present in all three gates; the setting's specific features (height, wind, isolation) constrain and enable the method. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The campfire's last spark marks "the appointed time" and frames the story's present window. However, elapsed time within the encounter is not tracked or made to tighten decisions—the scene unfolds without a live clock altering tactics. Present in setup (temporal anchor), absent in middle development, and not referenced at closure. Functional framing device but does not pressure choices (two gates: setup + implied span; missing tightening role, −0.5).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elian's desire to "anchor doubt, turning it from liability into tool" is stated early and dramatized through his chime selection. Lyra's motivation—to help her brother find nuance—drives her request and renunciation. At closure, Elian reframes doubt as essential mantle, fulfilling the thematic want. Present in all three gates with moderate causal pressure. However, the internal friction (doubt as burden vs. precision tool) is told more than shown through conflicting micro-choices (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone of "protected vulnerability" is signaled through Elian's method (passing a key through the mail slot, allowing discovery not instruction) and sustained in the chime-selection beat and Lyra's tearful shift. The final image—Elian holding the lightness of the shard, feeling doubt as mantle—charges the ending with this tone. Coherent through turns and modulates appropriately with pressure. Present in all three gates; tone constrain choice structure and charges closure, though specificity could be sharper (rounding adjustments yield 6.1).</comment>
