<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The translator's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Interior life consists largely of reflective summary ("her work had always been about honoring overlooked histories") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist observes and receives rather than making decisions that alter tactics; the merchant guides, the fragment pulses, the painting shifts—agency remains external. The final "smile" and pen-lift gesture toward change but lack the visible cost or foreclosed path required at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (fragment → market → canvases → final portrait) with a Conceptual Repricing attempted at closure: the protagonist realizes she "had always been here" and that "the story was never just about her." However, the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture, no live option closed. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first third. The escalation consists of accumulating discovery beats rather than narrowing tactical options, and the ending dissolves the market into "ordinary glass" without dramatizing what the translator sacrifices or gains in concrete terms.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is vividly rendered (glowing ropes, mist, bottled starlight) and provides a functional frame, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the protagonist moves through it as a catalog rather than a crucible. The lighthouse lens fragment recurs across beats and charges the final image when it "fades into ordinary glass," offering mild object-as-setting weight. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the sensory detail is selective, but the setting remains atmospheric rather than tactically essential.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early (uncover the lineage of translators), but pressure accumulates through revelation rather than narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The protagonist faces no meaningful resistance, and the market merchant immediately confirms her identity and hands over the needed canvases. The final "work just beginning" gesture implies future conflict but offers no on-page cost or foreclosed path. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require a density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with felt consequence; here the discovery beats feel cumulative but not costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (overlooked histories, lineage of women translators) emerges from the fragment and market rather than authorial assertion, and the final image attempts a non-literal answer by showing the protagonist among countless others. However, the closing lines veer toward theme summary ("The overlooked histories would have their day. And she would be the one to give it to them") rather than trusting the image. The phrase "eternal instant" recurs but remains ornamental; the conceptual cost of joining the lineage is asserted rather than felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register and rhythmic texture, though diction occasionally drifts into abstract generality ("elusively tangible," "eternal instant") without concrete anchoring. Interior access stays modest and the perceptual signature is selective (fragment warmth, painting shifts through glass). No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("she thought," "she could see") are present but voice-motivated. The prose reflects the translator's contemplative stance, though peak moments rely on summary rather than immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in descriptive beats, but several lines loop or paraphrase without advancing pressure: "Between worlds, she thought, between childhood and now, there was only this: an eternal instant of recognition" echoes the timeframe element without new information. The phrase "elusively tangible" recurs as a stock modifier. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed (fragment "pulsed like a heartbeat" / "grew warmer" / "no longer just glass but a bridge"). Clarity remains intact, and no causality breaks occur, but momentum sags in the reflective middle section. Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" constructions across adjacent lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (translator discovers mystical lineage through fragments and hidden painting details) echoes familiar template structures: magical realism quest, secret society of women with special gifts, protagonist realizes she was always part of the pattern. The alchemist's market and lighthouse motif add texture but do not transform the underlying arc. Emotional specificity remains abstract (honor, recognition, testament) rather than grounded in lived contradiction. The final turn (she had always been here, the work is just beginning) is structurally predictable. No bold risk elevates the material beyond competent synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The translator is present throughout and her identity shapes the frame, but her choices do not create key turns—the merchant identifies her, the fragment reveals, the paintings shift. She observes and accepts rather than deciding under pressure. Present in closure (picking up a pen) but without causal agency that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens fragment appears in the opening beat, grows warmer in the market, reveals hidden details in the painting, pulses with urgency, and fades to ordinary glass at closure—reweighted meaning across at least four distinct beats. It enables the protagonist's sight and charges the final image. Causal pressure is moderate (it reveals rather than constrains), but closure linkage and beat involvement are strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Anchors of intuition" is mentioned twice as a phrase and named as guiding the protagonist, but it does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page. The fragment functions as the operational anchor; the concept itself remains thematic decoration. Swappable with "instinct" or "inner knowing" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Elusively tangible" appears as a descriptor for the fragment's light and form but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. It is label-only, restated in the closing paragraph without tactical consequence. No visible tradeoff tied to this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears in two beats (childhood game of unfastening secrets, mid-market resolve to "unfasten the truth") but does not drive a major turn or redefine options. The action of looking through the fragment or picking up canvases carries the causal weight; "unfasten" remains metaphorical garnish. Swappable with "unlock" or "reveal" without altering the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Through hidden details in paintings" is signaled early (childhood game, merchant's instruction "Look closer"), enables the mid-market revelation when the protagonist peers through the fragment, and returns as the method for finding "the others" across canvases. The mechanics matter (fragment as lens), though the final canvas reveal feels summative rather than tactically challenging. Shapes one key turn and contributes to closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The alchemist's market provides vivid atmosphere and frames the central discovery beats, but it does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The protagonist moves through it without restriction or tactical friction. Present in setup and middle, absent from closure (dissolves into mist, replaced by the study). Functional but replaceable with any mystical bazaar.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Between childhood and now" is named in the opening and closing paragraphs and the phrase recurs mid-market, but time does not tighten decisions or constrain tactics. The timeframe is vague (years since she first found the fragment) and the narrative unfolds in a single continuous present without a live clock. Thematic presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To honor overlooked histories" is stated as the protagonist's work and named as personal ("this time, it was personal"), but the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No friction appears between this desire and a competing want or cost. Present in setup and closure (pen-lift to write the histories), but not tested under pressure in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Eternal instant" is named explicitly in the reflective middle beat and implied in the closing dissolution of the market. Tone remains contemplative and elevated throughout without modulation under pressure or a meaningful shift at closure. Static mood rather than dynamic charge. The phrase recurs but does not reweight the final image with new cost or tension.</comment>
