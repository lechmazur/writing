<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and embodied through craft details (the ink formula, the forged confession), but her interior contradiction remains largely told rather than acted. The heritage rose thorn functions more as symbolic trigger than a choice-constraining object. The final "lighter than she had in years" reads as therapeutic resolution rather than a flawed character navigating genuine ambiguity. Micro-choices exist (pricking her finger, adding blood to the seal) but the emotional arc smooths too quickly from bitterness to relief without on-page struggle at the peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by paragraph two (forger, sanctuary, three winters). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara completes the forgery and steps into daylight feeling "lighter," breaking the cycle through deception—but the cost remains abstract ("unlinked her past") rather than a specific forfeiture legible in the final image. The drive lens reads Causal (forgery enables revenge/justice), yet the ending avoids showing whether the document will work or what Elara loses by choosing this path, leaving consequence implied rather than paid on the page. The "key with no apparent lock" metaphor arrives as a late flourish rather than a mechanism that shaped earlier attempts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites anchor space and atmosphere effectively; the cold floor and dripping water constrain Elara's endurance across hours. Sensory detail is vivid ("emerald waves," "pearl twilight") and filtered through her craft focus. The heritage rose thorn as micro-object charges the final image when she tucks it "close to her heart like a prayer," transforming from betrayal token to devotional object and constraining her final gesture. Minor cap applied: some details (stalactites forming "translucent pillars") read ornamental rather than tactically relevant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (revenge via forgery) and the work escalates from preparation to execution. The tightening occurs when Elara adds her own blood to the seal, but this choice lacks a visible trade-off—no moment where she must sacrifice safety, certainty, or another value to complete the act. The story opts for lyric confidence ("calibrated treason was complete") over dramatized friction. No antagonist pressure tests her resolve on the page; the actual delivery and Lord Valerius's response remain off-stage, so the peak choice feels rehearsed rather than under live fire.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of justice-through-deception emerges organically from Elara's craft and the forgery's dual nature (holy/unholy). The heritage rose thorn's shift from "betrayal" token to "prayer" object offers a purposeful reprise that reweights meaning. However, the final paragraph risks stating the theme outright: "cycle of vengeance would be broken," "strange, holy act of deception," "The key with no apparent lock had finally turned." These lines lean toward summation rather than letting the image of Elara stepping into daylight with the thorn at her heart do the work. The moral calculus of creating false evidence to achieve "justice" invites ambiguity but the ending smooths it into resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("calibrated treason," "unlink," "heritage rose thorn") that sometimes drifts into ornamental phrasing ("stalactites formed translucent pillars"). Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices craft details (vellum, quill, pressure, flourishes)—but under peak pressure the voice remains smooth rather than compressing or fracturing. Phrase recycling is noticeable: "heritage rose thorn" appears seven times, "calibrated treason" three times, "wisely endured" twice, often as full noun phrases rather than varied references. No dialogue on the page to assess naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong, but patterned artifacts accumulate: "heritage rose thorn" as unvaried full phrase across seven mentions; "calibrated treason" recycled verbatim; "wisely endured" appears twice in identical form. Template cadence in paragraph four: "She had wisely endured… Her motivation had become clear… The heritage rose thorn rested…" creates a declarative drumbeat. Mixed metaphor: "a key with no apparent lock" as both the ink formula and a final metaphor for resolution strains coherence—keys open locks, but the story uses it to mean both a secret method and a spiritual release. Purple prose in places: "memories surfaced like drowning bodies," "something between dream and reality." Deduction: −1.2 cumulative for loops, stem repetition, and figurative muddle in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The calligraphy-forger premise offers specificity, and the aurora-lit sanctuary provides atmospheric originality. However, the revenge-via-forgery plot and the symbolic rose thorn follow familiar templates: wronged daughter, patient craft, righteous deception, liberation through art. The "key with no apparent lock" arrives as a late metaphor rather than an integrated puzzle. Emotional arc from bitterness to cathartic lightness lacks the moral ambiguity the premise invites—Elara's forgery is framed as "holy" and "justice" without on-page cost or doubt. The story hedges risk by keeping Lord Valerius off-stage and the solicitor's reaction unshown, avoiding the harder question of whether her deception will work or corrupt her further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; her decision to forge the confession and add her blood drives the central turn. However, much of the story recounts her past preparation rather than showing new choices under immediate pressure. The peak decision (adding blood, sealing the document) is executed smoothly without on-page friction or a visible alternative she rejects. She appears in the final image but as observer of her own emotional state rather than making a new choice. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is reflective rather than choice-driven. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure +0.6; late first live choice −0.3, swappability (any skilled forger) −0.5. Band guidance: solid presence, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph one) and returns in final paragraph ("tucked close to her heart like a prayer"), providing a lyric frame. Handled in three beats: removed from pouch, placed beside inkwell, used to prick her finger. The blood-seal moment offers specificity, but the thorn's unique properties (dark crimson, dried, from her mother) do not mechanically enable or constrain her forgery—any sharp object could draw blood. The early-to-final reprise reweights it from "betrayal" token to devotional object, supporting theme but not driving a choice that could not happen without it. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, lyric reprise +0.4; swappability (any keepsake or blade) −0.7, ornamental first mention −0.3. Rounds to 5.8, within the lyric-resonance allowance but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Calibrated treason" is named three times and frames Elara's act thematically, but it functions as descriptive label rather than shaping on-page tactics or choices. The story does not dramatize how the treason is "calibrated"—what measurements, risks, or trade-offs she navigates—beyond the forgery mechanics already present. The concept echoes at closure ("calibrated treason was complete") but does not redefine options or introduce cost; remove the phrase and the plot remains unchanged. Late full articulation (paragraph six), no middle development where it narrows a choice. Functional presence +0.4, closure mention +0.3; late label −0.5, ornamental (swappable with "careful revenge" or "planned deception") −0.7, summary-only −0.6. Cap at 4.6 (introduced after 40% as full phrase).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Wisely endured" appears twice as a label for Elara's three-winter preparation but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait describes past patience rather than forcing a present trade-off (e.g., enduring cold that slows her hand, or resisting the urge to rush and make an error). No moment where "wisely enduring" competes with another impulse in scene. Setup gate met (paragraph two), no middle or closure participation. Functional mention +0.4; label-only −0.5, no causal pressure −0.7, swappable with "patiently practiced" −0.5. Cap at 3.8 (swappability).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Unlink" is used four times to describe Elara severing family ties via forgery, but it functions as thematic metaphor rather than a discrete action with mechanical steps. The actual unlinking is the forgery and delivery, already core to the plot; "unlink" renames rather than specifies. No moment where unlinking mechanics (as opposed to forging) create a choice or obstacle. Final image uses it ("unlinked her past from her future with every step") but as summary label. Present across beats +0.9, closure mention +0.5; swappability (replace with "sever" or "break") −0.8, ornamental/label usage −0.6, no unique causal pressure −0.6. Mid-band for consistent presence, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"A key with no apparent lock" is identified as the royal ink formula (paragraph two) that enables Elara's forgery, then reappears as metaphor in the final sentence ("The key with no apparent lock had finally turned"). The ink formula is causally necessary—without it, her forgery fails scrutiny—and is signaled early, shaping her method. However, the phrase itself is ornamental; the mechanics are "royal ink formula," and calling it a "key" adds poetic gloss without altering how she uses it. The final line's metaphorical turn (spiritual unlocking) muddies whether the key is the ink or the act itself. Early signal +0.7, two beats (discovery, use) +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.7; late metaphorical reprise that shifts meaning −0.8, swappability (the ink formula works without the key metaphor) −0.6, mixed-metaphor friction −0.5. Just under 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary under aurora is introduced in the opening line and anchors every beat; the cold floor constrains Elara's endurance ("joints protesting after hours"), and the dripping stalactites mark time. The aurora's color shifts (emerald to pearl twilight) modulate atmosphere and cue elapsed time, and the sanctuary's acoustics and isolation enable her years of hidden work. The setting is irreplaceable for her refuge and the closure image of emerging "into the breaking daylight." Early signal +0.8, continuous presence across all beats +1.4, causal pressure (cold, isolation, acoustics) +1.0, closure linkage (daylight exit) +1.2; minor deduction for some ornamental description ("something between dream and reality") −0.4. Strong integration, not quite indispensable (the forgery could occur elsewhere with edits).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"As stalactites drip" appears in the subtitle/header and twice in the text to mark slow time, reinforcing Elara's patient endurance. However, the dripping does not create urgency, deadline pressure, or alter her tactics—it measures duration passively. No moment where she must finish before dawn or before the wax cools, for example. The timeframe is vague ("hours still on the cold floor," "approaching dawn") and does not tighten decisions. Setup gate met, no middle or closure pressure from time. Atmospheric presence +0.5, two mentions +0.5; vague/untracked −0.7, no tactical pressure −0.8, swappable with any slow-time marker −0.5. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle development gate).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To forgive the unfinished" is stated once (paragraph three: "to forgive the unfinished business between her family and theirs, not through mercy but through justice") but is not dramatized as a live internal conflict. Elara's motivation reads as revenge/justice throughout; the "forgive" framing arrives mid-story as intellectual reframe rather than emotional friction tested on the page. No moment where forgiveness competes with vengeance in a choice. The ending asserts resolution ("unfinished forgiven") but does not show her wrestling with what forgiveness via deception costs her morally. Setup gate met (paragraph three), no middle or closure choice where forgiveness vs. revenge creates visible trade-off. Functional presence +0.4, closure mention +0.3; told-only −0.7, no friction between wants and costs −0.8, late first mention −0.4. Cap at 4.6 (introduced after 40%).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Pearl twilight" is named twice (paragraphs three and five) and describes the aurora's soft luminescence, setting a contemplative, liminal tone consistent across the piece. The tone modulates slightly (emerald intensity to pearl softness) as Elara moves from preparation to completion, and the final "breaking daylight" exit extends the dawn imagery. However, the tone remains static—reverent and resolved—without tensioning against pressure or fracturing under crisis. No moment where the serene tone clashes with urgency to charge a beat. Setup gate met, development and closure present but passive. Coherent presence +0.7, closure linkage +0.6, modulation (emerald to pearl to daylight) +0.5; static mood −0.6, ornamental (swappable with "soft dawn" or "gentle light") −0.4. Mid-band for consistent atmospheric support, not indispensable.</comment>
