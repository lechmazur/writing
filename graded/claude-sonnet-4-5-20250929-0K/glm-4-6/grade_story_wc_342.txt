<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (paint the impossible sky, cope with face blindness through pattern) is stated but never meaningfully tested or contradicted. The "discovering limits" premise could have forced a trade-off—time versus perfection, safety versus completion—but he succeeds without visible cost or internal friction. Embodied emotion is thin: "heart pounding," "hands trembling" are stock phrases that flatten peak moments. The final walk-away reads as declarative summary rather than earned transformation rooted in on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative lens: Elias enters, unlocks the safe, assembles lenses, projects the sky, exits. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (he's "free," carries the sky inside him), but cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible trade-off, injury, or forfeiture shapes the final image. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchor by the opening lines). The dominant stake (mirror the sky before demolition) is signaled early, but the single tightening moment (wrecking ball strikes) arrives late and does not narrow options; Elias completes his work unimpeded, undercutting felt urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The hollowed tree trunk library, the hidden safe, and the crystal lenses provide concrete spatial anchors and constrain Elias's method (he must align indentations, position lenses to catch dawn). The "fractally precise" visual motif recurs but remains decorative—it does not alter a choice or charge the closure image with new weight. Sensory detail is present (dust, decaying paper, grain of wood) but filtered through a generic art-catalog register rather than Elias's embodied priorities. The demolition timeframe is mentioned but not tracked beat-to-beat, so spatial pressure exceeds temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (paint the sky before demolition) is clear, but escalation is minimal: Elias faces no meaningful obstacle, reversal, or forced trade-off. The wrecking ball's arrival provides declared urgency ("imminent," "trembled," "groaning") yet he completes the work unhindered and walks away unscathed. Agency is descriptive (he "adjusted," "positioned," "assembled") rather than decisional—no live choice narrows options or exacts a visible price. The ending asserts freedom and purpose without on-page cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in patterns rather than faces; light as art; hidden legacies) emerges organically from Elias's condition and the guild's tools. The recurring "fractally precise" motif and the sky-inside-walls image offer resonance, though the final image leans toward overt statement ("some beauty couldn't be seen, only felt," "he was free"). The piece avoids heavy-handed moralizing in most beats, but the walk-away epilogue summarizes theme rather than letting the projection itself charge the close. Subtext operates in the safe's secret and Elias's relationship to vision, but the ending's internal monologue ("for the first time, he saw not faces but possibilities") crosses into thesis articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and elevated ("fractally precise," "heightened stillness," "shroud") but occasionally drifts into art-catalog register ("kaleidoscope of clouds," "trapped sunrise") that feels imposed rather than rooted in Elias's working perception. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the lens assembly, but the epilogue's internal monologue ("a keeper of light, a crafter of impossible skies") reads as summary rather than immediate thought. No dialogue. Perceptual signature (texture over faces) is declared but under-exploited—more touch and less visual metaphor would sharpen voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the epilogue: "The library was gone, but its soul lived on" echoes "The city would forget the library, but Elias would remember"; "The coin's indentations" repeats across three paragraphs without adding pressure. Template cadence flattens key beats: "He knelt… He smiled… He positioned… He adjusted… He took… He staggered… He turned… He walked… He slipped… He rounded… He knelt… He stood… He walked… He whispered." Stock metaphors ("trapped sunrise," "ghost between buildings," "roadmap to infinity") cluster without fresh vehicle. Information density is low in the final third, where summary replaces scene. Apply −1.2 for loops and template runs touching the closure epilogue.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist premise offers a fresh synthesis, and the hidden-lens mechanism is specific. However, the "artist finds meaning beyond his disability" arc follows a familiar template, and the ending's declarative freedom ("He was free. The sky was his now") resolves into uplift without complication. The fractal-sky effect is vivid but not irreplaceable—other light-art could serve. Risk-taking is modest: the piece chooses a safe, affirmative close over ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's face blindness frames his lens-work motivation and is mentioned across beats, but his choices are procedural (unlock, assemble, position) rather than dilemma-driven. His final walk-away is a summative statement, not a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present throughout, but agency remains thin.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The secret book safe appears in setup (coin aligns, safe opens), middle (lenses retrieved), and closure reference ("safe clicked shut," "was gone"). It enables the core action and is handled on the page, but its final mention is retrospective rather than charged. Strong beat involvement, moderate causal pressure, swappable with another hidden cache.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" is declared mid-text ("discovering the limits of his craft—of how far light could be manipulated") but never dramatized as a constraint or cost. Elias succeeds without hitting a boundary or trade-off. Present as theme claim, not as on-page stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" recurs (library arches, sky overhead, puddle reflections) as atmospheric description but does not constrain or enable a choice with cost. Label-only trait; ornamental use across beats without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Craft" (assembling lenses, bending light, painting the sky) drives the entire sequence from coin-unlock to final projection. Present in setup, middle assembly, and closure image. Central action, but easily swappable with another art form (sculpture, sound) without deep structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The coin's faint indentations unlock the safe in the opening third and recur as a tactile anchor in the epilogue ("coin's indentations a roadmap to infinity"). Signaled early, handled twice, but its mechanics (align indentations with floorboard) are perfunctory—any key analog would serve. Functional in two beats, moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hollowed tree trunk library provides spatial constraint (grooves, arches, cracks that catch dawn), houses the safe, and supplies the demolition pressure. Present in setup, middle, and closure reference. The setting pressures time but not spatial choices—Elias moves freely within. Solid beat involvement, moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "hush just before demolition" frames urgency and recurs ("imminent," "wrecking ball struck," "building groaning"), but elapsed time is not tracked beat-to-beat. The clock does not force a mid-scene trade-off or failure. Declared in setup and closure, but time does not tighten tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Mirror the sky inside walls" is Elias's stated goal and is achieved on the page (lenses project clouds). Present in setup, pursued in middle, and declared complete at closure. However, the desire faces no friction or cost—success is unimpeded. Functional but not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" is declared in the opening ("settling over him like a shroud") and reprised in the epilogue ("the hush had broken, but the stillness inside him endured"). Tone is consistent but static—it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with reweighted meaning. Present in framing beats, moderate coherence.</comment>
