<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The queen's motivation to climb is established through recurring dreams, but her interior life remains abstract—"weight of a crown," "disenchanted"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The seneschal's revelation that he "had known her secret all along" arrives unearned; no prior action dramatized his awareness or created tension from that knowledge gap. The final choice—awakening to celestial identity—feels like inherited memory rather than a decision forged under pressure, and the "price" paid by the kingdom is declared but not felt on the page. Diagnostic label-speak ("lacy menace") in the final line further distances the reader from embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative layering (dream → climb → grotto → memory recovery), but the key reversal—her realization of celestial origin—is triggered by passive recognition rather than protagonist action. The Orientation Test passes narrowly (queen, castle, storm season anchored by ~100 words), but the closure unit relies on exposition: "she was not dreaming of this place but remembering it" tells rather than dramatizes the shift. Cost is declared ("the kingdom she could no longer call home") but not legible in concrete forfeiture or visible consequence on the page; the smile and "lacy menace" replace scene pressure with summary assertion. One meaningful tightening occurs (climb → grotto → revelation), meeting minimum scope, but the final image does not reconfigure prior material with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto, ember patterns, and crystallized starlight provide vivid sensory anchors, and the ridge climb offers spatial progression with mist, rain, and fireflies that modulate atmosphere. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; no tool, terrain feature, or physical constraint forces a tactical choice or alters the queen's options during ascent or inside the grotto. The fireflies appear as symbolic recurrence without constraining action, and the embers "flare and die in patterns forming words she could almost read" but never compel a decision. Solid description but decorative rather than pressure-driving.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unraveling recurring dreams—is signaled early and sustained through the climb. The story delivers one meaningful tightening (arrival at the grotto) and one reversal (memory recovery), but both are driven by spatial arrival rather than protagonist agency or forced trade-off. The seneschal's presence adds companionship but no friction; he confirms rather than complicates. The final "will you stay or return" question is posed by the seneschal, not wrestled by the queen on the page, and her smile answers without visible cost or foreclosed option. Escalation reads as accumulative density rather than causal pressure, meeting minimum under a Hybrid lens but lacking the sharpened choice or visible price for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of celestial identity versus mortal duty emerges through imagery (starlight bleeding to rust, embers as home), but the ending pivots on explicit statement: "she had reclaimed what she was born to be, and the price of her awakening would be paid by the kingdom." This tells rather than showing the thematic reconfiguration. The "lacy menace" descriptor in the final line attempts to charge the image but reads as externally applied label rather than resonant particulars. The recurring dreams and fireflies create pattern, yet the resolution leans toward stated thesis ("timeless existence promised by the cobalt grotto") instead of a non-literal answer arising from scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated ("ethereal visions of cobalt depths," "veil between worlds grew tissue-thin"), though the register occasionally drifts toward generic fantasy ("ancient intelligence," "celestial fire"). The seneschal's single line of dialogue ("I could not let you face this alone") and his final question are functional but lack subtext or distinct idiom. Psychic distance stays controlled, but perceptual signature is weak—descriptions read as authorial catalog rather than filtered through the queen's particular urgency or bias. "Lacy menace" in the final beat jars as an external label rather than voice-consistent texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("starlight bled down stone walls in silver rivulets that dried to rust," "seasons merged like watercolors"), creating coherent atmosphere but also slowing momentum during peak beats. Template cadence appears in the opening: "For three months, recurring dreams… / Tonight, with lightning… / Dawn broke gray…" using time-marker stems without variance. Paraphrase loop in paragraph four: "She approached cautiously, watching as the embers flared… / she was not dreaming of this place but remembering it" restates recognition across adjacent sentences. Filter-verb reliance ("watching as," "confirming he had known") dulls immediacy. The final paragraph stacks exposition ("the kingdom below seemed fragile," "promised by the cobalt grotto," "the price of her awakening would be paid") where scene pressure would serve better. Cumulative line-level debt: −0.8 in Q7 for template stems, paraphrase loop, and filter stacks in closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—royal secretly celestial, summoned home—follows a widely used template (hidden identity, dream召唤, sacrificed kingdom). Execution adds specific textures (cobalt grotto, ember patterns, fireflies as memory markers) but does not transform the arc; swapping names and setting would leave the emotional beats unchanged. The "final warning" from the seer sets up tension but is never paid off with complication; it exists to frame the journey rather than force choice. "Lacy menace" attempts fresh language but feels ornamental rather than earned. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the story plays the archetype straight without fresh moral calculus or non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The disenchanted queen is present throughout and her climb initiates the plot, but key turns—arrival at the grotto, memory recovery, final stance—result from spatial progression and seneschal prompts rather than her contested decisions. Setup present, closure participation present, but middle development lacks agency-driven choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ember grotto appears in the seer's warning (setup), is physically approached and observed in the climax (development), and triggers the memory-recovery closure (payoff). It shapes two beats (approach, revelation) and its "patterns forming words" attempt causal involvement, but the queen does not handle, manipulate, or choose based on the embers—she passively reads them. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight appears in the opening dream ("starlight bled down stone walls in silver rivulets that dried to rust") and recurs inside the grotto ("starlight no longer glowed but bled into the rock in scarlet streams"), but it functions as atmospheric motif rather than constraint. It does not alter the queen's tactics, force a trade-off, or change her options. Present in setup and closure image but ornamental; lyric resonance without causal pressure caps score in the 3.0–4.0 range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Softly commanding voice" is mentioned twice (ordering the stable master, resolving into memory of true self) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. It labels her manner without dramatizing a tradeoff between command and vulnerability or shaping a tactical choice under pressure. Label-only use; no causal beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The climb anchors the entire middle act: queen abandons castle, rides seven leagues, ascends on foot for two hours, encounters the seneschal, spots fireflies at higher altitude, crests the ridge to reach the grotto. It is the primary action and shapes spatial progression, escalation via accumulation, and arrival at closure site. Setup early, drives multiple beats, participates in closure. Not easily swappable; removing the climb would collapse the narrative spine. Strong integration but the climb itself does not force a contested decision or visible cost—spatial arrival does the causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" appears once in the middle (paragraph three) as a moment of recognition that confirms altitude and recalls the dream imagery. It signals transition and reweights the fireflies from dream to present reality, but it does not constrain choice or enable a tactic. Setup weak (fireflies not seeded early enough), development moderate (one beat of recognition), payoff absent (fireflies do not return or shape the ending). Mid-band for single-beat involvement with some resonance but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto above clouds is the destination and closure site: setup via seer's reference and ancient texts, development through the climb toward it, payoff as the space where memory recovery occurs. It provides vivid atmosphere (crystals, indigo walls, pulsing light) and houses the ember grotto, but does not constrain the queen's choices—she walks in, observes, remembers. All three gates met; closure participation strong; causal pressure minimal (postcard function). Solid integration as goal-object but not as tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the final warning" timeframe is signaled in the opening (seer's warning "yesterday evening," queen resolves "tonight," then "dawn broke") and tracked through the climb ("two hours into her ascent"). Time progression is clear and creates a sense of building urgency, but no live clock tightens decisions or forces a trade-off; the queen proceeds at her own pace without temporal cost. Setup present, development tracked, closure unaffected by time pressure. Functional but replaceable; time is scaffold rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation to unravel recurring dreams is established early ("For three months, recurring dreams had haunted her nights"), drives her decision to climb, and is resolved at closure when dreams coalesce into memory. Setup strong, development sustained (climb is goal-directed), payoff direct (she remembers). However, the desire is never dramatized in conflicted choice—no moment where she weighs dream-truth against kingdom duty, or pays a visible cost to pursue the mystery. The climb proceeds without friction; resolution is given rather than earned through sacrifice. All three gates met but desire lacks on-page contest, capping score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Lacy menace" appears only in the final sentence ("her lacy menace as terrifying as it was beautiful") as an external label rather than a coherent tonal thread. Earlier beats carry grandeur and mystery (thunder, mist, pulsing light) but not menace; the shift to "menace" at closure is asserted, not modulated through escalating dread or threat. Tone is atmospheric and elevated but does not cohere around menace or charge the final image through prior patterning. Single ornamental mention at the end; no setup or development.</comment>
