<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kenji's motivation is clear and his interiority concrete through the bonsai work, but the emotional arc relies heavily on labeled feelings ("cerulean regret") rather than embodied contradiction. The grandmother's compass and lace provide external anchors, yet the pivotal moment—his acceptance of horizontal possibility over reaching toward Aiko—arrives through contemplation rather than a choice that forecloses a lived option with visible cost. The piece shows patience and measured grief but lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the compass, lace pattern, and bonsai techniques layer to reweight Kenji's stance from drowning in remembrance to navigating it. Orientation anchors cleanly (islet, post-severance, bonsai work). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the compass points toward "infinite possibility" rather than Aiko, and Kenji's verbal testing of apology paired with return to work crystallizes his acceptance. Cost is felt (he will not pursue Aiko) but remains oblique; the final image charges prior motifs without a sharper on-page forfeiture or decision that narrows tactics, keeping this shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The islet after rain and the miniature bonsai function as micro-setting that reflects Kenji's enclosed emotional state. The compass is handled across multiple beats, its erratic spin and eventual steadying shaping his internal movement. Spatial choreography is clear (islet, shore, ancient pine), and sensory detail (salt-laced air, wet earth, gull returns) anchors time and pressure. The setting constrains choice implicitly—the isolation mirrors his retreat—but does not supply a resource or barrier that alters a pivotal tactic, keeping this below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding "the color of unspoken apologies"—is signaled early and accumulates through grandmother's wisdom, compass guidance, and lace tracing. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as Kenji moves from being "threatened to drown" to "carrying" remembrance. The tightening is a cadence shift rather than a choice that narrows options; the compass settles and Kenji nods, but no live alternative is dramatized and foreclosed. The resolution is contemplative acceptance rather than agency-driven escalation with visible trade-off, holding this in the mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of grief management and the paradox of control (shaping trees vs. inability to shape words) emerges organically through bonsai metaphor and grandmother's encoded wisdom. The compass pointing toward horizon rather than mainland offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Kenji's question without stating a moral. Minor slip: "cerulean regret" recurs as label rather than evolving image, and the phrase "infinite possibility" trends abstract. The particulars (lace instructions, 23-year pine, "trim what was unhealthy") ground the meditation sufficiently to reach the 7-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Kenji's perceptual signature—slow-spoken, measured selection of words, focus on miniature precision—filters all detail. The prose modulates appropriately: longer, contemplative syntax in reflection ("Emotions…they have their own magnetic fields") tightens slightly at the physical work ("precise cuts"). Dialogue to tree and breeze feels voice-natural. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The single minor slip is slight register elevation ("rhythmically placid," "repurposed as a tool for navigating") that occasionally drifts above the lived moment, but remains legible and does not obscure pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifacts lower momentum. "Cerulean regret" recurs as decorative label without evolving mechanical function. Paraphrase loop: "the threads holding not just decorative knots but instructions" followed shortly by "the lace pattern…instructions for diffusing" restates without pressure gain. Template cadence: multiple "he + verb" stems and "the compass" + action structures cluster in the middle third. Stock metaphor: "tides of remembrance that threatened to drown him" is functional but unearned specificity. Figurative density (ghost ship, color of apologies, channels mirroring waterways, roots preserved in small spaces) appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching, creating minor overwriting. These issues do not obscure causality but dull propulsion. Applying patterned-artifact baseline (−0.6 to −0.8 for loops, template stems, and stock strings across the piece) and figurative density (−0.3) brings this to mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bonsai-as-grief-management premise is familiar from therapeutic metaphor templates, and the piece does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or sharp physical consequence. The compass and lace provide texture but function primarily as symbolic vehicles rather than irreplaceable constraints. The accumulation of grandmother's wisdom, encoded instructions, and settling compass is executed competently but reads as a curated assembly of prompt elements rather than an inevitable synthesis. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies (−0.8 for template grief-work arc); partial recovery for the specificity of lace-encoded instructions and the 23-year pine tying to relationship length. No bold structural risk or fresh turn that redefines the frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kenji anchors every beat and his slow-spoken nature filters all perception (setup). His choice to follow lace instructions and work the bonsai technique drives the middle beats (development). At closure he speaks his regret aloud and nods acceptance, returning to work—a decision to continue navigating rather than pursue reconciliation (payoff). His rhythmically placid handling and measured word selection enable the accumulative patience required. However, the final choice is contemplative acceptance rather than a turn that alters another character's state or forecloses a dramatized alternative path. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure (mild, internal navigation) +0.6, specificity (slow-spoken tutor) +0.4. Late first agency test −0.3, swappable internal arc −0.4. Sum suggests ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The compass appears in beat two (weathered palm, erratic needle), is handled and interpreted ("emotions…magnetic fields," grandmother's wisdom that it points toward truths), traced with lace in beat four, and at closure the needle settles toward horizon, providing the final image's directional shift. Setup clear +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage strong +1.2, causal pressure (its settling affirms Kenji's navigation method) +0.8, specificity (ghost ship relic, points to unsaid truths) +0.5. Swappability −0.5 (any symbolic directional tool could serve). Ornamental use −0.3 (described more than handled physically except in one beat). Sum ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Tides of remembrance" is named once in paragraph one ("threatened to drown him") and echoed in the final line ("tides of remembrance continued their eternal ebb and flow") but does not shape on-page tactics. Kenji follows lace instructions and works bonsai; the tide metaphor frames theme without constraining a choice or altering an option. Setup (first paragraph) +0.5, closure reprise +0.4, thematic coloring +0.3. Summary-only −0.6, ornamental (label without action pressure) −0.8, swappable (any grief-persistence image) −0.6, resolves nothing it created −0.3. Sum ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Rhythmically placid" is labeled in paragraph one, reinforced by "measured" voice and "slow-spoken nature." It filters all action (careful clips, tracing lace, nod) but does not visibly trade off against urgency or speed requirement—no scene tests whether placidity costs him an opportunity. Setup +0.5, pervasive filtering across beats +0.9, closure (final nod and return to work match the trait) +0.5, specificity +0.3. Label-only without visible cost −0.5, swappable (calm, deliberate) −0.4. Sum ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Diffuse" appears as the action in paragraph six: "to diffuse painful memories by giving them the same care he gave his bonsai…acknowledge each memory, examine its branches, trim what was unhealthy." This technique is executed in the final beats (precise cuts, testing words). Setup (end of first third) −0.2 for timing, two beats (articulation, execution) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure (enables his acceptance) +0.7, specificity (tied to bonsai method) +0.4. Swappable (process, manage, tend could substitute with minor edits) −0.6, summary-only in paragraph six −0.4. Sum ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lace pattern and its instructions are introduced in paragraph three ("threads holding…instructions for diffusing"), quoted ("follow the stitches southward"), and used in paragraph five (Kenji traces the pattern, mirroring waterways). At closure the lace is fingered in pocket, its pattern "now as familiar as his own heartbeat." Setup +0.6, three mentions (intro, quote, tracing) +1.4, closure callback +0.6, causal (guides his compass navigation) +0.6, specificity (antique, woven by grandmother) +0.5. Summary-only (instructions recounted, not shown altering a tactic in real time) −0.6, swappable (any mnemonic device) −0.5, ornamental in closure (pocket touch without new mechanical use) −0.5. Sum ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The islet after rain is named in the opening line and anchors all spatial choreography. Salt air, wet earth, shore, and gull returns mark time and weather. The isolation mirrors Kenji's retreat and enables solitary work, but the setting does not supply a resource that alters a tactic (e.g., tide blocks return, storm forces choice). Setup immediate +0.8, pervasive spatial grounding +1.4, closure (location unchanged, continuity of place) +0.4, micro-setting (body and bonsai as working space) +0.3. Postcard description (gulls, breeze) without pressure −0.4, no constraint on choice −0.5. Sum ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the severance" is named in paragraphs one and four, establishing emotional time. "Each morning since the severance" and "months ago" frame duration, but no live clock tightens a decision. The passage is contemplative retrospection without urgency. Setup +0.5, two mentions +0.9, thematic frame +0.3. No escalation via time pressure −0.7, vague duration −0.4, swappable (any post-breakup frame) −0.5. Sum ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the color of unspoken apologies" is stated in paragraph four and dramatized through Kenji's verbal testing ("I regret…testing words") and the compass quest for truths. The desire drives his daily return and bonsai work. Setup (end first third) −0.2, two beats (stated, tested at closure) +0.9, closure linkage (speaks apology aloud) +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, specificity (color as metaphor for emotional tone) +0.4. Told more than shown in friction (no counter-want dramatized on page) −0.5, label-only "color" abstraction −0.4. Sum ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Cerulean regret" is named in paragraph five and the penultimate sentence. The tone of measured grief, salt air, wet earth, and slow work coheres across all beats. Modulation is minimal—contemplative throughout—but the final line's "eternal ebb and flow" offers acceptance rather than static sorrow. Setup (first third) +0.5, closure reprise +0.7, coherence across turns +0.6, modulation (slight lift at end) +0.4. Single static mood dominates −0.5, label-only "cerulean" without image evolution −0.5, swappable (melancholy, wistful) −0.4. Sum ~5.7.</comment>
