<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's "warmly inquisitive nature" is asserted but never acts as a constraint or generator of micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation "to seek out the joy beneath anguish" arrives as declaration in paragraph three without prior embodiment or conflict. The final step through the elevator doors reads as acceptance of a pre-scripted role rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("affectionate detachment from the pain") rather than particular and embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early, but the Conceptual Repricing at closure—Elara inheriting a "legacy of finding joy beneath anguish"—lacks on-page cost; the diary author prepared everything, removing agency and price from the ending. The elevator's mechanical ascent provides a time structure, yet no reversal or tightening alters Elara's options; each floor simply reveals the next piece of exposition. The causal lens collapses when the goggles and diary solve themselves without Elara's struggle, and the final image asserts theme rather than dramatizing consequence. Cost proof fails: no sentence shows what Elara forfeits or risks by stepping through those doors.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crystalline elevator and icebound spire provide vivid anchors, and the "scattered light from a passing sunbeam" momentarily constrains the decryption action at floor seven. Sensory detail—fogged breath, darkening sky, frozen architecture—is selective and atmospheric. However, the spire functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental feature limits Elara's choices or charges the final image, and the ten-floor structure becomes a countdown rather than a spatial crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the diary—is signaled early but resolved by coincidence (finding the goggles, angling them perfectly) rather than protagonist agency. No meaningful tightening occurs; each floor simply unlocks the next block of exposition without forcing a trade-off or narrowing options. The final "continuation of a legacy" is declared without on-page cost, and Elara's "ascent" is a promotion she neither earned through struggle nor refused with consequence. Escalation collapses into sequential revelation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme "joy beneath anguish" is stated explicitly in paragraph three and repeated in the final line, bypassing emergence from particulars. The diary's accounts of "secret airship flights" and "small freedoms within constraints" gesture toward resonance but remain abstract rather than grounded in Elara's own struggle. The final image—stepping forward with goggles and diary—asserts legacy rather than offering a non-literal answer to a dramatized question. Label-driven thematic echo in the closing sentence ("affectionate detachment from the pain but profound connection to the joy") triggers the Q5 penalty for overt articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter leans toward Elara's curious perspective ("hadn't realized," "secret studies"). However, diction drifts into elevated register unsuited to a servant ("affectionate detachment," "warmly inquisitive nature," "profound connection") without irony or stress justification. The narrative withholds the goggles' decryption property until the perfect moment, creating artificial suspense rather than elision with cost. Psychic distance is consistent but voice lacks particularity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear in the opening ("always seemed a realm forbidden…yet here she was, summoned") and mid-story ("unfold the diary's secrets…unfolded the final pages…unfold the new pages"). Template cadence clusters in paragraph three: "unfolded the edges…unfolded the diary's secrets…Elara discovered…Elara understood." Register drift into abstract philosophical phrasing ("affectionate detachment," "profound connection to the joy that lay beneath it") clashes with the grounded elevator setting. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, but scaffolding ("the diary's mysterious author," "the rigid hierarchy she had always accepted") pads rather than propels.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—servant discovers encrypted diary via magical goggles during elevator ride—assembles familiar fantasy tropes (chosen-one inheritance, hidden mentor, magical decoder) without transformation. The "scattered light" decryption mechanic and ten-floor countdown offer structural specificity, but emotional and thematic territory remains generic: finding joy, breaking hierarchy, inheriting legacy. The final revelation that "the goggles were deliberately left for her" removes surprise and stakes, defaulting to predetermined destiny. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She picks up the goggles, angles them, reads the diary, and steps forward—all passive receptions of information rather than decisions under pressure. The "ascending servant" framing is setup only; her servanthood never constrains a middle choice or complicates the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The goggles appear early (paragraph one), enable the decryption mechanic at floor seven, and are carried through the final image. They function causally in one major beat (revealing the diary's text) and are mentioned at closure. However, their use is mechanical rather than contested, and no cost or trade-off attaches to their discovery or deployment. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with causal involvement in one beat places them in the mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is introduced early, shapes the middle revelation sequence, and appears in the final image. Its decryption drives one key turn (floor seven onward) and the protagonist's goal. However, the discovery is solved by the goggles rather than by Elara's effort, and the diary's contents are exposition rather than constraint. Three gates present, one beat of causal work, but swappable with any other "hidden mentor's message" artifact caps it near the 5–6 boundary.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is asserted once in paragraph one and echoed in paragraph four but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The trait exists as label only, without friction or trade-off. Ornamental mention, no causal pressure, no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Unfold" recurs structurally (diary pages, edges of goggles, new pages of her story) and organizes the revelation beats. However, the action is literal and metaphorical in parallel without tension; each unfold simply advances exposition rather than forcing a choice. Present across beats and at closure, but easily swappable with "discover" or "reveal" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Through scattered light" is signaled at floor seven and directly enables the decryption. The mechanic is specific and its optics matter to the single key turn. However, it appears only once and resolves the problem it did not help create. One-gate participation (middle development only), introduced past the first third, caps it below 5.0 despite clear causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The icebound spire is anchored early, provides vivid atmosphere (frozen architecture, darkening sky, cold air), and the ten-floor structure organizes time. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics; it functions as countdown and backdrop. The crystalline walls enable the light beam at floor seven, offering one moment of causal involvement. Present at setup and closure, shapes one beat, but remains largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The ten-floor ascent is signaled immediately and tracked across the entire piece (floors five, six, seven, eighth, ninth, tenth named on the page). It creates urgency and organizes the revelation sequence. However, no choice is tightened by the time pressure; Elara reads at leisure and the elevator simply delivers her to the ordained endpoint. Strong setup and closure participation, moderate development involvement, but no cost tied to the clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To seek out the joy beneath anguish" is declared in paragraph three as Elara's established motivation and repeated in the final line. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices, and no on-page friction between want and cost appears. The diary's revelations satisfy the goal without obstacle. Label-only presence with thematic echo, minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is named only in the final sentence and does not modulate through the prior beats. The narration remains neutral and slightly elevated throughout, without tonal shift under pressure or coherent emotional coloring that charges the ending. Late introduction, static application, ornamental use.</comment>
