<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is heavily abstract and conceptual ("cartographer of what never was") rather than embodied and contradictory. The drone strike backstory is summarized, not dramatized, and his motives remain declarative ("bleak exhilaration") without showing internal conflict acting in scene. The final choice to "hunt" is asserted through preparation gestures, not earned by prior micro-choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. Therapy-speak intrudes ("anticipatory horror and ecstasy") at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—who Elias is and where he is remain unclear until deep into the piece, creating drift. The drive lens is ambiguous: Accumulative/Textural patterns (the geode, potential pools) compete with Causal gestures (initiating the hunt) but neither coheres at closure. The ending offers preparation and declaration ("prepared for the descent") rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the cost is future-tense and abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory and thermosphere setting are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the piece in isolation and metaphysics. However, spatial choreography is vague—console, screens, and Elias's position within the circular room lack tactile grounding. The geode crystal constrains perception (mirroring screen patterns) but does not alter a present choice. The classroom target appears only in the final beat, too late to shape tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping potential energy—is signaled early but remains abstract and declarative. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Elias moves from discovering patterns to entering coordinates without a meaningful obstacle or cost that narrows options. The "hunt" is preparation, not pressure, and the ending defers consequence. Agency is missing: the protagonist observes and decides to descend, but no prior choice forecloses a path with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise—grief as a mapping problem, potential as resource—and the geode serves as a recurring image. However, the final beat asserts theme ("infinite repository of what might have been") rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The classroom target is introduced too late to function as a charged particular. The piece avoids overt moralizing but drifts toward abstraction rather than grounding theme in a specific, irreversible consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elias's perspective. Diction is elevated and poetic ("orthogonal to the vector," "intangibly tangible") but remains consistent as a voice choice. However, register occasionally drifts into pseudo-academic abstraction ("perturbation theory," "concentrations of potential energy") that reads expository rather than character-filtered. No dialogue. Perceptual signature is present (geode patterns, mathematical proofs) but the prose does not degrade under stress; Elias remains articulate throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("wreckage of the man," "mathematics and metaphysics merged," "theology of the potential realm") without taught pattern or escalation, creating overwriting that blurs clarity. Paraphrase loops appear: "what might have been, what could be" recurs with synonym churn. The final beat stacks abstraction ("anticipatory horror and ecstasy," "intangibly, tangibly") without concrete image. Template cadence is present in mid-section beats ("The monitor displayed… His bride's laughter echoed… These were places…"). Information density is moderate; many lines elaborate concept rather than advance pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—mapping unused potential via grief and physics—is conceptually inventive and synthesizes emotional and speculative registers. However, the Potential Resonance Mapper and perturbation theory read as prompt-fulfillment devices introduced without grounded mechanics or constraint. The geode-as-resonator is a fresh touch. The ending defers the hunt to a classroom target mentioned only in the final beat, undercutting specificity. The piece commits to its vision but does not transform the grief-as-exploration template into an irreversible particular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his survivor status frames the backstory, but his choices are observational and preparatory rather than decisive. The wedding and drone strike are summarized, not dramatized. He initiates the algorithm and enters coordinates, but these are setup moves without on-page cost or reversal. The element shapes context but does not create key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The geode appears in three beats: opening (texture contrast), mid-section (mirroring screen patterns), and closing (vibrating with signature). However, it is handled passively—Elias runs his thumb over it or pulls it out—without using it to constrain a choice or alter tactics. The final reprise (vibration) signals connection but does not reweight prior material with cost. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" is mentioned once mid-piece as a past event ("had come to him in fragments during his recovery") but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. It functions as backstory context, not a live constraint. The concept is thematic rather than causal. Present, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" appears twice as a descriptor for potential realities and the final hunt object. It is a conceptual label rather than a trait that constrains action. No visible tradeoff or enabled move depends on this paradox. The attribute colors tone but does not alter choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "hunt" is the story's primary action, signaled early and named repeatedly. Elias initiates algorithms, discovers patterns, and prepares for descent. However, the hunt itself is deferred; the story ends with preparation rather than execution. The action shapes the arc but does not create a major turn with cost on the page. Essential to setup and ending participation, but swappable for "search" or "pursuit" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Perturbation theory" is named once mid-piece ("his hunt through perturbation theory, analyzing how small alterations in the timeline") as a method for analyzing timelines. Its mechanics do not shape attempts or constrain tactics; it is expository dressing. Mentioned, not demonstrated. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The floating observatory is introduced early and anchors the setting. Power failures bookend the piece (humming fails, circuit breakers cool, systems stabilize), creating a structural frame. However, the setting does not pressure choices—Elias moves freely through console work without spatial or resource constraint. The thermosphere and isolation are described but do not alter tactics. The observatory enables the premise but could be swapped for any isolated research station.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"While circuit breakers cool" appears in the opening beat as a countdown framing device. Elias counts seconds until generators kick in, but the timeframe does not tighten later decisions or create urgency. The power stabilizes off-page and the cooling period is not tracked or used to compress choice. Present in setup, absent from escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to find pooled potential is stated early and drives Elias's algorithm work and coordinate entry. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. No friction between this want and a competing cost appears on the page; the hunt proceeds smoothly. The motivation shapes the arc but lacks on-page opposition or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named once mid-piece and appears implicitly in the final beat ("anticipatory horror and ecstasy"). The tone is coherent—melancholic wonder—but static; it does not modulate under pressure or shift at closure. The diction supports the mood, yet the ending repeats rather than charges the tone with a decisive image. Functional and consistent, but not transformative.</comment>
