<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains abstract throughout—a "chaste courtesan" label without contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphor ("whisper in a world of silence," "paradox draped in silk") rather than embodied, character-particular thought. The untangling action at closure feels unmotivated by prior on-page struggle; we see no established habit, fear, or want tested. Emotional states are asserted ("gasped but did not falter," "trembling") without the messy simultaneity of genuine crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is vague: we never learn who she is beyond the label, where the courtyard sits in time or space, or what "chaste courtesan" means in this world (−0.4 in Q2 for unclear anchors past ~120 words). The closure—untangling threads and walking away whole—occurs on the page, but cost is declared rather than dramatized: "she was whole" tells the change without showing a forfeited path or visible price. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (pattern of echoes and threads reweighting her stance), but the pattern is introduced late and resolved in a single sequence without earlier causal grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The silver courtyard and prism sanctuary offer vivid sensory anchors (snow, crystalline facets, refracted colors), and the threads pulse like living things. However, the setting remains postcard-static: snow and stars do not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The sanctuary's interior mechanics (how threads are woven, why they resist) are asserted but not shown through tactile interaction. Micro-setting credit: the threads themselves function as setting-objects that she manipulates, pushing the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escaping conformity's lullaby—is signaled early but never tested by a live on-page opponent or cost. The untangling sequence offers three threads with escalating difficulty, yet none forces a trade-off: each dissolves into starlight without visible loss. The "final thread" that "snapped" could have been the moment of agency, but her choice is foregone; no option is foreclosed. Pressure remains conceptual rather than embodied, and coincidence (the threads simply yield) resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme—freedom through embracing fractured selfhood—emerges through the prism image and the harvest-of-echoes conceit. The final paragraph risks overt statement ("true freedom was not in defying expectations, but in choosing which ones to keep"), though the prism metaphor and the laugh echo offer a non-literal answer. The "lullaby of conformity" motif recurs but feels prompt-like rather than rooted in scene particulars. Subtext operates in the echoes (lover's broken promise, half-truths) but is told rather than dramatized, limiting resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, but the voice is generically elevated rather than character-particular: "alarming serenity," "bodied poetic," "paradox draped in silk" read as authorial ornament, not the courtesan's perceptual signature. Diction drifts into abstract lyricism ("harvest of echoes," "fragments of a song others had composed") that blurs embodied immediacy. Filter verbs ("she felt warmth spread," "seemed to hold its breath") stack without voice motivation. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.5 for density in peak beats). Mixed metaphors: "crystals beneath her bare feet feared to shatter" anthropomorphizes snow, then "the harvest of echoes was not sound but memory—fragments… trapped like fireflies" shifts vehicle mid-image. Paraphrase loops: "she was still a chaste courtesan, still a paradox, but now she was whole" restates the closure twice in one paragraph. Template cadence: "She was X. She was Y. She was Z" runs through multiple beats. Scaffold phrasing ("the night was quiet, but she was no longer alone") summarizes rather than shows the closure image. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prism-sanctuary + threads-of-light mechanics offer a fresh visual frame, and the "chaste courtesan defying conformity" angle avoids the most obvious paths. However, the core emotional arc—woman escapes social constraint through symbolic self-discovery—follows a familiar template without lived-in transformation. The untangling action could be swapped for mirror-shattering or mask-removal with minimal change. One specific detail elevates: the laugh that bursts from the final thread is her own, unbidden, a concrete echo rather than abstract triumph.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The chaste courtesan is present throughout and makes the final choice to untangle threads, but her decisions do not create earlier turns—she arrives at the sanctuary unopposed and the conflict begins only in the second half. Observation and metaphor dominate her on-page time. Swappable: another seeker (priestess, exile) could perform the same arc with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary appears early (setup), houses the thread-untangling action (development), and "stood empty behind her" at closure (payoff). It enables the harvest mechanic and its crystalline facets refract light, but its specific properties (why prisms? why only under starlight?) do not constrain her tactics or evolve with use. It is causally present in two beats and shapes the ending image, but a temple, mirror-hall, or garden could substitute with modest rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The harvest of echoes is named early and drives the central sequence (untangling threads releases echoes), satisfying setup and development. However, "harvest" remains metaphorical: she does not gather, store, or spend echoes in ways that alter tactics. The concept shapes the stakes thematically but does not change her options—she simply untangles until done. Swappability: "releasing shadows," "shattering bindings," or "melting chains" would serve the same function.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" appears once as a descriptor ("her fingers worked faster, bodied poetic in their precision") without constraining or enabling on-page action. No cost, trade-off, or tactical consequence flows from this trait. Ornamental mention only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unlock" is signaled early ("Tonight, she would unlock the truth of herself") and governs the climax (untangling threads unlocks echoes, which unlocks her wholeness). The action appears in two beats and defines the closure. However, the verb is generic—"release," "free," or "open" could replace it without structural change. It drives the plot but lacks irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is the method for the unlock action, introduced at the sanctuary entry and demonstrated across three beats (pulling the first thread, loosening a knot of three, snapping the final red thread). The mechanics matter: tangled threads resist, and her precision shapes the outcome. Early signal, development across beats, and closure participation all present. Slight swappability: "severing cords," "weaving light," or "dissolving knots" could function similarly with modest rewrites, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The silver courtyard under snow frames the opening and closing images (setup and payoff) and supplies the sensory anchor (cold, snow, silence). However, it does not constrain her movement or supply resources that affect outcome—she crosses it unopposed. The sanctuary interior is where the conflict occurs; the courtyard remains a threshold. Postcard description with lyric reprise, but no middle development or tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Between sigh and smile" is invoked twice ("the space between sigh and smile" in mid-story, "beyond the space between sigh and smile" at closure) but remains abstract. No clock, urgency, or ticking pressure shapes her decisions; the untangling could take minutes or hours without altering the text. Ornamental thematic phrase, not a functional timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation to defy the lullaby of conformity is declared early and drives her journey to the sanctuary. The lullaby whispers during the knot-untangling beat, creating brief friction ("Let it be. Accept it. You are safe here"), and she refuses. At closure, "the lullaby of conformity faded." Setup, one moment of friction in development, and payoff all present. However, the cost of defiance is asserted rather than dramatized—no forfeited safety, relationship, or resource appears on the page. The motivation shapes one choice (continuing to untangle despite the whisper) but does not generate sustained conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Alarming serenity" is named once in the opening ("The night air hummed with an alarming serenity") and modulates through the sequence: quiet courtyard, colder sanctuary interior, "the night was quiet" at closure. Tone shifts subtly from expectant hush to revelation without breaking coherence. The oxymoron charges the setting and recurs implicitly in "the snow whispered her name, and the stars above shimmered like approving eyes." Present in opening and ending with consistent emotional coloring, but not tested under peak pressure—no moment where serenity becomes truly alarming or forces a choice.</comment>
