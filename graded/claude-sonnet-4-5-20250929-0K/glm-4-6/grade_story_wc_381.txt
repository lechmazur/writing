<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The summoner's interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("tranquil blaze," "mapping silence") rather than embodied contradiction or concrete micro-choices under pressure. The prophecy motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses; we see only smooth execution without genuine struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path. The final "satisfaction" reads as summary rather than earned change through on-page friction. No secondary character is present to test relationship dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when remain abstract until well past 120 words ("solitary summoner," "nocturnal haven" are generic placeholders without spatial anchors). The drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures at Accumulative/Textural (layered silence imagery) but lacks a decisive tightening or cost-laden reconfiguration at closure. The ending summarizes triumph ("the prophecy was hushed") without on-page cost or a before/after legible through action. Causality is present but the closure unit dissolves into assertion rather than dramatized change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The brook and nocturnal haven provide atmospheric detail but remain postcard-level; spatial choreography is vague (kneeling "by" the haven, walking "with the flow" without concrete distance or obstacles). The origami wing is handled across beats, yet its physical properties (paper, creases, transformation into a sphere) are asserted rather than shown constraining choice. Sensory selection leans heavily visual and metaphoric without urgency-driven narrowing. The setting does not meaningfully constrain the summoner's success.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is declared early but never tested on the page with a visible tradeoff or narrowing of options. The summoner's will "flows through" the wing without resistance, cost, or escalation; the prophecy simply yields. No reversal or deepening occurs; the arc is smooth assertion of mastery. Agency is present but the cost remains conceptual and off-page, failing to foreclose a path with felt consequence scaled to the length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (silence as peace versus weapon) is stated rather than enacted through specific choices with cost. The final image offers "tranquil blaze" and "smoothed hush" as abstract satisfaction without a non-literal answer to the central question. Recurrence of phrases ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush") reads as ornamental rather than reweighting prior material. The piece avoids thematic sermonizing but also lacks the earned resonance that would elevate theme from concept to felt truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Voice is ornate and consistent but drifts into elevated register that clashes with moment-to-moment urgency ("terrestrially cosmic," "leached of motion," "stitching the night together"). Psychic distance remains stable but the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; the summoner notices in stock poetic terms. Purposeful compression is attempted but reads as opacity rather than taught pattern. Free indirect style is clean, but the diction feels authorial rather than focalizer-specific under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("drew bow," "starlight edges," "tranquil blaze," "smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalties. Paraphrase loops appear ("the prophecy was hushed" / "the prophecy's code was gone"), and template cadence runs ("The summoner [verb]" across multiple sentences). Synonym churn ("hush," "silence," "quiet," "stillness") substitutes for escalation. Mixed metaphors ("blaze" as "quiet," "cosmic" as "terrestrially small") violate coherence. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally and applying cumulative deductions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise—silencing a prophecy through silence—is conceptually interesting but executed through stock mystical imagery (origami crane, murmuring brook, moonlight) without transformation. The summoner's mastery is asserted rather than earned through specific constraint or lived cost. The ending offers no fresh inflection; the prophecy yields without surprise or non-obvious turn. The piece hedges toward safe middle-ground lyricism, avoiding bold risk that would heighten stakes or challenge the reader's expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The summoner is present throughout but his choices (unfolding the wing, whispering, pressing his thumb) do not create turns; the prophecy yields without resistance. Setup is clear, middle use is ornamental (observation), and closure is summary ("he had done enough") rather than decision-driven change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The origami wing appears early, is handled in multiple beats (unfolding, lifting, transforming into a sphere, tucked away), and is present at closure. However, its transformation is asserted rather than shown constraining choice; swappable with another magical object. Mid-band for functional but replaceable integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" recurs as a label throughout but does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. It functions as thematic echo rather than constraint. The summoner's method (out-silencing silence) is told, not dramatized through cost or tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears as descriptor for the wing's scale but does not constrain or enable action with cost. It is ornamental phrasing, label-only without visible tradeoff or mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Flow" appears in multiple beats (flowing with currents, summoner's will flows, moving with the flow of water) but functions as metaphor rather than action that redefines options. Swappable with "merge" or "align" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is mentioned early ("spent years mapping silence") and again at closure ("he mapped the silence around him") but the mechanics are abstract; we do not see the method constrain or enable a specific attempt with cost. Functional but generic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven and brook are present early and at closure, framing the action. The brook's pause and resumed murmur offer light participation in the ending. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome; it is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" appears in the opening but time remains untracked. No clock tightens decisions; the summoner completes his task without temporal pressure or cost. The timeframe is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation to hush the prophecy is stated early and frames the task, but it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or friction with cost. The summoner succeeds smoothly without visible sacrifice or renunciation. Functional but not deeply pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" recurs across the text as a tonal label but does not modulate with pressure; the tone remains static and elevated rather than charging the final image with earned tension. Present but ornamental.</comment>
