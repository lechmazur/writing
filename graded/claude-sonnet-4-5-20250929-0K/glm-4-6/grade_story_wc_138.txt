<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The immortal's motivation—"to discover what happens after goodbye"—is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical musing ("dimensionally aware, a curse that turned the infinite into a beige repetition") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final dissolution reads as an asserted transformation rather than one earned by prior causal struggle; no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from concrete action. Internal conflict is summarized as boredom rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the immortal's dissolution reweights his quest for finality. However, orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague: "crystalline wall," "escondite," "chamber where geometry frayed" lack spatial grounding past the ~120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure unit—vortex swallowing form and will—lands on the page, but cost remains abstract ("unspooled from the fabric of existence") rather than dramatized through a concrete forfeiture or visible consequence. Linkage is pattern-based (amulet thrums → storm peaks → geometry folds) but the because/therefore chain is thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "prismatic escondite" and "crystalline labyrinth" are named repeatedly but never constrain a choice or shape tactics; the immortal "moved through" it without spatial friction. Sensory detail leans heavily on visual abstraction ("light-prisms," "watercolors," "impossible angles") without grounding in body, tool, or micro-setting that alters action. The amulet fragment and magnetic fields function as thematic devices rather than objects with weight, temperature, or resistance that the character must navigate. The setting does not pressure the climactic moment—geometry "frayed" conveniently where needed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what follows goodbye—is declared early but never tested by a choice that narrows options on the page. The protagonist's agency is passive observation and a single deliberate press of the amulet into a hollow; no prior reversal or cost shapes this final act. The storm and magnetic fields escalate in description but do not force a tactical shift or impose a visible price. The closure reads as an automatic unmaking triggered by placing the fragment, not a decision with felt sacrifice or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—finality, escape through self-negation—emerges clearly but is stated rather than earned through concrete particulars: "the intrigue's true face, not an escape but a complete unmaking." The final paragraph moralizes directly: "He had discovered what happens after goodbye: nothing, and everything, all at once." The amulet and escondite recur but do not accumulate new meaning through action; their thematic charge is asserted in lyric summation. Subtext is thin; interiority declares meaning rather than allowing it to surface through image and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("cartographer of unseen maps," "delicious, terrifying treason") that clashes with the immediacy of dissolution. Psychic distance remains consistent, yet perceptual signature is generic: the immortal notices in the same lush, philosophic register throughout, with no compression under peak stress. No dialogue. Compression and lyricism are purposeful but not taught early enough to feel like a pattern; the piece reads as overwrought rather than controlled accumulation. The final third stacks metaphors ("ghost in his own machine," "story folded into the lattice") without tightening rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is extreme and sustained without pattern-teaching or payoff: "silent, beautiful violence," "hushed thunder," "origami collapse," "poignant knife twist," "delicious, terrifying treason" cluster in peak beats, obscuring causality (−0.7). Paraphrase loops abound: "The spatial mutiny was over" / "The spatial mutiny's legacy" and "the amulet fragment waited" / "The amulet, its curiosity sated" restate without advancing (−0.4). Template cadence appears in the final third: "The spatial mutiny was over… / The amulet… / The hushed thunder…" (−0.5). One stray character ("安静") breaks immersion. Clarity at closure is significantly dulled by metaphor stack and synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The immortal-seeking-finality premise is familiar but executed with lyric ambition. The "spatial mutiny" and "dimensionally aware" labels add conceptual texture but do not transform the core arc—passive figure triggers device, dissolves—into a non-obvious synthesis. The magnetic-field method and amulet fragment feel chosen for prompt compliance rather than inevitability. Risk-taking in diction and structure is present but undermined by overwrought metaphor and abstraction that obscure rather than heighten stakes. The piece reaches for originality through vocabulary rather than through a fresh moral calculus or grounded surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The bored immortal frames the opening and makes the final press, satisfying setup and closure gates. However, his agency is limited to one deliberate action (inserting the amulet) after centuries of passive observation. The trait "bored" is told rather than shown through on-page choices that alter tactics. Causal pressure is thin: the decision to "let go" is asserted, not earned through prior reversals or costs. Swappability is moderate—another jaded, eternal figure could perform the same function with minor edits. No specific cost tied to his boredom constrains the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cursed amulet fragment appears in setup (hand, thrumming), development (traced through invisible lines, responding to storm), and payoff (pressed into hollow, glows white-hot, lies dormant after). It drives two beats: the tracing and the final insertion. Causal linkage is present but mechanical—the fragment unlocks the vortex because the text declares it does. Cost connection is weak; no visible sacrifice accompanies its use. Specificity is moderate: "smooth and dark as a sealed promise," but its cursed nature has no on-page consequence. Removing it would break closure, but substituting another key-object would require only minor rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny is named four times as a thematic label ("his stage," "would either succeed or collapse," "was over," "legacy") but never dramatized as a tactic or choice that narrows options. It does not constrain the protagonist's method or impose a cost; the geometry "frayed" conveniently where needed. The concept is ornamental—repeated to satisfy prompt requirements without altering the causal chain. Setup and thematic reprise are present, but middle development and payoff are absent. Swappable with "dimensional rebellion" or similar abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Dimensionally aware is introduced early ("a curse that turned the infinite into a beige repetition") and mentioned at closure ("screaming as it was unspooled"). However, it functions as a label for the immortal's ennui rather than a trait that enables or constrains action with visible cost. No on-page moment shows him leveraging or struggling against this awareness in a way that alters tactics. The trait is told, not demonstrated through choice or tradeoff. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Intrigue is named twice ("had begun centuries ago," "the intrigue's true face") but never enacted as an on-page action. The protagonist's method is observation and a single press; no scheming, maneuvering, or multi-step plan unfolds in scene. The element reads as a backstory summary rather than a dramatized verb. It does not drive major turns—setup is told, middle development is absent, and closure hinges on the amulet press, not intrigue. Functional as thematic color but replaceable with "quest" or "experiment."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Magnetic fields are signaled in setup ("The amulet responded to the storm's magnetic fields"), shape the middle beat ("traced the amulet's path through invisible lines of force"), and coalesce at closure ("held the moment," protagonist "scattered across the magnetic fields"). They enable the final act—storm peaks, fields align, amulet activates—satisfying all three gates. However, mechanics remain abstract: how the fields "lever against reality's framework" is told, not shown through a visible cost or constraint. Specificity is low; another energy source (gravitational waves, temporal flux) could substitute with minor edits. The method matters structurally but lacks irreplaceable texture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is named throughout (walls, labyrinth, chamber where geometry frayed) and present in the final image ("returned to its quiet, patient hum," "held the light of this new void"). Setup and payoff are clear. However, it does not constrain the protagonist's movement or choices—he "moved through" it without spatial friction or cost. The setting is atmospheric but functionally inert; it could be replaced with another exotic prison (temporal loop, void fortress) without altering the causal chain. Lyric reprise charges the ending but lacks middle development where the environment pressures tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The solar storm is present in setup ("raged," painting the void), drives the middle beat ("peaked," bathing the labyrinth in lightning, triggering the amulet's pulse), and bookends closure ("subsided," "final beams painted the walls"). It imposes a temporal constraint: the protagonist must act when the storm aligns the magnetic fields. The timeframe tightens decision—without the peak, the amulet would not activate—satisfying causal pressure across all three gates. However, the clock is loose; no sentence-level urgency or countdown sharpens the moment. Cost linkage is indirect: the storm enables rather than imposes sacrifice. Solid integration but not indispensable—another celestial event could serve with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover what happens after goodbye" is stated in setup ("what he coveted was not freedom, but the answer"), restated in the climax ("his motivation burned bright"), and answered at closure ("He had discovered what happens after goodbye: nothing, and everything"). It frames the entire arc and drives the final choice to press the amulet and "let go." However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted on-page choices. No visible cost or trade-off accompanies the pursuit—boredom aches, but the protagonist faces no friction or sacrifice in acting. The motivation is causal glue but lacks embodied tension. Removing it would hollow thematic resonance but the plot mechanics (amulet + storm + press) would function without it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Hushed thunder appears in setup ("silent, beautiful violence," "strokes of hushed thunder"), recurs at the middle beat ("hushed thunder of the storm filled the silence"), and charges the final image ("The hushed thunder of his departure was the only sound that mattered now"). The oxymoron modulates with pressure: quiet menace in setup, peak intensity at the vortex, and elegiac resonance at closure. Tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the protagonist's muted transcendence. However, the phrase is repeated mechanically rather than evolved through action, and the tone does not shift enough under peak stress to heighten pressure—it remains lush and philosophical throughout. Solid lyric cohesion but lacks dynamic range. Removing the phrase would reduce thematic texture but not break the closure effect.</comment>
