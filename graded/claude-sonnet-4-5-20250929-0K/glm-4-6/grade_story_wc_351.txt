<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara remains purely cerebral throughout—her "helix-minded" approach and "quaking reverie" are asserted repeatedly but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The text tells us she's "designed not for this world but for what this world had been unable to become" without dramatizing the cost of that alienation. No relationship pressure exists; no secondary character tests her conviction. The transformation is declared complete rather than earned through visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No legible closure unit appears. The piece opens with Elara already at the canyon, already transformed, already equipped, and ends with her "already planning her next expedition"—a pure status quo. The "archeologist of abandoned dreams" frame is announced in paragraph six and never tested; no decision narrows options, no reversal changes knowledge. The drive lens cannot be inferred because no pressure accumulates: she activates equipment, witnesses visions, records findings, and packs up without friction. Orientation is delayed until paragraph three (neural interface mention), but the larger failure is the absence of any decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon supplies vivid images ("parted synapse," "infinite shadows and possibilities") but functions as backdrop only—it does not constrain a single choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The broken periscope mirror is described three times but never handled or used; its fractured reflections remain metaphorical. Spatial choreography is vague (equipment "arranged," neural interface "adjusted") with no tactile engagement. The Orientation Test penalty was routed to Q2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—excavating abandoned dreams—is declared but never dramatized as under threat. No antagonist, obstacle, or internal friction appears; the neural interface works perfectly, the visions arrive on cue, and Elara's method succeeds without complication. The text summarizes her years of research and gradual expansion but shows no on-page reversal, tightening, or cost. "Quaking reverie" is mentioned twice but never embodied as a risk or price. Agency is absent: she is a passive receiver of visions, not a protagonist whose decisions foreclose paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Theme is over-articulated: "archeologist of abandoned dreams," "bridge between lost dreams and present reality," "evolutionary" transformation, "reshape human potential." The final paragraph explicitly states her purpose ("finding order within apparent randomness, truth within brokenness") rather than letting image or action imply it. The broken periscope mirror is invoked as symbol four times without dramatized meaning-shift. No specific experience earns the epiphanies; the text asserts wisdom ("she understood why she had always felt out of place") without grounding it in struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The prose remains stable in third-person limited, but Elara's perceptual signature is generic: "helix-minded" and "chaotically precise" are repeated labels without distinct syntax or idiom. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs and abstraction dominate ("felt out of place," "understood," "could perceive," "might reshape") where concrete perception would sharpen voice. The register drifts into academic phrasing ("synaptic plasticity," "quantum entanglement," "glial cells") without modulation for urgency. Paragraph-level coherence holds, but the voice lacks specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 10–11 restate the synaptic-plasticity method; paragraphs 20–21 recycle the "helix-minded" and "chaotically precise" motifs; paragraphs 28–29 repeat the transformation claim. Template cadence appears in "The engineer carefully…," "Elara trembled as…," "The archeologist of abandoned dreams was finally…" Stock metaphors recur ("sugar in hot water," "bridge between"). The text summarizes pivotal beats (years of research, the antique-shop insight, dawn recordings) rather than dramatizing them. Synonym churn: "modify" appears eleven times. Artifacts touch closure (final paragraph loops earlier phrasing). Apply −1.4 baseline plus −0.3 for closure contamination; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The premise—quantum-entangled collective dreams accessed via neural modification—matches speculative-fiction templates without fresh synthesis. The broken periscope mirror as metaphor for consciousness is signaled overtly rather than discovered. The antique-shop insight (paragraph 15) and the canyon expedition are told rather than shown. Emotional beats are generic ("trembled," "heart filled with purpose"). The transformation-test fails: swap "entangled memories" for "ancestral echoes" or "morphic fields" and the arc is unchanged. No risk-taking heightens stakes; the piece hedges into abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no decisions that alter tactics. She "activates the sequence" (paragraph 19) without friction; visions arrive without complication. Observation dominates; agency is absent. Her "helix-minded" trait is asserted six times but never constrains a choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The broken periscope mirror appears in four beats (paragraphs 5, 14, 25, 35) but is never handled or used—only described. It supplies metaphor ("fractured yet coherent," "multiple viewpoints") without altering tactics or charging the closure with new weight. Static ornament.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Entangled memories are explained (paragraphs 9, 17) and witnessed (paragraph 20) but do not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The concept is present as theme and exposition, not as a constraint or enabler of protagonist action. Mid-functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Chaotically precise" is asserted in paragraphs 4, 8, 27, 36 as a label for Elara's equipment arrangement and mental approach. No on-page action demonstrates the trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. Ornamental repetition.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Modify" appears eleven times across neural pathways (paragraphs 10, 13, 18, 23), consciousness (paragraph 9), society (paragraph 30), and her own architecture (paragraph 22). The action is present and thematic but easily swappable with "reshape," "reprogram," or "adapt." It does not drive a single major turn with visible cost. Functional but generic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Synaptic plasticity is named in paragraphs 10, 13, 18, 28, 31—setup, middle exposition, and closure mention. The method is explained (paragraph 13: stimulating glial cells) but its mechanics never matter on the page: no failure, no calibration choice, no price for its use. Present across beats but causally inert.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon is established in paragraph 1, returns in paragraphs 6–7, 19–20 (transformation), and 37 (dawn cresting). It supplies vivid backdrop and tonal coherence but does not constrain a single choice or provide a resource that alters outcome. Atmospheric but passive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Profound transformation" is declared in paragraph 3 and repeated in paragraph 28 but never tracked as a live clock that tightens decisions. Time is vague: "this period," "years of research," "coming months," "another day." No urgency or deadline shapes tactics. Ornamental frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>The motivation is stated clearly in paragraph 6 and repeated in paragraphs 24, 36. It frames the expedition but is never conflicted or tested—no want-versus-fear friction, no cost dramatized on the page. Told rather than embodied through choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" appears in paragraphs 12, 25, 37 as a label for Elara's visionary state. The tone is static—no modulation under pressure, no cadence shift at closure. The phrase describes rather than charges the final image. Present but not integral.</comment>
