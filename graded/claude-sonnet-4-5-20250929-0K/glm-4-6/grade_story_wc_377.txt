<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The bell tuner remains abstract throughout; "seasonally mute" is declared but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. Interiority consists of generic observations ("his heart pounding a rhythm") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The protagonist observes and arranges rather than making a difficult decision that forecloses a path, leaving motivation label-only. No internal conflict dramatized; the piece tells us he preserves wonder without showing what he sacrifices or risks.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—"whispering bluff above the clouds" anchors location but "who" remains vague ("bell tuner, whose name had long been lost") and "when" ("after words became unnecessary") stays abstract past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The piece follows an observational, descriptive arc without a legible causal turn or escalation: the tuner positions the fragment, adjusts a lever, watches it melt—no decision narrows options or changes knowledge. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is conceptual only ("the color of wonder would endure") without visible forfeiture on the page. Under an inferred Accumulative lens, the density does not meaningfully shift at the end; the final image repeats prior assertions rather than reweighting them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bluff, clouds, and workshop are visually rendered but remain postcard settings; none constrains a choice or alters tactics. The iceberg fragment is described ("edges glisten-ing") yet never pressures the protagonist's actions—it melts passively. Spatial choreography is vague (pendulums "swung," the fragment "tilted") without clear distances or physical consequences. Sensory detail leans visual and repetitive ("glisten" appears four times); urgency does not narrow perception as the tuner works. The micro-setting allowance (tool or object constrains choice) is not satisfied; the fragment decorates rather than charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early ("preserve the color of wonder"), but it remains abstract and never tested by on-page opposition or choice-cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; the tuner executes his plan without complication, and the fragment melts on cue. Agency is observation and arrangement rather than decision under pressure. The resolution is declared ("his purpose fulfilled") without visible trade-off or forfeited path. Under the chosen lens, pressure does not escalate; the arc is a static demonstration, not a narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme ("symphonies of truth," "the color of wonder") is asserted in the text ("to preserve the color of wonder") and repeated in near-identical phrasing rather than emerging from concrete action. The final image ("the symphonies of truth had been preserved") states the outcome rather than offering a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext is minimal; the piece foregrounds its concepts directly. The protagonist's arc is label-only ("seasonally mute had spoken loudest through his silence"), a meta-commentary that replaces dramatized resonance. One micro-positive: the iceberg's drop-by-drop release offers a specific image, though it does not complicate or deepen the thematic premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction periodically elevates beyond the scene's needs ("symphonies of truth," "vigor he allowed himself") into abstract register. The perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; the tuner notices "patterns only he could fully interpret" without showing what makes his perception distinct. No dialogue. Purposeful compression is attempted in the long paragraphs but becomes repetitive loops ("The symphonies of truth were not played... The symphonies of truth were not loud... The symphonies of truth would play on") rather than patterned elision that pays off. Psychic distance remains consistent, a minor positive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "The symphonies of truth" recurs five times with near-identical phrasing; "glisten" appears four times in identical participial constructions ("glisten-ing," "glisten-ed," "glisten-ing"). Template cadence runs through multiple beats: "He [verb], [object]" structures repeat without variation. Figurative language crowds high-description passages without causal payoff ("the music of wonder played on, forever mute yet forever heard" contradicts itself). Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("the vigil," "the grand design") that clashes with the concrete task. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content (e.g., the fragment melts, then "now a mere sliver, its truth fully released" repeats the same event). Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and applying baseline −1.2 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise (artist above the clouds preserving abstracted qualities) relies on familiar symbolic shorthand: clouds as remove, ice as purity, kinetic sculpture as art-magic. "Seasonally mute" and "after words became unnecessary" are clever labels but do not transform through specific lived detail or world logic. The core emotional arc—artist completes work, smiles, departs—could transplant to any medium without structural change, failing the transformation test. One micro-positive: the iceberg melting from vibration rather than heat offers a non-obvious detail, though it does not drive a turn or complicate stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The bell tuner is present throughout and the protagonist, but his choices are observational and technical (position, adjust, watch) rather than creating key turns. No on-page decision alters tactics or stakes; he executes a plan without complication. Setup and development are present, but closure participation is passive observation. Swappable with "sculptor" or "composer" with minor edits. Mid-band capped by lack of decision-driven turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment appears early (setup satisfied), is handled in two distinct beats (positioned, then melts under vibration—development satisfied), and its final state ("now a mere sliver") anchors the ending image (payoff satisfied). It enables the tuner's method and appears in the closure unit, satisfying all three gates. However, the fragment does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; it behaves as expected without complication. Causal pressure is moderate (+0.6), closure linkage is present (+0.8), but specificity is generic (ice melting into color). Eligible for mid-6s but lacks irreplaceability or tight cost linkage to reach higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" is declared early but remains a thematic label rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page. It does not change the tuner's options or decisions; he never chooses between competing "truths" or pays a cost to preserve one. The concept is echoed five times in near-identical phrasing without evolving meaning. Present in the ending ("the symphonies of truth had been preserved") but as assertion, not causal participation. Setup present, development and payoff absent; ornamental use lowers score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Seasonally mute" is introduced early and mentioned twice ("His seasonally mute state deepened the connection"; "The bell tuner, seasonally mute, had spoken loudest through his silence"). However, it never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The tuner does not attempt to speak and fail, nor does silence alter his tactics or choices. The trait is label-only, a conceptual claim rather than a dramatized constraint. Setup satisfied, development and payoff absent; cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation, further lowered by ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Glisten" (and variants "glisten-ing," "glisten-ed") appears four times across multiple beats: the fragment's edges, the sculpture, the released truth, and the final image. Setup and development are present; the action recurs and is tied to the fragment's transformation. However, major turns do not trace to this action—the fragment would melt and release its essence regardless of the verb chosen. Easily swappable with "shimmer," "gleam," or "shine" without altering plot or stakes. Functional recurrence elevates above ornamental, but replaceability caps mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Kinetic sculpture" is introduced early ("Gallery of kinetic sculpture") and the pendulums' motion is described in two beats (swinging, transferring energy to the iceberg). Setup and development are present. The method enables the fragment to melt from vibration, satisfying causal participation. However, the mechanics are vague ("kinetic energy transferred") and the sculptures could be replaced with "sound," "heat lamps," or any energy source with minor edits. Payoff is present (sculptures slow at the end) but passive. Functional but replaceable; mid-band appropriate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "whispering bluff above the clouds" is named in the opening and closing beats, framing the piece. Setup and payoff are present, but the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome. The bluff is a postcard backdrop; the tuner could perform the same actions on any elevated platform. No middle development where the setting alters tactics. The final beat ("The whispering bluff exhaled") offers a charged image but does not reconfigure prior material with new cost. Two of three gates satisfied; lyric reprise is weak; cap near 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After words became unnecessary" is declared early but remains abstract; no clock or deadline tightens the tuner's decisions. The timeframe does not constrain choices or alter tactics. The piece mentions "The season was changing; soon he would speak again," but this does not pressure the on-page action. Vague and untracked time; setup only, no development or payoff. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation, further lowered by lack of causal function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder" is stated early and repeated in the ending ("the color of wonder would endure"). Setup and payoff are present. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in choices; the tuner never faces a competing want or pays a visible cost to preserve wonder. No friction between desire and obstacle on the page. The motivation frames the piece thematically but does not drive a turn or shape a sacrifice. Two gates satisfied; lack of conflict and cost lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Muted vigor" is signaled in the opening ("the only vigor he allowed himself") and modulates through the piece: quiet action, restrained emotion, the faint smile. Tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the "seasonally mute" attribute. The ending maintains the muted register ("walked into the clouds, his silhouette swallowed by the fog") and charges the final image with restraint. Setup, development, and payoff are all present. Tone does not shift dramatically under pressure but sustains a single mood with subtle intensification. Solid integration but static modulation; mid-6s appropriate, lowered slightly by lack of dynamic turn.</comment>
