<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's professional skepticism combined with openness to the impossible reads coherently, and her final choice to surrender the tooth carries visible cost (losing her anchor to the Fae world). However, the decision feels inevitable rather than conflicted—no competing impulse acts against it in the moment. The child's abstract pronouncements ("I'm what remains when the exchange is incomplete") replace embodied stakes with exposition, and Eleanor's interior remains descriptive rather than contradictory under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the tooth, garden, and Merrick's teaching form a pattern that reweights at closure when Eleanor surrenders the tooth and gains understanding. The closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise) lands on the page with felt cost—the tooth dissolves, the cleft heals by "expanding into understanding," and Eleanor's certainty shifts. Orientation anchors arrive clearly (Eleanor, her office, yesterday's case, then the garden). The cost is legible in "the cleft in certainty begin to heal, not by closing but by expanding," though the phrasing tilts abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The secret garden functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: impossible botany, starlight-dripping willow, and the child arranging stones create a vivid backdrop for the exchange. The hedge maze constrains Eleanor's approach (navigation by touch and intuition), and the garden's inhale when the tooth dissolves ties environment to plot consequence. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Eleanor's professional-yet-wonder-open POV. The garden's presence at closure elevates this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Eleanor will surrender the tooth and accept the invitation into the Fae world—is signaled early and tightens when the child explains the anchor is shifting. The exchange itself (tooth for understanding) constitutes a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, with Eleanor foreclosing her prior anchored certainty. Visible cost: she loses the physical talisman that had been "her first encounter." The substitute body functions as inciting pressure, though its resolution happens off-stage (the child explains rather than Eleanor discovering through action).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—navigating fractures between worlds, mistakes as medicine—emerges from the tooth, substitute body, and bone-setting imagery. The final image ("some fractures between worlds were meant to be navigated, not destroyed") reweights prior material but veers close to a stated moral. "Shrewdly innocent" and "forgiving skeptic" are invoked as labels more than dramatized through contradictory choices. The tooth's dissolution offers a quiet Conceptual Repricing (balance restored, cleft expanding into understanding), but the garden's rapid resolution softens the ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Eleanor; psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the exchange, wider during transit). Perceptual signature is clear: scientific terms ("biological markers," "bone setting") mixed with Fae-attuned vocabulary ("iridescence," "starlight"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; the child's lines carry subtext and goal pursuit ("I need my tooth to rebalance what has been broken"). Minor slip: "She would return to her work tomorrow with the same scientific methods" reads as future summary rather than present-tense closure pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well, and no major loops appear. Information density is solid in the garden exchange. However, several phrases tilt abstract or use elevated register during peak beats: "imaginative sympathy," "yearned for the clarity," "cleft in certainty," and "fractures between worlds were meant to be navigated, not destroyed" (which borders on moralizing summary). "Shrewdly innocent" and "forgiving skeptic" recur as labels without fresh embodiment. The tooth "felt heavier" is a stock physical cue. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the figurative load in the final third slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The Fae-coroner hybrid and the changeling's tooth as anchor offer a fresh synthesis. The substitute body as "message" rather than threat inverts expectation. However, the core emotional arc—professional skeptic accepts the impossible—follows a familiar template, and the garden sanctuary with impossible botany reads as established fantasy set-dressing. The child's archaic wisdom ("I'm what remains when the exchange is incomplete") and Eleanor's final insight lack the lived-detail transformation that would elevate originality. Solid execution within genre conventions, but no bold risk that redefines stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor as "forgiving skeptic" is established early and her choice to surrender the tooth alters the ending. However, the trait is mostly told ("by nature and training," "shrewdly innocent") rather than tested by on-page friction. She navigates the maze and accepts the child's request without visible internal conflict—skepticism fades rather than fights wonder. Present in setup, middle (visiting Merrick's estate), and payoff (the exchange), but the decision feels inevitable rather than costly in the moment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tooth appears in setup (drawer, "impossible iridescence and slight warmth"), middle (Eleanor retrieves it from her pocket, "felt heavier"), and payoff (dissolves into starlight, restoring balance). It drives at least two beats: Eleanor's sensitivity allows her to see the substitute body's wrongness, and the child's summons across the veil. The tooth's dissolution is causally active at closure and its unique properties (warmth, iridescence, cross-veil call) make it irreplaceable. Strong integration; just shy of indispensable because Eleanor's arc could theoretically pivot on another anchor object with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is established early ("marking the beginning of a cleft in certainty that had been widening") and returns at closure ("felt the cleft in certainty begin to heal, not by closing but by expanding into understanding"). It shapes Eleanor's openness to the substitute body and her willingness to visit the garden. However, the concept remains more thematic than tactical—it doesn't narrow options or impose visible cost in a beat. The lyric reprise reweights the stake, lifting it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is attributed to Eleanor by Merrick and repeated in the garden scene ("The child's innocence somehow carried the weight of ancient knowledge, a shrewdness that made perfect sense"), but it functions as a descriptive label rather than a trait that constrains or enables action with cost. No on-page moment where Eleanor's innocence forces a mistake or her shrewdness prevents one. Present in setup and ending but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Yearn" appears once: "her fingers trailing along the ancient leaves as she yearned for the clarity she always found in Merrick's garden." It motivates Eleanor's drive to the estate and sets up the garden's importance, but the action itself is not causally decisive—Eleanor could seek, hope for, or need clarity with similar effect. Present in the middle transition beat but not at closure, and the word is swappable. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Bone setting" appears twice: the substitute body's skeleton "felt arranged, as though someone had performed bone setting with artistic rather than medical precision," and later the child says "Our bones are setting incorrectly between worlds." It signals the Fae manipulation early and the child's explanation links it to the anchor problem. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no on-page demonstration of how bone setting works or how Eleanor's understanding of it alters her choice. Shapes one key turn (recognition of wrongness) but doesn't constrain tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The secret garden behind the hedge maze is signaled early (Eleanor knows it waits there), shapes the middle journey (maze navigation by touch), and serves as the stage for the entire closure sequence. The garden's impossible botany and the willow's starlight set tone and provide the charged backdrop for the tooth's dissolution. The maze constrains Eleanor's approach, and the garden's "inhale" when balance is restored ties setting to plot consequence. Essential across beats and ending; just shy of indispensable because the exchange could occur elsewhere with rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the substitute body was found yesterday" is mentioned once in paragraph two and never returns. It establishes recency but does not tighten decisions—Eleanor drives to the garden at her own pace, and no clock pressure shapes her choices. The "yesterday" anchor provides context but is functionally replaceable with "recently" or "last week." Present in setup but absent from middle and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To turn mistakes into constellations" is established via Merrick's teaching ("mistakes could become constellations if examined with both scientific rigor and imaginative sympathy") and echoed when the child arranges stones "into constellations Eleanor had never seen before." It motivates Eleanor's openness and her final acceptance that "some fractures... were meant to be navigated, not destroyed." The motivation is present in setup and payoff, but the stakes remain abstract—no on-page moment where Eleanor must choose between fixing a mistake and reframing it, with visible cost. Purposeful reprise that reweights meaning, lifting it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tone blends scientific grounding (medical examiner, "biological markers") with wonder (iridescence, starlight, impossible botany), creating a "nostalgic innovation" feeling—Eleanor revisits the familiar garden and mentor's wisdom while encountering new knowledge. The tone modulates: clinical in the office beat, lyric in the garden. However, "nostalgic innovation" is more inferred than charged by recurring images; the innovation (expanding certainty) is told rather than shown with fresh syntax or rhythm at closure. Coherent through turns but static in the final third.</comment>
