<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("perpetually learning hands," "turbine-hum reverie") rather than embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. The character's motivation to "scaffold complexity with simplicity" is asserted repeatedly but never tested by a conflicting impulse or visible cost on the page. The final "smile" and declarative closure lack the embodied ambiguity or renunciation that would earn the change. Internal experience reads as a performed thesis rather than lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (sculptor, archway, storm) and a loose causal thread (slide reveals sculptures → she visits each → completion), but the closure is declarative summary rather than a decisive change with felt cost. The storm "calming as if in response" offers convenience rather than earned consequence. The dominant lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending relies on explanation ("a testament to the alliances") instead of an image that reweights prior material. Cost remains abstract; no live option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archway, slide, and sculptures are named and revisited, and the storm brackets the journey. However, spatial choreography between lighthouse, tide pool, and cave is vague—distances and transitions are elided without POV justification. The archway's "turbine-hum reverie" recurs as label but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with concrete detail. Sensory selection is generic (waves crashing, dim light) rather than character-filtered or tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (decoding the slide's purpose) is signaled early but never tightens meaningfully. Each sculpture reveals the next object in a treasure-hunt sequence without cost, complication, or narrowing options. The storm's cessation is convenient rather than earned by protagonist agency. No live trade-off or renunciation forecloses a path; the ending declares stakes met ("alliances complete") without a visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of connection between art and land is stated explicitly in the final paragraph ("a testament to the alliances") rather than emergent from particulars. The magic lantern slide functions as a mechanical puzzle-piece rather than an image that accumulates contradictory meanings. "Timewoven alliances" and "scaffold complexity with simplicity" are prompt labels repeated without transformation or thematic friction. The ending summarizes the lesson instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative voice is stable third-limited, but diction toggles between concrete ("calloused from salt and wood") and abstract jargon ("timewoven alliances," "turbine-hum reverie") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Psychic distance narrows for phrases like "she knew what she had to do" without revealing the decision, then zooms out for expository summary. Perceptual signature is generic; no idiosyncratic filtering marks Lyra's way of noticing under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops pervade: "reimagine" appears five times, "alliances" seven, "turbine-hum reverie" three, "perpetually learning" twice, all as recycled labels rather than evolved images. Template cadence runs ("the slide wasn't just X; it was Y," "not just art, but…") flatten rhythm. Mixed metaphor: "turbine-hum reverie of the cave" conflates mechanical and meditative registers without coherent vehicle. The final third stacks scaffold sentences that summarize rather than propel. Artifacts touch closure, triggering −1.7 baseline plus disallowance of 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (artist discovers art was secret map all along) is a widely used template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious calculus. The magic lantern slide as puzzle-decoder and the convenient storm bookend feel mechanically arranged rather than inevitable. Phrase "timewoven alliances" and "scaffold complexity with simplicity" read as prompt echoes rather than organic voice. No fresh inflection or risk-taking elevates the familiar treasure-hunt structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Lyra appears throughout and makes one choice (to walk the shoreline with the slide), but most beats are observational or summary. Her decisions do not alter tactics; the slide guides each step without cost or renunciation. Present by setup, involved in middle and ending, but causal pressure is low and swappable with a generic seeker.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide is introduced early, handled in multiple beats (cave discovery, lighthouse, tide pool, cave wall), and shapes the ending when placed into the carving. It drives the treasure-hunt structure and reappears with shifted function. However, it resolves a problem it did not help create and could be replaced with any decoder object. Cost is not tied to the slide itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Timewoven alliances" appears as a repeated label but does not constrain a single on-page choice or tactic. The concept is asserted in narration ("alliances she'd forged without knowing it") rather than dramatized through friction or cost. It functions as theme decoration, not a stake driver. Mentioned in setup and ending but never shapes options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Perpetually learning" is mentioned twice as a descriptor ("perpetually learning hands," "perpetually learning spirit") but never enables or constrains an action with visible cost. No on-page choice turns on this trait; it remains label-only. Present in setup and ending, absent from middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reimagine" appears five times and frames the protagonist's central action (reimagining the slide, her journey, her path). It shapes the middle beat where images rearrange and the final beat where wanderings become quest. However, the action is told rather than shown in specific gestures, and removing it would require only synonym substitution. Causal role is moderate; cost is absent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Through layered meanings" is mentioned once in setup ("embedded with layered meanings") and echoed in closure ("piecing together the layered meanings"). The method is asserted but not demonstrated in mechanics; we do not see how meanings layer or how she parses them. No middle beat shows the method constraining or enabling a choice. Summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway is present in setup (refuge), middle (shuddering waves), and ending (lights up, storm calms). It provides the discovery site and final installation point. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply resources that alter outcome; the storm's convenient cessation reduces its causal role. Spatial function is generic cave.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"After the GPS fails" is mentioned once in the opening line and never referenced again. The timeframe does not tighten decisions, track elapsed time, or shape tactics. Lyra's journey has no visible clock or urgency; she walks the shoreline at leisure. Ornamental setup mention only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To scaffold complexity with simplicity" is stated twice as Lyra's habit ("scaffold complexity with simplicity") and echoed in closure ("scaffolding of simplicity holding the complexity"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized in a choice; no friction between wanting simplicity and facing complexity emerges on the page. Present in setup and ending, absent from development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Turbine-hum reverie" appears three times, always as a label applied to the cave or Lyra's state. Tone does not modulate with pressure (the storm outside versus "serene" inside remains static) and does not charge the final image. The phrase reads as imposed descriptor rather than coherent tonal signature. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but static and ornamental.</comment>
