<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The caster's motivation is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. His "technically gentle" hands appear as label-only repetition without constraining choices. The final transformation—guilt dissolving "like frost in spring"—reads as summary rather than embodied struggle, and the interior voice relies on stock metaphors ("winter fire," "river of memory") that flatten character particularity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; "decades" and "years since he'd forgiven himself" create timeline confusion. The closure—names "transcribed forever" into rope fibers—occurs but the cost is asserted ("guilt dissolve") rather than demonstrated through a forfeited path or visible trade-off. Causal lens attempt fails: the punched card's "holes aligning with rope strands like a key" is metaphor without mechanics, and the aurora's participation reads as convenient magic rather than earned escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora provide vivid sensory anchors, and the rope's braids constrain the caster's method across multiple beats. However, spatial choreography remains abstract—kneeling position, tray placement, and rope coiling are mentioned but never affect movement or choice. The "snowmelt ardor" scent appears late and ornamentally. The setting charges the final image but does not narrow tactical options during the central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and coherent. One tightening occurs when the caster unravels the knots, but the rope's response is immediate cooperation rather than resistance. No visible cost: the voices rise "in gratitude," and the caster's hands are "steady" at closure. Agency reads as ritual execution without a forfeited path or trade-off that tests commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory preservation emerges clearly, but the final paragraph moralizes directly: "in preserving others, he had finally preserved himself." The punched card's shift from street organ remnant to "conduit" is told rather than earned through image. Recurrent motifs (rope, light, names) appear but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure—they function as symbolic checkpoints. The closing line's explicit echo of the caster's name replaces resonance with summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, but perceptual signature is generic: "technically gentle" recurs without distinct filtering of sensory detail. Diction drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral," "oubliettes," "latent magic") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Sentence stems repeat across emotional peaks ("The caster closed his eyes," "The caster stood," "The caster walked"). No dialogue present to assess. Psychic distance remains static; no modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "preserve their echoes" / "preserve the sound"; "lost, erased, ones who had never been carved" cycles synonyms without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the final third with uniform clause structure. Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats: "river of memory," "frost in spring," "silk," "snowmelt ardor" as convenient abstraction. Filter-verb stack: "felt the last remnants dissolve," "believed his work was," "understood: it was to listen" dulls immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disqualifying 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The premise—transcribing memory via ceremonial rope and punched card—offers surface novelty but resolves through passive ritual without friction or cost. The "lost wax caster" profession remains ornamental; bronze casting skill does not constrain or enable the rope work. The ending's wisdom ("his work was to listen") and symmetric satisfaction (guilt resolved, voices grateful, heart light) avoid bold stakes. No transformation test: swap names and setting, the emotional arc remains generic redemption.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and causally central, but the caster's profession (lost wax casting) does not shape his method with the rope. His choices—lifting the card, unraveling knots—are described but do not force trade-offs or narrow options under resistance. One beat of decision (final tug) but no visible cost tied to his casting skill or "technically gentle" attribute.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Introduced early on a silver tray, handled when lifted, and its perforations align with rope strands in the central beat. Returns in the closure paragraph as "conduit." However, the card's mechanics are metaphorical ("key in an otherworldly lock") rather than specific, and the middle development is told: "the punched card had been a street organ's remnant, but here, it became a conduit." Two functional beats but swappable with any perforated object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Transcribed memory" drives the dominant stake and shapes the rope's function (names "etched into its fibers, transcribed forever"). However, the transcription mechanism is asserted rather than demonstrated—no visible notation, recording medium, or retrieval constraint appears. The concept charges the thematic claim but does not alter tactics or force a choice between competing methods.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" appears three times as a label attached to his hands but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. No visible trade-off: the gentleness does not prevent force, and no moment requires him to choose between delicate touch and another need. Ornamental descriptor without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is seeded early ("preserve their echoes, not in bronze, but in light") and drives the central turn when "light bloomed from the rope's core." The illumination projects the card's pattern and triggers the sound of names. However, the action is immediate result rather than struggle—no failed attempt, no cost to achieving light. Two beats (setup, payoff) with closure linkage but minimal resistance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled midway ("by reconfiguring the braids") and executed in one beat: "The caster began to unravel the rope's intricate knots... With a final tug, the braids shifted." The mechanics are gestural—no detail of which knots, what pattern, or how reconfiguration enables transcription. The method appears in the closure ("rewoven") but as label rather than causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Icebound sanctum and aurora are established in the opening line and return in the closure ("aurora pulsed above"). The cold affects the rope's brittleness, and the aurora's colors intensify to bathe the sanctum in warmth, altering emotional tone. However, the setting does not constrain movement or supply resources that alter the caster's tactical options. Micro-setting (the rope) drives more pressure than the macro location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After forgiving himself" is mentioned once in backstory ("It had been years since he'd forgiven himself") but does not tighten present decisions. The timeframe is past; no on-page moment revisits forgiveness or tests whether it holds under new pressure. The closure asserts self-preservation but does not dramatize a forgiveness relapse or confirmation. Told-only past state without present friction.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Desire to preserve forgotten names is declared early and pursued throughout. The caster's "motivation burned clear as winter fire," and the sanctum fills with the murmur of names at closure. However, the motivation is never conflicted—no moment forces him to choose between preservation and another cost (safety, time, self). Friction comes from external difficulty (brittle rope) rather than competing wants. Two beats of pursuit but no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" appears once late in the story as a scent descriptor and returns in the penultimate paragraph as "a quiet promise." The tone does cohere (cold thawing into warmth) but remains static—no modulation under pressure, and the final image's warmth is asserted rather than charged by prior constraint. Ornamental label rather than a tonal shift that reweights the ending.</comment>
