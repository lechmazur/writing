<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marina's motivation to find her mentor is declared but never tested by contradictory impulses on the page. The final "choice" to integrate with the temple arrives without visible internal conflict or cost—she simply accepts transformation in a single sentence. Interiority consists largely of label-only statements ("primal fear," "motivation grows clearer") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The perfume vial recurs frequently but Marina never hesitates over it or trades one desire against another in a way that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Orientation Test fails: by line 120 (~"As their vessel approached...") the reader still cannot determine whether Marina is in space approaching a planet or already underwater, creating sustained spatial confusion that is never taught as deliberate disorientation. The piece declares escalation ("time runs short," "oxygen...dwindles") but these pressures vanish without consequence—Marina completes every step and integrates successfully with no dramatized cost or forfeiture. The ending offers transformation but no legible before/after in her options or stance; she becomes "the new distress signal sender" via summary assertion rather than a visible decisive change, renunciation, or image that reweights prior material. Drive lens remains ambiguous throughout (spatial exploration? consciousness merger? mentor quest?) and does not cohere at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Spatial choreography is incoherent: the story opens with a ship in "the void of space," then approaches an "underwater temple" without clarifying whether this is a submerged structure on a planet or a metaphor, and Marina dons a "diving suit" while aboard a spacecraft with "life support" and "oxygen reserves." The crystal vial, temple spires, and corridor geometry are described but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Orientation debt persists past the allowable window and is never resolved, capping Q3 at 7.0 per the global rule.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (find mentor / understand temple / "harness ephemeral energies") shifts across the text without convergence. Declared pressures—"time runs short," "oxygen reserves dwindle," "water begins to breach"—are announced but never force Marina to abandon an attempt, choose between tools, or pay a visible price. The sequence "unsnarl temporal threads → integrate with temple" reads as outline fulfillment rather than protagonist-driven escalation; no live option is foreclosed on the page. No reversal or deepening tightens her choices; she proceeds from signal to chamber to integration without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than earned: "bridge between worlds," "understanding," "mysteries of existence" arrive as abstract declarations in the final paragraphs without grounding in prior concrete particulars. The perfume vial's thematic role—"creates pathways between memories"—is announced by the narrator rather than revealed through Marina's choices under pressure. The ending moralizes explicitly ("not of danger, but of understanding") instead of offering a resonant image. No coherent question is posed early and reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Voice remains generic and register-neutral, lacking perceptual signature or character-specific bias—Marina notices crystalline spires and shifting symbols with the same detached catalog regardless of urgency. Dialogue is minimal and functional. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt like") appear frequently but do not obscure meaning. The prose avoids major grammatical errors but offers no rhythmic or syntactic distinction under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "gathered hush" recurs six times without functional variation; "crystal perfume vial" appears in eight paragraphs, often restating its warmth or iridescence without advancing action. Template cadence dominates the middle section: "The crystal perfume vial touches...," "As time runs short...," "The gathered hush [verb]..." Stock metaphors ("weight pressing against consciousness," "shadows dance") and elevated diction ("fragmentary thoughts," "ephemeral energies") clash with the POV's lack of scientific or mystical grounding. Line-level artifacts touch multiple beats but do not obscure the final image's basic sense, so deductions remain in Q7 only. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops (−0.6), template cadence across three+ sentences (−0.5), stock metaphor strings (−0.3) = baseline ~−1.4 in Q7, with artifacts spread across the second half triggering the artifact-in-final-third cap (disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band at 8.8).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The core premise—consciousness upload to an ancient alien temple—follows widely used SF templates without fresh detail or moral calculus to differentiate it. The "distress signal is actually an invitation" twist is telegraphed and resolved without hindsight inevitability. Marina's transformation lacks specificity: what does she forfeit, misunderstand, or lose in becoming the temple's guardian? The perfume vial and "gathered hush" are ornamental recursions rather than synthesized into a non-obvious whole. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The "distress signal sender" is revealed in the final third as a guardian-function, not a character who makes on-page choices. It serves as a plot device to frame Marina's arrival but does not drive any beat or reversal. Missing setup (not present as a character by end of first third), missing development (no middle choice), present only as reveal at closure but without causal agency there. Late appearance + ornamental role + no decision-making: cap at 2.8, apply late penalty −0.6, ornamental use −0.4 = 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears in paragraphs 3, 7, 10, 16, and 21 (five touches across distinct beats). It is handled ("clutches," "touches memories") but never used—Marina does not open it, trade it, or sacrifice it. Its "purpose" is explained by the narrator in paragraph 21 rather than demonstrated through Marina's choice. Setup present (paragraph 3), middle mentions (paragraphs 7, 10, 16), closure mention (paragraph 21) satisfy all three gates, eligible for ≥6.1. However, the vial does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it is a passive mnemonic device. Swappability: any mentor keepsake could serve the same function. Early signal +0.5, five beats +1.0, closure mention +0.3, but swappable −0.6, summary-only use −0.8, no causal pressure −0.8. Start 3.0, net adjustments ≈ +1.2, final 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" recurs as atmospheric description (paragraphs 4, 9, 13, 19, 22) but never shapes a tactic or decision. It is told as a thematic label ("gathered hush of that ancient structure," "gathered hush intensifies," "gathered hush transforms into a symphony") without altering Marina's options. Setup present (paragraph 4), middle echoes (9, 13, 19), closure reprise (22) meet all three gates. However, it remains ornamental: Marina does not navigate by silence, lose communication, or pay a cost tied to the hush. Label-only use across all mentions, no causal pressure, swappable with "ancient silence" or similar. Early signal +0.4, closure reprise +0.5, but ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.5, swappable −0.6. Start 3.0, net ≈ −1.0, final 2.0; round up slightly for five-beat presence to 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Touches memories" appears in paragraphs 7, 16, and 21. In paragraph 7 it is a simple memory cue; in paragraph 16 it delivers "experiences from countless explorers" but Marina's response is passive acceptance; in paragraph 21 the narrator explains its function. The attribute never constrains a choice—Marina does not resist the memory flood, trade one memory for another, or lose her own identity as cost. Present in three beats (paragraphs 7, 16, 21), spanning setup to closure, but always summary-only. Gates: setup yes, middle yes, closure mention yes; eligible for ≥6.1 but no causal work performed. Early +0.4, three beats +1.0, closure +0.3, but summary-only −0.8, no cost −0.5, swappable −0.6. Start 3.0, net ≈ +0.8, final 3.8; apply swappability limiter to cap at 3.8, then round down to 3.4 for passive use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" appears once in paragraph 15 ("unsnarl the temporal threads") and once in paragraph 20 ("unsnarl the mysteries of existence"). Neither instance is dramatized: we do not see Marina attempt, fail, adjust, or pay a price to unsnarl. The action is declared complete in the same sentence it is introduced. Missing setup (first appearance at ~60% of text), missing development (no middle attempt), weak closure linkage (mentioned but not performed). Late intro −0.8, summary-only −0.8, no causal pressure −0.8, swappable with "solve" or "unlock" −0.6. Start 3.0, net ≈ −3.0, floor at 0.5; lenient read for two mentions lifts to 3.2 but still well below functional.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Override instinct" appears in paragraphs 6, 15, and 21. Paragraph 6: "needed to override instinct, the primal fear"; paragraph 15: "requires her to override instinct"; paragraph 21: "help someone override instinct and embrace transformation." All three are label-only statements; no on-page dramatization of Marina resisting an impulse, choosing against reflex, or paying a price for overriding. The method is told, not shown. Gates: late setup (paragraph 6, ~25%), weak middle (paragraph 15 declares it required but not performed), weak closure (paragraph 21 explains in summary). Three mentions +1.0, but label-only across all −0.9, summary-only −0.8, no causal shaping −0.8, swappable −0.6. Start 3.0, net ≈ −2.2, final 0.8; lenient read for thematic presence across all three sections lifts to 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "forgotten underwater temple" appears in paragraph 4 (approach), paragraph 8 (descent), paragraph 12 (interior), paragraphs 13–14 (corridors and chamber), and paragraph 19 (temple responding). It provides the location for all action from paragraph 8 onward and supplies the orb, symbols, and energy field that frame Marina's final integration. However, it does not constrain her choices—no locked doors, failing life support specific to the temple, or environmental cost. She proceeds linearly from docking to chamber to integration without forced trade-offs. Setup early (paragraph 4) +0.6, continuous presence across five+ beats +1.4, closure active (paragraph 19 "temple responding") +1.0, but no tactical constraint −0.8, postcard description in paragraphs 12–13 −0.5. Start 3.0, net +1.7, final 4.7; bonus for sustained setting presence and closure linkage lifts to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"As time runs short" appears verbatim in paragraphs 8, 17, 20, and 22. Paragraph 5 mentions "oxygen reserves dwindle to critical levels," and paragraph 20 adds "water begins to breach." None of these pressures alter Marina's actions: she completes every step (descent, corridor navigation, orb approach, thread unsnarling, integration) without skipping, rushing, or losing a resource. The timeframe is declared but never tracked or paid. Setup present (paragraph 5), recurring middle (paragraphs 8, 17, 20), closure mention (paragraph 22), but no causal tightening. Four mentions +0.9, closure mention +0.3, but untracked clock −0.8, no forced trade-off −1.0, ornamental repetition −0.5. Start 3.0, net ≈ −1.1, final 1.9; lenient read for four-beat presence lifts to 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Harness the ephemeral" appears explicitly in paragraph 11 ("harness the ephemeral energies"), paragraph 20 ("harness the ephemeral energy that flows between dimensions"), and is implicit in paragraph 17 ("powers that could reshape understanding"). The desire is told rather than dramatized: Marina does not weigh this goal against safety, mentor retrieval, or survival; she accepts the temple's offer without visible friction. Setup mid-text (paragraph 11, ~45%), present in final act (paragraphs 17, 20), weak closure (paragraph 20 states completion but no cost is shown). Late setup −0.4, three mentions +1.0, closure linkage +0.5, but told-only motivation −0.8, no on-page conflict between wants −0.8. Start 3.0, net ≈ −0.5, final 2.5; generous read for thematic centrality in final third lifts to 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is not labeled but evoked through "void of space," "forgotten," "silence so profound," "crystalline spires," "iridescent colors," solitary Marina, and the temple's grandeur. Tone is consistent across the piece—melancholy grandeur without tonal rupture—but remains static; it does not modulate with urgency or charge the final image. The ending ("waiting for the next explorer") sustains the lonely-guardian note but does not deepen or reweight it. Coherent tone throughout +1.0, charges setup and middle +0.8, mild closure charge +0.4, but static modulation −0.6, no tonal turn under pressure −0.5. Start 3.0, net +1.1, final 4.1; bonus for consistent atmospheric control across all beats lifts to 5.2.</comment>
