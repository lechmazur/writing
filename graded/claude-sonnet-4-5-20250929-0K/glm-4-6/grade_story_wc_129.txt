<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's interior is heavily abstract ("luminescence aching," "vessel of luminescence") rather than embodied through concrete choices under pressure. His motivation to belong is declared but the internal contradiction—what he fears losing versus what he seeks—never acts simultaneously in a single beat. The final "we're home" moment lacks prior dramatic resistance; the ache simply dissolves without visible cost or foreclosed path. Elara functions primarily as wise guide rather than applying independent pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (marsh-reeds, light, arbor imagery building toward a transformative bloom), but the closure—arbor blooming after joint dedication—arrives through convenient completion rather than earned constraint. The cost is asserted ("ache soften into something whole") but not dramatized: no on-page choice forecloses an alternate path or exacts a visible price. Orientation is clear early. The mythic setup (arbor waits for street artist's tag) functions as quest scaffolding but the resolution bypasses the stated rule (incomplete tag magically completes via "joined effort") without showing how their specific actions bridge the gap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, floating prisms, and crater's edge create vivid, consistent imagery. Micro-setting (marsh-reeds, obsidian arbor) is handled across beats and charged at closure when vines transform sculptures into beacons. However, the environment does not constrain a choice; characters move freely without spatial friction. The recurring prisms and reeds accumulate texture but do not force a tactical trade-off, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Kael's longing to belong) is clear, but escalation is declarative rather than earned. The incomplete tag could have forced a hard choice—complete it dishonestly, abandon the myth, or sacrifice something personal—but instead the arbor "stirs" in response to their combined creativity without narrowing options. "Maybe it's not enough" is a micro-turn instantly resolved by Elara's reframe, not a pressure point with cost. No visible price alters later tactics; the bloom is granted rather than won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of community and co-creation emerges through the marsh-reed/light motif and the joint dedication. However, Elara's line "We didn't find the artist. We became the art" is on-the-nose thematic summary that replaces embodied resonance. "Beyond the murmur of lost languages" recurs as atmospheric tag but does not reweight prior material with fresh implication at closure. The ending grants symmetric satisfaction (ache gone, place found, light spreads) without ambiguity or conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative voice maintains a lyric, elevated register throughout ("vessel of luminescence," "cartographer of sorrow," "dialect of the heart"). Elara's dialogue ("It's waiting," "An answer. A sign") and Kael's responses are functional but generic, lacking distinct idiom or subtext. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is poetic but homogeneous across characters. Under pressure, diction remains ornate rather than compressing to match urgency, which slightly flattens momentum at key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally maintained, but several loops and scaffold patterns appear: "luminescence" recurs four times as abstract label; "the webs of kinship" appears three times identically; "boldly sympathetic" is repeated without fresh context. Metaphoric density is high throughout ("wind over glass," "threads of longing," "beacons," "dialect of the heart") without meaningful variation in texture, creating a sustained elevated register that dulls peak moments. The final paragraph stacks declarations ("We're home," "the world answered with light," "had finally learned to listen") rather than propelling through image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise—mystical arbor blooms when street artist's tag is found and dedicated—is a familiar quest structure (find artifact, achieve transformation). The emotional arc (isolated artist finds belonging through collaborative creation) follows template beats without fresh friction. The incomplete tag could have introduced moral complexity (forge completion? redefine success?) but instead resolves via "joined effort" and metaphoric completion. Elara's wisdom-guide role and Kael's tidy epiphany lack the specificity or earned contradiction that would transform the trope.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his sculptures evolve (binding reeds around arbor, infusing stories), but these actions are summarized rather than shown as on-page choices with competing costs. "Worked until dawn" compresses the key creative labor. His final realization ("It's not just ours…it's for everyone") is delivered rather than discovered through a constraining choice. He observes and creates but does not face a decision that alters tactics mid-quest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glimmering obsidian arbor appears early (discovery beat), is handled in the middle (Kael binds reeds around its base, Elara hums into its core), and transforms at closure (surface alight, vines unfurl). Its dormancy creates narrative pressure and the bloom charges the final image. However, the mechanism of its transformation is asserted ("stirred," "alight") rather than causally earned by specific prior actions, and it does not constrain a choice—it rewards rather than tests.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Webs of kinship" is named three times and functions thematically (fractured world, rekindled at closure) but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. Kael's desire to belong is individual rather than navigating existing kinship structures under tension. The concept echoes as poetic frame but is never a live constraint or dilemma in the quest; removing it and replacing with "community bonds" would not alter the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" is applied to Elara's eyes and gaze twice but never constrains or enables an action with cost. She offers comfort and reframes Kael's doubt, but the trait could be swapped for "warmly encouraging" or "gently wise" without changing her function. No scene shows her sympathy creating friction or forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Dedicate" is signaled in the arbor myth, executed when Kael and Elara dedicate their creation "to the community," and triggers the arbor's bloom at closure. The action is present across setup, middle, and payoff. However, it is performed once without competing options or visible cost; the dedication is a gesture rather than a choice that forecloses another path or exacts a price, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The shared search is introduced early (Elara explains the myth, "Together, they embarked"), shown in summary ("Days blurred into weeks"), and pays off when they find the incomplete tag on the floating prism. The method shapes the quest structure but the search itself is compressed; the mechanics (how they locate the tag, what obstacles they face) are omitted. Finding the tag midway could have been a stronger pressure point but instead prompts the pivot to joint creation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and shimmering crater are vividly described and frame all action. The floating prism bearing the tag and the crater's edge at closure provide spatial beats. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it is stage rather than pressure. The orchard's prisms shift and "cast rainbows" at the end, charging the final image, which lifts the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears as title-like phrase in narration but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. "Days blurred into weeks" is the only temporal marker, and it diffuses rather than compresses urgency. No live clock or deadline alters tactics; the arbor waits indefinitely. The phrase reads as atmospheric flourish rather than a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation "to graft oneself onto community" is dramatized through his sculptures (offering homes for light, weaving stories of inhabitants) and voiced in his final realization. The desire drives his participation in the search and his all-night creation session. However, internal conflict is thin—he never faces a moment where grafting himself requires sacrificing autonomy or another value. The ache is declared and then dissolved without friction, limiting the cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Tone of "luminescent ache" is established early ("heart a vessel of luminescence aching") and recurs in imagery (light, glow, shimmering). The ache softens at closure as luminescence becomes "steady glow." The tone is coherent and modulates slightly with emotional arc. However, "ache" functions as label more than embodied sensation, and the shift from ache to wholeness is asserted rather than charged through image, keeping the tone's integration in mid-band.</comment>
