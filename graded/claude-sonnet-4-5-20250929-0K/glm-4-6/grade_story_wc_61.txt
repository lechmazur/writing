<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sentimentalist's motivations are stated abstractly ("to share light without using fire") but never crystallize into a concrete, embodied choice under pressure. Interiority consists largely of passive observation and summarized emotion ("its heart ached," "felt both joy and loss") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final smile is asserted without grounding in prior causality; we're told the character has fulfilled its purpose, but no on-page micro-choice demonstrates a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who/where/when remains abstract past the 120-word mark; the nebula garden is atmosphere without spatial anchors, and "the sentimentalist" lacks concrete embodiment until well into the piece (−0.4). The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the gear integrated, patterns shifted), but the causal chain is vague: the gear "began to glow" and "whirred" without clear mechanism, and the sentimentalist's light-sharing is described in metaphor ("weaving strands of photon") that obscures the actual action. Cost is asserted ("joy and loss," "purpose fulfilled yet altered") rather than demonstrated through a forfeited option or visible consequence on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The nebula garden supplies vivid sensory texture ("petals of gas and light," "blossoms swayed in perpetual twilight") and the gear's "smooth as polished obsidian" offers tactile specificity. However, spatial choreography remains vague—distances, boundaries, and the sentimentalist's form are abstract throughout. The gear does constrain one choice (placement at the blossom's base), meeting the 9+ gate marginally, but the environment functions more as backdrop than active pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (breaking the cycle vs. preserving organic harmony) is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the gear is placed and light is shared, but the escalation is largely atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency—events happen to the sentimentalist more than resulting from its decisions. The "gear began to glow" and "garden responded" without clear cost; the sentimentalist's "serenity now troubling" is asserted emotion rather than a demonstrated trade-off that narrows future options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of organic chaos vs. mechanical order emerges through the gear/garden interplay and avoids overt moralizing. The final image ("blooms opened, their edges sharp and precise") offers a resonant visual that reweights the premise. However, the sentimentalist's internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized in scene, and phrases like "price of sharing without fire" and "silent guardian of serenity's engine" veer toward abstract philosophizing. The conceptual tension is present but not fully embodied in concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, and the prose carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register ("silent prayers," "river of memories"). However, diction occasionally drifts into generic elevated phrasing ("ephemeral into the measurable," "symphony of light and logic") that lacks character-specific texture. The phrase "its Canada edges trembling" appears to be a typo or artifact. Perceptual signature is weak; the sentimentalist's way of noticing does not feel selective or biased in character-specific ways—observations read as authorial mood-setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles: "the garden's rhythm faltered" / "break the cycle" / "disrupt the patterns" rehash the same concept across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence in the middle third: "The gear began to glow... The gear whirred... The sentimentalist stepped back..." Sequential actions with identical structure. Stock metaphors: "silent prayers," "river of memories," "fragile, fleeting thing." The phrase "Canada edges" is either a typo or incomprehensible artifact (−0.8 for artifacts touching clarity). Information density is low—many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation or character.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The nebula garden and sentimentalist frame offers a science-fantasy setting, but the core emotional arc—organic tradition threatened by mechanization, a guardian mediating the two—is a widely used template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8). The gear as calculating artifact and light-without-fire are evocative but remain conceptual rather than grounded in unique world logic. The final image of "sharp and precise" blooms is predictable given the setup; no surprising synthesis emerges.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The sentimentalist is present throughout and makes the key choice to place the gear and share light, meeting setup and payoff gates. However, the character observes and reacts more than it decides—agency is passive. The final action (placing the gear, weaving light) is described but not shown as a difficult trade-off; the character "knew it had to act" but the decision process is summarized. Two beats (discovering the gear, placing it) but neither dramatically narrows options with visible cost. Swappable with a generic "guardian" archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gear appears early (first third), is handled in two beats (discovery, placement), and participates in the closure (amplifying light, transforming the garden). Its "teeth designed not to bite but to count" and "approximating infinity" give it specificity. The gear enables the final transformation and its mechanical precision contrasts with organic grace, shaping the thematic payoff. However, the gear's function is metaphorical rather than causally specific—"meshing with the stem" and "amplified" light are asserted rather than dramatized with clear stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Generational patterns are seeded early ("how each bloom mimicked its predecessor") and reappear at closure ("no longer repeating exactly but evolving"). The concept shapes the dominant stake (breaking vs. preserving the cycle) and the final image shows the patterns shifted. However, the mechanics remain abstract—patterns are described rather than shown constraining a choice. The sentimentalist's ancestors "tried and failed," but that history does not alter present tactics. Theme-level presence but weak causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Approximates infinity" is attributed to the gear ("each rotation an approximation of infinity") and mentioned again at closure ("approximating infinity"). However, it functions as poetic descriptor rather than constraint or enabler—the trait does not alter a tactic or impose visible cost. The gear's infinitude is asserted but never tested; removing the phrase would leave the story's logic intact. Label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Transit is introduced early ("it began its transit, gliding through the nebula's tendrils") and frames the journey to the garden's center, where the key placement occurs. The action is purposeful and moves the sentimentalist from discovery to resolution. However, transit itself is generic—"gliding through tendrils" could describe any movement. The action does not create a turn or impose cost; it functions as connective tissue. Functional but replaceable with "approached" or "moved."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Sonar pinging is introduced in the middle third ("a series of soft, rhythmic pulses") and used to map the garden, with petals trembling at each pulse. It reappears briefly at closure ("The sonar pinging faded"). The method affects the environment (petals shiver) and provides a metronome rhythm, but it does not constrain a choice or shape a turn. Removing sonar would require only minor edits to replace the pulsing with another sensory detail. One functional beat but no causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The nebula garden is present from the opening and supplies vivid imagery throughout (blossoms, petals, luminous soil, twilight). The garden's center is the site of the climactic placement, and the garden "responded" to the gear's light. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop—it does not supply resources or obstacles that alter tactics. The "oldest blooms swayed" but do not resist or enable the sentimentalist's choice. Atmospheric rather than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Across the quiet sigh of falling petals" appears in the final third, creating a temporal frame for the resolution. However, the timeframe is vague and does not tighten decisions—petals fall "for eons," then "halted their fall," with no sense of urgency or clock. The phrase is lyric decoration rather than a functional constraint. Late appearance, no causal pressure, ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to share light without using fire" is stated early ("a vow made long ago") and drives the climactic action (weaving strands of photon). It reappears at closure ("the price of sharing without fire"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized—no scene shows the sentimentalist resisting fire or choosing a costlier path because of the vow. The desire exists as backstory label; friction between want and cost is asserted ("purpose fulfilled yet altered") but not shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tone is consistently serene and contemplative throughout, with lyric phrasing ("silent prayers," "endless lullaby") establishing mood early. "Troubling serenity" is explicitly named late: "its serenity now troubling." The phrase captures the tension between calm surface and underlying unease, and the final image ("fragile, fleeting" smile, "darkness carry it onward") sustains this duality. However, tone does not modulate with pressure—it remains uniformly meditative even at the climactic placement. Coherent but static, with one purposeful tag at the end.</comment>
