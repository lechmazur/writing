<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior commitment to his theory is established early and drives the ascent, but his motivation remains largely abstract—"whispers imbued with pure intent"—without embodied contradiction or genuine cost until the final release. The "screaming tenderness" offers texture, yet the emotional progression feels more declared than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The cork becomes a fetish object rather than a tool that forces tradeoffs, and the final act of release reads more as ritual than as a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible regret or gain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ascent and scent-creation accumulate toward the cork's release, which reconfigures the premise with a quiet, lyric closure. Orientation anchors (assistant keeper, cobalt lighthouse, post-heat-wave dawn) land clearly within the first third. However, the closure unit—the cork lifting and vanishing—lacks legible cost on the page; we see the object depart but not what Elias has forfeited or what consequence he now faces. The "proof was in the leaving" declares rather than dramatizes the cost, preventing the Resonant Reconfiguration from landing with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse, spiral stairs, and narrow balcony supply vivid spatial anchors, and the phantom garden scent charges the final sequence with purposeful atmospheric contrast. The cork's rough-hewn texture and the salt-stashed rock create micro-setting that supports the protagonist's ritual focus. The setting does not constrain a choice with visible cost—the balcony and wind enable rather than complicate—but it charges the closure image strongly enough to enter the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and sustained through the ascent. Pressure accumulates via the scent's impossible bloom and the final beckoning wind, creating one meaningful tightening. Yet the cork's departure encounters no on-page resistance or tradeoff; the "invitation, unburdening of sorrow" remains abstract, and we do not see what live option Elias forecloses or what price he pays for the release. The accumulative lens allows this to function, but the lack of dramatized cost keeps escalation in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the whisper-versus-shout premise and resolves through the phantom garden and the cork's silent flight, offering a resonant image of intent purified and released. The final line—"a message sent into the morning dawn"—avoids overt moralizing and allows reflection. Minor penalty: "screaming tenderness" and "theories observed without the outside world" edge toward prompt-label phrasing, but the scent and cork particulars anchor the thematic question in embodied action rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV and distance remain stable; Elias's perceptual signature—"theories," "vibrations of intent," "phantom garden"—is consistent and voice-specific. Elevated diction ("benediction," "brutality of the sea," "filament of air") suits the contemplative register but occasionally drifts toward ornamental density ("screaming tenderness," "cobalt tower bruised from purple to rose"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, and the final image maintains interior coherence. The prose holds a distinct texture, yet peak-beat figurative layering ("needle of intent threading the horizon") risks slight overwriting without clarity harm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings diversify, yet several beats rely on template stems: "He did not speak… he closed his eyes… He did not think… It was a whisper… He did not drop it… He did not throw it… He did not cast it out." This anaphoric pattern is purposeful but verges on scaffold when sustained across adjacent paragraphs. Figurative density is high throughout—"sky bruised," "fragile egg," "needle of intent," "silent highway"—without muddled metaphors, though the cumulative weight slows momentum in the middle third. No paraphrase loops or clarity breaks; information density is strong, keeping the score in the upper-6 band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-as-messenger, purified intent, and phantom-garden method is specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock magical-realism tropes. The vial cork as a vibration-tuned object and the wind beckoning it outward offer fresh particulars. Risk: the piece commits fully to its lyric, accumulative design and trusts the reader to infer stakes from image rather than confrontation. Slight deduction: the "assistant lighthouse keeper testing theories" frame and the whisper-versus-shout thesis echo common writing-prompt templates, but the execution—scent, cork flight, dawn tableau—transforms the premise into something memorable and coherent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias appears in setup, drives the ascent (middle), and performs the release (closure), satisfying all three gates. His theory frames the attempt, his focus channels the scent, and his final choice to "give permission" enables the cork's flight. However, the choice itself is more ritual than decision under pressure—no live alternative is dramatized, and the cost remains abstract ("that was not the point"). The character is essential to the premise but does not create a key turn that narrows options with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cork is introduced early (first third), held and honored mid-ascent (middle beat), and released at closure, satisfying all three gates. Its "purifies intentions" attribute shapes the protagonist's channeling method, and its physical departure—lifting, suspended, then shooting outward—charges the final image. The cork's rough-hewn texture and vibration-attuned structure are specific and irreplaceable. Penalty: the cork does not constrain a choice with visible cost; Elias releases it without dramatized hesitation or tradeoff, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The concept "vibrations of intent" is present throughout: introduced as Elias's theory, invoked during the scent-creation, and implied in the cork's flight on "a focused filament of air." It frames the premise but does not alter on-page tactics or force a choice under pressure. The protagonist's actions—channeling pure desire, releasing the cork—enact the concept without testing or complicating it. The concept is functional but swappable with a near-synonym metaphysical system; removing "vibrations" and keeping "purified intent" would leave the story largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The attribute "purifies intentions" is introduced early (first third), shapes the protagonist's channeling method (middle: "he focused on the cork, channeling the purified desire through it"), and enables the final release (closure: "a single, purified thought"). It satisfies all three gates. However, the attribute does not impose a visible cost or tradeoff; Elias uses it without struggle or sacrifice, and the text does not dramatize what impurity was stripped or what ego was forfeited. The attribute is present and causal but lacks the felt constraint required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action "beckon" appears at closure: "the wind itself seemed to beckon it" and Elias "gave the cork permission to leave." This final beckoning enables the cork's flight and completes the ritual. However, the action is introduced late (final third) without prior setup or middle development, violating the early-signal and middle-development gates. The beckoning is essential to the ending image but was not signaled or tested earlier, and the protagonist does not perform the beckoning—the wind does—reducing agency. Late arrival and passive execution cap the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The method "by the scent of a garden at night" is seeded early ("the method had come to him in a dream… by the scent of a garden at night") and enacted at the climax (night-blooming cereus, moonflower, damp earth). It shapes the protagonist's middle attempt—he channels the idea of nocturnal fragrance—and charges the closure by making the cork's departure ride "a filament of air that held the scent of a midnight garden." All three gates are satisfied. Penalty: the method is described as received ("came to him in a dream") rather than discovered through struggle, and its mechanics are asserted rather than tested with cost, keeping the score in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse is introduced immediately (setup), supplies the spiral stairs and balcony that frame the ascent and release (middle and closure), and its "messenger by design" attribute anchors the thematic premise. The setting is specific—cobalt paint, salt-stashed rock, narrow balcony—and the height enables the cork's outward flight. However, the lighthouse does not constrain a choice or impose a cost; it provides a stage rather than shaping tactics under pressure. The dawn timeframe and lighthouse color charge the final image, lifting the score into the upper-6 band, but the setting remains more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the heat wave breaks" is established in the opening line and provides atmospheric relief ("cool air," "profound… benediction"). It frames the protagonist's resolve ("the heat had made the world brittle… but it had also amplified his own quiet resolve") and the quietude that enables the whisper-test. However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics or impose a deadline; the story unfolds in a single continuous ascent without time pressure or a live clock. The timeframe supplies mood and thematic contrast but is largely replaceable with any calm-after-storm moment, capping the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts" is introduced early (first third), drives the ascent and scent-creation (middle), and is enacted in the cork's release (closure). It shapes all three beats and is specific to Elias's theory-testing stance. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; we do not see what Elias sacrifices or what competing desire he must overcome. The "screaming tenderness" offers texture but remains abstract. The motivation is present and causal but lacks the on-page friction required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tone "screaming tenderness" is named explicitly ("a screaming tenderness had settled in his chest") and colors the middle section with "fierce, protective love for the silence." It modulates at closure into "profound calm, the warmth of a message sent." The tone is coherent and purposeful, yet the label "screaming tenderness" reads as an imposed descriptor rather than emerging from embodied perception. The tone does not shift under pressure in a way that charges the final image with undeniable cost; instead, it transitions smoothly from tenderness to calm without complication. Present and functional but not indispensable.</comment>
