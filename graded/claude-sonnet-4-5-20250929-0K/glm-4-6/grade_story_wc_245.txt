<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael's interior life is established through embodied perception (tremor language, ring warmth, note-as-shiver), and the opening grounds him in consistent sensory filtering. However, the motivation—"to quiet the storm in his own soul"—remains abstract and label-only; no prior micro-choice or contradiction dramatizes what grief or longing cost him in tactical terms. The final smile and "genuine smile in years" land as summary epiphany rather than earned renunciation with visible price. Agency is present but the internal arc resolves via assertion, not on-page foreclosure of a concrete path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the three-note sequence deepens immersion and the final stillpoint image reconfigures the opening quest from external cartography to internal recognition. Orientation anchors quickly (blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest, platinum ring) and the closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost, however, is asserted ("consumed his fear, his grief, his longing") rather than shown through a tactical forfeiture or body-level price; the final walk back feels like soft reset. One meaningful deepening is present, but the conceptual cost remains oblique and the "he finally saw" line tilts toward thematic summary rather than charged image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vivid and purposeful: pulsing bark, tremor-speech ground, shifting tree-hum all filter through Kael's sensory hierarchy and the environment narrows as he approaches the stillpoint. The platinum ring functions as micro-setting, absorbing vibration and feeding warmth; its coolness at closure charges the final image. Spatial choreography (forest floor yielding, trees bowing) stays coherent, and the forest's acoustic texture constrains his dowsing method throughout. One minor slip: "across the pause of shifting constellations" recurs as poetic frame but never constrains an on-page tactic or alters a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the stillpoint) is signaled early and the three-note sequence provides one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. The B flat "struck him like a physical blow, forcing him to his knees" gestures toward cost, but the resolution—"consumed his fear, his grief, his longing"—erases complexity without trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the ending grants "heart full" satisfaction without visible price or tactical sacrifice. Under Accumulative pressure, one decisive intensification is present, but the final reconfiguration does not narrow options or leave a felt wound on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (internal versus external maps, stillness as state rather than place) emerges cleanly from the dowsing structure and the final image reweights the opening quest. The platinum ring's cooling and the forest's single perfect note offer non-literal closure without moralization. However, "the map he had sought was not of the world outside but of the world within" and "he finally saw" edge toward summary statement rather than letting the image carry full weight. The thematic question is clear and the ending answers it, but relies on modest exposition to close the conceptual loop rather than trusting resonance alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "a language his feet had learned," "tasted like honey on his tongue," sensory filtering throughout. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated. Two slips lower the score: "selfish and sacred" is thesis-like phrasing, and runs of elevated register ("coalescing into harmony," "consumed his fear, his grief, his longing") drift from embodied perception into narrated summary at peak beats. The final "quiet blaze" recurrence charges the close, but the "he finally saw" line asserts revelation rather than showing perceptual shift. No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory lines often do double duty (ring warmth, tremor-speech). However, patterned artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("not as a destination but as a presence," "not as a place but as a state of being," "not of the world outside but of the world within"), template "the X came as Y" cadence for all three notes, and filter-verb reliance ("could feel," "realized"). The closure paragraph stacks summary ("he had reached," "he realized," "he finally saw") rather than propelling through image. Synonym churn ("chaos of sounds," "ultrasonic song," "symphony") recurs without added pressure. Apply −0.8 for multiple artifacts; −1.0 total for touching closure with summary stack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The blind-mapmaker-dowsing-for-internal-stillness synthesis is purposeful and the sensory inversion (ultrasonic forest, tremor language, skin-absorbed tongues) adds texture. However, the emotional-cartography frame and the journey-inward resolution follow familiar bildungsroman and quest-as-self-discovery templates without a sharp counter-reading or non-obvious moral calculus. The three-note structure provides clean escalation but the final image—smiling, heart-full protagonist walking back—offers tidy satisfaction rather than a charged ambiguity or cost that lingers. Specific sensory detail elevates the piece above generic execution, but the thematic resolution does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's choices (stepping toward notes, kneeling at B flat, walking back) drive the sequence and his perceptual filtering shapes every beat. However, key turns (note arrivals, stillpoint revelation) are delivered to him rather than earned through tactical decision under constraint. Present across all three gates and involved in multiple beats, but his agency is more reactive than driving.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The platinum ring appears in the opening, absorbs vibration mid-sequence ("ring pulsing," "ring glowing softly"), and cools at closure to signal completion. Handled in three distinct beats and the cooling charges the final image. However, the ring's mechanics (how it translates vibration to warmth, why it glows) remain ornamental description; no on-page choice hinges on its specific properties versus a generic sensory tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The stillpoint shapes the quest from the opening ("a hidden stillpoint rumored to lie at the heart of the wood"), drives the dowsing method, and is revealed at closure as "not a destination but as a state of being." The concept constrains tactics (following notes toward it) and the final reconfiguration (external to internal) reweights the premise with conceptual cost (he must abandon literal cartography). Present across all three gates and integral to the thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The skin-absorption trait is described early ("absorbed the forest's silent symphony," "feeding him fragments of forgotten tongues—lost dialects of birds, the dead speech of stones") and mentioned at closure ("its languages absorbed"). However, no on-page choice tests or leverages the trait's mechanics; it functions as atmospheric flavor rather than tactical enabler or constraint. No visible cost or tradeoff tied to absorbing language through skin versus another sense.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dowsing structures the entire middle sequence: Kael lifts his hand, sways, follows the trail. The method is signaled early ("began to dowse") and the three-note beats are dowsing results. However, the mechanics (why dowsing reveals musical notes, how body-swaying connects to the ring's warmth) remain vague, and the final turn (stillpoint as internal state) does not hinge on dowsing's unique properties. Functional across beats but somewhat swappable with "questing" or "sensing."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The musical-note trail is signaled early ("follow a trail of musical notes"), structures all three middle beats (C minor, G sharp, B flat), and the completed melody reveals the stillpoint. Each note arrival narrows his path and the "melody now complete" line triggers closure. The method's mechanics (why these specific notes, how they guard the stillpoint) matter to pacing and the final "single, perfect note" charges the ending. Indispensable to the story's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is present from the opening, its pulsing bark and tremor-ground filter every perception, and the trees' acoustic behavior (chaos coalescing, final hum) marks progression toward the stillpoint. The environment constrains Kael's method (he must dowse through vibration) and the forest's quieting signals proximity to closure. However, the forest could be replaced with another synesthetic landscape (e.g., a color-shifting desert, a temperature-sensitive glacier) without breaking story logic. Strong atmospheric presence but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The phrase "across the pause of shifting constellations" appears twice as poetic frame but does not anchor elapsed time or tighten a decision. The three-note sequence implies progression ("an hour later") but no on-page clock pressure forces a trade-off or alters tactics. Ornamental; could be removed without changing choices or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation ("to navigate uncharted emotional depths, to find the one note that would quiet the storm in his own soul") is declared early and the closure delivers internal stillness. However, the emotional storm remains abstract—no on-page micro-choice dramatizes what grief or longing cost him before the quest. The final satisfaction ("heart full") asserts rather than shows the want/cost friction. Functional but told-dominant.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "quiet blaze" phrase bookends the piece (midpoint "quiet blaze that consumed his fear" and closing "quiet blaze within") and the tone balances restraint with sensory intensity throughout. However, the tone does not modulate distinctly under pressure; the same lyric register persists from opening to closure. The final reprise charges the ending but the tone itself remains static rather than escalating or contrasting with earlier beats.</comment>
