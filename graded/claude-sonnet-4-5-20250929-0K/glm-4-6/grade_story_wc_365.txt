<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to discover withheld truth is stated but never dramatized through competing impulses or visible internal conflict. The younger-self encounter lacks embodied emotion—he observes and nudges probability without visceral hesitation or cost beyond "agonizing" pull-back. Interiority relies heavily on elevated abstractions ("cartographer of his own soul," "profound resonance") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The final shift from haunted to "solid, real" is told rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; no penalty. The piece attempts a causal lens: shard touch → world-shift → datapad nudge → log resurfaces. However, the closure unit—"withheld truth was no longer a whisper; it was a stone"—is abstract declaration rather than on-page decisive change with visible cost. The log's resurfacing happens off-stage ("a new whisper crept into his senses"), and Kael never opens it or acts on its weight; the ending summarizes emotional resolution ("ghosts...had fallen silent") without a legible before/after in choice or consequence. Cost is asserted ("painful terminus") but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rust-eaten repair bay is introduced early with sensory texture (metallic tang, corroded tools), and the green shard's location under the spanner ties setting to object discovery. The parallel-universe bay ("gleaming starship, crisp uniforms") provides contrast but remains postcard description—Kael moves through it without spatial constraint or environmental pressure altering his tactics. The setting does not constrain the datapad nudge or charge the final image; micro-setting (body, tool) potential is unrealized because the shard's cyclical spontaneity controls transitions rather than environmental friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover withheld truth) is signaled early. One tightening: shard activates → Kael jumps realities → nudges probability to expose the log. However, escalation is thin—no on-page opposition, no failed attempt, no visible trade-off between competing goods. The "tiny push to send the incriminating security log" lacks friction; probability nudging is described as effortless ("focused thought") with no cost until the shard heats (exit cue, not a choice-driven price). The log's resurfacing is told in summary; Kael does not act on it within the window, so the tightening does not foreclose a live option or force a final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of truth and self-cartography emerges from events but the final paragraph moralizes: "no longer just a map maker of places; he was a cartographer of his own soul." The shard recurs (tool → memento) with modest reweighting, but the shift is told rather than shown through image. "Profound resonance of a story finally, correctly told" is abstract assertion rather than a non-literal answer arising from particulars. The piece avoids simplistic binaries yet leans on prompt labels ("weaving between worlds," "cyclically spontaneous") and summary wisdom instead of letting the final image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries elevated diction ("chaotic symphony," "flimsy membranes between realities," "agonizing, like being unstitched") that often drifts above the POV's plausible lexicon during peak stress. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though filter verbs ("he knew," "he felt") are frequent. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature (sensory mapping) is gestured at but not consistently embodied in how Kael notices under pressure—descriptions read generic rather than character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: "vast chamber hummed with the ghosts of machinery," "chaotic symphony," "flimsy membranes between realities," "profound resonance of a story finally, correctly told." Mixed metaphors appear ("memento of a debt paid...across the tear in reality's fabric"). Template cadence runs: "The green glass shard..." opens multiple beats; "His...," "He...," "The..." stems recur without variation. Paraphrase loop: "The withheld truth was no longer a whisper; it was a stone" echoes "heavy, dense truth filling a void" two lines prior. Stock metaphors ("tectonic plates," "river of causality") and filter-verb stacks ("he knew," "he felt," "he saw") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph's summary declarations), triggering cumulative −1.7 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Core premise (sensory mapmaker using glass shard to navigate parallel realities and correct past injustice) combines familiar SF tropes without fresh synthesis. The scapegoat-engineer reveal and probability-nudge resolution follow template causality; emotional arc (haunted → resolved) could transfer to most wronged-protagonist stories with minor edits. Specificity in setting (spaceport repair bay) and the shard's cyclical spontaneity add texture but do not transform the core wronged-hero-clears-name structure. No bold risk-taking; the piece hedges toward safety with elevated diction and summary wisdom rather than visceral particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Sensory mapmaker trait is present (opening paragraph, final reflection) but drives only description, not key turns. Kael's choices (touch shard, nudge datapad) arise from goal rather than his mapping skill constraining or enabling tactics. The trait appears at setup and closure but does not shape middle escalation or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Green glass shard appears in three beats: discovery under spanner, activation for world-shift, and final memento. It enables the core turn (jump to parallel bay) and signals exit (grows hot). Closure reprise ("no longer a tool but a memento") reweights its meaning. Causal pressure is strong (without it, no journey), though cost tied to the shard itself (cyclical spontaneity frustration) remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is the method for the core turn: shard touch → world dissolves → parallel bay. It shapes the middle beat (Kael navigates altered reality to access the engineer) and participates in closure (return to own time). Specificity of mechanics (cyclical spontaneity, "probability nudge") adds texture. Swappability is low; time-travel or simple hacking would require major rewrites. Cost linkage is modest—transit pain is mentioned but not developed into a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Cyclically spontaneous trait is mentioned twice: setup ("would only respond to him at unpredictable moments, a frustrating dance") and implied when the shard grows hot. It does not constrain an on-page choice—Kael touches the shard once and it works; no failed attempt, no tactical adaptation to unpredictability. The trait is label-only; its cost ("frustrating") is told, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Redirect action occurs at the mid-beat: Kael nudges probability to send the security log to a public server. This is the core plot turn; without it, the Chimera Log does not resurface. However, the action is narrated in one brief moment ("With a focused thought, he nudged the probability") without friction, and the consequence (log resurfaces) is told in summary rather than shown on the page. Present at setup (implicit goal), development (executed), and closure (result), but the execution lacks on-page cost or tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Through parallel universes method is signaled early ("maps charted the flimsy membranes between realities") and executed in the middle beat (shard activates → parallel bay → datapad nudge → return). The mechanics matter: only by jumping realities can Kael access the unredacted moment. Appears in setup, development, and closure (return). Specificity is modest; the "cyclical spontaneity" adds texture but does not shape multiple attempts or force a tactical trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport repair bay is the frame for the opening and closing beats; the parallel-universe version is the middle location. Setup is vivid ("rust-eaten walls," "corroded hydraulic spanner"), and the setting supplies the shard. However, the environment does not pressure Kael's choices—he traces walls to build a sensory map (character color, not constraint), and the parallel bay is navigated without spatial friction. The setting is present at setup and closure but does not alter tactics or charge the final image beyond mood.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Timeframe "in the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears as abstract description in setup and closing reflection ("ghosts in the murmur of his dreams had fallen silent"). It functions as tone and metaphor, not a live constraint. No clock tightens decisions; the shard's heat signals exit, but duration and urgency are vague. The phrase is ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation to discover the weight of a withheld truth is stated early ("his motivation burned steady") and drives the plot: Kael uses the shard to access the past and redirect the log. Present in setup, development (goal pursued), and closure (truth becomes "a stone"). However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible hesitation—Kael acts without internal friction. Cost is told ("painful terminus") rather than shown in a micro-choice that forecloses a path.</comment>
