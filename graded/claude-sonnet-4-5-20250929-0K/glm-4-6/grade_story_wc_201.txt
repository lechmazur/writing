<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's proprioceptive enhancement shapes his experience concretely—feeling ground tilt, air currents, joint alignment—and his motivation (mathematics of mercy) drives the closure equation. However, the final "discovery" M = ∫(k/R) arrives as epiphany rather than earned choice; the protagonist endures and realizes but does not decide or renounce with visible cost that forecloses a path. Interior voice leans toward therapeutic abstraction ("trauma responses," "displaced rootedness") in places where embodied sensation could carry the work, weakening specificity under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density (violet forest, phantom mask pressure) builds to a conceptual repricing when Kael reframes mercy as active counter-action rather than negation, and the forest light shifts in response. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (he remains "rooted in trauma" but now "growing from it"), legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the trauma memory unlocks the equation, satisfying the lens requirement for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vivid—ozone, decay, violet-to-indigo glow, bark texture—and the phantom pewter mask strap functions as micro-setting, constraining Kael's recall and charging the closure moment when its pressure recedes. Spatial choreography (back against tree, hands bracing ground, taking a step forward) remains clear. The forest's light modulation at the epiphany directly charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate test, but the setting does not constrain an earlier choice, capping the score near the high 7s rather than 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover the mathematics of mercy) is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through sensory overload and trauma flashback, tightening when Kael's body replicates the mask constraint at peak intensity. The closure reweights his stance from passive survivor to active pioneer, with the forest becoming "the first variable in his proof." Cost is visible (he remains disoriented, "an outsider in his own skin") and the final step forward forecloses passive endurance. No antagonist or reversal, but the Accumulative lens allows deepening alone; escalation is driven by protagonist agency (bracing against memory) with legible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (mercy as deliberate counter-action, not absence) emerges through the contrast between quantified pain and the new equation, avoiding direct statement until the epiphany. The forest as "penance" shifts to "first variable," a resonant reprise that reweights the premise. However, the equation M = ∫(k/R) and the term "displaced rootedness" risk abstraction; the final insight feels more asserted than distilled from prior particulars. The closing metaphor ("rooted in trauma, but...growing") is effective but borders on tidy resolution, reducing ambiguity slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature (proprioceptive hyper-awareness) is distinct and consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during sensory immersion, pulling back for the equation discovery. However, diction drifts into clinical/therapeutic register ("enhanced interrogation survivor," "proprioceptively enhanced," "trauma responses") where embodied language would sharpen voice under pressure. No head-hopping, and the elevated tone at closure (the formula, "terrible and beautiful equation") reads intentional but risks slight register mismatch with earlier visceral beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in sensory passages. However, several template-cadence runs appear ("He was an enhanced interrogation survivor," "He was proprioceptively enhanced," "It was happening again," "It was a displaced rootedness") and the phrase "ultraviolet penance" recurs without dramatic variation. The equation reveal and terms like "displaced rootedness" lean abstract where concrete image would propel. Paraphrase loop: "his body had learned to adapt" adjacent to "his sense...heightened to an excruciating degree" restates the same content. Filter-verb stack ("He could feel the tilt...the subtle shift...the way his joints") in a high-pressure beat dulls immediacy. Total artifact load: −0.8 baseline, touching near-closure beats pushes penalty toward −1.0 and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fusion of speculative setting (ultraviolet forest), proprioceptive enhancement, and mercy-as-equation offers a fresh angle on trauma survival. However, the core trajectory—protagonist in surreal space processes trauma and gains insight—is a familiar template, and the story does not fully transform it through character-specific calculus or non-obvious moral stakes. The equation M = ∫(k/R) is novel but arrives as epiphany rather than earned tactical choice. Specific details (pewter mask strap notches, phantom pressure) create texture, but the emotional arc (survivor becomes pioneer) follows a recognizable healing path without bold subversion or high-risk structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Enhanced interrogation survivor: setup (opening), development (flashback shapes middle choice to brace against memory), payoff (survivor-to-pioneer shift at closure). Present in all three gates. Shapes one key turn (memory unlocks equation) and contributes to ending identity shift. Cost is visible (disorientation persists). However, the trait functions more as backstory anchor than active constraint on tactics; it enables the epiphany but does not narrow options in a second distinct beat. Causal pressure +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, two beats +0.9, but swappability (another trauma type could serve similarly) −0.5, yielding mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pewter mask strap: setup (opening touch, "familiar indentation"), development (flashback: "tightened...notch by notch"), payoff (phantom pressure recedes at closure). Present in all three gates and returns with reweighted meaning (constraint → key). Handled across three beats. However, the strap's action is mostly internal (phantom sensation) rather than physical handling that alters tactics on the page. Causal pressure moderate +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, three beats +1.4, but summary-only use in middle beat −0.4, lands low 6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Ultraviolet penance: setup (opening, "physical manifestation"), payoff (forest "no longer just a penance; it was the first variable"). Missing middle development—does not constrain or enable a choice between setup and ending. Two-gate cap 6.0. Lyric reprise reweights the stake at closure +0.8, but the concept remains thematic/atmospheric rather than shaping on-page tactics. Ornamental mid-story −0.6, swappability (another symbolic environment) −0.5, lands below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Proprioceptively enhanced: setup (opening explanation), development (heightened awareness allows endurance, "feel the tilt...shift...joints"), payoff (body replicates mask pressure to unlock equation). All three gates. The trait enables the climactic memory-trigger and is present across multiple beats. Causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, three beats +1.4. However, much of its function is told rather than dramatized (label-heavy exposition) −0.5, and the cost is conceptual rather than a visible tradeoff on the page −0.3, yielding mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Brace: setup (opening, "brace his hands against the ground"), development ("braced himself, not against the ground, but against the memory"), payoff (hands lowered as pressure recedes, then steps forward). All three gates. The verb shifts meaning across beats (physical → metaphorical → release) and the middle use is the pivot that enables the equation discovery. Two distinct beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +0.9, irreplaceability +0.5. Strong integration but not indispensable—removing it would require rewrite but not break story logic—caps near high 6s to low 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Remembering through trauma responses: setup (implicit early: "body had learned to adapt"), development ("He was remembering through trauma responses, the only way his mind could now access certain truths"), payoff (trauma memory unlocks equation, "clarity struck"). All three gates. The method is named explicitly in the middle and its mechanics drive the climactic turn. Causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, two beats +0.9. However, the method is more announced than shown—label-only trait −0.5—and summary-only in final beat −0.4, landing low 6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest: setup (opening anchor, "ozone and decay, canopy...violet glow"), development (violet hum overlays flashback), payoff (light flickers, "violet edges softening into...indigo," illuminates path). All three gates. The forest supplies sensory pressure throughout and its light shift at closure validates the equation discovery, participating actively in the ending image. Three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9 (provides disorienting constraint), closure linkage +1.3 (light modulation charges final image), irreplaceability +0.6. Solid high-7 integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>After the anesthesia wears off: setup (opening line), middle (implicit: events unfold as fog lifts), payoff (absent—time does not tighten decision at closure). Two gates only, cap 6.0. The timeframe anchors the opening but does not create a live clock or deadline that alters tactics. Present +0.3, but ornamental after setup −0.7, swappability (any post-disorientation frame) −0.6, lands low 4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To discover the mathematics of mercy: setup (explicit early: "pursuit...to discover the mathematics of mercy"), development (desire shapes the attempt to ground himself, "why he had consented"), payoff (equation M = ∫(k/R) fulfills the goal). All three gates. The motivation drives the arc and the closure delivers its object. Causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.5, three beats +1.4. However, the desire is mostly told and internal; it does not face on-page friction or competing wants that force a tradeoff. Told-only execution −0.8, minimal visible cost −0.4, lands mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Displaced rooted: named explicitly mid-story ("It was a displaced rootedness") and returns at closure ("still rooted in his trauma, but...also growing from it"). Two-gate lyric reprise. The tone (disorientation + anchoring in suffering) is coherent and modulates with pressure—violet harshness softens to indigo calm. Lyric reprise +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, coherence across beats +0.5. However, the label "displaced rooted" is abstract and the tone effect is more stated than embodied in rhythm or diction shift. Label-only trait −0.5, summary-only tone claim −0.3, lands mid-5s.</comment>
