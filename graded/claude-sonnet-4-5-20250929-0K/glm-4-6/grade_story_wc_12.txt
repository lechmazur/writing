<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The priest is given a ceremonial role but lacks embodied interiority or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Motivation ("illuminate hidden assumptions") remains abstract and is never dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing values. The entity's "resistance" and the priest's "resolve wavered" are told in label-only fashion without bodily sensation or irrational self-contradiction. No credible cost forecloses a path; the priest simply walks away intact.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words, so no penalty under the Orientation Test. However, the closure lacks visible cost: the priest "had won" and "stood," then leaves with tools intact and no dramatized forfeit or stance crystallization. The "unraveling stillness" is declared defeated but no on-page image shows what was traded or lost. Under a Situational lens (the priest vs. entity), coincidence (the entity "recoiled," "faltered") resolves the conflict without protagonist agency driving the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor, loop pedal, and violet pigment are named and reappear, lending atmospheric specificity. The chamber's "muffled clarity" and the pedal's hum provide sensory anchors. The violet circles "pulsing" and "expanding" participate in the final beat, pushing back the stillness, which charges the image slightly. Spatial choreography remains coherent (priest kneels, stands, walks), meeting micro-setting and object-as-setting standards for this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—stopping the possession before completion—is signaled early. Yet escalation is passive: the entity "recoils," "snarls," "thrashed," "faltered" in response to the priest's voice and paint, but the priest never faces a forced trade-off or narrowing of options. The "victory was fragile" is asserted without an on-page cost that alters later tactics. No reversal or tightening is driven by protagonist agency; the entity's collapse reads as coincidental surrender.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of "illuminating hidden assumptions" is declared but not dramatized; the priest's rhetorical devices ("metaphors of shadow, similes of decay, paradoxes of silence") remain ornamental lists rather than enacted logic that traps the entity. The violet pigment and silence motifs recur, and the final image of the priest walking away with the palette and pedal offers a muted echo. The piece resists overt moralizing, yet no non-literal reweighting of the central question lands because the question itself was never concretely posed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is thin; the priest's noticing lacks character-specific bias or idiom. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("unspoken intent," "tapestry of rhetorical devices") that distances rather than grounds. No dialogue is present. Under peak pressure, syntax remains uniform and declarative, missing the rhythmic modulation that would reflect stress or urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Template cadence is pervasive: "The priest [verb]" opens nine sentences, flattening propulsion. Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third ("The priest's method was through rhetorical devices" immediately after "his chant grew louder, the loops overlapping until they formed a tapestry of rhetorical devices"). "Unraveling stillness" and "dimensional anchor" repeat without accruing new meaning. Filter verbs ("The priest was here," "His motivation was clear") stack in expository beats. No mixed metaphors or major clarity breaks, but density is low and momentum sags under repetitive phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The loop-pedal exorcist and single-color palette offer a fresh synthesis of ritual and audio art. Yet the execution leans on familiar exorcism beats (entity recoils, priest prevails, fragile victory). The rhetorical-device method is declared but not dramatized with non-obvious tactics; the entity's contradictions are never made legible on the page. The premise is specific, but the emotional and causal arc could transpose to a standard banishment without loss, signaling mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; early setup, middle involvement (chanting, painting), closure participation (stands, walks away). Yet the priest's actions are reactive demonstrations rather than decisions that narrow options. No forked choice with visible cost. Functional but largely observational, fitting low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Appears early (first third), used in three beats (dipping brush, painting stroke, painting spiral and circle), and present at closure ("the violet color was gone, but its memory lingered"). The pigment's fading and glowing stages offer slight reweighting. However, it enables no tactic the priest could not perform otherwise; swappable with another ritual tool. Causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Unraveling stillness" is named in the setup, mentioned mid-story, and declared defeated at closure. Yet it never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The priest's actions (chanting, painting) do not visibly adapt to the stillness's mechanics. Present and thematically consistent, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Decorates with silence" appears as a label ("The priest decorated with silence, his movements a language in themselves") but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. The violet strokes and chant loops are the active means; silence is asserted context. No tradeoff or tactical shift tied to this trait. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Plumb the depths of the possession" is stated as intent ("The priest was here to plumb the depths…") and the chant/paint sequence enacts a probing action. However, no major turn traces uniquely to this verb; the priest could "confront," "banish," or "bind" with similar beats. Functional but mid-swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Rhetorical devices are named ("metaphors of shadow, similes of decay, paradoxes of silence," "rhetorical question") in the middle third and participate in the entity's defeat. Yet their mechanics remain abstract; no on-page example shows how a specific device traps the entity. The method is present but not dramatized with unique pressure. Swappable with "incantations" or "logic."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor appears in setup, middle (quivers, flares, shuddered), and closure (stabilized). It provides the battlefield and responds to pressure, offering mild micro-setting constraint. The priest's tactics do not adapt to the anchor's state in ways that foreclose options, but its flaring and stabilizing rhythm charges the final image slightly. Two-gate plus lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Before the possession completes" is established in the opening and frames urgency ("a race against the unraveling stillness"). Yet no on-page countdown or tightening window alters the priest's moves; the entity falters when the text declares it, not because time ran out. Time is present as setup but does not constrain middle or closure choices. Functional framing only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden assumptions" is stated twice as motivation but never dramatized through a choice that trades one want against another. The priest's chant and paint are declarative demonstrations, not conflicted probings. No friction between the goal and a competing cost on the page. Told-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Muffled clarity" is established early ("the chamber hummed with a muffled clarity"), recurs in sensory details (absorbed sound, low pulsing light), and lands in the final image ("the silence now clean, pure"). Tone modulates slightly under pressure (crescendo, then exhale) and charges the ending. Coherent across beats and purposeful at closure, reaching low-7 eligibility; capped at 6.2 due to static mood in middle beats and modest pressure modulation.</comment>
