<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and grounded in the borrowed heartbeat conceit, which provides a concrete physical anchor. However, the painter remains largely observational; her choices are ritualistic rather than conflicted, and the borrowed heart functions more as thematic ornament than a force that constrains or complicates her decisions under pressure. The emotional arc is asserted ("she would return tomorrow") without dramatized cost or a credible path foreclosed. No meaningful internal contradiction or micro-choice alters her stance by the end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the painter performs a ritual, the mirage coalesces, and dissolves as bells ring. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (terrace, spring, prism parapet). However, closure is Resonant Reconfiguration by patterned recursion—the final image reweights prior material through the girl's reflection and the promise of return—but the cost remains abstract and deferred ("she would return tomorrow"). The ending offers charged poise without on-page forfeiture or a visible path closed, landing at the threshold of a meaningful tightening but not crossing it decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and post-rain light are vividly rendered and recur across beats, shaping the painter's workspace and ritual timing. The cathedral bells impose a hard time constraint that governs the action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though at times the lush register drifts slightly elevated. The prism parapet charges the final image by continuing its refractive work after the painter departs, satisfying the 9+ gate partially but not decisively constraining a mid-scene choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the mirage painting before the bells shatter the hush—is signaled early and provides a time-bound pressure. The borrowed heartbeat accelerates slightly as the work nears completion, offering a micro-turn. However, the stakes remain largely procedural; no live option is foreclosed, and the painter's tactics do not visibly narrow under the pressure. The cost is conceptual (ephemeral art, secrecy) rather than dramatized through a trade-off or forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conceit of mirage painting and borrowed heartbeats: art as ephemeral bridge between possibility and reality, the cost of isolation for vision. The final image—the girl seeing alternate selves—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the theme is stated overtly in places ("to capture the ephemeral bridges between what is and what could be"), and the coded lullabies concept borders on symbolic convenience, introduced but not deeply integrated into character cost or conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistently lyric and distant-third, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring light, sound, and spectral imagery. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts elevated ("perceptively calm," "dusky harmony") in ways that read slightly ornamental rather than strictly character-bound. The borrowed heartbeat metaphor threads through interiority, but the prose leans heavily on abstract nouns and passive constructions ("was traded," "could coax") that soften immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythm varies purposefully, with strong sensory anchors and minimal grammatical slips. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, the piece exhibits paraphrase loops ("elusive in reputation, though not by choice" / "elusive not by intention but by necessity"), template cadence in the third paragraph ("She began to hum… a method she had developed… Each note carried…"), and filter-verb stacks ("she could feel," "could persuade"). These artifacts cluster in expository beats rather than the closure, limiting the deduction to mid-band penalty (−0.6 in Q7).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat and mirage painting blend into a coherent fantastical premise with vivid, specific detail (prism parapet, coded lullabies). However, the core conceit—artist sacrificing for ephemeral art—is familiar, and the transformation is primarily atmospheric rather than driven by non-obvious moral calculus or narrative surprise. The coded lullabies and mirror-persuasion feel more like flavor than structural necessity. The ending's grace note (girl's reflection) is lovely but predictable given the setup, offering lyricism without bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The elusive mirage painter is present throughout and her ritual actions anchor every beat. However, her choices are procedural rather than decisive; she enacts a practiced method without conflict or variation. She does not face a mid-scene reversal or make a choice that narrows options. The character frames the premise but does not drive a turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The prism parapet appears in the opening, recurs in the middle beat as it casts fractal patterns across the canvas, and returns in the final image continuing its patient work. It enables the painter's art through refractive light and charges the closure by persisting after she leaves. It crosses all three gates (setup, development, closure) and is irreplaceable in its specific optical function, but it does not constrain a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat is introduced early with clear backstory (traded three days prior with a dying musician), recurs as a steady rhythm during painting, and accelerates slightly at the climax, syncing with the bells. It provides perceptual texture and thematic resonance (steadiness vs. unpredictability), but it does not change tactics or narrow options on the page. The cost of the trade is mentioned but not dramatized as a friction that shapes the present action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" appears as a label in the opening and again in the fourth paragraph ("perceptively calm assessment"), describing the painter's manner rather than enabling or constraining an action. It does not shape a choice or create visible tradeoff; it is ornamental voice texture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Grace appears in the painter's movements ("otherworldly grace," "practiced grace") and is tied to her borrowed heartbeat's steady rhythm. It recurs across beats but functions as descriptive texture rather than a causal action. Removing "grace" and substituting "fluidity" or "precision" would not alter the story's logic or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The coded lullabies in children's songs are introduced early as the painter's method, explained with specificity (certain melodies coax dimensions to unfurl), and recur as she hums during the painting process. They enable the mirage and appear in the closure beat (the girl's reflection is a result of the lullabies set in motion). However, the mechanics are asserted rather than tested; the lullabies do not face failure or adaptation, limiting their causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The echoing terrace in spring is the sole setting, established immediately and reinforced across beats. The terrace amplifies her humming, the spring timing is mentioned, and the location recurs in the final paragraph. It supplies the requisite isolation and acoustics for the ritual, and the bells' resonance across the city depends on the terrace. It shapes the painter's choice to work there and charges the ending, but does not impose a mid-scene constraint that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hush before bells ring is the timeframe, signaled in the opening as "the brief window" and "suspended moment," iterated as "daily meditation," and resolved when "the hush before bells ring was ending" and the bells finally ring. The time constraint governs the painter's urgency, accelerates her heartbeat, and triggers the mirage's dissolution. It tightens decisions and is causally active in the closure beat, qualifying as essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation to persuade mirrors to show possibilities is stated explicitly in the opening and closing, framing the painter's ritual. However, it is never dramatized as a conflicted choice; the painter succeeds without friction, and no competing want or cost tests her commitment. The desire is told rather than shown under pressure, trending toward ornamental premise rather than lived stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dusky harmony appears explicitly in the final sentence ("dusky harmony between notes, between heartbeats") and is implied through the lyric, contemplative register throughout. The tone is consistent—soft, spectral, meditative—and modulates slightly as the bells approach and the painter departs. It charges the final image by naming the effect, but the tone does not shift dramatically under pressure or create friction with events, remaining largely static and atmospheric.</comment>
