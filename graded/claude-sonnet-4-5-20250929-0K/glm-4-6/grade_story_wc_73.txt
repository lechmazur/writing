<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's "grim optimist" stance is declared more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The dice-clutching and equation-writing show goal pursuit, but interior texture relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("texture of a missed opportunity," "perpetual motion that traps souls") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The final laugh and healed-dice moment gesture toward change, but the path from regret-loop to freedom reads more as thematic assertion than earned agency with visible psychological cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, spiraling stairs, dice) arrive early. The causal chain—mapping, calculating, writing proofs, staircase crumbling—follows a because/therefore structure, but key mechanics (how proofs "rupture" infinity, why the chipped die splits at that moment) remain vague, weakening the closure's felt cost. The ending lands a Decisive Change (staircase gone, dice healed, Elias free), yet the transition from abstract equations to physical dissolution lacks the specificity that would make the cost undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is vividly established (spiraling, identical steps, heavy air, groaning stone) and recurs across beats. However, spatial choreography remains generic—no anchor for scale, curvature, or how Elias orients within the loop. The dice function as a recurring object that charges the closure (chipped → split → healed), meeting the 9+ test, but the broader setting operates more as symbolic frame than tactical constraint that alters his choices mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape the loop) is signaled early. Pressure escalates via the proof-writing sequence, and the crumbling steps provide one meaningful tightening. Yet the decisive rupture unfolds without visible trade-off or cost legibility—Elias risks "everything" in abstract terms, but no live option is foreclosed on the page before the stairs dissolve. The final step onto solid ground registers relief more than a hard-won sacrifice, leaving escalation functional but under-charged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (regret as infinite loop, solved by understanding) emerges from particulars, and the dice/proofs/staircase motifs recur with shifted meaning. However, the final paragraph over-articulates the lesson: "a wound but a lesson," "not by escaping confinement, but by embracing its boundlessness," "a riddle solved." These thematic echo statements replace scene pressure and approach explicit moralizing (−0.6 in Q5 per anti-pattern), reducing resonance to summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a slightly elevated register ("grim optimist," "perpetual motion," "rupturing mechanism") that feels consistent but tilts abstract under peak pressure. Perceptual signature is present (focus on dice texture, equation symbols) but not deeply idiosyncratic. The narration occasionally drifts into helpful-narrator mode ("The infinite staircase was a mirror…"), softening voice distinctness at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally high, but the prose carries noticeable scaffold and loops: "The infinite staircase" appears seven times, often in consecutive beats; "grim optimist" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment; "texture of a missed opportunity" is repeated verbatim. Paraphrase loops touch the ending ("not as a trap, but as a choice" / "not by escaping… but by embracing"), and the final three paragraphs recycle closure-summary phrasing. Template cadence ("The dice… The chipped die…") and stock metaphor strings ("fragments scattered like dust") dull momentum. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack (loops, label-only traits, stock metaphor strings present; final third affected): baseline −0.8 in Q7, escalated to −1.2 because artifacts appear in closure beats. Additional cap triggered: disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise (infinite-staircase punishment solved by math) is conceptually appealing but closely echoes familiar metaphysical-prison tropes without transforming them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "mathematical proofs" remain abstract—no equations are shown, no specific flaw in infinity is dramatized—reducing the freshness of the solution. The dice motif and grim-optimist stance offer texture, but the arc (trapped → proofs → freedom) follows a median template path. Applying the Derivative Premise Guardrail: −0.8 adjustment within Q8 for close match to widely used template without sufficient transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias ("grim optimist") is present throughout and his choices (stopping to roll dice, writing proofs, stepping forward at the end) shape key turns. However, the trait functions more as a repeated label than a constraint that forces visible trade-offs. The final laugh and decision to walk away demonstrate agency, but the proof-writing sequence—the pivotal choice—unfolds without on-page friction or cost tied to his optimism versus despair. Signaled early (+0.5), present in three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.0), but swappable optimism label (−0.5), summary-only character work in key beats (−0.5), and lack of specific cost tied to the trait (−0.4). Starting anchor 3.0 + 2.4 positive − 1.4 friction = 4.0, rounded to 4.2 for slight causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dice appear in the opening line (setup +0.6), rolled mid-scene (beat involvement +0.4), and return at closure when the chipped die splits and is later healed (closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6). The chip's texture is concretely handled ("rough against his thumb," "landed askew," "split perfectly in two"), and the healed state at the end reweights the regret motif. However, the dice do not constrain a choice—they are rolled as witness/symbol rather than enabling or narrowing tactics under pressure (−0.6 for ornamental use in middle beat, −0.3 for lack of causal pressure). Starting 3.0 + 2.8 positive − 0.9 friction = 4.9; strong lyric reprise and closure charge lift to 6.8 within band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Perpetual motion" is named early as the core haunting concept (setup +0.5) and explicitly frames the stakes ("not the kind that runs machines, but the kind that traps souls"). The proofs halt the motion at closure (closure linkage +0.9). However, the concept remains abstract—no on-page dramatization of how infinite regression operates or how the flaw functions. It shapes theme more than tactics; removing "perpetual motion" and substituting "infinite loop" would not alter the plot structure (swappability −0.6, ornamental in middle beats −0.4). Starting 3.0 + 1.4 positive − 1.0 friction = 3.4; slight causal charge at closure lifts to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Balancedly daring" appears twice as a descriptor ("He balanced daring and despair," "balancedly daring, risking everything") but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. The proof-writing is framed as risk, yet no on-page consequence or trade-off (e.g., exhaustion, error, lost resource) materializes. The trait is label-only (−0.6), late restatement without new development (−0.3), and swappable with "cautiously bold" (−0.5). Starting 3.0 + 0.0 positive (no beat involvement, no closure linkage) − 1.4 friction = 1.6; slight thematic coherence lifts to 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rupture" is announced as intention early ("Today, he would rupture the cycle"), enacted through the proof-writing, and realized when the steps crumble (setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0). The action drives the major turn from confinement to freedom. However, the rupture mechanism is vague—"elegant flaw" is declared, not shown—reducing irreplaceability; substituting "break" or "shatter" would fit with minor edits (swappability −0.5, summary mechanics −0.4). Starting 3.0 + 2.5 positive − 0.9 friction = 4.6; causal centrality lifts to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Mathematical proofs" are signaled early ("The proofs were his weapon," "years mapping… calculating"), used mid-scene when Elias scrawls equations (beat involvement +0.4), and credited at closure ("The proofs had worked"). Setup is present (+0.5), and the method shapes the climax (+0.9). Yet no proof content appears on the page—no equation is shown, no specific flaw articulated—leaving the mechanics summary-only (−0.7) and swappable with "arcane ritual" or "logic puzzles" (−0.6). Starting 3.0 + 1.8 positive − 1.3 friction = 3.5; closure participation lifts to 4.8 within band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is present from the opening line, pressures Elias across the entire arc (setup +0.8, three beats +1.4), and its dissolution is the decisive closure moment (closure linkage +1.5). The groaning stone, crumbling steps, and spatial loop constrain his tactics (he must calculate angles, inscribe equations on steps). Specificity is strong ("spiraled endlessly," "each step identical," "stone echoing like a sigh"), and the setting is irreplaceable—swapping to "infinite corridor" would require substantial rewrite (+0.7 specificity). Starting 3.0 + 4.4 positive = 7.4; slight swappability friction (−0.3 for abstract "boundless confinement" theme overlay) nets 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Required element is "None."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To capture the texture of a missed opportunity" is stated early as Elias's motivation (setup +0.6) and recurs at closure ("captured the texture… not by reliving it, but by solving it," "no longer a wound but a lesson"). The desire drives his proof-writing and frames the final release (closure linkage +1.0, two beats +0.9). However, the "texture" remains abstract—no specific sensory or emotional detail of the original gamble is dramatized, only asserted ("the sharp crack of the dice, the gasp of the crowd, the slip of his hand" is summary without scene cost). Summary-only (−0.6), swappable with "to understand his mistake" (−0.5). Starting 3.0 + 2.5 positive − 1.1 friction = 4.4; thematic through-line lifts to 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Boundless confinement" is the story's tonal spine: the paradox of infinite space that traps rather than liberates. The tone is coherent from "prison and purpose" through "groaning stone" to "soft light" at closure, modulating from oppressive to released. The final image ("not as a trap, but as a choice," "infinite in a new way") charges the tone's inversion (closure linkage +1.4). Setup is implicit but clear (+0.6), and the tone shapes two distinct emotional beats (heavy ascent, tentative hope; +0.9). However, the paradox is stated more than felt in micro-detail (−0.4 for abstraction). Starting 3.0 + 2.9 positive − 0.4 friction = 5.5; strong tonal payoff at closure lifts to 6.9.</comment>
