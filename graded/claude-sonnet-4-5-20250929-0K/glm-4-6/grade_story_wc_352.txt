<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's "prism-mind" is deployed as label rather than lived contradiction; we see observations refracted but no competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her motivation to "restore balance to a world tilting toward dangerous myopia" arrives as abstract thesis rather than embodied choice under pressure. The final paragraph claims "expanded consciousness" without on-page cost or foreclosed path—she walks home carrying prize boxes with no visible trade-off. Emotional progression is telescoped through therapy-adjacent phrasing ("latent blaze of purpose") that replaces embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal-Situational Hybrid; the grotto crossing is motivated but closure lacks visible cost. Orientation anchors appear by ~80 words (library → city → quarries) within tolerance. The central causal thread holds—margin doodle signals grotto, gravity inversion permits entry, crystals deliver knowledge—but the ending awards full success without on-page price: Elara returns unscathed with "seeds of vigilance" boxed and her work "only begun," deferring consequence entirely off-page. The structural turn (discovery of crystals) happens on schedule but resolves without foreclosing options or altering stance in the present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto receives vivid atmospheric detail ("mist coiled around her ankles, whispering in languages that predated human speech") yet functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through library, streets, quarries, standing stones, and grotto passages. The gravity inversion is described but does not materially limit Elara's choices; she passes through unimpeded and returns when the hour ends without tactical cost. The crystal formations appear as discovery objects rather than environmental pressure that alters her approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("to find where forgotten combinations hide") is signaled early and pursued linearly without meaningful resistance. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; each step—reading doodle, traveling to grotto, entering at inversion, retrieving crystals—succeeds as planned. The manuscript describes "terrified detail" about the threshold but Elara experiences no fear, injury, or trade-off. Closure awards complete success with no visible cost: she integrates the combinations, contains them safely, and walks home planning future work. Escalation is declarative (unwonted intensity, latent blaze) rather than dramatized through narrowing choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed knowledge and vigilance is announced explicitly ("fundamental arrangements of reality that had been deliberately suppressed") rather than earned through scene particulars. The final paragraph moralizes openly: "humanity was ready to plant them properly" and "a new way of seeing" state the thesis rather than letting the image resonate. The "prism-mind refracted the coming sunrise into impossible new spectrums" attempts symbolic closure but carries no felt ambiguity or conceptual cost—it asserts transcendence without dramatizing the price of perception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature ("prism-mind refracting") is asserted but not shown through distinct idiom or selective attention under stress. Register drifts into academic ("constituent colors," "temporal element," "molecular structures encoding mathematical relationships") that exceeds her voice-motivated lexicon during peak beats. No dialogue present to assess. The prose at closure ("heralding the dawn not just of a new day, but of a new way of seeing") telegraphs meaning rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "her unique ability to splinter perception into constituent colors" restates the prism-mind concept introduced two sentences prior. Template cadence evident in the fourth paragraph with repeated "she [verb]" stems across four consecutive actions. Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh vehicle: "latent blaze," "seeds of vigilance," "serpentine grotto." Figurative density in the final paragraph ("refracted the coming sunrise into impossible new spectrums, heralding the dawn") stacks without causal grounding. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance description but few tighten pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Core premise (archivist with synesthetic perception finds hidden dimensional map) follows template quest logic without fresh inflection. The "prism-mind" ability is asserted but not explored through cost or limitation; it simply works when needed. Tropes (secret knowledge, liminal threshold, chosen seeker, reality layers) are executed competently but not transformed—the emotional and plot arc would function identically if "prism-mind" became "eidetic memory" and "grotto" became "vault." No synthesis or turn feels inevitable in hindsight; each beat delivers what the prior setup telegraphs.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; her observations drive the plot but her choices face no resistance. She decodes the doodle, travels, enters the grotto, and retrieves crystals without on-page decision cost. Swappable with "determined scholar" or "gifted researcher" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Appears early (weeks ago), returns at midnight pulsing with intensity, fulfills its map function at the grotto, then ceases glowing after use. Three beats with evolving meaning, but its mechanics are told rather than tested. Removing it would require a replacement signal but the grotto quest could proceed via another artifact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Mentioned as abstract goal ("seeds of vigilance were not metaphorical but literal entities") and delivered at the end as crystal formations. The concept is theme-claimed ("tools that could restore balance") but does not shape on-page tactics or force a trade-off. Ornamental metaphor rather than stake driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The doodle's luminescence enables discovery (glows under fourth quarter-moon, pulses with intensity) but imposes no constraint or cost. It functions as convenient signal rather than double-edged trait. Present in two beats but swappable with "hidden ink" or "enchanted map."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Entry to the grotto occurs once at the midpoint when gravity inverts; the act is successful without complication. "Reenter" implies prior visit but none is dramatized. The action shapes the middle beat but is swappable with "unlock" or "open portal" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Mentioned late ("pass through threshold effects") as the mechanism enabled by gravity inversion. Described rather than tested; Elara steps between stones and reality warps without on-page resistance. The method is present but does not constrain her approach or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The grotto receives atmospheric detail (mist, winding passages, breathing walls) and houses the crystals. It appears in the second half, provides the discovery location, and is present at closure when she exits. However, it does not pressure her choices—she navigates it successfully and leaves when the hour ends. One key beat plus closure presence, but setting as stage rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Gravity inversion occurs at 1:00 AM and lasts one hour, bracketing the grotto sequence. The clock is mentioned (struck midnight, precisely 1:00 AM, "when the hour of inversion ended") but does not tighten tactics—no rush, no close call, no cost. Time frame present in two beats but not leveraged for pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stated clearly ("to find where forgotten combinations hide") and pursued throughout. The desire shapes her journey but faces no friction; she locates the combinations without sacrifice. Motivation present early and at closure but told more than tested; no competing want or visible cost dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Latent blaze" appears twice as label ("latent blaze of purpose," "latent blaze of her mind intensified") but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Static descriptor rather than evolving tonal element. Present but ornamental.</comment>
