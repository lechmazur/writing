<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and stated early, but his characterization relies heavily on summary and abstract description ("peripherally focused attention," "working like the locks he designed") rather than concrete embodied action. The weeks of work are compressed into exposition rather than dramatized choices under pressure. His final decision to preserve the crystal feels pre-ordained rather than earned through visible internal conflict; there's no moment where he weighs competing goods or faces a meaningful cost that alters his options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear anchors (who, where, when by paragraph two). The closure—Elian removing and storing the crystal—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual and somewhat abstract ("something was always lost in healing"). The narrative traces a steady progression from broken mechanism to repair to harvest, with one meaningful deepening when the timer captures "not just sound, but the full resonance." However, the causality is smooth to the point of being frictionless; no reversal or complication tests Elian's path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern is vividly established early with purposeful detail (polished walls, crystal formations, reflection angles). Setting elements actively shape Elian's work: angles at different times of day, the north passage at noon, the western wall at dusk. The timer mechanism itself functions as micro-setting, constraining his approach. However, the cavern doesn't force a choice with visible cost at closure; it remains a well-described stage rather than a crucible that narrows options in the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder against cultural forgetting—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, the story lacks escalation or meaningful pressure. Elian faces no opposition, setback, or complication; the repair proceeds smoothly, the test succeeds immediately, and the harvest is "secured" without cost. The "wounded season" and impending scarcity create atmospheric stakes but never materialize as on-page obstacles. No choice narrows options or forecloses a path; the ending fulfills the plan exactly as conceived.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action: the cavern as repository, echoes as embodied memory, the "cellar of reason" as bulwark against spiritual winter. The contrast between practicality and poetry, imagination and barrenness, is woven through Elian's work without overt statement. The final image—wonder preserved "against the coming winter of the spirit"—offers resonant closure. However, "to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later use" skirts platitude, and the thematic assertion in the penultimate paragraph ("Scars remained, patterns changed") reads slightly over-articulated for the moment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with a consistent elevated register that matches Elian's reflective, technical mindset. Perceptual signature is clear ("peripherally focused attention," tracking "subtle gradations"). However, the voice occasionally drifts toward expository summary ("His motivation was simple yet profound") and some diction feels slightly detached from immediate experience ("the emotional architecture of wonder"). No dialogue present. Psychic distance remains controlled but the narration sometimes explains rather than embodying.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, but suffers from scaffold and paraphrase loops. "The timer mechanism" and "echoes" recur as stems across multiple adjacent sentences without variation. Several lines restate concepts: "the echoes were dissipating untapped" followed immediately by how "sound and memory struck different surfaces" covers similar ground. The phrase "not just X but Y" appears twice ("not just with gears but with resonant crystals," "not just sound, but the full resonance"). Figurative density is high in some beats ("frozen ripples in a timeless pond," "cartographers charted seas") but mixed metaphors emerge ("harvest," "cellar," "wounded season" all operating simultaneously). Template cadence in the mapping section: "Elian marked positions, recorded how echoes bounced..., how some angles amplified..." No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, but the cumulative line-level debt prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core premise—locksmith as memory preservationist harvesting echoes with a timer mechanism—offers a fresh synthesis. The "peripherally focused" trait and the specificity of reflection angles provide texture. However, the execution feels derivative of familiar "artisan preserving dying art against cultural amnesia" templates. The "wounded season" and "winter of the spirit" read as stock fantasy-register metaphors. The story proceeds without surprise or resistance; every step fulfills genre expectations. The emotional arc—solitary craftsman completes his work, reflects on its necessity—could transpose to many similar premises with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and his role as locksmith informs his methodology ("His mind worked like the locks he designed"). However, his choices are primarily technical rather than moral or relational. The key decisions—to repair the timer, to activate it, to store the crystal—are pre-determined by his stated goal and face no complications. He makes no choice that narrows options or forecloses a path with visible cost. Present in closure (removing the crystal) but not causally reweighted there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timer mechanism is introduced early (paragraph one: "broken timer mechanism"), drives the middle action (repair work across multiple beats), and appears in the closure (Elian removes the storage crystal from it). It shapes tactics: Elian must "reverse-engineer its logic," work with "resonant crystals," calibrate it "to the specific topography." The test activation and successful harvest depend on it. However, it doesn't acquire new meaning at the end; it functions consistently as a tool throughout. Strong integration across beats but not irreplaceable—another resonant device could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The harvest of echoes is the story's premise, shaping both the dominant stake (preserving wonder) and Elian's tactics (timing the angles, calibrating frequencies). The concept drives the test scene: "the timer mechanism had captured not merely the echoes but the essence of wonder itself." Present in closure (the storage crystal "glowed with captured aurora"). However, the mechanics remain abstract; we see the result (festival sounds, laughter) but not the on-page process of capture constraining a choice. The concept frames everything but doesn't narrow options or impose visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" is introduced early and explicitly tied to Elian's method: "His peripherally focused attention caught what most would miss," "His peripheral vision detected patterns that direct observation obscured." It's invoked again mid-story ("peripherally focused state allowed him to become a receptor") and at closure ("his peripheral vision catching the flicker"). However, it functions as a label for his observational style rather than constraining an on-page choice with cost. We don't see a moment where peripheral focus enables something direct observation would miss in a way that alters tactics or outcomes. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering is stated as Elian's task in paragraph two ("Elian needed to reverse-engineer its logic") and implied in the repair work ("understand the codex of how echoes were captured"). The weeks of study and component fitting presumably enact this. However, the action itself is summarized rather than dramatized; we don't see specific deduction or trial-and-error that would distinguish reverse-engineering from generic "repair." The successful test suggests the work succeeded, but the process is compressed into exposition. Functional but swappable with "repair" or "restore" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Studying reflection angles is signaled in paragraph two ("studying reflection angles at different times of day") and detailed in the mapping work: "angle of weak light...changed hourly, creating shifting matrices," "certain angles in the north passage...at noon," "the western wall...at dusk." Elian's calculation of "the precise angle when the strongest echoes would be available" directly enables the successful harvest at closure. The method shapes his approach and the timing of the test. However, the angles themselves don't impose a tradeoff or narrow options; they inform rather than constrain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The marble cavern is established in the opening lines and remains the setting throughout. Its physical properties—polished walls, crystal formations, reflection angles, north passage, western wall—directly inform Elian's work and the timer's calibration. The cavern's topography shapes tactics: "calibrated the timer mechanism to the specific topography of the cavern." Present in the closure scene (Elian leaves the cavern, watches light fade). However, the cavern doesn't pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome in the final beat; it remains a well-mapped stage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"The lull of a wounded season" is mentioned early and invoked again: "the broken timer had failed during the great silence, that moment when the season had first been wounded," "the wounded season reached its deepest quiet," "The wounded season would eventually heal." The timeframe creates atmospheric urgency (preserving echoes before they're lost) and the test occurs "as the wounded season reached its deepest quiet." However, the time pressure remains abstract; no ticking clock forces Elian to choose between options or accept a cost. The "weeks" of work pass in summary without imposing tactical constraints.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is stated explicitly in paragraph four: "to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later use." It's contextualized with cultural stakes ("the world growing barren of imagination, practicality winning against poetry") and appears in the closure reflection ("wonder preserved against the coming winter of the spirit"). The desire drives the entire arc—repair, test, storage. However, it's told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. Elian never weighs this goal against a competing want or cost; the motivation is univocal and unchallenged. Present across beats but not tested under friction.</comment>
