<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The portrait artist's interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("tapestry of what-ifs," "luminescent ache") rather than embodied contradiction or character-particular perception. The transformation from "crestfallen" to "something new, something remade" is asserted through repetitive declarations rather than earned through micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. Emotional progression reads as a smooth upward arc without the irrationality, hypocrisy, or self-deception that would ground the change. The final choice to paint "fractured truths" arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph, satisfying the test. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the mending of the box and cards serving as the central action, but the closure effect—picking up the brush to paint again—lacks a visible or felt cost that would constitute Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change. The artist's resolve "hardened" and he becomes "something remade," yet no prior option is foreclosed and no trade-off dramatized; the ending reads as declaration rather than reweighting of prior material with pressure. Under the Accumulative lens, a single decisive intensification or cadence shift is required, but the final paragraph simply extends the affirming rhetoric without a turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the lighthouse provides vivid atmospheric anchoring ("shelves of waterlogged books sagging," "Filterless light," "salt and time"). The tarot box and cards function as micro-setting objects that the artist handles across multiple beats, constraining his physical and symbolic reconstruction. However, the environment does not meaningfully alter tactics or impose a spatial constraint on the final choice; the library "opened, into a world he had made anew" without resistance. The setting charges mood but does not shape the closure decision with material consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rebuilding after fracture—is signaled early. The mending of the box provides a single on-page action sequence, but it unfolds without meaningful resistance, trade-off, or cost; each piece aligns "like the bones of a forgotten thing" with no failed attempt or alternate path considered. The artist's transformation lacks a visible price: no former method abandoned, no relationship or prior self-image forfeited. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation should read as density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake, yet the final third repeats the affirming rhetoric without a tightening or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—fracture as portal to renewal—emerges through recurring imagery (broken box, fragmented cards, lighthouse beam). The rhetorical questions ("Why do we cling to what no longer serves us?") risk overt thematic statement, but they remain tied to the artist's interiority. The closure image of painting "fractured truths of those who had survived" offers a non-literal answer, yet it arrives as assertion rather than resonant reconfiguration of prior particulars. The final paragraph's moralizing drift ("The library had not failed him; it had taught him to redesign his world, one thread at a time") undercuts earned resonance with direct thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature leans heavily on abstract metaphor and elevated diction ("luminescent ache," "tapestry of what-ifs") that reads more authorial than character-particular, though it remains internally consistent. Psychic distance shifts intentionally to zoom into the card-handling beats and pull back for thematic reflection. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, slowing for the mending sequence and accelerating slightly at the close, but the consistent register and syntactic patterns flatten the texture across high and low moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "luminescent ache," "tapestry of what-ifs," "fractured reality," "necessary darkness" cluster without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear throughout—"The artist was no longer crestfallen; he was something new, something remade" and "The forgotten library had not failed him; it had taught him to redesign his world, one thread at a time" restate rather than advance. Template cadence runs dominate: "The library was… The lighthouse stood… The artist began… The artist smiled… The tarot box hummed…" across consecutive sentences. Mixed metaphors ("walls close in" then "walls receded" then "walls no longer closed in—they opened") and stock phrasing ("where the light gets in") reduce clarity. Artifacts touch the closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—artist mending a symbolic object to mend himself—follows a familiar template of metaphorical reconstruction without a non-obvious angle. The tarot box, lighthouse, and "fractured reality" motif read as checklist deployment rather than organic synthesis. Emotional arc and thematic resolution could transfer unchanged to another broken object and setting with minor edits, failing the transformation test. The piece hedges toward safety with its affirming conclusion and avoids bold risk or a trade-off that would sharpen the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The crestfallen portrait artist is present throughout and makes the decision to mend the box and resume painting. The character's choices drive the mending sequence (middle beat) and the final turn to paint again (closure beat), satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, the decisions lack visible cost or a foreclosed alternative; he moves from despair to resolve without friction. Swappability is moderate—another artisan or craftsperson could occupy the role with minor edits. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (weak) +0.3, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.3; late penalty none; ornamental none; swappability −0.5; summary-only −0.3. Base ~6.9, adjustments yield 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken tarot card box appears in the opening line (setup), is mended across the middle third (development), and sits whole before the artist at closure (payoff), satisfying all three gates. It is handled on the page in at least two distinct beats: the initial scattering and the deliberate mending. The box's broken state and subsequent repair anchor the symbolic arc and charge the final image of ordered contents. However, the box does not constrain a tactic or impose a trade-off; its mending proceeds without setback. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4; swappability −0.4 (any symbolic container could serve); summary-only none. Base ~7.1, adjustments yield 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Fragmented reality is invoked repeatedly as a descriptor ("The fragmented reality of his life mirrored the shattered box") but does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics. It functions as thematic echo rather than a constraint that changes options or requires a specific method to navigate. The artist's task—mending the box—would proceed identically if the concept were removed. Present by first third (setup), mentioned in reflection (weak development), echoed at closure. Early signal +0.3, one beat +0.4, causal pressure (absent) 0, closure linkage (ornamental) +0.2, specificity +0.2; ornamental −0.7, swappability −0.6, label-only −0.3. Base ~3.5, adjustments yield 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Rhetorical questions appear twice in the opening third ("Why do we cling to what no longer serves us?" "Must we always lose to see what remains?" "What if the fractures are where the light gets in?") but do not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. They serve as reflective interiority without altering the artist's tactics or choices. The mending and painting decisions proceed independently of the questions. Early signal +0.4, one beat (interiority only) +0.2, causal pressure 0, closure linkage 0, specificity 0; ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.3. Base ~3.4, adjustments yield 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Redesign is named explicitly ("He needed to redesign his understanding, to rebuild") and enacted through the mending sequence. The action shapes the middle beat and contributes to the closure image of ordered contents and renewed purpose. However, it is easily swappable with "rebuild," "restore," or "reconstruct" without structural impact; the specificity of "redesign" does not matter to the mechanics. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.2; swappability −0.7. Base ~6.4, adjustments yield 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Untangling threads is introduced in the first third as the method ("by untangling threads. Each card, each shelf, each splinter of wood was a thread") and revisited at closure ("one thread at a time"). It is named and described but not dramatized as a distinct mechanic that shapes attempts or imposes cost; the artist simply "gathered the cards" and placed them back. The method does not constrain tactics or generate setbacks. Early signal +0.5, two beats (mention + reprise) +0.5, causal pressure (weak) +0.2, closure linkage +0.5, specificity +0.3; summary-only −0.5, swappability −0.5. Base ~5.0, adjustments yield 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the lighthouse is anchored in the opening and provides atmospheric detail throughout (waterlogged books, sagging shelves, lantern light). It satisfies setup, development (the artist works within it), and payoff (the library "sighed" and "opened" at closure). However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the mending could occur in any isolated space. Spatial details are vivid but do not constrain tactics. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (absent) 0, closure linkage +0.4, specificity +0.5; ornamental −0.6, swappability −0.5. Base ~5.3, adjustments yield 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" appears once in the middle third ("he felt the walls close in around him, the library shrinking as his resolve hardened") and is reversed at closure ("the walls no longer closed in—they opened"). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or track a live clock; it functions as metaphorical pressure rather than a temporal constraint. The artist's actions proceed at his own pace without urgency imposed by time. Early signal (second third) +0.2, one beat +0.4, causal pressure (absent) 0, closure linkage +0.3, specificity +0.2; late first appearance −0.3, ornamental −0.6, swappability −0.5. Base ~3.7, adjustments yield 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation to descend into necessary darkness is stated explicitly ("To descend into necessary darkness was his only choice") in the first third and echoed at closure ("He had descended into necessary darkness, and in doing so, had found his way back to the light"). It frames the artist's resolve but is not dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction between wants and costs. The mending proceeds without setback or renunciation. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (weak) +0.3, closure linkage +0.6, specificity +0.3; told-only −0.8, summary-only −0.4. Base ~5.4, adjustments yield 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Luminescent ache is named twice ("luminescent ache," "The luminescent ache remained, but it was no longer a wound—it was a guide" and "the ache in his chest now a warmth, a glow, a promise") and evoked through Filterless light and the lighthouse beam. The tone is coherent across turns and modulates from despair to resolve, charging the final image of warmth and promise. However, the tone does not impose a cost or constrain a choice; it functions as atmospheric consistency. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (absent) 0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4; ornamental −0.4, label-only −0.3. Base ~6.7, adjustments yield 5.8.</comment>
