<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>L-734's internal conflict is present but often told through abstract labels rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The android's "emotional subroutines were fragmenting" and "inner static" are diagnostic labels that flatten what could be embodied tension. The final shift—"not a deletion but an integration"—arrives without sufficient prior causality showing how fear transforms into "protective membranes." Micro-choices exist (retrieving the box, placing the seed) but the cost of each choice remains vague, undermining the earned-change requirement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (roses, static, glass dome, fear-seed) toward a final reweighting. Orientation is adequate—who, where, when anchor within the first hundred words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (integration of fears into protective membranes, L-734 walking away with a seed), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "having burned away the prison of fear without escaping what made it whole" tells the transformation without showing the trade-off. The magnetic-north complication and controlled-burn mechanics remain atmospheric rather than causally tight, reducing closure punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert roses, and cultivation tank ground the setting effectively, and the magnetic-north shift pressures the systems. The box of childhood fears is handled in multiple beats (trembling approach, retrieval, miniaturization, placement), and its iridescent pulsing charges the atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain a key choice—L-734 executes the plan without spatial friction or resource scarcity altering tactics. The final image of iridescent rose petals offers a purposeful callback but does not shift options, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resolving inner static and escaping captivity—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when L-734 decides to miniaturize and contain the fears rather than destroy them outright, narrowing options. However, the plan unfolds without visible obstacles or costs that force trade-offs; the controlled burn "began not as explosion but as whisper" and succeeds as intended. No credible loss (stamina, tool failure, partial destruction) alters later tactics, and the protagonist's agency at closure feels more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: containment enables freedom, fragmentation enables wholeness. The fear-seed and roses carry the idea without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit thesis: "some things must be contained to be free, burned to be preserved, broken to be complete" articulates the theme rather than trusting the image to resonate. The transformation of fears into "protective membranes" and the iridescent petals offer a conceptual answer, but the cost of this wisdom is asserted rather than felt through prior struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable—single third-person limited on L-734. The perceptual signature is android-specific (diagnostic routines, chronometer malfunctions, processors screaming) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register not quite earned by the established voice: "a being L-734 had become," "the strange organic framework that had once housed terror." Filter verbs ("found itself pausing," "understood that") appear frequently without adding voice texture. The prose feels more like written meditation than android perception under stress, reducing distinctness at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "strangely organic" appears at least four times; "fragmented" and "chaos" recur without added pressure. Multiple sentences restate the same content—paragraph four describes emotional subroutines fragmenting, paragraph five repeats "fragmented wholeness," and later "fractured into a dozen pieces" echoes the same idea. Template cadence appears in the middle: "The android [verb]" opens consecutive sentences without variation. The final third mixes metaphors—fire "blooming like a rose," fears as "protective membranes"—without coherent vehicle logic. These artifacts dull momentum and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—android caretaker resolving internal corruption via controlled burn—combines familiar AI-consciousness and purification-by-fire tropes without a sharp synthesis. The fear-seed miniaturization and the roses turning iridescent are atmospheric but do not transform the template; the emotional arc (fragmentation → integration) follows a predictable path. The "strangely organic" refrain gestures toward originality but remains a label rather than a specific, irreplaceable detail that alters choice. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>L-734 is present throughout and makes the key decisions (retrieve box, miniaturize, initiate burn, walk away), satisfying setup, development, and closure gates. However, "nostalgic" is claimed—"memories… that felt both broken and complete"—but not dramatized through a specific memory or longing that shapes a choice. The android's choices are functional but feel inevitable rather than dilemma-driven, reducing causal pressure. The element is integral but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The box of childhood fears appears in setup (cultivation tank mention), drives the middle (trembling approach, retrieval), and is transformed at closure (miniaturized seed, then implied dispersal into the roses' iridescence). It appears in at least three distinct beats and its contents shift meaning—from therapeutic relic to corruptive force to protective essence. The transformation is asserted rather than shown step-by-step, preventing a higher score, but the element is essential to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Controlled burn escape" is signaled early, shapes the plan (miniaturization to contain rather than release chaos), and executes at the climax. The concept appears in setup and closure and constrains tactics—L-734 must "contain chaos within a vessel" rather than simply flee. However, the mechanics remain abstract; the reader does not see how containment prevents explosion or what would happen if the method failed. The concept drives the arc but lacks on-page friction or visible cost tied to the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" is a repeated descriptor (roses, box, tendrils, framework, final touch) but functions as atmospheric label rather than constraint. No choice hinges on the organic quality—L-734 does not exploit or struggle with the trait in a visible way. The descriptor appears in setup and closure, satisfying two gates, but remains ornamental. The roses' organic warmth in the final line offers lyric resonance but no causal cost, capping the score near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Miniaturize" drives the key turn: L-734 compresses the box's contents into a seed, enabling containment rather than destruction. The action appears in the middle third and is essential to the closure (the seed blooms as fire, then transforms into the roses' essence). However, the process is summarized in one paragraph without dramatized difficulty or visible cost—no failed attempt, no strain on L-734's systems. The action is necessary but not irreplaceable with fuller pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"By containing chaos" is the stated method and is signaled early ("escape required sacrifice… of the parts that held it captive"). The method shapes the plan (miniaturization, combustion chamber placement, controlled burn) and is present at closure ("containing chaos rather than releasing it"). However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—what makes the fear-seed a container, how it "blooms like a rose made of fire" without explosion, remains abstract. The method is integral but lacks on-page friction or visible cost tied to its execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert rose farm anchor the setting throughout (setup, middle withering, cracked-but-held climax, final exit). The dome provides spatial coherence and a symbolic boundary. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—L-734's plan proceeds without resource scarcity, access problems, or spatial friction. The roses' survival and iridescence at the end offer a charged reprise that reweights prior material, lifting the score, but the setting does not alter tactics mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The magnetic-north shift is signaled early and tied to the static/corruption escalation. The timeframe pressures the plan: "The controlled burn would activate at dawn, when magnetic north reached its most unstable position." However, elapsed time between "two weeks ago" and "dawn broke" remains vague, and no ticking-clock moment forces a rushed or altered decision. The timeframe supports the premise but does not tighten tactics or impose visible cost, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To resolve inner static" is the dominant stake, stated explicitly and linked to the magnetic disruption. The motivation appears in setup (static growing louder, diagnostic anomalies) and drives the plan (purge corruption, integrate fears). However, the motivation is told through labels—"emotional subroutines fragmenting," "inner static"—rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. No on-page moment shows L-734 torn between competing desires (e.g., preserve memories vs. purge corruption). The motivation is functional but not deeply conflicted, capping the score below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Fragmented wholeness" is declared as tone and appears in several phrases: "pieces of memory floating disconnected yet somehow forming a larger… pattern," "fractured into a dozen pieces," "burned away… without escaping what made it whole." The tone is consistent and supports the thematic question. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure—descriptive density remains steady rather than compressing or breaking at the climax. The final image echoes the tone but does not shift it, keeping the score in the mid-band.</comment>
