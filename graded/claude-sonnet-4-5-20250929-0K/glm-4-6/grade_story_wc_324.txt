<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aria's "persistently curious nature" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The climactic discovery (documents in the music box) arrives via her equipment rather than through a choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Interiority leans toward label-speak ("profound gratitude," "incidental heroism") instead of embodied contradiction. The final moment summarizes her emotional state rather than showing a micro-choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via "incidental heroism" realization, but the cost remains abstract—gathering documents for authorities is stated intention, not on-page action with felt consequence. The drive lens reads Causal through the investigation sequence, though the hearing-aid mechanism strain credibility (Margaret was "deaf since birth" yet the device "contained recordings of faint pulses"). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One meaningful turn occurs when the pulses lead to the hidden compartment, though the sister revelation arrives through document exposition rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium establishes atmospheric specificity and the "boundary between worlds thinning" anchors the premise. The hearing aid and amplification system function as micro-setting tools that constrain method. However, the music box's hidden compartment materializes late without prior spatial setup, and the documents resolve the mystery through summary rather than tactile discovery. The atrium's "reeling hush" shifts to "relief" in the final beat, a purposeful tonal reconfiguration that charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—clearing the sister's name—is signaled midway rather than early, diluting pressure buildup. One meaningful tightening occurs when "strong pulses" lead to the music box, but the discovery itself unfolds through exposition (documents "revealed a truth") rather than a choice that forecloses options. No visible cost attaches to Aria's success; she will present evidence to authorities, a future intention without on-page consequence. The scratched photograph mystery deepens partway through, offering one reversal, but escalation lacks protagonist agency at the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of protecting vulnerable voices emerges through Aria's stated mission but is articulated directly in the final paragraph ("someone willing to assure others that truth would protect...") rather than through image or action. "Incidental heroism" appears as meta-commentary in the penultimate paragraph, flattening subtext. The photograph's scratched-out figure and the sister's institutionalization offer symbolic weight, yet the resolution delivers a thesis statement about "following where the evidence led" instead of a resonant non-literal answer. Quiet endings are valid, but this one explains rather than reweights.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Aria with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries deliberate gravity ("reeling hush," "mist-clad atrium") that suits the supernatural-adjacent premise, though some diction ("assure you we'll find your truth") drifts into professional register under peak pressure. Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific—"familiar pull in her chest" and "profound gratitude" read generic. Free indirect interiority is clean; no head-hopping. One line of dialogue ("I assure you we'll find your truth") functions more as thematic flag than subtext or goal-driven speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Syntax varies purposefully and maintains momentum through the investigation sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "to protect vulnerable voices" recurs three times with minimal variation, and "persistently curious" appears twice in identical phrasing. The phrase "something that compelled Aria to protect vulnerable voices that might otherwise be lost to time and silence" (paragraph 2) is later echoed nearly verbatim in the final paragraph, a −0.3 penalty for redundancy. Mixed metaphor: "incidental heroism born not of grand ambition but of following where the evidence led" conflates birth with following without coherent vehicle. Stock phrasing: "profound gratitude," "something connected to," "something urgent to communicate." Template cadence in paragraph 5: "something important—something connected to." Overall density is solid, but artifacts cluster in thematic summary beats. Total penalties: −0.6 for loops and metaphor strain.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The contact-tracer-for-hearts premise offers initial freshness, but the execution leans on familiar beats: mysterious photograph, scratched-out figure, hidden documents that reveal abuse cover-up. The hearing-aid mechanism (recording "energy pulses" for a woman "deaf since birth") strains plausibility without transforming the investigative arc into something irreplaceable—a different device or method could deliver the same plot. The final reveal (sister institutionalized, father's abuse) follows expected trauma-recovery template. "Incidental heroism" and "vulnerable voices" arrive as prompt labels rather than earned synthesis. No close proximity to famous works, but insufficient transformation of stock elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria as "contact tracer for hearts" frames the opening and anchors her occupation, satisfying setup. She makes one key choice—connecting the hearing aid to her amplification system—that triggers the middle investigation beat (development gate met). However, the climactic discovery (music box compartment, documents) happens to her via equipment output rather than through her decision. She "followed the signals," a passive construction, and her final action is stated future intention ("prepared to present them to authorities"), not on-page closure agency. Present across all three gates but causal pressure is low; the role could be swapped for "investigator" or "medium" with minor edits. Two-gate participation (setup, development) with weak payoff. Mid-functional band: 4.0–4.9.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears in paragraph 2 (setup), is handled and examined ("ran her fingers over the image"), and its scratched-out figure drives the investigation question (development). It returns at closure when documents reveal the erased person's identity, reweighting the image's meaning (payoff). Three gates met. However, the photograph itself does not constrain a choice or impose cost—it poses a mystery that the hearing aid and documents solve. The element is essential to the premise but not indispensable to closure mechanics; the documents do the revelatory work. Causal role in two beats (initial mystery, final reweighting) with closure linkage, but no visible cost tied to the object. Band: 6.0–7.0 range, settled at 6.8 for three-gate presence and closure resonance despite limited choice-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is named explicitly in paragraph 6 ("What Aria had initially viewed as routine work transformed into something greater: incidental heroism born not of..."), functioning as thematic label rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. The concept is told, not dramatized through choice. It does not constrain options or impose cost; Aria's investigation proceeds the same way regardless of whether she views it as heroism or routine. Present at closure as meta-commentary but ornamental. One-gate participation (payoff as theme statement only); no setup or development. Cap for swappability: the story's arc works unchanged if "dedication" or "commitment" replaces "heroism." Band: 3.0–4.9, settled at 3.8 for functional presence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is mentioned twice—paragraph 1 (setup: "Her persistently curious nature had gotten her dismissed") and paragraph 6 (payoff: "profound gratitude for her persistently curious nature that had led her to keep investigating"). Both instances are told labels without on-page demonstration. The trait does not constrain or enable a dramatized choice; we do not see Aria wrestle with curiosity versus caution or pay a cost for probing further. The investigation unfolds via equipment, not a curiosity-driven decision under pressure. Two-gate participation (setup, payoff) but no development beat. Swappable with "determined" or "thorough." Cap for label-only use and no visible tradeoff: 4.9. Band: functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Assure" appears once in dialogue—paragraph 5: "I assure you we'll find your truth"—and is echoed thematically in the final line: "someone willing to assure others that truth would protect..." Setup and payoff gates met. The action frames Aria's promise and ties to her mission, but it does not create a key turn or redefine options. The discovery sequence is driven by tracking pulses, not by the assurance itself. The dialogue moment is atmospheric rather than causal. Swappable with "promise" or "vow" without structural impact. Two-gate participation with thematic resonance but low causal pressure. Band: 5.0–6.9, settled at 5.7 for purposeful early–final reprise without choice constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hearing aid is introduced in paragraph 3 (setup), used in paragraph 4 when Aria "connected the hearing aid to her amplification system" (development), and in paragraph 5 "strong pulses emanated from the hearing aid" that lead to the music box (payoff). Three gates met. The device's specific properties—decades-old, worn since childhood, containing inexplicable recordings—are integral to the method and irreplaceable. It enables the middle investigation beat and triggers the climactic discovery. However, the mechanics strain plausibility (a woman "deaf since birth" whose device records "energy pulses"), and the final revelation comes from documents rather than the hearing aid itself. Causal role in two distinct beats with closure linkage. Band: 7.0–8.4, settled at 7.2 for three-gate presence, specificity, and beat involvement despite credibility friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The atrium is named in the opening line (setup) and returns in the final paragraph—"The reeling hush of the atrium at twilight suddenly felt different" (payoff). The mist and twilight establish atmospheric conditions ("perfect atmospheric conditions for her work, the boundary between worlds thinning"), but the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Aria's investigation could occur in any enclosed space with similar effect. The "reeling hush" shifts to relief, a tonal reconfiguration, but the space itself remains backdrop. Two-gate participation (setup, payoff) with purposeful reprise but no middle development beat where the environment pressures action. Swappable with "chamber" or "gallery." Band: 5.0–6.9, settled at 5.3 for lyric resonance without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"When the dead call" is introduced in paragraph 1 ("when the dead called out to the living") and paragraph 5 ("The dead called most clearly when they had something urgent"), framing the temporal premise. Twilight anchors the single scene window. However, time does not tighten decisions—no clock pressures Aria, and the investigation unfolds at her pace. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than causal. Two-gate participation (setup, mid-story echo) but no payoff gate; the ending does not hinge on the temporal boundary. Swappable with "dusk" or "evening" without altering stakes. Cap for introduced after 40% and no middle development or closure constraint: 4.6. Band: functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To protect vulnerable voices" is stated in paragraph 2 (setup) and echoed in the final paragraph (payoff). The motivation drives Aria's occupation and frames her mission, but it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. We do not see friction between this desire and a competing want or cost. The investigation proceeds without obstacle that tests her commitment to protection versus personal risk. Two-gate participation with thematic resonance but no on-page friction. Swappable with "to uncover truth" or "to honor the dead." Band: 5.0–6.9, settled at 6.1 for purposeful early–final reprise that shapes framing but lacks dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" appears in the final paragraph: "The reeling hush of the atrium at twilight suddenly felt different—less like sorrow, more like relief." The phrase is not seeded earlier, so setup gate is missed. However, the tone modulates coherently from mysterious dread (opening paragraphs) through investigative focus (middle beats) to atmospheric resolution (ending), and the final shift from sorrow to relief charges the closure image with tonal reconfiguration. One-gate participation (payoff only) but purposeful tonal arc. The late arrival (final paragraph) triggers −0.6 penalty per the guidance. Starting at 7.0 for strong closure linkage, subtract −0.6 for late introduction: 6.4. Band: 6.0–7.0 for tonal coherence and charged final image despite missing early signal.</comment>
