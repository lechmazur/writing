<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Hemlock's borrowed-memory power is asserted but never dramatizes internal contradiction or embodied struggle under pressure. The woman's story arrives via exposition rather than through micro-choices that reveal Hemlock's values. His final nightly gesture reads as sentiment without visible cost or foreclosed path. The interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart broke," "eternal language") and therapy-adjacent labels that flatten rather than embody emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes pattern early (borrowed memories, collected objects) and the Edelweiss returns at closure to reweight the stake. However, the closure unit is thin: Hemlock's nightly flower placement is a gesture without felt cost or consequence that forecloses a live option. The woman's story is summarized rather than discovered through dramatized gaps, weakening causal pressure. Orientation anchors appear promptly. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the ending reads as thematic echo rather than reconfiguration with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse are vividly rendered with purposeful atmospheric detail. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The glass case and logbook function as micro-setting elements that enable investigation. The Edelweiss constrains Hemlock's final choice to place flowers nightly, charging the closure image. Economy is strong; sensory selection reflects the reflective pace without catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode the woman's gesture) is signaled early but never tested by a complication or reversal. Hemlock's borrowed-memory power solves the mystery without friction or trade-off. The woman's story arrives complete via passive reception; no decision narrows options or forces sacrifice. The nightly flower gesture is tender but lacks visible cost—time, stamina, or social consequence are not dramatized. Escalation is absent; the arc is flat from inciting object to summary resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of witnessed isolation and love transcending death emerges organically from the Edelweiss and Hemlock's vigil. The final image (nightly flower on the dock) offers a quiet, non-literal answer to connection across distance. However, the penultimate paragraph delivers overt thematic summary ("eternal language of human hearts," "love never truly disappears") that replaces scene pressure with assertion. The ending avoids moralizing but leans on abstraction rather than letting the flower speak alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric, fitting the lighthouse keeper's reflective cast. However, register drifts into generic literary phrasing at emotional peaks ("eternal language," "borrowed consciousness," "shared isolation") that feels authored rather than focalized. Perceptual signature is present but muted by poetic abstraction. The voice is consistent but lacks character-specific idiom that would ground the elevated tone in Hemlock's particular mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph structure supports the meditative pace. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty. However, paraphrase loops appear: "borrowed memories" and variants recur across adjacent paragraphs without escalation. Template cadence is visible in the penultimate paragraph ("The softly persistent pull," "their solitude now witnessed, their gestures now understood"). Stock metaphors ("mist becoming sea," "ocean breezes that understood") appear in the closure beat, dulling specificity. Figurative density in the final third reads as overwriting without clear payoff. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems, plus −0.4 for metaphor muddle in the closure beat, totaling −1.2 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper collecting lost objects is familiar territory; the borrowed-memory twist adds a layer but does not transform the archetype. The Edelweiss and Alpine reunion quest feel archetypal without fresh inflection. Emotional specificity is present but the arc (stranger's faithfulness witnessed and honored) follows a well-worn path. The piece commits to its premise but does not take structural or perspectival risks. No close echoes of famous work, but freshness relies on lyric atmosphere rather than a surprising synthesis of character, world, and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Hemlock appears in every beat but his choices are passive: he picks up the flower, reads his logbook, receives memories, and places a flower nightly. No decision alters tactics or creates a turn. His eccentricity is asserted (collecting echoes) but not demonstrated through a choice under pressure. Present throughout but does not drive key reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Edelweiss is handled in three beats: discovery, placement in the glass case, and the nightly placement at closure. It seeds early, enables investigation via borrowed memories, and returns at the end to charge the final image. Removing it would collapse the mystery and the gesture. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement elevate the score. Swappability is low; the Alpine specificity matters.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Borrowed memories are signaled in the opening beat and recur throughout, enabling the investigation and the woman's backstory. The concept shapes the central stake (decode the gesture) and provides the means of discovery. However, it never constrains a choice or imposes cost; Hemlock receives the memories without struggle or consequence. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but functions as convenience rather than pressure. Lyric reprise (first paragraph establishes the power, final act relies on it) with thematic weight but minimal causal friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" appears twice as a descriptor (paragraph 3, paragraph 10) but never constrains or enables an action with cost. It labels the flower's pull and later the "shared connection" without altering Hemlock's tactics. Ornamental; could be omitted without structural loss. Late first substantial mention (paragraph 10) further limits integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Investigate" frames Hemlock's goal early and organizes the middle beats (observing gaps, reading the logbook, decoding the borrowed memories). The method (observing gaps) is signaled and used. However, the investigation proceeds without reversals or obstacles; the answer arrives complete. Present across setup, middle, and closure, but the action does not redefine options or force a trade-off. Essential to the arc but does not create a turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" is named in paragraph 3 as Hemlock's method and appears again in paragraph 5 (gaps in his logbook). The method is used once (he finds the entry about the woman by noticing confusion in his notes), but the mechanics are vague and the gap-observation does not constrain later choices. Present in setup and one middle beat, but does not shape closure or create pressure. Functional but replaceable with generic investigation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The opal dock appears in the opening beat, as the site of the woman's vigil (paragraph 5), and in the penultimate and final paragraphs where Hemlock leaves flowers. It anchors spatial choreography and charges the closure image. The mist contributes atmosphere and thematic resonance. Removing the dock would weaken the ending's spatial specificity. Present in setup, middle reference, and closure; the setting supplies the stage for the final gesture and the "gap where she had stood" image that closes the story.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Nautical twilight appears in the opening line and again in paragraph 10 ("the following evening"). It establishes atmosphere but does not tighten decisions or create time pressure. The investigation has no clock; Hemlock's process unfolds without urgency. Present in setup and a brief closure callback, but the timeframe does not constrain tactics. Functional for mood but replaceable with any evening marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to decode the woman's gesture is stated early (paragraph 3) and organizes the investigation arc. Hemlock's goal drives the middle beats (logbook, borrowed memories) and culminates in the nightly flower placement. However, the motivation is never conflicted; no competing want or cost complicates the pursuit. Present across setup, middle, and closure, shaping all major moves, but lacks friction or dramatized trade-off. Essential to the arc but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Witnessed isolation is coherent throughout: Hemlock's solitary vigil, the woman's solo journey, and the closing image of shared solitude. The tone modulates subtly (meditative opening, elegiac middle, tender closure) without breaking register. The final paragraph explicitly names "isolation...witnessed" and "shared isolation," charging the closure image. Removing this tonal thread would flatten the thematic resonance. Present in setup, developed through the woman's story, and crystallized at closure with felt weight.</comment>
