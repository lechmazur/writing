<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Margaret's interiority is labeled rather than embodied—"bewildered," "disquiet," "compelled"—without contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her decision to document visits and later prepare a note for her successor occurs off-camera, removing agency from view. The final acceptance ("strange joy") reads as unearned epiphany, a tidy emotional resolution that skips the cost of renunciation. No micro-choices under pressure constrain or reveal her hierarchy of values on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The piece opens with acceptable orientation (Margaret, desk, morning) but immediately drifts into nonlinear abstraction ("would inherit it next Tuesday, or perhaps had inherited it last year") that becomes a structural tic rather than a taught pattern. The astral orchard visits occur without causal linkage—she "stood" there, "found herself back"—erasing agency and because/therefore progression. The ending offers thematic summary ("nonlinear inheritance wasn't a curse or gift but simply complicated existence itself") rather than a decisive on-page change with felt cost. No meaningful tightening forecloses an option; the closure is conceptual assertion, not a legible reconfiguration anchored in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo and astral orchard are vividly imagined—"crystalline fruits," "inner curvature"—but the orchard never constrains a choice or alters Margaret's tactics on the page. The museum's restricted wing and staff restroom anchor locale briefly, yet spatial choreography dissolves during the orchard sequences (no clear entry/exit mechanics). The cameo charges the final image by reappearing on the desk, lifting the score into mid-band despite the lack of environmental pressure on decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the cameo and orchard—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful trade-off or tightening that narrows options. Margaret's visits accumulate without escalation; each revelation ("the orchard existed between the first and last page") is told rather than earned through a choice under pressure. The decision to find a successor and leave the cameo occurs off-stage, removing agency from the closure beat. No live price on the page forecloses a path or alters her state with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of nonlinear inheritance and consciousness across timelines emerges through repeated assertion—"repository of experiences," "accumulated knowledge of an infinite number of their alternate selves"—rather than from concrete action and image. The bathroom breakthroughs are told as epiphanies without dramatic embodiment; the final note ("don't try to make sense, simply inherit") borders on moralizing summary. The astral orchard offers a striking central image, but its resonance is claimed rather than earned through specific choices that reweight prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the prose carries a consistent register of curatorial formality blended with surreal imagery. However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic—"bewildered curator," "strange joy"—without idiosyncratic noticing or bias. Key beats rely on filter verbs ("realized," "wondered," "came to accept") that dull immediacy. The phrase "simply complicated" recurs as a motif but becomes a verbal tic rather than a voice-specific perceptual mode. Distance control is adequate but lacks the rhythmic modulation under pressure required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The prose suffers from template cadence and paraphrase loops throughout. "Simply complicated" appears six times across the text, shifting from descriptor to empty intensifier. Runs of "The [noun] [verb]" and "Margaret [verb]" stems flatten rhythm. The final paragraph restates the entire premise in summary mode: "nonlinear inheritance wasn't a curse or a gift but simply complicated existence itself—full of beauty, terror, and lonely asteroids blossoming with impossible fruit" recycles prior content without advancing it. Mixed metaphors ("brightened disquiet," "disquiet...brightened") and stock constructions ("Between the first and last page") appear in peak beats, dulling the closure image. Apply −1.2 cumulative for loops, template cadence, and stock phrasing touching the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The premise—curators inheriting nonlinear experiences via a magical artifact—offers a fresh synthesis of time-loop and museum-keeper tropes. The astral orchard on a lonely asteroid and the pistachio shell cameo are specific, memorable images. However, the execution leans on familiar beats: epiphanies in bathrooms, cryptic predecessor notes, and the responsibility-across-lifetimes frame common in "chosen curator" templates. The ending recycles the opening note without transforming it through a non-obvious choice. Risk-taking in structure (nonlinear visits, rewriting notes) does not fully cohere with closure, preventing higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Margaret is present throughout and her role as curator frames the premise, but her choices—taking the cameo to the restricted wing, documenting visits, preparing the note—occur off-camera or as summary. The orchard visits happen to her ("she stood," "found herself back") without agency. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is weak (she walks away with "strange joy," but the decision to leave the cameo is told, not dramatized). Swappable with "bewildered librarian" or similar without structural change. Cap at 4.6 for passive involvement; apply −0.8 for ornamental presence in closure and −0.6 for summary-only key beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo blank appears in the opening beat (Margaret stares at it on her desk), enables the orchard visits when she holds it (middle beat), and returns in the final image when she places it on the desk for her successor. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the cameo's mechanics are vague—it "warmed against her palm" and transports her without clear rules—and its role in the ending is passive (she leaves it, but it does not constrain her choice or reweight her stance). Three distinct beats and closure reprise lift the score to low 6s, but lack of causal pressure and specificity prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance is introduced immediately ("inherited it from her predecessor, or rather, she would inherit it next Tuesday") and recurs as theme throughout—bathroom breakthroughs reveal "consciousness...receiving knowledge meant for other versions of herself in other timelines," and the ending asserts "nonlinear inheritance wasn't a curse or a gift." Setup and thematic development gates are met. However, the concept is told and reiterated rather than dramatized through a choice that alters tactics under pressure. The final note ("simply inherit") gestures toward closure participation but offers no visible cost or option foreclosed by the nonlinearity. Apply −0.5 for ornamental thematic use and −0.4 for summary-only presence in key beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" appears six times as a descriptor—"simply complicated...somehow containing everything," "the simply complicated nature of her inheritance," "the pistachio shell cameo blank was simply complicated because it was a key"—but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It functions as a label and motif without causal force. Setup gate is met (first paragraph); development and payoff gates are absent. Apply −0.6 for ornamental use and −0.3 for label-only trait across all appearances.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Inquire" appears in the opening ("Margaret needed to inquire about its origins") and recurs when "she tried to inquire about the orchard's purpose" (her handwriting changes in response). Setup and one development beat are present. However, the action does not drive a major turn or redefine options—her inquiry is answered passively by rewriting notes rather than through a choice under pressure. The ending does not hinge on inquiry; she simply leaves the cameo. Two-beat involvement and thematic presence lift the score to mid-5s, but lack of closure linkage and causal pressure cap it below 6.0. Apply −0.4 for swappability (could be "investigate" or "research") and −0.3 for summary-only use in the middle beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms are mentioned three times: "philosophical breakthrough in the bathroom" (once), "having more frequent philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms" (ongoing summary), and "philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms" (final paragraph). Setup gate is met by the second mention (~25% mark); the final paragraph reprise provides closure participation. However, the method is never dramatized—we see no on-page bathroom scene where a breakthrough shapes her tactics or costs her something. Development gate is missing (no middle choice constrained by this method). Apply −0.5 for ornamental use, −0.4 for summary-only across all mentions, and cap at 4.6 for missing development gate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The astral orchard blossoming on a lonely asteroid is introduced in the first third when Margaret "stood in an astral orchard," recurs in the middle ("back among the blossoming trees"), and appears in the final image ("The astral orchard would continue growing between the first and last page"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The orchard contains "crystalline fruits...each piece of fruit contained a stolen moment," providing vivid specificity. However, the setting does not constrain Margaret's choices or alter her tactics—she observes and reflects but does not navigate obstacles or trade resources tied to the orchard's structure. Three beats and closure reprise lift the score to mid-5s; lack of causal pressure prevents higher bands. Apply −0.3 for ornamental closure participation (it appears but does not reweight options).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Between the first and last page" appears in the predecessor's note (opening), in Margaret's breakthrough ("the astral orchard existed between the first and last page"), and in her own note to her successor (ending). Setup and closure gates are met. However, the timeframe is metaphorical rather than a live constraint—it does not tighten decisions, track elapsed time, or pressure tactics on the page. Development gate is absent (the phrase recurs as theme but does not shape a middle choice). Apply −0.8 for metaphor-only use without causal pressure and cap at 4.6 for missing development gate; further reduce for label-only presence across all appearances (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is signaled early ("Determined to pursue the forbidden knowledge it clearly represented") and recurs throughout—Margaret takes the cameo to the restricted wing, documents visits, and reflects on "forbidden knowledge they shouldn't possess." Setup and development gates are met. The ending references "curious soul willing to inquire beyond the boundaries of what should be known," providing closure participation. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through choices with visible friction or cost—Margaret's pursuit unfolds without trade-offs or obstacles that test her desire against competing needs. Three-beat involvement and closure presence lift the score to low 5s; lack of on-page conflict between want and cost prevents higher bands. Apply −0.4 for summary-only dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Brightened disquiet" appears twice: "The disquiet of her situation brightened as she realized..." and "She came to accept the brightened disquiet as her natural state." The oxymoron is striking but functions as a descriptor rather than a tonal throughline that modulates with pressure. Setup gate is met (first third); the second mention (~60% mark) provides development. The ending does not reprise the phrase or modulate it under closure pressure—the final paragraph shifts to "strange joy" and thematic summary, abandoning the established tone. Payoff gate is missing. Two-beat presence lifts the score to mid-4s; lack of closure linkage and static application (no modulation across turns) cap it below 5.0. Apply −0.3 for label-only use and cap at 4.6 for missing payoff gate.</comment>
