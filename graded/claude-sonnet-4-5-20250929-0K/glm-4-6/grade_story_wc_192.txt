<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("teach suffocating things how to breathe") is stated rather than dramatized through choices under pressure. Her past bridge-burning is told in summary without showing the contradictory impulses that would make the final reconnection feel earned. The "miscalculated" realization arrives via exposition rather than through failed tactics on the page. Interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("phantom pains," "necrotic tissue") instead of character-specific embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—the reader does not have clear spatial or temporal grounding until well past 120 words; "three years ago" and "ashen charcoal sanctuary" arrive late and without concrete anchors. The closure moment (raising the ring to "bridge the gap") reads as Charged Poise, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("risk being unable to breathe yourself") rather than felt through prior failed attempts. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final tightening does not emerge from density increase or cadence shift but from a declarative epiphany. Causality is present but thin: the encroaching presence is drawn by her methods, yet we never see her use those methods on the page in a way that demonstrates their mechanics or consequences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary under starlight provides vivid visual texture, but the space does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—"outside" and "through the charcoal-black archway" lack concrete distances or obstacles. The doorknocker ring is handled twice, but its weight and serpent shape do not change her approach or enable a specific action. Sensory detail leans heavily on the visual ("constellations that burned cold," "smoke in wind") without touch, sound, or smell to ground the crisis moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's sanctuary collapsing under the encroaching presence—is signaled early, but escalation occurs off-page: "the fading threshold weakened day by day" and "the barrier…was thinning" are summary without visible steps. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; the encroaching presence arrives as a given, not as a consequence of her dramatized actions. The final decision to reconnect is described rather than shown through hesitation, failed alternatives, or visible trade-offs. Agency reads as conceptual rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of isolation versus communion and the cost of healing others emerges from the premise, but the final insight ("sometimes to teach something how to breathe, you must first risk being unable to breathe yourself") is stated rather than imaged. The doorknocker ring (serpent swallowing its tail) is symbolic but not integrated into the pressure—its ouroboros meaning is ornamental. The story invites reflection, yet the epiphany arrives via exposition in the closing lines rather than through a non-literal final action or image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, and the perceptual signature is consistent—Elara's way of noticing leans toward metaphor and abstraction ("memory like breath holds air," "intimacy was sometimes a form of consumption"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-specific ("necrotic tissue," "loaded emptiness she had cultivated like a rare orchid"). No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she had learned") appear frequently but are voice-motivated. Psychic distance remains steady, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in the opening and middle carries figurative language ("memory like breath holds air," "stained glass and scripture," "necrotic tissue," "smoke in wind"), creating density without corresponding pressure increase. Paraphrase loops appear: "teach suffocating things how to breathe" is restated in the final paragraph as "to teach something how to breathe, you must first risk being unable to breathe yourself." Template cadence runs through the backstory section ("She burned bridges carefully," "Each connection severed," "phantom pains still visited"). Mixed metaphor: "loaded emptiness…cultivated like a rare orchid" conflates weight, absence, and horticultural care without coherent vehicle. The closure beat is dulled by abstract exposition rather than concrete action or image. These artifacts touch the closure, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—a healer isolated in a ruined sanctuary whose empathic gift attracts malevolent forces—follows a recognizable template without transformative specificity. The "linking through scars" method is named but never demonstrated on the page, leaving it conceptual. The final turn (reconnecting after isolation) is foreshadowed but not earned through failed alternatives or visible cost. Emotional beats (phantom pains, miscalculation, the nature of intimacy) lean on familiar therapeutic language. The story's vision is coherent but does not offer a non-obvious synthesis or a fresh angle that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the final choice to reconnect, but her prior decisions (burning bridges, choosing the sanctuary) are recounted in summary. The on-page decision to raise the doorknocker ring is described rather than dramatized through hesitation or trade-offs. Setup is present (she is introduced as the shadow keeper by the end of the first paragraph); development is weak (no middle choice that constrains her); payoff is conceptual (raising the ring) without visible cost on the page. Functional but replaceable—another isolated healer archetype could perform the same arc with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring is handled in at least three beats: tracing its outline, clutching it as the threshold fades, and raising it to make contact. It is seeded early (end of first paragraph) and returns at closure. However, its specific properties (serpent swallowing its tail, its weight) do not constrain her choices or enable a tactic—she could raise any object to "knock on the door between worlds." The ring anchors her to reality but does not alter her approach. Causal role in two beats plus closure presence, but swappability lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The fading threshold shapes the story's central pressure: it is the reason Elara must act. The concept is seeded early ("the barrier…was thinning") and reappears at closure ("the threshold continued to fade"). However, the threshold's mechanics are vague—we do not see what it blocks or how her methods weaken it—so the concept remains thematic rather than tactical. Lyric reprise with a clear reweighting at closure, but lack of middle development (no choice that tests the threshold's limits) caps the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Burns bridges carefully" is stated in summary ("not with fire and fury but with the quiet precision of a surgeon removing necrotic tissue") but never demonstrated on the page. No on-page action shows her severing a connection with visible cost or method. The trait primes the final reconnection thematically but does not constrain a middle choice. Present in setup (second paragraph), absent in development and payoff as an enacted behavior. Functional but told-only; swappable with any isolation backstory.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Encroach" drives the story's pressure: "the encroaching darkness had begun to take form," "the encroaching presence pressed against the fading threshold," and it is present in the final beat ("the encroaching darkness"). The action is seeded early and recurs across at least three beats. However, the encroachment is passive—it happens to Elara rather than being triggered by her specific choices on the page—so it does not demonstrate irreplaceability. Causal role in escalation and closure presence, but lack of protagonist agency in causing it lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is named in the middle section ("Her method had always been linking through scars") and referenced at closure ("to link through the scars she had tried to heal alone"), but the mechanics are never demonstrated. We do not see her attempt the method, fail, or succeed in a way that alters tactics. The method is told rather than shown, making it ornamental. Setup is absent (not mentioned until past the 40% mark); development is summary-only; payoff is label-only. Cap at 4.6 for late introduction; subtract −0.3 for label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" is seeded in the opening paragraph and provides consistent visual texture. The setting is mentioned in the final beat ("the ash-gray sanctuary"). However, the space does not constrain Elara's choices—she moves through it without obstacles, and the environment does not supply resources or limit her tactics. Lyric reprise with early seed and final return, but no middle development where the sanctuary's properties affect a choice. Mid-5s for descriptive coherence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After cutting off all contact" establishes the timeframe early (second paragraph: "three years ago"). However, the time elapsed does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no live clock forces Elara to act now rather than later. The encroachment is described as gradual ("day by day"), but we do not see incremental worsening that alters her tactics. Setup is present; development and payoff do not leverage the timeframe to pressure choices. Functional but replaceable with any isolation backstory duration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach suffocating things how to breathe" is stated twice (middle and final paragraphs) and frames the thematic question, but it is never dramatized through conflicting choices. We do not see Elara attempt to heal something and fail, or choose between her safety and the act of teaching breath. The motivation is told rather than enacted. Setup is present (middle section); development is absent (no choice that tests the desire); payoff is label-only in the final epiphany. Functional but summary-only; subtract −0.4 for lack of on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" is named explicitly ("the loaded emptiness that had defined her existence") and evoked through imagery ("ashen," "hollowed remnant," "skeletal framework"). The tone is coherent and modulates with the encroaching presence, darkening toward the ending. However, "loaded emptiness" is also stated rather than maintained purely through image and cadence. The tone charges the final image ("the loaded emptiness…was about to be filled") but does so via direct assertion rather than tonal shift alone. Coherent modulation with closure linkage, but the explicit naming reduces subtlety.</comment>
