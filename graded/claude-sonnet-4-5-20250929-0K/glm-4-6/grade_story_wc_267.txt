<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bellhop's motivation to "understand the cost of safety" is signaled early but remains abstract; his discovery of the ledger triggers recognition rather than earned internal contradiction. Interior life relies on stock formulations: "heart raced," "mind racing," "cold, quiet fire." The final stance—"he would remain"—reads as acceptance but lacks visible cost that forecloses a prior path; we see resolve stated, not a choice that sacrifices something legible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (bellhop, cobalt fortress, assigned months ago). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: dust imagery, silence motif, the ledger as pattern-break. Closure attempts Charged Poise ("his silence now a weapon"), but cost remains asserted rather than dramatically foreclosed—no on-page renunciation of escape or prior hope that we saw him hold. The bolt-as-key mechanism and ledger discovery provide one meaningful deepening, satisfying minimal escalation for this length, but the final image ("cold, quiet fire," "cobalt walls seemed lighter") leans on metaphor rather than a concrete image that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, snow, and spiral staircase are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (faint thrum of machines, crunch of snow, air thin enough to taste). The piano bench bolt constrains the middle beat—its discovery and use as key—meeting the micro-setting/object gate for 9+ eligibility. However, the setting does not pressure the final choice; the bellhop's resolve to remain is internal, unaffected by environmental constraint at closure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bellhop finds the ledger and realizes "the fortress's safety came at the cost of its people." However, the escalation is cognitive (a fact learned) rather than a choice under pressure that narrows options or forces a visible trade-off. The final decision to remain carries stated resolve but no on-page cost that alters tactics or forecloses a live alternative we saw him consider.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—erasure vs. silence as resistance—emerges from the ledger discovery and the piano's symbolic lock. The piece avoids overt moralizing until the final paragraph, where "his silence now a weapon" and "frostbitten hope wasn't gone; it was waiting" edge toward thematic summary rather than image-driven resonance. The bolt and piano offer purposeful recurrence, but the ending reconfigures meaning through assertion ("seemed lighter now, as if reflecting a dawn he couldn't yet see") rather than a concrete, non-literal image that reweights prior material without commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a silenced bellhop's interior: "seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope," "unpardonable silence" feel authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual specificity is present (sharpened hearing, dust-covered steps) but lacks consistent idiom. The prose in peak moments (ledger discovery, final resolve) relies on abstract intensifiers ("cold, quiet fire," "shroud") that dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs harm momentum: "The bellhop's motivation was simple: to understand…" / "The bellhop's hands trembled as he realized…" / "The bellhop descended, his steps measured, his resolve hardened." Figurative density in the final third ("shroud," "cold, quiet fire," "frostbitten hope," "dawn he couldn't yet see") obscures rather than sharpens the closure image. Stock metaphors ("heart raced," "mind racing") and filter-verb stacks ("felt the fortress's frostbitten hope settle," "seemed lighter now") dull immediacy at peak beats, triggering baseline artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—silent worker discovers ledger of vanished staff in a control-obsessed installation—closely follows dystopian-workplace templates without fresh transformation. The piano-as-locked-container and bolt-as-key offer functional mystery mechanics but no distinct synthesis. Emotional truth is present but expressed through generic intensifiers rather than specific, character-particular perception. The "silent choir" constraint and nerve regeneration world-rule remain unexplored; they function as atmospheric labels rather than mechanics that shape choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; his investigation drives the sequence. However, key turns are observational (finding the bolt, reading the ledger) rather than decisions that alter tactics or foreclose options. The final choice to "remain" is stated but not enacted with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Appears in two beats: discovered on step three, used to unlock the piano. Its threads matching the lock's mechanism provides specificity, and it returns in his pocket as a "promise." However, swappable with any small key; its properties beyond "unlocking" do not constrain later action or charge the closure image causally.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The concept frames the dominant stake and recurs across beats (piano's silence, the choir condition, the ledger as erasure). It shapes the middle discovery but does not constrain a final choice on the page—his resolve to "remain" is internal, not forced by the silence itself. Present in closure image ("silence now a weapon") but as thematic echo rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Seraphically mundane" appears once as descriptor for his steps. It does not enable or constrain any action, carries no visible tradeoff, and reads as ornamental elevated diction rather than a trait that alters behavior under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>His decision to "remain" anchors the ending and recurs ("He would remain" appears twice in the final paragraph). However, the action is stated rather than enacted with visible cost or a scene choice that forecloses an alternative we saw him consider, making it swappable with "endure" or "wait" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The discoloration on the third step is signaled early, leads to the bolt discovery, and drives the middle investigation. The means—observing dust and finding the bolt—shapes two beats and enables the ledger reveal. However, "slightest discoloration" could be replaced with any small clue without altering story logic; specificity of dust does not charge the closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress and snow are present throughout, supply vivid sensory detail (cold, thin air, crunch of snow), and frame the mood. The west wing's colder air affects perception. However, the setting does not pressure the final choice to remain—his decision is internal, unaffected by environmental constraint at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Nerve regeneration is mentioned in exposition (the prior bellhop vanished during it; it will come for the protagonist too) but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. No live clock; the phrase functions as background threat rather than a timeframe that alters moves within this scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "understand the cost of safety" is declared early and drives his investigation of the piano's silence and the ledger discovery. However, the want is told rather than dramatized through friction between competing desires; no visible cost trades off against this goal within the scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Tone is coherent: cold imagery, quiet dread, muted resolve. "Frostbitten hope" recurs as a phrase and the final image gestures toward dawn. However, the tone remains static—a single sustained mood without modulation under pressure. The closure image asserts hope ("seemed lighter," "dawn he couldn't yet see") rather than earning tonal shift through concrete action.</comment>
