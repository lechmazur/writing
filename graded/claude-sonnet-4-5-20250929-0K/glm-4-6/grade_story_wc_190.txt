<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated ("to teach silence how to comfort") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. Her actions follow a purely procedural sequence—adjust reins, pull vial, kneel, place vial, watch—without internal friction or visible cost. The resolution is asserted ("Elara knew the terrace had understood") rather than earned through on-page struggle. Interiority relies on abstract concepts ("the space between sounds") and summary statements rather than embodied, character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation (who/where) arrives by ~80 words, satisfying the test. However, the closure unit is a told assertion ("she had succeeded," "The quiet remained, now a comfort") without visible cost or change in options on the page. The piece lacks causal linkage: Elara's actions (placing the vial, monitoring) produce the result through summary declaration rather than dramatized consequence. The final third repeats the same resolution in near-synonym loops ("work was done," "purpose served," "silence was kind") without deepening or tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vividly described with strong sensory anchors (crystalline structures, refracted light, humming rails). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara's path is frictionless. The storm glass vial and prisms are repeatedly described but do not pressure decisions. Micro-setting potential exists but is not leveraged to charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to teach silence how to comfort") is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No reversal, tightening, or meaningful complication occurs; Elara executes a procedure and succeeds without friction. The train whistle's echo is mentioned but never creates a live problem that forces a trade-off. Agency is procedural observation rather than decision under pressure, and the resolution arrives through summary assertion with no visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of silence as comfort is stated overtly ("to teach silence how to comfort," "silence had learned its lesson") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The storm glass vial and prisms recur but function as decorative motifs without constraining choice or charging the closure. The final paragraph moralizes ("The quiet remained, now a comfort, now a friend") in place of resonant image. Prompt language ("fluidly logical") appears three times as authorial echo rather than dramatized subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on sound and silence. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("fractals," "catalyze," "fluidly logical" used three times as inserted idiom) that does not read as Elara's lived lexicon. The phrase "fluidly logical" appears identically in narration, description of the vial's response, and Elara's thoughts, creating voice convergence. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Psychic distance remains consistent but the narrator's vocabulary feels templated rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn dominate the final third: "work was done" / "purpose fulfilled" / "purpose served"; "quiet lingered" / "quiet remained" / "silence was kind"; "vial was clear" / "vial was still" repeated four times across seven paragraphs. Template cadence runs: "The terrace would remember. / The vial was still. / The silence was kind. / And Elara was content." Stock metaphor ("like a lullaby") and the phrase "fluidly logical" recurs three times without variation. Clarity remains intact but momentum flatlines under the weight of repetition. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the lower-band penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise (floating terraces, sound-monitoring via storm glass) offers surface novelty but the emotional arc is generic: a caretaker performs a ritual and succeeds without complication. The transformation test fails—swap "gondola operator" for "lighthouse keeper" and "prism terrace" for "coast" and the plot/arc remain unchanged. Prompt elements ("fluidly logical," "catalyze," "monitoring noise levels") appear as inserted keywords rather than organic narrative texture. No fresh inflection or risk-taking; the piece executes a static, decorative procedure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her choices are procedural (adjust reins, pull vial, kneel, place vial) without meaningful alternatives or cost. She observes and monitors rather than deciding under pressure. No key turn traces to her agency—the terrace's "understanding" is asserted, not earned through her action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The storm glass vial appears in three beats (pulled from pocket, placed at prism base, pocketed at end) and its state changes (cloudy → still → clear). However, it functions as a passive indicator rather than constraining choice or enabling tactics. The vial's "response" is described but does not alter Elara's options or the outcome. Present in the ending but cameo rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"In transit" is reflected thematically (terraces drifting, gondola moving) but never shapes stakes or tactics on the page. The transit is backdrop rather than constraint. Elara's work happens in a static location; the drifting does not complicate or enable her actions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Fluidly logical" appears three times as an inserted label (vial's response, terrace's movement, Elara's thoughts) but never constrains or enables an action with cost. It reads as decorative keyword rather than trait with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Catalyze" is mentioned once in narration ("The action was meant to catalyze something") but the narrative never dramatizes what shifts or how. The vial placement is procedural; the same outcome (terrace "understanding") could follow from observation alone. The action is swappable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Monitoring noise levels" is stated and Elara watches the vial, but the mechanics are opaque and the method does not shape her attempts. The vial responds passively; Elara's monitoring consists of waiting. The method appears but does not constrain tactics or alter the path to resolution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vividly described and frames all action. It supplies the storm glass vial and the prisms, and the setting's "slow journey" bookends the piece. However, it does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome—Elara's work proceeds without environmental friction. Present in closure (prisms at rest) but as backdrop rather than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" is mentioned twice but never tightens decisions or tactics. The train's echo is long gone; no live clock shapes Elara's moves. Time is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach silence how to comfort" is stated clearly and repeated, but it is never dramatized through conflicted choices or visible cost. Elara's desire faces no friction or competing want. The "lesson" is asserted ("silence had learned") rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Tone is consistent (elevated, reverent, quiet) and modulates slightly with the prisms' hum and Elara's satisfaction. Phrases like "vaulting hush" do not appear, but the intended register (awe, stillness) holds. However, the tone remains static through the resolution rather than charging the final image with new pressure. Coherent but does not elevate closure.</comment>
