<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is told ("nurture lifelong wonder") rather than dramatized through contradictory wants under pressure. Leo's breakthrough feels schematic—his three-month silence dissolves too smoothly without embodied resistance or messy ambivalence. The locket curl functions as a symbolic token rather than a choice-constraining object; Maya touches it reflectively but never wrestles with competing impulses. Interior life relies on therapeutic abstractions ("cautious exuberance," "ordinary magic") instead of specific, character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (Maya, Sage Ridge, eclipse session). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the eclipse provides atmospheric intensification and the shared curl moment offers a lyric reprise, but no meaningful tightening of options occurs—Leo's opening is presented as inevitable transformation rather than earned through prior resistance. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Leo speaks, shares the curl), yet the cost remains abstract; we are told he "finally" connects, but no on-page foreclosed path or visible trade-off charges the final image. The "weeks later" summary further dilutes present-tense closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is named and the oak/roots are invoked lyrically, but the setting does not constrain a single tactic or supply a resource that alters Leo's response. The eclipse functions as backdrop spectacle rather than a spatial or sensory trigger that narrows choices. Micro-setting potential (the curl, the harp strings) remains ornamental; neither object pressures a decision in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reaching Leo—is signaled early but never tightened. Maya plays, Leo taps, Leo speaks: each step is additive rather than a reversal that forecloses an alternative approach. No visible cost appears on the page; the eclipse provides atmospheric cover but does not force a trade-off or test Maya's method against a complicating pressure. The "weeks later" report of piano lessons is off-page outcome, not dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" is explicitly stated multiple times, converting theme into thesis rather than letting it emerge from image and action. The final paragraph moralizes ("the most profound magic exists...when we allow ourselves to be vulnerable") instead of trusting the eclipse and curl moment to resonate without commentary. The curl return could charge the ending, but the piece explains its meaning rather than reweighting prior material through implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single POV held throughout with stable past tense. Therapeutic abstractions ("cautious exuberance," "ordinary magic," "softly adaptive") recur as label-speak and dilute perceptual specificity; Maya's interior reads generically rather than idiosyncratically. Leo's whispered question ("Can you link the music to the stars?") feels scripted for thematic effect rather than emerging from a seven-year-old's speech pattern. The final summary paragraph shifts to reflective distance without concrete anchoring stimulus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening (strings/notes/gentle craft; locket/curl/promise all restate the same content within three sentences). Template cadence appears mid-story: "The music seemed to collect...creating a bridge...Leo finally began to cross" stacks abstract metaphors without embodied action. Register drifts into elevated therapeutic diction ("lifelong wonder," "cautious exuberance," "emotional reconnection") that exceeds Maya's immediate perception under pressure. Figurative density in the eclipse peak (hollow between earth/sky, bridge of sound, dreaming roots) blurs rather than sharpens the moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Music therapy during a solar eclipse is a premise collision rather than an organic synthesis; the eclipse provides atmospheric convenience but does not transform the therapeutic encounter in a non-obvious way. The curl exchange and "ordinary magic" motif echo dozens of similar "small moments hold profound meaning" templates without specific inflection. Transformation test fails: swap names/setting and the emotional arc remains unchanged. The "cautious exuberance" + "lifelong wonder" pairing reads as prompt fulfillment rather than earned vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and her "mellow" trait appears as descriptor, but her choices (play harp, hum, raise arms) do not create turns—Leo's responses unfold without Maya adapting tactics or facing a complication. She observes and facilitates but does not decide under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The curl appears in paragraph one (Maya touches it), returns at the eclipse peak (Leo places his beside hers), and is collected at session end. Setup and payoff gates are met, but the curl does not constrain a choice or supply a needed resource; it functions as symbolic token. The lyric reprise reweights meaning modestly but the element remains swappable with any keepsake.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" is named four times but operates as thematic label rather than shaping stakes or tactics. It does not alter what Maya or Leo can attempt; instead it retrospectively categorizes the eclipse moment. Present as concept, absent as causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Softly adaptive" is told in exposition ("Her approach was softly adaptive—she might use percussive rhythms...") but Maya never pivots tactics on the page. She begins with harp, transitions to voice, and raises arms—linear sequence without visible adaptation cost or enabling tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Link" appears twice: Leo asks "Can you link the music to the stars?" and Maya forms a link by raising their joined hands. The gesture is present at the closure beat and specific to this moment, but easily swappable with "connect" or "join" without altering story logic. It enables the peak image but does not redefine options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The eclipse is signaled in paragraph one, structures the session's arc (approach, totality, partial phases, return), and provides the temporal frame for Leo's breakthrough. It constrains the window and supplies atmospheric pressure (twilight, diamond ring) that charges the curl exchange. The mechanics matter: totality triggers Maya's shift to voice, which prompts Leo's approach. Essential to this exact telling.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is named and the oak/roots recur as images, but the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource. The ridge's height matters for eclipse viewing (mentioned once) but does not alter tactics. Postcard-level integration; functional but replaceable with any outdoor therapy site.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Beneath the hush of dreaming roots" appears as lyric phrase but does not function as timeframe. The eclipse provides temporal structure, but "dreaming roots" is metaphor without clock pressure. The phrase recurs in the final paragraph as thematic echo, not time constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Nurture lifelong wonder" is stated in paragraph one and implied at closure when Leo begins piano lessons, but the desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants or on-page cost. Told motivation without friction; Maya's choices do not test this aim against competing priorities.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named twice and describes Maya's stance at Leo's first response and at story end. The tone is present but static—no modulation under pressure, no tonal shift that charges the final image. It labels affect rather than shaping rhythm or closure.</comment>
