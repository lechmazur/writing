<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eliara's motivation is stated but never tested through meaningful conflict or contradiction. Her "empathy in motion" and "symphonically minded" traits appear as labels rather than enacted tensions that complicate choice. The ending resolves without visible cost or change—she fulfills her motive without forfeiting anything, and the sculpture will "sing again" with no indication that her stance or knowledge has shifted. The hedgehog and grove remain decorative rather than applying relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors orientation adequately (tree-song sculptor, siskin alder grove, quest for silenced sculpture) within the opening paragraph. However, the closure lacks decisive change or visible cost: Eliara accomplishes her goal, departs satisfied, and the final lines assert future repetition without on-page consequence or foreclosed path. The narrative follows a linear fulfillment arc—she seeks, finds, succeeds—but no reversal, renunciation, or reconfiguration reweights prior material. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore chain is thin; under Accumulative, the final image restates rather than charges.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (hushed leaves, hedgehog foraging, rustling in time with rhythm), and the porcelain insulator's tactile contrast is well-drawn. However, the environment does not constrain choice or alter tactics—Eliara enters, kneels, uses the insulator, and succeeds without spatial or material friction. The setting functions as atmosphere rather than active pressure, missing the Q3 9+ gate of forcing a decision or charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to create music in a silent world") is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Eliara's first attempt succeeds without complication, cost, or reversal; no option is foreclosed, no trade-off emerges. The sculpture "trembles" and releases sound immediately upon contact, collapsing potential escalation into wish-fulfillment. The lack of meaningful resistance or consequence keeps this narrative inert under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>A coherent theme—broken things can sing, silence versus sound, empathy as bridge—emerges through image and action rather than didactic statement, which is a strength. The porcelain insulator's shift from "mundane object" to "conduit" offers modest thematic work. However, the final lines veer toward moralizing ("the world, she thought, was not so silent after all") and the ending provides a tidy answer rather than resonant ambiguity. The thematic elements arise from particulars but resolve too neatly to charge the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("softer than the hedgehog's uncurling dusk," "symphonically minded"). Psychic distance is consistent and no head-hopping occurs. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from the focalizer's present urgency ("a testament to the power of listening with more than ears"), and some filter verbs ("she sensed," "she knew") dull immediacy in key beats. The voice is legible and purposeful but lacks the heightened control under pressure required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with some vivid images ("ghosted melodies," "tapestry of sound"). However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "the sculpture's fractures trembled" / "the sculpture's song grew louder" restates effect without advancing it; "empathy in motion" recurs as a label across multiple beats without functional variation. Template cadence is visible in "She knelt… her fingers tracing," "She adjusted her grip… and continued to strum," "She stood… her heart light." Stock metaphors ("leaves rustling in time," "shimmering… before dissolving") and elevated abstraction ("resonant with possibility") reduce density at closure. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—sculptor reviving a sculpture's song through empathy and a telegraph insulator—offers modest originality in object choice, but the emotional arc (artist seeks lost music, succeeds, departs fulfilled) follows a template without transformation. The stress-crack analysis and porcelain-insulator mechanics are specific yet never constrain or surprise; they function as set dressing for a predetermined outcome. The hedgehog, siskin alder, and "symphonically minded" voice add texture but do not fundamentally alter the familiar pattern of retrieval and restoration. No bold risk elevates the frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Eliara is present throughout and her role as tree-song sculptor frames the quest. However, her choices do not create turns—she decides to enter, kneel, press, strum, and leave in linear sequence without conflict or complication. Her decisions affirm her motive but do not alter tactics or foreclose paths. She observes, executes, and succeeds; the closure restates her intent rather than testing it.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator appears early (first third), is handled in at least two beats (withdrawn from pouch, pressed against crack, strummed), and its past function (carrying telegraph voices) is noted. It enables the central action and recurs with modest thematic weight ("once a mundane object, had become a conduit"). However, it does not constrain choice or evolve in meaning at closure—Eliara uses it successfully on first attempt and carries it warm at the end without new friction or cost. Its role is functional but largely replaceable with any resonant tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Empathy in motion" is stated multiple times as a concept but never dramatized as a tactical constraint or cost-bearing choice. Eliara's empathy is asserted ("her empathy in motion bridging species and time") rather than tested through conflicting impulses or failure. The concept appears as thematic decoration without altering on-page options or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" is labeled twice but never constrains or enables a specific action with visible cost. It describes Eliara's perceptual style ("heard the ghosted melodies," "wove them together") but does not force a trade-off, limit her toolkit, or complicate a beat. The trait remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Strum" is the central action, signaled mid-story and enacted across multiple beats ("began to strum," "continued to strum," "the strumming gentler"). It triggers the sculpture's release of sound and drives the narrative's main event. However, the action succeeds immediately without revision or complication, and it could be swapped for similar tactile verbs (press, tap, stroke) with minor edits. It shapes two beats and participates in closure but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Analyzing stress cracks is introduced early ("by analyzing stress cracks… she sensed the struggle") and provides the rationale for Eliara's approach. However, the mechanics are summarized in one sentence and never revisited or tested—she senses, then proceeds to strum without using the analysis to adjust tactics or overcome resistance. The method is present in setup and referenced but does not shape attempts or closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is named and described throughout (hushed leaves, quiet intensifying, leaves rustling in time) and provides atmospheric continuity. It frames the setting but does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome—Eliara could perform the same action in any quiet grove. The setting is vividly rendered but ornamental to causality.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After the hedgehog uncurls" appears as a poetic frame in the opening and closing lines but does not track elapsed time or tighten decisions. The hedgehog uncurls, forages, pauses, resumes—these are ambient details without a live clock. The timeframe is present as motif but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to create music in a silent world" is stated explicitly ("Her motive burned bright") and recurs at closure ("Her motive fulfilled"). It frames Eliara's goal and is tested by the sculpture's initial silence. However, the motivation is never conflicted—she pursues it without cost, doubt, or competing want. The desire is dramatized in one attempt that succeeds, placing it in functional but low-friction territory.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Intensely quiet" is coherent throughout: the grove hushes, silence intensifies, the last note dissolves into hush, and Eliara's steps fade. The tone modulates subtly as sound emerges and recedes, charging the opening and closing images. However, the tone does not shift under pressure—it remains uniformly contemplative and reverent without tension or disruption. It shapes atmosphere and participates in closure but lacks the dynamic range required for higher bands.</comment>
