<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is defined almost entirely by labels—"urbane," "uncommonly serene," "practiced grace"—with no embodied contradiction or internal friction visible in scene. The argument that opens the story is off-page, leaving no dramatized stake or micro-choice to anchor his motivation. His puppet performances are summarized across weeks rather than shown in one high-pressure beat where a decision costs him something. The final "cut strings" moment gestures at release but arrives without prior resistance or visible sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story opens with an off-page argument, delaying anchors (who argued? about what specifically?) past the 120-word mark and violating the Orientation Test; applying −0.4. The structure is a montage across weeks and locations (dome, bars, final performance) without clear transitions or a single scene window, yet no taught mosaic pattern emerges by the first quarter to guide accumulation. The closure—puppets with cut strings—reads as metaphor rather than a decisive change with on-page cost; Elias's stance at the end ("uncommonly serene once more") mirrors the opening with no visible forfeiture or tactical shift. Under an attempted Accumulative lens, no cadence break or density spike charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The radar dome is mentioned three times (opening, night work, final performance) but never constrains a choice or alters a tactic—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The seedy bars receive vivid texture ("The Rusty Compass," "grimy surroundings") yet spatial choreography within any single performance is absent; we never see Elias navigate proximity, sightlines, or audience interference. The campfire story stick and puppets function as props described rather than tools that impose physical or tactical limits during a live beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"ethical storytelling"—is declared in dialogue but never tested on-page through a choice with competing costs. Elias's puppet shows are summarized across weeks without a single dramatized beat where an audience member's reaction forces him to adapt tactics or pay a price. The "aggressive critic" arrives late and is dismissed with a smile and quip, deflating rather than escalating pressure. The final performance's "cut strings" gesture lacks causal grounding: no prior scene showed Elias struggling to release control, so the act carries no felt cost or reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of ethical storytelling is stated directly in multiple lines ("The real ethical violation…" "Stories belong to those who need them") rather than emerging from dramatized choices. The campfire story stick recurs but without shifting meaning; it remains a static symbol. The closing paragraph moralizes explicitly: "ethical storytelling wasn't about providing answers but about asking better questions"—a thematic summary that replaces earned resonance. No particular image or micro-choice in the final beat reweights the premise non-literally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The narration maintains stable third-person limited focalization on Elias with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, yet the prose leans into elevated diction ("meteor hush," "velvet curtain," "half-lit epiphanies") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Dialogue is sparse and functional; the critic's line carries subtext, but Elias's responses ("Why not?") feel oracular rather than embodied. Under pressure—the argument, the critic's challenge—syntax does not compress or shift; the voice remains uniformly urbane without modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "half-lit, incomplete yet illuminating" / "half-lit epiphanies"; "uncommonly serene" appears twice in identical phrasing bookending the story. Template cadence runs ("Elias set down… walked to… Among them rose…") appear in the second paragraph without pattern payoff. The phrase "campfire story stick" recurs eight times, often in decorative mentions that add no new information. Figurative density ("like dawn filtering through dust motes," "darkness descended like a velvet curtain," "meteor hush") clusters without grounding in POV-specific perception, triggering overwriting penalties of −0.6. Multiple scaffold phrases ("his practiced grace," "his serenity undisturbed") recur without variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise—calligrapher performs subversive puppet shows to explore ethics—combines unusual elements, yet the execution follows a template: artist has epiphany, undertakes project across montage, achieves symbolic resolution. The "reverse traditional tales" concept is told rather than shown in one full story; we never witness a complete subverted narrative. The radar dome and campfire story stick feel like prompt-mandated quirks rather than organically integrated specifics. Swap "calligrapher" for "painter" and "puppet shows" for "gallery installations" and the emotional arc remains unchanged, failing the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias appears in every paragraph but makes no on-page decision with visible cost. His choice to perform puppet shows is summarized, not dramatized. The final "cut strings" moment is his only specific action at closure, but it arrives unearned by prior resistance. Setup and closure gates are met, but middle development (a choice that narrows options) is absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The campfire story stick is mentioned eight times: paragraph 2 (selection), puppet shows (summary as "narrative spine"), passing between puppets (one line), critic scene (lifted as prop), final performance ("untouched"), and closing paragraph ("just wood"). It never constrains a choice or changes use across beats—each mention is decorative. Setup, weak middle presence, and closure cameo meet two gates, but no causal pressure or reweighted meaning materializes. Late penalty does not apply (introduced early), but ornamental use and swappability (any "narrative prop" would serve) cap at 3.8; the multiple mentions without function elevate slightly within that band to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The phrase "half-lit epiphany" appears three times: paragraph 2 (the epiphany arrives), late middle (audiences leave with "half-lit epiphanies"), and final paragraph (restated as concept). It frames the premise and reappears at closure, meeting setup and payoff gates, but does not constrain a middle choice or tactic. The concept is thematic rather than stake-shaping; Elias never struggles with partial insight in a way that alters his moves. Lyric reprise (early seed → final return) allows up to ~6.3, but the lack of causal pressure and the tell-only treatment lower the score to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" appears verbatim in paragraph 1 and the final paragraph, bookending the story. It is never tested or complicated: Elias remains unruffled when the critic challenges him, and no scene shows serenity costing him connection or clarity. The trait is label-only with no visible tradeoff or choice enabled by calm under pressure. Setup and closure cameo meet two gates, but zero middle development and zero on-page cost cap below 3.0; the exact reprise at closure within that constraint yields 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Reverse" appears as thematic action (reversing traditional tales in puppet shows, reversing his daytime calligraphy work, "to reverse creation is not destruction") but is never dramatized in a single full beat. The final performance claims to reverse by cutting puppet strings, yet no prior scene established Elias controlling them, so the reversal lacks contrast. Setup in paragraph 4, thematic middle work, and closure presence meet all three gates; the action shapes two beats (puppet content, final gesture) but remains swappable with "subvert" or "transform" without structural loss, capping in mid-band. Causal linkage to the final image and irreplaceability are weak, yielding 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Puppet shows in seedy bars are introduced paragraph 4, described in paragraphs 4–6, and return as the framing method for the final dome performance. Setup and closure gates are met. The method shapes the middle (his growing reputation, the critic's discovery) with one causal beat: the bar shows draw the niche audience that populates the final performance. However, the mechanics are summarized, not shown in real-time action, and the method could be replaced with "underground gallery installations" or "street performances" with minor edits. Two beats plus closure linkage allow 5.0–6.9 range; summary treatment and swappability lower to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The radar dome appears in paragraphs 1, 3, and 9 (final performance "in the radar dome"). It is described as "repurposed military relic" and a space "designed to monitor threats from above," offering thematic resonance but no spatial constraint on action. Elias never navigates its acoustics, sightlines, or layout in a way that alters a choice. Setup, weak middle mention, and closure location meet two gates, but the setting remains postcard-level and swappable with any unconventional studio space. Ornamental use and thematic-only function cap at 3.8; exact closure return within that band yields 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The phrase "in the hush left behind by heated words" appears once in paragraph 1 as atmospheric framing. No ticking clock, deadline, or temporal pressure shapes any subsequent choice. The story then spans "weeks" in summary montage, abandoning the immediate post-argument window. The timeframe is setup-only with no middle or closure development, meeting one gate and capping at 2.8. Vague tracking and zero tactical constraint lower further to 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To explore ethical storytelling" is stated explicitly in paragraph 5 and restated in the final paragraph. The motivation is told rather than dramatized in friction: Elias never faces a choice where ethical purity conflicts with audience desire, safety, or income. Setup and thematic closure meet two gates, but middle development (a moment where the desire costs him something) is absent. Told-only treatment and lack of on-page friction cap in low-mid band at 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears in paragraphs 1 and 10 (final) as metaphor; the text also references "hush left behind by heated words" and "that meteor hush" bracketing the story. Tone remains uniformly elevated and declarative throughout, with no modulation under pressure: the critic scene and final performance carry the same narrative distance and diction as the opening reflection. Setup and closure reprise meet two gates, but the static mood without cadence shift or tonal pressure at climax caps in mid-low band. The exact phrase reappearing at closure within the static-mood constraint yields 3.4.</comment>
