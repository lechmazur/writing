<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's arc from grand artist to someone seeking "purpose in the pauses" reads as a clean interior shift, and the final choice to embed ash in glass carries visible cost (abandoning pure luminosity). The "steadily adaptive" trait is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene; we see methodical clearing and patient waiting, but no moment where adaptation conflicts with another value under pressure. The smuggler backstory provides context but remains inert—Kaelen never grapples with complicity or guilt, only receives information. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("truth settling into him not like a weight, but like light") rather than embodied contradiction at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: frost patterns → ledger decoding → mineshaft discovery → final artistic synthesis. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the final image reweights Kaelen's art from "luminous" to "testimony, clear and dark," embedding sorrow with visible material cost (ash replaces pure glass). The cost is conceptual and legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mineshaft revelation transforms the smuggler's motive from criminal to protective, which reconfigures Kaelen's understanding and his artistic purpose. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The canyon setting provides atmospheric grounding ("stars stitching the ink-black sky," "crystalline air"), and the greenhouse frost functions as a micro-setting element that reveals the ledger's code, directly enabling the middle turn. However, spatial choreography inside the workshop is vague (we never see Kaelen handle tools or navigate space concretely), and the mineshaft supplies information rather than constraining a tactical choice. The frost pays off at closure by teaching Kaelen "the language of silence," but environment does not pressure the final artistic decision—Kaelen's stance shift feels internally motivated rather than spatially constrained.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering purpose after the attack—signals early and tightens once when the ledger/frost patterns force Kaelen to retrace the smuggler's steps, narrowing his options from passive mourning to active investigation. The mineshaft revelation (smuggler as protector, not criminal) deepens understanding and transforms Kaelen's artistic intention. Closure involves a renunciation with visible cost: embedding ash means abandoning pure luminosity for testimony. The reversal from "attack as silencing" to "gesture of creation" reshapes stakes, but the escalation remains cognitive rather than embodied—Kaelen faces no on-page tactical obstacle or live decision friction during the investigation itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between creation and destruction, with the smuggler's failed protective gesture mirroring Kaelen's own artistic struggle. The final image—glass embedding ash and sorrow—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of purpose without moralizing. "Finding its own drifting resonance" feels slightly echo-y of the "drifting resonance" tone element, flirting with self-reference, but the core synthesis (luminous testimony vs. pure light) reweights prior material cleanly. The frost-as-language motif constrains one middle choice and charges the ending, avoiding token symbolism. Subtext operates in the juxtaposition of "scorched testament" and "fleeting art of pressure and temperature."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; psychic distance is consistent and controlled. The perceptual signature is artist-specific: "luminous glass rods," "molten glass," "feathery spiral matched an unfamiliar rune." Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register under pressure ("settling into him not like a weight, but like light"), which reads slightly above the focalizer's lived urgency in that beat. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. Purposeful compression in the mineshaft discovery beat ("swept the ash…into a special crucible") maintains momentum. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift across beats. Information density is high: most lines advance character, discovery, or atmosphere without scaffolding. One minor paraphrase loop: "He understood now. His purpose was not found in the grand unveiling, but in the pauses where the frost forms" restates the earlier motivation without added pressure (−0.2). No template cadence, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language ("ghosts and scorched earth," "stars stitching," "truth settling…like light") remains controlled and legible, though the final "settling like light" metaphor borders on stock. Clarity and propulsion are strong; the Text Artifact Screen flags no major scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The core synthesis—using frost patterns as a cipher to decode a ledger—offers a fresh, specific method that feels particular to this artist and setting. The smuggler-as-protector reversal avoids the expected criminal-empire reveal. However, the broader arc (traumatized artist discovers hidden truth, transforms grief into art) follows a familiar template without a bold transformation of stakes or moral calculus. The ending gesture (embedding ash in glass) is visually specific but thematically predictable given the setup. No proximity echoes of famous lines; voice and subject cohere. Risk-taking is moderate: the frost-cipher method elevates the piece, but the emotional throughline remains within median safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaelen is present throughout and makes the key closure decision (embed ash in glass). Setup: introduced immediately. Development: the ledger discovery and retracing choice are his agency. Payoff: the final artistic synthesis is his action. However, many beats involve receiving information (finding ledger, reading frost, discovering mineshaft contents) rather than tactical friction or trade-off. The closure choice carries cost (luminosity sacrificed) but feels more like acceptance than a decision that narrows live options under pressure. Three-gate presence and closure linkage place it in mid-band; swappability is low (glass artist is specific), but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: discovered in paragraph 2. Development: drives the middle investigation when paired with frost. Payoff: the ledger's revelation (smuggler as protector) directly reshapes Kaelen's artistic purpose. The object is handled twice (discovery, decoding) and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (its content transforms his intention). However, the ledger itself does not appear in the final image; the ash and crucible do. Causal pressure is strong (it unlocks the mystery), but closure linkage is indirect—its information shapes the ending without physical reprise. Early signal, two-beat involvement, strong causal role, moderate closure link.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "scorched testament" appears in paragraph 2 as a descriptor for the ledger. Development: the concept recurs implicitly (the mineshaft contents are another testament to creation vs. destruction). Payoff: Kaelen's final work will be "a testimony, clear and dark," directly echoing the concept. The concept shapes theme cleanly but does not constrain on-page tactics—Kaelen's investigation and artistic choice would proceed identically if framed as "hidden truth" or "buried motive." It functions more as thematic coloring than a stake that alters options. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff), lyric reprise that reweights meaning at closure, but no middle choice constrained by it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setup: "steadily adaptive" is mentioned in paragraph 1 as a defining trait. Development: Kaelen's methodical clearing and patient waiting illustrate the trait descriptively, but no on-page moment shows adaptation constraining or enabling a choice with visible cost—he does not pivot tactics, sacrifice one method for another, or face a trade-off tied to adaptability. Payoff: the final artistic pivot (embed ash) could reflect adaptation, but the text does not explicitly link the trait to that decision. Label-only use without causal friction; ornamental rather than enabling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: signaled early when Kaelen decides to follow the frost-path. Development: the retracing action occupies the middle third and drives the key discovery (mineshaft contents). Payoff: the revelation reshapes his artistic purpose and directly enables the closure choice. The action is causally central and irreplaceable—without retracing, Kaelen would not learn the truth or shift his artistic stance. Three-gate presence, two-beat involvement (decision to retrace, the journey itself), strong causal pressure, direct closure linkage. Minor friction: the journey itself is summarized rather than dramatized with obstacles.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: frost patterns introduced at the end of paragraph 3. Development: the method enables the ledger decoding and guides Kaelen's investigation—without it, he cannot retrace the smuggler's steps. Payoff: the method recurs in the final paragraph ("purpose…in the pauses where the frost forms"), charging the closure image thematically. The mechanics matter (rune-matching, crystalline branches), and the method is specific and irreplaceable. However, the frost itself vanishes by closure ("bleeding from the windows in streaks of water"), so the physical method does not shape the final artistic act—its conceptual lesson does. Strong early signal, one-beat causal involvement, lyric reprise at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: "quiet canyon under stars" established in paragraph 1. Development: the canyon provides the mineshaft location and frames Kaelen's journey ("crystalline air," "only sound"). Payoff: the ending references "the heart of the quiet canyon." The setting supplies atmospheric coherence but does not pressure choices—Kaelen's investigation and artistic decision would proceed identically in a different locale. The greenhouse frost (micro-setting) does more causal work than the canyon itself. Three-gate presence, but the setting remains postcard-descriptive rather than tactically constraining. Geographic specificity is moderate; the canyon's "syndicate" and "small-timers" hint at social pressure but remain vague.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Setup: "A week had passed since the attempt" anchors the timeframe early. Development: the frame (post-survival) motivates Kaelen's shift from fear to patient investigation, but elapsed time is vague (dawn arrives, sun climbs) and does not tighten decisions—Kaelen faces no deadline or urgency. Payoff: the ending references "after surviving" indirectly, but the timeframe does not shape the final choice. The "after" context sets the emotional baseline but does not function as a live clock or constraint. Two-gate presence (setup, thematic backdrop), but no middle escalation tied to time pressure. Swappable with "days after" or "months after" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: motivation articulated in paragraph 1 ("to discover purpose in the pauses"). Development: the ledger discovery and frost-pattern decoding illustrate the search for meaning, and the mineshaft revelation redefines what "purpose" means. Payoff: the ending directly fulfills the motivation ("His purpose was not found in the grand unveiling, but in the pauses where the frost forms"). The desire is dramatized through investigation and artistic reorientation, with visible cost (luminosity sacrificed). However, the motivation is more quest than conflict—Kaelen does not face friction between competing wants. Three-gate presence, strong closure linkage, moderate causal pressure (the search shapes beats but does not force trade-offs).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: "drifting resonance" appears in the final line, but the tone (contemplative, elegiac, quiet accumulation) is established from the opening ("silence was his only companion," "quiet canyon"). Development: tone modulates subtly—fear and opacity (paragraph 1) → patient discovery (paragraphs 3-4) → sad clarity (mineshaft) → resolve (ending). Payoff: the final image ("finding its own drifting resonance") directly names the tone, charging the closure. The tone is coherent through turns and supports the accumulative lens. Minor friction: naming the tone explicitly in the last line flirts with self-reference rather than letting the image embody it. Tone shapes the final image strongly but is told rather than fully enacted at closure.</comment>
