<comment>The poet's interior is built on reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "warmly attentive" touch and "mission" are told rather than shown through micro-choices with visible cost. The weaving action near midpoint offers a gesture toward agency, but the ending withdraws into passive observation ("simply sat, observing") and summary interiority ("the poet had always believed"), flattening the final stakes. No meaningful renunciation or stance crystallization with felt cost occurs on the page.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly early. The piece offers a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt—the poet creates a sculpture, observes it, then walks away as the tide claims it—but the cost remains abstract and told rather than shown in a decisive image. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final third recycles prior reflection ("beauty lived in the margins," "woven dawns") without a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake. The ending summarizes rather than dramatizes the closure effect, and the conceptual price is asserted, not made undeniable on the page.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the poet's contemplative attention (petrichor, salt, cobalt lagoon, damp sand). The feather and string function as micro-setting objects and constrain one mid-story choice (the weaving). However, the final third abandons physical grounding for summary reflection, and the sculpture on the rock never pressures a subsequent choice. The lagoon remains postcard backdrop rather than a resource or obstacle that alters tactics at closure.</comment>

<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The kite-string catch and weaving offer one tightening moment, but no meaningful reversal or deepening narrows options with visible cost. The poet's final decision (to walk away and let the tide claim the sculpture) is told as inevitable philosophy rather than dramatized as a trade-off with felt consequences. Under the Accumulative lens, no cadence shift or density increase forces a stance crystallization; pressure plateaus after the weaving and the ending summarizes rather than escalates.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Theme (beauty in brokenness, transformation over restoration) emerges from the feather-and-string weaving and is signaled in multiple reflection blocks. However, the final third meta-narrates the theme ("The poet had always believed," "they had proven it again") rather than letting the final image speak non-literally. The sculpture's surrender to the tide is told as thematic validation ("That was part of the beauty") instead of dramatized with undeniable pressure. Subtext is weak; the poet's interior voice articulates the theme directly, leaving little room for reader inference.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a distinct contemplative texture ("burnished hush," "woven dawns"). However, narrative distance fluctuates: early embodied detail (fingers along vanes, sand clinging to calves) gives way to summary omniscience in the final third ("The poet had always believed," "The shore would hold this moment"). Several reflection blocks exceed character-plausible articulation at the moment of pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent but flattens under peak emotional beats into abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is frequent and occasionally vivid ("scarlet vein," "captured twilight") but mixed metaphors muddle clarity ("the tide's advance slow and inexorable" while the poet remains unmoving stretches plausibility). Template-cadence runs appear: "The poet [verb]" opens five sentences in the final third. Paraphrase loops recur: "beauty in the incomplete" / "beauty lived in the margins" / "in the incomplete, the poet would find their next verse" restate the same idea across three beats without added pressure. Information density is low in the final third, where summary reflection replaces scene momentum. The closure beat is buried in philosophical summary rather than a sharp final image.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>The premise (contemplative artist finds meaning in ephemeral creation) is familiar and the execution does not transform it through non-obvious synthesis or specific lived detail. The feather-and-string weaving is a functional metaphor but feels illustrative rather than inevitable. The final choice (to let the sculpture be claimed by the tide) echoes widely used templates of impermanence without a fresh moral calculus or risk. The "woven dawns" coinage reads decorative rather than causally integrated. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece plays safe in the contemplative middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>The poet appears in every beat but makes only one on-page decision with consequence (lunging to catch the kite string, then weaving it with the feather). The final choice (to walk away) is told as philosophical inevitability rather than a turn that alters tactics or forecloses a live option. Observation dominates; the poet "simply sat, observing" at the penultimate beat. Present throughout, functionally active in one middle beat, but passive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The drake's tail feather is introduced early (first paragraph), handled in two distinct beats (initial touch, weaving with string), and appears in the final image ("leaving the feather and string to the lagoon"). Its iridescent surface and structural properties enable the weaving. However, its role in the closure is descriptive rather than causally decisive; the poet's choice to walk away does not hinge on the feather's unique properties. Strong setup and development, but closure linkage is participatory rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>"Woven dawns" is coined mid-story as a label for the poet's method and recurs in the final paragraph as thematic summary. It does not shape on-page stakes or constrain tactics; the weaving would proceed identically without this phrase. The concept is told rather than dramatized as a force that narrows options. Present and thematically aligned, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>3.4</grade>
<comment>"Warmly attentive" appears once as description ("their touch warmly attentive, as if coaxing a secret") and does not constrain or enable a subsequent choice with visible cost. The weaving is described as "practiced grace," but no on-page tradeoff arises from warm attentiveness versus another mode. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Tend" is signaled in the prompt motivation ("to discover beauty in the incomplete") and performed on-page during the weaving ("They tended the object as if it were a living thing"). It recurs in the final line ("their next reason to tend"). The weaving beat is the story's one causal turn, and "tend" names the method, but the closure choice (to walk away) does not trace directly to tending. Shapes one key beat and the final image semantically, but the major turn (departure) is philosophically motivated rather than driven by the act of tending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>4.7</grade>
<comment>"By harmonizing discord" is dramatized in the weaving beat ("harmonizing discord, they mended what was broken not with glue, but with meaning"). The method's mechanics matter (feather's rigidity meets string's flexibility) and enable the one middle turn. However, it does not shape the final choice; the poet's departure is philosophically motivated, not tactically altered by the harmonizing method. Functional in one beat, absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>The cobalt lagoon after rain anchors setting throughout and supplies sensory texture (petrichor, salt, ripples, tide). The tide's advance is noted at closure but does not pressure the poet's decision; the choice to walk away is told as philosophical ("They knew the sculpture would be claimed") rather than forced by rising water. The lagoon mirrors the poet's focus metaphorically but does not constrain tactics. Present across beats, participates in closure image, but does not alter outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The kite string snaps early ("A sudden gust rattled the palms above, and the poet glanced up just as a kite string snapped") and triggers the poet's lunge, creating the story's one causal turn. The snap itself is a timeframe marker (a singular event) rather than a ticking clock. Time otherwise remains vague (morning find, untracked duration of weaving, tide advance unquantified). The snap drives one key beat and supplies the string as material, but does not tighten decisions at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>"To discover beauty in the incomplete" is told in the first paragraph ("Their lifelong pursuit was to discover beauty in the incomplete") and reasserted in the final third ("The poet had always believed that beauty lived in the margins"). The weaving dramatizes the motivation in one beat. However, no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost or fear is visible; the poet's choices align smoothly with the stated mission. Told and illustrated, but not conflicted with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>"Burnished hush" appears twice (opening and final paragraph) and names the story's contemplative register. Tone remains stable and quiet throughout, modulating slightly during the kite catch (urgency: "lunged, scooping") then returning to reflection. The final image ("The cobalt lagoon after rain shimmered behind them, a mirror to the burnished hush within") charges the tone phrase with closure meaning. Coherent, modulates minimally under pressure, and participates in the final image semantically, but does not transform prior material.</comment>
