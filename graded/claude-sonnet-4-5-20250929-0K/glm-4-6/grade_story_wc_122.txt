<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to defeat numbness is clear and her plan to use backward recordings shows agency. The embodied sensation work—feeling vibrations through boots, palm on spinning record—grounds her deaf experience concretely. However, the emotional arc from numbness to "crack in its foundation" feels more told than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "defiantly beating heart" veers toward label-speak rather than letting the physical sensation stand alone.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: deaf music teacher in drum maker's cavern with broken phonograph needle. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens—density increases through layered sensory detail (scraping, humming, buzzing) that reweights the numbness stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the "filament of hush" snaps, numbness cracks, and she feels "alive to the world's vibrations once more" with visible cost (the chaotic friction, tearing grooves). The causal chain from broken needle → filing it crude → playing backward discs → physical sensation → emotional crack holds cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cavern is vividly realized with selective, purposeful detail: wooden drum shells as "sleeping giants," wood shavings on the workbench, stone floor conducting bass vibrations. The setting constrains Elara's choice—she needs the "audibly muted" quality to discern phantom vibrations, and the turntable/floor become conduits for her sensory plan. The micro-setting (her body, the turntable, the record) charges the final image when she feels the pulse through her skeleton. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and remains coherent. The tightening occurs when she files the needle crude despite knowing it will tear grooves, a trade-off that raises cost. The backward recordings escalate from "low guttural frequency" to "final track's reversed crescendo" that snaps the filament, a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the protagonist's agency in the peak beat is somewhat passive (letting vibrations happen to her) rather than a choice that forecloses a path; the cost is felt but not decisively chosen.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the journey from silence/numbness to chaotic, painful sensation mirrors the backward recordings' "reversed architecture of sound." The filament-of-hush metaphor threads through without over-statement, transforming from constraint to snapped release. The ending resists tidy resolution—"not happiness, not yet, but...being alive"—and the final image of her heart's "messy, painful, and beautiful throb" answers the central question without moralizing. No late-arriving symbols; the needle, drums, and recordings are established early and reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara throughout. Perceptual signature is strong in sensory hierarchy—she notices vibrations, tremors, and tactile texture over auditory detail. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("filament of hush," "audibly muted," "混乱," "终于") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated for a music teacher's interiority under stress. The prose texture is distinct but at times over-wrought ("crumbling of tonal structures," "jagged journey of the needle as a frantic, buzzing text"). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several loops appear: "audibly muted" recurs without added pressure (opening, middle, near end); "filament of hush" appears three times with near-identical phrasing. The phrase "turning seasons outside" bookends without transformation. Figurative density is high throughout ("drawn bowstring," "tapestry of scrapes," "ghost of its former self") and some metaphors clash—"crumbling of tonal structures" as "physical presence" mixes incompatible vehicles. Two untranslated Chinese characters (混乱, 终于) disrupt legibility. Apply paraphrase-loop and figurative-density penalties cumulatively: −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of deaf protagonist + backward-recorded test discs + filing broken needle crude to increase friction is specific and non-obvious. The concept avoids the "cure" narrative by keeping numbness cracked, not vanished. The drum maker's cavern as setting fits organically rather than as set-dressing. However, the emotional numbness → sensory reawakening arc follows a familiar template, and the transformation relies heavily on the protagonist's unique constraint (deafness) rather than a surprising moral calculus or perspectival risk. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreating into safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices create the key turns: she decides to file the needle, to use backward recordings, to press her palm against the spinning record. Her agency drives the middle and ending beats. Early setup (opening paragraph), middle development (filing, playing discs), and payoff (final sensory breakthrough) all present. Removing her would collapse the story's logic. The cost—chaotic friction, tearing grooves, physical overwhelm—is tied directly to her method.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The broken phonograph needle appears in at least four beats: discovery ("glinted...tiny severed spear"), filing it to crude point, lowering it to scrape shellac, and final resting state ("its purpose fulfilled"). Its broken state and crude rework are causally necessary—she needs the friction. The needle's transformation from "personal failure" to "key that unlocked her" charges the closure image. High irreplaceability; the story hinges on this exact object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Filament of hush" is seeded early (opening paragraph), recurs at mid-point ("tighten, a drawn bowstring"), and snaps at closure, enabling the emotional crack. However, it functions primarily as metaphor rather than constraining on-page choice—Elara never navigates around it tactically. The concept shapes theme more than stakes. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake at the end, lifting it into mid-band, but it does not narrow options in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" recurs three times and enables a tactic: the cavern's dampened quality allows Elara to "discern the phantom vibrations beneath." It appears in setup (opening), middle justification (she needs the muted space), and near closure. However, it is somewhat ornamental—generic "quiet space" could serve similarly. The specificity of "audibly muted" versus simply "quiet" adds texture but not irreplaceable constraint. Two-gate presence (setup, middle) with modest causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Enthrall" appears once, tied to her plan: "she needed to enthrall herself, to trick her nervous system." Later, "it began to enthrall her, pulling her from her emotional quagmire." The action is causally central—her goal is to use sensation to enthrall/overwhelm numbness—and it drives the climax. However, the word itself could be replaced with "overwhelm" or "immerse" without major structural loss. The concept is essential; the exact verb is not. Three-gate presence with strong causal role but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are seeded early ("cache...strange shellac discs"), explained (drum maker used them to test resonance), and deployed in the climax (first disc, final track). The method is mechanically essential—forward recordings would not provide the "reversed architecture" or the chaotic friction she needs. Removing this exact method collapses her plan and the thematic reversal. Three gates with high specificity and causal pressure. Cost is legible: she tears grooves to harvest sensation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cavern is established early (opening paragraph), provides resources (workbench, turntable, stone floor conducting vibrations), and its "audibly muted" quality enables her tactic. The rejected drums and wood shavings create atmosphere and mirror her internal state. The setting shapes multiple beats and recurs in the closure image ("still audibly muted, but...now a space of profound resonance"). However, another quiet workspace could serve with minor edits. Strong but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Faint rustle of turning seasons" bookends the piece (opening and final line) but does not constrain tactics or tighten decisions. No on-page clock pressure; the experiment could take minutes or hours without affecting outcome. The phrase adds lyric texture and thematic weight (change, passage) but is largely ornamental. Two-gate presence (setup, closure cameo) without middle development or causal work. Swappable with "autumn wind" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to defeat emotional numbness is stated early ("desperate, aching hunger"), drives her plan (backward recordings to trick her nervous system), and lands at closure (numbness cracks, sliver of feeling pours through). The friction between her want (to feel again) and the cost (chaotic, painful sensation, tearing grooves) is dramatized on the page. Three gates with strong causal pressure and visible trade-offs. Her choices trace directly to this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" tone is coherent throughout—muted opening, restrained middle, quiet ending—and modulates under pressure (the "混乱" chaos absorbed by the cavern, the "messy, painful throb" breaking through). The cavern mirrors her numbness explicitly. However, the tone is somewhat static; the chaotic middle does not fully rupture the hush on the page, and the ending returns to quiet ("faint rustle"). The final image charges the tone but does not transform it decisively. Strong thematic fit, moderate tonal arc.</comment>
