<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The thief's motivation is declared ("press his ear against destiny's door") but never tested against a meaningful counter-pressure or cost. His "realization" that the portrait is a mirror arrives as an unearned epiphany without prior contradiction or struggle. The final choice—to leave the portrait untouched—feels like acceptance of a philosophical premise rather than a decision shaped by competing desires. Internal conflict is asserted ("frustrated," "trembling hands") but remains decorative; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is adequate (station, thief, portrait anchored early). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (golden hour, emerald light, moonbeams as recurring images), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the thief simply kneels, traces, and experiences an insight. The "closure" is a reconfiguration claim (portrait as mirror, not door) but the cost is absent—he walks away with his jar intact and his heart "lighter," a reward rather than a price. No on-page action or forfeiture alters his options; the story tells us he's learned but shows no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The emerald station and golden-hour light are vivid and consistently rendered across the piece. Sensory detail (moonbeams "like liquid starlight," "misty veil") is selective and atmospheric. However, the setting does not constrain a single choice or charge the final image with tactical consequence; it functions as backdrop. The jar of moonbeams is handled twice (unscrewed, capped) but its use does not alter the environment or test a physical limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—listening for destiny's secrets—is declared early but never tightened by opposition or cost. The portrait's silence is described as "profound," yet the thief's response is immediate philosophical acceptance rather than a forced trade-off. No meaningful escalation occurs; he kneels, traces, receives a smile, and concludes. The resolution (walking away) is not earned by prior causality but by an off-stage shift in understanding. Coincidence (the woman's smile) triggers the turn rather than protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme (destiny as path, not door; creating one's own illuminated moments) emerges clearly but is stated rather than embodied in the final beats: "Maybe destiny wasn't a door to be opened but a path to be walked." The flower codes are set up but never decoded on the page, so their thematic contribution remains abstract. The portrait-as-mirror insight is told, not demonstrated through a choice with visible cost. The ending image (thief vanishing, "a thief no longer of portraits, but of perspective") gestures toward resonance but remains a label rather than a felt reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and lush, with a distinct perceptual signature ("shadow painted in honey," "liquid starlight"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("luminous disbelief," "unsung histories") that feels more decorative than rooted in the thief's lived lexicon. Diction modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter clauses when he kneels and traces), though the final paragraph's philosophical summary flattens urgency. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the prose is largely clear, but several paraphrase loops appear: "He'd spent weeks decoding its secret" immediately followed by "a language of petals and stems—codes in flower arrangements that only he could read" restates the same content without added pressure. Figurative density is high throughout ("moonbeams swirling like liquid starlight," "shadows painted in honey," "destiny's door") without clear escalation or pattern payoff. The final third contains stock phrasing ("his heart lighter than it had been in years," "a beacon for the illuminated moments yet to come") that dulls the closure image. Loops and elevated register in peak beats warrant −0.6 to −0.8; mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise (thief stealing illuminated moments via moonbeams and flower codes) is imaginative in surface detail but the arc follows a familiar template: seeker pursues secret, discovers self-knowledge instead, walks away transformed. The flower codes are introduced as a unique mechanism but never used on the page, reducing them to ornament. The woman's smile and the portrait-as-mirror realization feel like stock wisdom-quest resolutions. No bold risk or specific synthesis elevates the material beyond the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The golden-hour portrait thief is present throughout and makes the final choice to leave the portrait untouched, but that decision is triggered by an off-stage epiphany rather than a dramatized conflict. He observes, kneels, and accepts; no on-page choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off. Swappable with "seeker" or "philosopher" with minor edits. Introduced immediately (setup ✓), passive middle (development ✗), minimal closure participation (payoff ~). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle; subtract −0.5 for swappability and −0.3 for ornamental agency. Final: 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The jar of moonbeams appears in three beats: carried in the satchel (setup), unscrewed and poured onto the canvas (middle action), and capped at the end (closure callback). However, its use does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the moonbeams dim when the golden hour fades, a parallel rather than a price. It is handled on the page but remains symbolic rather than causally active. Setup ✓, development ~, payoff ~. Two-gate presence allows eligibility to ~6.0, but swappability and lack of cost connection lower the score. Subtract −0.5 for ornamental middle use and −0.4 for no cost linkage. Final: 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Illuminated moments" frames the thief's quest in the opening and returns in the final line as "a beacon for the illuminated moments yet to come." It does not shape a single on-page tactic or choice; the thief's actions (decoding, listening, tracing) are driven by the portrait and flower codes, not by the concept itself. The concept is thematic echo rather than narrative engine. Setup ✓, development ✗, payoff (label-only reprise). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle; subtract −0.3 for label-only use and −0.1 for late thematic cameo. Final: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Quietly savvy" is mentioned once in the second sentence ("His quiet savvy had gotten him past the guards") as backstory explanation. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action; the guards are off-stage and the thief's approach to the portrait is unopposed. Label-only, no demonstrated cost or tradeoff. Setup ✓ (mentioned early), development ✗, payoff ✗. Cap at 4.6; subtract −0.8 for summary-only, −0.5 for no causal work, −0.4 for swappability. Final: 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Reinterpret" appears explicitly near the end ("began to reinterpret the painting's purpose") and drives the thief's shift from seeking secrets to accepting the portrait as mirror. This action is the story's conceptual hinge. However, it is told rather than dramatized through a prior choice with visible cost, and the reinterpretation itself is a passive realization rather than an active decision that alters tactics. Setup ✗ (not signaled early), development ✗, payoff ✓ (closure-central). One-gate presence limits eligibility, but closure linkage is strong. Start at 3.0; add +1.2 for closure linkage, +0.5 for conceptual hinge, subtract −0.4 for summary delivery and −0.5 for late first appearance. Final: 6.3 (lyric-resonance allowance for closure reprise with conceptual cost).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Codes in flower arrangements" are introduced early ("a language of petals and stems—codes in flower arrangements that only he could read") and referenced once in the middle when he traces them with his fingertips. They do not shape any tactic or reveal meaning on the page; the thief never decodes them, so their mechanics remain inert. Setup ✓, development ~ (gestural mention), payoff ✗. Two-gate weak presence allows eligibility to ~3.4. Subtract −0.5 for ornamental middle use, −0.4 for swappability (could be "symbols" or "runes"), −0.3 for no causal work. Final: 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "emerald station by moonlight" (also described as "emerald luminescence under a fleeting golden sunset") is present throughout, anchors the setting early, and provides atmosphere. The station's lights "flicker, as if bidding him farewell" at the end, a charged callback. However, the setting does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics; it functions as stage rather than crucible. Setup ✓, development ✗, payoff ✓ (charged reprise). Two-gate presence with lyric reprise allows ~5.5–6.3. Add +0.3 for closure callback, subtract −0.2 for postcard description, −0.2 for no tactical pressure. Final: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Under a fleeting golden sunset" is signaled in the opening ("a fleeting golden sunset") and tracked across the middle ("the golden hour fading as the sun dipped below the horizon," "the last traces of gold slipping away as night claimed the sky"). The timeframe tightens the thief's window and the jar's glow dims in sync, creating parallel pressure. However, no on-page decision is forced by the clock; the thief completes his realization without urgency. Setup ✓, development ✓ (tracked across beats), payoff ~ (mentioned but not causal). Add +0.9 for two-beat involvement, +0.5 for causal pressure (parallel), subtract −0.4 for no forced choice, −0.3 for passive ending. Final: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To press your ear against destiny's door" is introduced early as the thief's motivation and returns in the final beat ("he'd finally pressed his ear against destiny's door—and found only himself"). It frames the quest but does not face conflicting costs on the page; the thief pursues it without friction or sacrifice. The ending reconfigures the metaphor (destiny as path, not door) but the shift is told rather than forced by a choice. Setup ✓, development ✗ (no on-page friction), payoff ✓ (conceptual reprise). Two-gate presence with lyric reprise allows ~5.5–6.3, but told-only friction lowers the score. Add +0.8 for closure linkage, subtract −0.6 for no dramatized conflict, −0.3 for label-only desire. Final: 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Luminous disbelief" appears once in the middle ("luminous disbelief") when the thief hears silence. The overall tone is contemplative and lush, coherent across the piece, but does not modulate sharply with pressure; the thief's frustration and realization are described in similar register. The tone charges the final image weakly (thief vanishing, moonbeams as companion). Setup ~ (not named early), development ✓ (one explicit mention), payoff ~ (tone present but static). Add +0.4 for one-beat involvement, +0.3 for tonal coherence, subtract −0.4 for static mood, −0.3 for late first appearance, −0.2 for weak closure charge. Final: 5.4.</comment>
