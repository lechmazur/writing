<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's choice to form an alternative hypothesis drives the investigation, and his decisions to correlate dates and heat the stamp show agency under pressure. However, his interiority relies heavily on tell ("tranquilly perceptive nature," "feverish determination") rather than embodied contradiction. The final act of readjusting entries feels like task completion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible personal cost, weakening the character arc's stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal chain: blackout → candlelight examination → stamp discovery → hypothesis → coordinate revelation → reindexing. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when), and the lens reads as primarily Causal with accumulative texture. The closure effect (reindexing the library's history) is on the page but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or altered relationship. The final image offers thematic resonance but lacks the felt price required for Charged Poise or a full Decisive Change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The underwater library is vividly anchored with the dome, hydroelectric systems, and glass allowing sunlight through water. Sensory details (flame through water, sea creature songs) are selective and atmospheric. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; the stamp's heating and the coordinate maps are tools handled, but neither the water pressure, the blackout's spatial constraints, nor the vault layout materially narrows Elias's options or charges the final image with environmental consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tracing honest origins—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The discovery that the city was built underwater rather than sunk provides one meaningful tightening of knowledge. Yet Elias faces no antagonist, no competing deadline pressure from the blackout, and no visible trade-off; the investigation proceeds without friction or cost. The escalation is cognitive (hypothesis → evidence → conclusion) but lacks a felt price or foreclosed alternative that would elevate pressure under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: knowledge preserved through foresight rather than salvaged from disaster. The final image—light filtering through water onto the completed notes—offers a resonant metaphor without overt statement. "Reclaimed stillness" and the blackout as gift reinforce the theme through concrete experience. However, Elias's epiphany ("true knowledge survives not by escaping disaster, but by transcending it entirely") edges into stated thesis rather than letting the image and action carry the weight alone, slightly diluting the thematic restraint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elias, with clear focalization and appropriate narrative distance. Diction is controlled and voice remains consistent. The single line of dialogue ("How peculiar," "There never was a flood") feels natural for a solitary scholar speaking to himself. However, repeated label-phrases ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") and filter verbs ("believed," "understood") reduce immediacy in key beats. No head-hopping or tense drift, but the voice lacks a strong perceptual signature beyond scholarly register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is high and the prose maintains momentum without major loops. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and figurative language ("dappled shadows," "constellations in the darkness") serves atmosphere. However, multiple instances of prompt-echo phrasing appear: "tranquilly perceptive nature," "dappled resolve" (twice), "reclaimed stillness," "honest origins," "antique ink stamp" recur as labels without variation. Template cadence in the middle section ("He ran his fingers," "He formed," "He took out") and minor paraphrase loops ("masterpiece of preservation—a sanctuary built to save knowledge") reduce density. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting the deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The core premise—underwater library built intentionally, not sunk—offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic preservation tropes. The heated brass stamp revealing coordinates is a clever, specific mechanism. However, the protagonist is a stock "lone scholar discovers hidden truth" archetype, and the investigation proceeds without surprise or moral complexity. The resolution (city was always underwater) reframes backstory but does not challenge Elias's values or assumptions in a way that generates thematic tension. The premise transforms a familiar trope but stops short of bold risk or emotional complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elias appears in setup and every beat; his decision to form an alternative hypothesis and to heat the stamp are key turns. However, many beats are observational (adjusting the lamp, running fingers over the stamp, whispering to silence). The final act of reindexing is task-driven rather than a choice that forecloses a competing path with cost. Present across beats but decisions lack visible stakes or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stamp is introduced early, handled physically (fingers over brass, heated over flame), and its hidden coordinates drive the central reversal. It appears in at least three distinct beats (discovery, heating, cross-reference) and directly enables the climax. The final paragraph does not return to it, missing a lyric reprise opportunity, but its causal work is strong. Irreplaceability is moderate—another artifact could serve—but its octopus-spiral motif ties to setting architecture, adding specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is named twice and frames the blackout as gift, shaping Elias's ability to think without distraction. However, it functions thematically rather than as a tactical constraint; the stillness does not narrow options or force a trade-off. The story would proceed nearly unchanged if Elias simply preferred candlelight. Present and consistent with tone, but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears twice as a label describing Elias's manner of noticing details others overlook. It justifies his discovery of the stamp's peculiarity but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. The trait could be replaced with "meticulous" or "detail-oriented" without structural change. Label-only use without dramatized trade-off or friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Readjust" appears three times: adjusting the lamp (setup), readjusting his framework (midpoint turn), and readjusting index entries (closure). The midpoint readjustment of framework is the key cognitive reversal that reorients the investigation. The final readjustment completes the arc and appears in the closure paragraph. However, the action is intellectual rather than physical, and the cost is abstract (correcting centuries of narrative) rather than personal. Two beats plus closure, but swappability with "reframe" or "revise" caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The alternative hypothesis is signaled early ("Elias had been hired to trace honest origins... Yet everything... suggested otherwise") and explicitly named at the midpoint ("He formed an alternative hypothesis"). It shapes his investigation method (correlating dates, cross-referencing maps) and drives the discovery. However, the mechanics of hypothesis formation are told rather than shown through competing interpretations or failed attempts. Present in setup and middle, method matters, but execution is summary-level.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underwater library is anchored early with vivid details (watery dome, hydroelectric systems, glass vault, sea creature songs). The blackout forces candlelight, creating mild constraint. The coordinate maps in the vault supply the key evidence, and the final image uses sunlight through water to close the arc. The setting provides resources (maps, preserved texts) and atmosphere, appearing in setup, middle, and closure. However, the water itself never pressures a choice (no leak, no air limit, no navigation challenge). Strong presence and closure linkage, but tactical constraint is limited.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The blackout is named in the opening and the final paragraph notes "dawn approached" and candles "flickered out." It frames the investigation and creates the "reclaimed stillness" condition. However, elapsed time is vague ("three hours into his investigation," "as dawn approached"), and the blackout never tightens a decision or forces a trade-off (no failing light mid-discovery, no urgent deadline). Present in setup and closure with mild middle constraint (diminishing fuel), but the clock does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To trace honest origins" is stated in the opening as Elias's hired task and returns in the final paragraph as the driving question. The motivation frames every beat of investigation and the closure directly answers it. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted—Elias pursues it without friction, competing desire, or cost. The want does not collide with a fear or competing value. Present setup to closure and causally central, but lacks the friction required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears twice as a label, and "dappled shadows" opens the story. The tone is contemplative and steady, modulating slightly with Elias's quickened heart and trembling fingers but never fracturing under pressure. The final image (dancing light patterns) visually reprises "dappled" and charges the closure with quiet affirmation. Coherent and present in setup and ending, but the tone is static rather than dynamically responsive to escalation. Lyric reprise earns mid-band credit, but lack of tonal shift under pressure limits the score.</comment>
