<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior is textured with embodied detail (dust patterns, the button's weight, the file's "click"), and his motive to magnify small kindnesses drives his archival choices under pressure. Internal contradiction surfaces briefly when his "broken heart" is marked but not extinguished, yet the piece leans toward reflective observation rather than live conflict between impulses. The final moment—standing and reweighting the shelves—reads as insight more than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, capping the score in the upper 6-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (archivist, file room, "after the emancipation"). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elias traces one button through marginal notes, building density toward the final reweighting ("network of these small, bright moments"). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the archival sleeve and his altered perception crystallize a before/after with felt cost (his heart "more bearable"). Causality is clean; the cost is emotional and opportunity-based (he will not return the button), legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The file room is anchored with sensory particulars (fluorescent hum, dust patterns, brittle pages, brass button). The button's tactile presence (cool, weightless) and the archival sleeve constrain Elias's final choice to pair objects rather than re-file them. Spatial choreography is clean (bottom shelf, ledger, sleeve), and the setting shapes the closure image (endless shelves reweighted). The micro-object (button) charges the final beat, meeting the 9+ gate's constraint test, but one slip—"листing" (a typo or code artifact)—touches the opening and prevents higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—magnifying small kindnesses in forgotten records—is signaled early and drives each beat: finding the button, tracing Micah's file, pairing the drawing. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias decides not to return the button, foreclosing the default archival path with visible cost (the ledger loses its artifact, the drawing gains a companion). Agency is clear (decision to pair objects), and the cost is legible (he alters the archive's order). Escalation is modest but sufficient under the Accumulative lens; no major reversals are required, and the final act reweights options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—small kindnesses as an architecture of hope beneath bureaucracy—emerges through concrete beats (button, note, drawing) without thesis statements. The final image ("network of these small, bright moments") reweights the opening view of "boxes of sorrow" with a non-literal answer to the central question: do these histories matter? One small slip: "His work was a quiet, patient unfurling of the past, revealing the hidden architecture of hope" edges toward summary statement in the penultimate paragraph, but the closure image (standing, reweighting the shelves) earns the resonance through prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (Elias notices dust patterns, thread loops, marginalia). Diction is mostly controlled ("tactfully hopeful," "sad tapestry"), but one phrase—"листing the cover back"—is a typo or artifact that disrupts voice. Internal thought formatting is consistent, and psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the button discovery, wider during the final shelf scan). No dialogue is present. The artifact and one borderline elevation ("sacred texts," "universe of untold joy") prevent entry into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, information density is high, and spatial choreography tracks clearly. One typo/artifact ("листing") and one minor paraphrase loop ("small kindness...small, profound current") slightly dull momentum. Figurative language is mostly controlled, but "universe of untold joy and sorrow" and "pebble into the ocean" approach stock metaphor territory without fresh specificity. Propulsion is steady; no major scaffold or template cadence appears. The artifacts are clustered early and do not touch the closure beat, limiting deduction to −0.3 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—archivist discovers hidden kindness in foster-care marginalia—transforms a familiar "found object" trope through specific occupational detail (ledgers, caseworker notes, archival sleeves) and emotional grounding (Elias's broken heart). The button-to-drawing connection is earned in hindsight, and the final reweighting avoids a tidy moral. However, the core arc (lonely worker finds solace in old records) is well-trodden, and the transformation, while solid, does not offer a non-obvious synthesis. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat, landing in the upper 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias (broken-hearted archivist) is present throughout and makes two key decisions: to examine the ledger (beat one) and to pair the button with the drawing rather than return it to the ledger (beat two, closure). His choices create the story's turns, meeting the Setup, Development, and Payoff gates. Early signal (+0.5), two distinct beats (+0.9), causal pressure (narrows archival options, +0.7), and closure linkage (final decision, +1.0) lift the score. Swappability is low; the "broken-hearted" trait is specific to his motive. Minor deduction for limited mid-scene friction (−0.3), yielding 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The infantryman's button appears in four distinct beats: discovery in the ledger, examination, tracing through Micah's file, and pairing with the drawing at closure. Setup by ~15% (+0.7), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (its thread loop and eagle shape guide Elias's search, +1.0), closure linkage (archival sleeve decision, +1.2), and specificity (brass, tarnished, eagle face, +0.6) sum to strong integration. The button's meaning reweights from talisman to testament. No major frictions; total 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unknown histories" is signaled early ("silent stories," "those who had passed through") and shapes Elias's stake: to magnify what official records miss. It appears in the inciting decision (examining the ledger, beat one), the tracing of Micah's marginalia (beat two), and the final reweighting ("examined unknown of the file room"). Setup (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (unknown = what must be found, +0.9), closure linkage (final phrase, +1.0), cost connection (he alters the archive to preserve the unknown, +0.4). Minor swappability (could be "forgotten" or "hidden," −0.3) yields 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" is established early ("a trait that had been beaten down but never extinguished") and enables Elias's decision to trace the button ("felt a spark of it now"). It appears in one key beat (mid-story realization) and is implied at closure (his heart "more bearable"). Setup (+0.5), one beat (+0.4), causal pressure (the trait allows him to see the button as a key, +0.6), closure linkage (emotional shift, +0.7). Visible tradeoff is modest; the trait is more label than constraint (−0.4), yielding 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfurl" appears three times: opening the ledger ("decided to unfurl the life contained within"), the final paragraph ("quiet, patient unfurling of the past"), and implicitly in the act of pulling the drawing from its sleeve. Setup by ~12% (+0.7), two beats (ledger, drawing, +0.9), causal pressure (the action reveals the marginalia and drawing, +0.8), closure linkage (thematically charged in the penultimate line, +0.8). Swappability is moderate (could be "open" or "reveal," −0.5), and the action is more metaphorical than physical at closure (−0.3), yielding 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Through accumulated dust patterns" is signaled early ("dust patterns wrote their own stories," "clear swipe across the spine") and enables the inciting choice: someone else's recent interest piques Elias's curiosity. Setup by ~10% (+0.6), one beat (discovery, +0.4), causal pressure (the swipe suggests prior care, motivating his decision, +0.5). Missing from middle development and closure participation (−1.0 gate penalty). The method is specific but does not recur or shape the ending, capping at 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The foster care file room is anchored early (fluorescent lights, bottom shelf, ledgers, boxes) and supplies the resources for Elias's search (files, button, drawing, archival sleeve). Setup by ~8% (+0.6), two beats (ledger examination, archival sleeve decision, +0.9), causal pressure (the room's organization and tools constrain his choices, +0.8), closure linkage (endless shelves reweighted in final image, +1.0). Spatial choreography is clean. Minor swappability (could be another archive type, −0.3) and modest micro-setting constraint (−0.3) yield 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the emancipation" is mentioned once in the opening paragraph and establishes Elias's backstory (he stayed on post-emancipation). Setup by ~5% (+0.4). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or constrain tactics in any beat; it is context rather than clock. Missing middle development and closure participation (−1.4 gate penalty). Swappable with any post-event timeframe (−0.5). Total 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To magnify small kindnesses" is signaled early ("His motivation was simple, almost foolish") and drives all three beats: choosing the ledger, tracing the button and notes, pairing the objects. Setup by ~8% (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (the motive shapes every tactic, +1.2), closure linkage (the paired artifacts magnify the chain of kindness, +1.3), cost connection (he alters the archive's order, +0.5). Friction between the motive and institutional norms is implicit but not dramatized as live conflict (−0.4), yielding 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Examined unknown" as tone is established early (sterile hum, silent stories, forgotten records) and modulates with pressure: curiosity (dust swipe), reverence (opening the ledger), warmth (final reweighting). Coherent through all turns. Setup by ~10% (+0.6), modulates across three beats (+1.2), charges the final image ("examined unknown of the file room," +1.1). Minor static stretches in the middle (caseworker notes summarized without tonal shift, −0.3) and one slip toward summary statement ("quiet, patient unfurling," −0.2) yield 6.9.</comment>
