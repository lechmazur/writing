<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to provoke an unspoken conversation") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict; the phrase "bravely conflicted" appears as a label without embodied cost. Her decision to release the letter feels inevitable from the opening rather than earned through on-page struggle—no micro-choices reveal competing values. Interiority relies on abstract phrases ("her bravely conflicted soul," "the taste of freedom") instead of specific, embodied perception under pressure. The final "smile" and "heart finally at peace" resolve tension with convenient closure rather than felt ambiguity or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first lines, satisfying the test. The piece follows a single POV and one continuous sequence, but causality remains thin: Elara's choice to upload the letter is presented as fait accompli rather than a decision forged under pressure, and the "fallout" is told rather than shown. The closure unit—Elara vanishing into the storm with her "purpose" found—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted ("the weight of it felt like wings") rather than made undeniable through concrete loss or foreclosed options. The lens wobbles between Causal (her action triggers societal change) and Accumulative (repeated images of snow, silence, echoes), never cohering at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "echoing library under snow" is vividly rendered with frost-coated shelves, blue emergency lighting, and dormant servers; sensory detail is purposeful and atmospheric. Snow recurs throughout and bookends the piece, creating textural coherence. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics—she moves through it unopposed, and the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The final image of snow blanketing fires is poetic but ornamental; the library itself becomes a symbol rather than a space that shapes outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—releasing contraband truths to provoke conversation—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or reversal. Elara faces no on-page obstacle: no alarms sound during her upload, no internal hesitation stalls her hand, and her escape is frictionless. The piece moves in a straight line from decision to execution to flight, with escalation asserted ("the council would hunt her") rather than dramatized. Agency is present in her initial choice, but that choice costs nothing visible on the page—she smiles and feels "at peace," undercutting the declared sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of "contraband truths" versus constructed lies emerges clearly and is woven through imagery (the letter, dormant networks, frozen society). However, the piece leans heavily on direct thematic statements: "Contraband truths weren't just dangerous—they were necessary," and "The blink that follows surprise had stretched into eternity." The ending moralizes rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material without stating its thesis. No genuine ambiguity complicates the moral calculus—Elara is right, the council is wrong, and the revolution is unambiguously good.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited, but the narrative voice drifts between vivid physical detail ("the paper crinkling with enough heat to melt a tiny circle in her palm sweat") and abstract, writerly declarations ("her bravely conflicted soul," "the taste of freedom"). Psychic distance is inconsistent: some lines stay close to Elara's perception, others float into omniscient summary ("Across the city, eyes widened"). Template cadence is pervasive: "The X would Y" structure recurs across a dozen sentences, flattening rhythm. Elara's perceptual signature is generic—no idiosyncratic way of noticing distinguishes her mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Severe template-cadence debt: runs of "The [noun] [verb]" and "She [verb]" structures span the entire piece without variation, triggering −0.6. Paraphrase loops abound—"contraband truths" is restated four times in slightly different phrasing; "bravely conflicted" appears twice as a label without added meaning. Mixed metaphors clutter peak beats: "the weight of it felt like wings" contradicts itself; "fires burned" under snow lacks physical logic. Stock phrases ("the taste of freedom," "a ghost in the snow," "the world waking up") replace concrete images. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same idea (e.g., the letter's impact, the council's collapse) without advancing pressure. Cumulative artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise—lone archivist releases forbidden information to topple oppressive regime—is a widely used template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Elara's choice carries no genuine friction or cost on the page, and the revolution succeeds without complication, echoing convenience plotting. The "echoing library under snow" setting and "blink that follows surprise" timeframe are poetic but do not reshape the familiar arc. Close echoes of "ghost in the machine" and "truth will set you free" recur without fresh synthesis. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material beyond its template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present in every beat but agency is limited to one executed decision (uploading the letter) with no on-page struggle or reversal; observation and flight dominate the remainder.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The letter appears in the opening (clutched), middle (placed on terminal, contents echo through system), and is referenced in the final third; it drives the central action. However, its specific contents are never dramatized—only its effect is told—and it does not return with reweighted meaning at closure. Two-beat presence with causal weight, but swappable for any "forbidden document."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Contraband truths" is named explicitly five times and frames the thematic stakes, but it operates as a label rather than shaping on-page tactics or choices. The concept is present throughout but largely ornamental—Elara does not wrestle with what truths to reveal or weigh competing harms; she simply uploads. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Bravely conflicted" appears twice as a direct label without constraining or enabling any on-page action; no scene shows contradictory impulses in simultaneous operation. The trait is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The act of uploading the letter is the story's fulcrum and directly causes the societal ripple effect; it appears in the middle beat and is referenced at closure. However, the scandal itself is told rather than shown—no on-page reaction from the council or populace dramatizes the impact. Essential to the plot but off-stage in its key consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Dormant networks" appear in the setup (background hum), are activated in the central beat (terminal flickers, system pulses), and continue "spreading the truth" in the final third. The method shapes the middle action and is referenced at closure. However, the mechanics are vague—how Elara bypasses security or ensures propagation is elided—so the method's constraints do not alter her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The library is established early (frost-coated shelves, blue lighting, dormant servers), provides the location for the central action, and is mythologized in the ending ("a shrine to her courage"). However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices—she encounters no physical obstacle or spatial friction—and the snow outside functions as atmosphere rather than tactical pressure. Present across all three gates but largely ornamental in causal terms.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"The blink that follows surprise" is named three times but never tracked as a live constraint on the page; Elara's actions unfold without urgency tied to elapsed seconds. The phrase functions as poetic motif rather than temporal pressure. Ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "provoke an unspoken conversation" is declared in the opening and reiterated at closure; it motivates the central action. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—she never hesitates, doubts, or weighs competing costs on the page. One-beat causal presence without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Dizzying quiet" is named once and evoked through "muffled world" and "silence stretching thin," cohering in the first half. However, the tone shifts to triumphant ("roar of a world waking up," "fires burned") in the final third without modulation that charges the ending image. Present but inconsistent across the arc.</comment>
