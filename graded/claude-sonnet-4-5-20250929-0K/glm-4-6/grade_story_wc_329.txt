<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The violinist's interior life is present but largely declarative ("she had forgotten why she played"), lacking the embodied contradiction that would elevate pressure. The decision to play and stand her ground reads as motivated by symbolic logic rather than a specific hierarchy of values with visible cost. Emotional states are asserted through metaphor ("grief sharpened its edges like a blade") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to drop the shell and walk away feels thematically complete but misses the micro-choices under duress that would make the stance crystallization earn its weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a Conceptual Repricing closure: the locust shell's fall plants a vine that transforms the orchard and city, reweighting the premise of beauty versus mechanism. Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, though "the gap between knowing and understanding" remains abstract until the shell appears. Causality holds (shell → playing → statues stir → city pauses → chord → statues crumble → shell planted → vine grows), but the statues' defeat feels dictated by symbolic necessity rather than earned tactical pressure. The Cost proof test is borderline: the shell's fragility and the violinist's defiance register, but the resolution delivers triumph without a visible forfeiture that alters her final state.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sky-bridge and enchanted orchard are vivid and purposeful, grounding the violinist's spatial choices and the statues' approach. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through metaphor ("towers of rust and glass," "brittle edges stark against weathered wood"), though the orchard's mechanics—how she moves "like smoke"—remain gestural rather than tactile. The locust shell functions as micro-setting, constraining her choice to play and charging the final image when planted. The Q3 9+ gate is narrowly missed: the shell and bridge shape key turns, but the orchard's constraint is more atmospheric than action-altering during the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and coheres through the playing sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the statues reach the bridge, forcing the violinist to play faster rather than flee, but the escalation lacks a visible trade-off; her triumph costs her nothing on the page. The city's pause and the flower's emergence read as symbolic rewards rather than complications that test her commitment. The final chord resolves conflict through aesthetic force alone, missing the calculus of competing goods or unavoidable harms that would charge the ending with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—beauty reawakening a mechanical world—emerges through the violin, shell, and vine imagery, and the ending offers a non-literal answer via the planted shell. However, the locust shell's promise and the vine's bloom lean toward allegory with transparent stand-ins (shell = escape/hope, vine = renewal) rather than irreducible particulars. The gap between knowing and understanding is invoked repeatedly but remains a prompt-like abstraction rather than a dramatized friction. The final image of the shell becoming a vine is purposeful but borders on overt symbolism, and the violinist's laugh and light steps ("resonantly soft, a harbinger of wonders yet to come") edge into thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the violinist, and perceptual signature is present in the musical filter ("notes emerged not as melody but as challenge"). Register drifts into elevated lyricism ("the afterlife of her song," "a harbinger of wonders yet to come") that sits uneasily with the established voice under peak pressure. The phrase "resonantly soft" recurs as a motif but also as a textual tic (three uses in close proximity), flattening rhythmic variation. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though one moment—"The city's hum had changed, softer now, resonantly soft like the shell's promise"—blurs whether the observation is hers or authorial summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff ("her shadow trailing like a melody," "flowers opening like questions answered"), triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "She had uprooted their stillness" and "She had uprooted silence and planted symphony" restate the same core idea. Template cadence runs in the final third ("The orchard bloomed. The statues slept now… The city's hum had changed… The violinist's steps were light…"), reducing propulsion. The phrase "resonantly soft" appears four times, becoming a synonym loop rather than a purposeful refrain. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disqualifying 9+ globally and applying the −1.7 penalty here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The sky-bridge violinist and enchanted orchard offer a fresh synthesis of music-as-weapon and animate-statue tropes, and the locust shell as talisman adds specificity. However, the emotional arc—isolated artist rediscovers purpose and liberates the oppressed—follows a recognizable template without transforming it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. The ending's triumph (statues crumble, city ceases, vine blooms, world listens) delivers symmetric satisfaction with no ambiguity or durable cost. The transformation test is marginal: swap the violinist for another art-worker and the shell for another fragile token, and the plot holds with minimal revision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sky-bridge violinist is seeded in the title and opening line, makes the central choice to play (middle beat), and her final action—dropping the shell—directly causes the vine's growth (closure). She drives three distinct beats and her decisions alter tactics (playing faster when statues approach) and outcomes. The element is indispensable to the story's logic and present across setup, development, and payoff, qualifying for the 7.0+ range. A slight deduction for swappability: the occupation could be another artist (painter, dancer) with moderate edits to the mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The locust shell appears early (first third), is handled in two beats (pressed to collarbone while playing, dropped at the end), and its fall/planting drives the closure image (vine shoots up). It carries specific cost (fragility as talisman) and irreplaceability (its winged-escape memory and brittle form matter). All three gates are met, and it shapes the ending. A small deduction for the middle beat being more symbolic (glowing on her skin) than causally active; its primary causal work is at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Breaking free" is stated as the shell's promise ("a promise to break free") and echoed at closure ("She had broken free, and in doing so, freed the world too"), but it functions as thematic narration rather than a constraint that shapes on-page choices. The violinist's decision to play is motivated more by reawakening beauty than by her own imprisonment or liberation. The concept is present and logically consistent but could be replaced with another thematic claim (e.g., "to reclaim voice") without structural impact, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" is used four times as a descriptor (her music, the city's hum, her laugh, the shell's promise) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It reads as a label applied to moments rather than a trait that creates friction or advantage. The violinist's music is also described as "sharp enough to splinter steel," contradicting the softness without dramatizing the tension between the two qualities. The attribute is ornamental, meeting the setup gate (early mention) but failing development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Uproot" appears twice: "She had uprooted their stillness" (middle) and "She had uprooted silence and planted symphony" (closure). The first usage describes the statues' response to her music, a key turn; the second is metaphorical summary. The action is present in two beats and shapes the statues' defeat, but the second use is paraphrase rather than a new causal moment. Swappability is moderate: "shatter" or "break" could replace it with minor tonal loss, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heart-rhythm signaling is introduced in the orchard ("she had pressed her palm to a statue's chest, signaling through heart rhythms"), and the statue nods in response—a setup beat. The violinist's heart "hammered a new rhythm" later, but this is interior metaphor, not the signaling method in use. The method does not recur in the middle conflict (playing the violin, not signaling, drives the statues' approach) and is absent from closure. It appears functional in one beat but is not developed or paid off, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band with a late-appearance deduction for weak closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard is seeded early (first third), provides the shell and the statues, and the vine's growth at closure transforms it into a site of renewal. The orchard's policing by living statues creates pressure in backstory (she moves "like smoke"), but during the on-page action the statues leave the orchard to reach the bridge, so the setting does not directly constrain her climactic choice. All three gates are met, and the orchard supplies the shell (essential resource) and anchors the ending image, but its middle role is weaker, capping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"The gap between knowing and understanding" is invoked three times (opening, middle reflection, closure summary) but functions as thematic abstraction rather than a timeframe that tightens decisions. The story does not track a live clock or deadline; the violinist's playing and the statues' approach unfold without temporal pressure. The phrase is present and thematically coherent but does not alter tactics or create urgency, placing it in the ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "reawaken beauty in a mechanical world" is stated explicitly ("how to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world?") and dramatized through the choice to play despite the statues' threat. It drives the central conflict and the ending (city ceases its mechanisms, flower unfurls, vine blooms). However, the motivation is announced rather than discovered through friction, and the violinist's internal conflict between fear and purpose is told more than shown in contradictory action. Setup and closure gates are met; middle development is present but not deeply embodied, placing the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Tarnished wonder" is evoked through imagery (rust, glass, worn strings, mechanical hum) and modulates slightly as the city pauses and a flower unfurls. The tone is coherent across beats but leans static—melancholic beauty without sharp tonal shifts under peak pressure (the statues' approach and the chord's climax maintain the same register). The final image (vine, bloom, violinist's light steps) extends the tone rather than recharging it with new cost or irony. The tone is purposeful and consistent but does not pivot to charge the closure, placing it in the mid-5s.</comment>
