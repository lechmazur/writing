<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior life is vivid and philosophically anchored, with embodied emotion in his carving and sensory engagement with the greenhouse. However, his search for "the shape of collective grief" remains abstract—no on-page micro-choice tests competing impulses or costs until the final carving decision, which arrives without dramatic friction. The spectral mentorship functions more as atmospheric permission than as a source of internal contradiction or stakes. Grandfather's "presence measured in the rustle of leaves" reads poetic but does not dramatize a choice between competing values or impose visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: layered images of butterflies, ribbon, and stone deepen across the evening until the final carving gesture reweights the opening meditation on grief. Orientation anchors (Elias, greenhouse, dusk, carving work) arrive promptly. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the carved migration path and unrolled ribbon poem crystallize his understanding—but the cost is conceptual and asserted ("a connection, a fierce and quiet understanding") rather than felt or forfeited on the page. No visible price or foreclosed path; the ending tells us he has found what he sought without dramatizing what he gave up or left behind.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting is vivid and purposeful: humid air, streaked glass, dying butterflies, and new seedlings create a charged paradox that mirrors the thematic meditation on grief and migration. The weathered workbench and gravel path are handled concretely. The carved granite and the ribbon's ink-bleed anchor tactile engagement. Micro-setting qualifies: the stone, chisel, and ribbon constrain Elias's final action and charge the closing image with the migration path motif, lifting the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure remains meditative rather than escalating through choice or opposition. The carving of the migration path in the final third offers one meaningful deepening, consistent with Accumulative design. Yet no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized; Elias encounters no friction between competing goods or unavoidable harms. The cost at closure is conceptual and asserted, not felt on the page, capping the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: butterflies, ribbon poems, granite, and the spectral presence weave grief-as-migration without overt thesis. The final image—carved path and unrolled ribbon—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question. However, the last two paragraphs edge toward thematic summary ("Grief...isn't a static monument but a current") and the closing line's "more beautiful question" tilts into gentle philosophizing rather than letting the image speak alone. Strong integration of motif and setting keeps the score in the 7s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and intimate, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices stone grooves, ink bleed, the angle of dying light. Diction is elevated and lyrical but consistent throughout, voice-motivated by his reflective occupation. No head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately from meditative opening to focused carving work. Minor register drift: "spectral mentorship" and "thundering calm" read slightly ornamental, but they remain within the established poetic idiom and do not fracture clarity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied; no template cadence or synonym loops. Information density is solid, with most sentences layering image and interiority. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the final third without clear pattern-teaching, diluting urgency: "thundering calm," "spectral wings," "cathedral of life and death," "fierce and quiet understanding." The closing paragraphs lean toward scaffold ("he felt the weight...settle not as a burden, but as a connection") and thematic summary that dilutes propulsion. Apply −0.4 for density and register drift in peak beats, landing in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, butterfly migration, spectral mentorship, and woven ribbon poems is specific and committed. The frame avoids cliché through occupational and sensory detail. However, the core emotional arc—artist seeking meaning through craft, guided by a deceased mentor—follows a familiar template without a sharp turn or non-obvious moral calculus. The spectral presence functions as permission rather than complication. The ending's "more beautiful question" phrase and the symmetry of discovery without friction keep originality in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias (thoughtful gravestone carver) is present throughout, and his occupation frames every beat. His choices—moving to the workbench, unrolling the ribbon, carving the migration path—drive the narrative arc. The final carving decision is causally linked to his meditation on collective grief and the spectral mentorship. However, the choices are meditative and unopposed; no competing impulse or visible cost tests his commitment. The character shapes the ending but without friction, placing the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The woven ribbon roll appears in three beats: coiled on the workbench, unrolled to reveal the poem, and left unrolled at the end as "a new offering." Its meaning shifts from family custom to line of connection to poetic thread. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost; Elias reads it and leaves it without tension. The reprise at closure ("shimmering faintly in the dark") reweights it thematically but does not drive the final action. Mid-5s for purposeful recurrence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship is signaled early ("weeks ago") and returns at midpoint and in the final third. It shapes Elias's perception—"a way of seeing"—and licenses his shift from carving names to carving the migration path. However, the ghost never opposes, complicates, or imposes cost; it "recedes" without friction. The concept enriches theme and tone but does not narrow options or dramatize a choice between competing directives. Mid-5s for thematic presence without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" appears twice: in "movements fiercely meditative" and "his focus absolute, the thundering calm...a shield." The trait colors his carving work and final concentration, but it does not constrain or enable a specific choice with visible cost. It remains a descriptive label rather than a source of tradeoff—no moment where meditative slowness competes with urgency or fierce intensity risks error. Functional but replaceable, trending low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Retrace" appears three times: retracing grooves with chisel, retracing steps on the gravel path, retracing the carved path with his fingertip. Each instance advances the accumulative pattern and charges the final image with the motif of revisiting and continuity. The fingertrip retrace in the penultimate beat crystallizes his discovery. However, the action itself does not force a reversal or narrow options; it deepens texture rather than changing tactics. Strong reprise and thematic charge lift it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The family custom of trading poems at dinner is mentioned once in exposition ("his family's custom") and returns only in the final paragraph ("the poem he would trade at the following night's dinner"). It frames the ribbon's presence but does not shape any on-page choice or alter tactics. The mechanics are told, not used. Late final reprise without middle development caps at ~4.6; swappability and summary-only use lower it further into low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse is vividly rendered and omnipresent: streaked glass, humid air, monarch wings, seedlings, dim glow. It supplies the tactile and symbolic resources (butterflies, damp ribbon, "dying light") that shape Elias's meditation and final carving. The setting constrains his evening ritual and charges the closure image as "a cathedral of life and death." The greenhouse participates in setup, middle beats, and ending, with specificity and causal relevance, placing it solidly in the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across the butterfly migration" bookends the piece (opening and final paragraph) but functions as seasonal backdrop rather than a tightening timeframe. No tactical pressure arises from the migration's duration or endpoint; Elias "had come here each evening" in an untracked span. The timeframe enriches atmosphere and motif but does not constrain decisions or alter moves. Present in setup and closure but vague and non-urgent, capping in low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the shape of collective grief" is stated explicitly early and drives every beat: his carving work, the poem's theme of letting go, the spectral mentorship, the final migration-path carving. However, it is told and contemplated rather than dramatized through competing wants or visible friction. No on-page moment shows Elias torn between this search and another value, and the ending asserts discovery without cost. Strong setup and closure linkage but low dramatization, landing in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" appears three times, anchoring tone throughout: "seeking a thundering calm," "the thundering calm of the greenhouse a shield," and implicitly in "profound quiet" and "fierce and quiet understanding." The oxymoron coheres across pressure levels and charges the final image with paradox. However, the tone remains static—no modulation under rising stakes or shift at closure. Consistent presence and thematic charge without dynamic range place it in mid-6s.</comment>
