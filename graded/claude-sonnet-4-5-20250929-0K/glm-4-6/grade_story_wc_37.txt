<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation to rekindle the realm through song is established but remains abstract; his scattered memories are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The protagonist's final choice to release the light feels inevitable from the opening rather than earned through visible internal conflict. Interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("his scattered memories sharpening into focus") without embodied sensation or character-particular thought patterns. The mention of prior failure adds stakes but is summarized in a subordinate clause rather than shown as a живой wound that complicates present action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered imagery (mica window, phosphorescent trees, glowing blooms) toward a final reconfiguration where light spills into the streets and the townsfolk begin to sing. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the mirror world shifts from endless night toward dawn, songs return), but cost remains conceptual and implied rather than viscerally felt on the page—the keeper's chest aches and his role feels lighter, yet no concrete path is foreclosed. Orientation anchors who and where by the second sentence, though "mirror world" and "alchemical orchard" remain high-concept placeholders. One meaningful deepening occurs when the keeper's voice joins the lute and the music breaches the greenhouse walls, narrowing from solitary attempt to communal awakening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mica window and greenhouse setting anchor the space and recur with purpose: the keeper traces the warped glass, presses his palms to it, and light spills through at closure, charging the final image. Sensory detail leans heavily on visual glow (phosphorescent trees, glowing blooms, shimmering facets) without tactile or auditory texture during peak beats. The "alchemical orchard" and "mirror world" remain high-concept labels; no occupational or physical constraints (soil, temperature, tool maintenance) pressure the keeper's choices. Spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rekindling the dying realm through forgotten songs—is signaled in the opening and sustained throughout. Escalation occurs when the keeper moves from tracing glass to playing the lute to singing aloud, each step releasing more light, but the progression feels additive rather than a narrowing of options or a forced trade-off. The mention of a prior failure that shattered like glass adds stakes retroactively but is told in summary; no on-page reversal tests the keeper's commitment or reveals a visible cost. The townsfolk's awakening arrives as a result of the keeper's persistence rather than a choice with foreclosed alternatives.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory, fragmentation, and restoration emerges through imagery (scattered memories becoming a constellation, frayed threads rewoven) but relies on overt statements in the final paragraph: "even the most scattered memories could be woven back together," "bound by the release of the songs." The core question—whether forgotten songs can restore a community—receives a yes without complication or ambiguity. The mica window and glowing blooms offer resonant images early and late, yet their recurrence feels more decorative than causally or conceptually reweighted at closure. The keeper's self-recognition ("saw himself—not fragmented, but whole") is stated rather than implied through image or action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on the keeper throughout; no head-hopping. Diction frequently elevates into poetic register ("his purpose fulfilled," "constellation in the sky," "the woven dawns would grow") that reads more authorial than character-particular, especially under the pressure of rekindling a realm. Free indirect style is attempted but inconsistent: "The mirror world would never be the same, and neither would he" reads like thesis rather than the keeper's lived perception. Sentence stems recur: "The keeper's [body part] [verbed]" appears six times, flattening rhythmic variation. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The keeper rose…The keeper's fingers…The keeper's breath…The keeper's hands…The keeper's chest…The keeper smiled…The keeper lay back" creates a drumbeat of identical openings across successive paragraphs. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff: "notes shattering like glass," "seams of gold stitching their fractured reality," "woven dawns," "threads of light," "constellation in the sky"—mixed metaphors (weaving, stitching, threads, glass, constellations) accumulate without coherent vehicle. The final two paragraphs summarize thematic resolution rather than dramatizing it, diluting closure momentum. "The lute's final note hung in the air, and the keeper knew this was only the beginning" is scaffolding that tells what the scene should have shown. Apply patterned-artifact penalty (−0.9) and figurative muddle (−0.5) for a total Q7 deduction of approximately −1.4 from a mid-6 baseline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—a keeper restoring a darkened realm through forgotten songs—fits familiar fantasy-recuperation templates without fresh synthesis. The "mirror world," "alchemical orchard," and "mica window" are high-concept labels that gesture toward uniqueness but remain vague in mechanics and consequence. The emotional arc (solitary struggle → communal awakening → self-recognition) follows a predictable path. The keeper's scattered memories and prior failure are mentioned but not transformed into specific, lived detail that would distinguish this iteration from stock myth. Risk-taking is minimal; the piece retreats into abstraction and poetic summary at closure rather than committing to a bold image or renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The scattered memory keeper is present throughout and makes two key choices: to play the lute and to sing aloud, each escalating the light's release. His scattered memories are mentioned repeatedly but function more as trait labels than constraints that complicate tactics. The character's decision at closure (to press his palms to the mica window and release the light) is set up by prior beats and alters the townsfolk's state, though the choice itself feels inevitable rather than a crossroads with visible cost. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.8), but swappability (another keeper/mage archetype could serve similarly, −0.5) and summary-only interiority for the prior failure (−0.5) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mica window is handled in three beats: the keeper brushes dust from it (opening), traces the warped glass (paragraph 3), and presses his palms to it to release light (closure). The window's surface "flecked with light that wasn't his own" and its final state as "a map of the rekindled realm" add specificity and reweighting. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.0), but the window does not constrain a choice or impose cost—it functions as a portal without resistance or trade-off (−0.8). The object is essential to the story's spatial logic but not indispensable to the character's dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Woven dawns appear as a metaphor in the keeper's song ("suns that never set and fields that bloom in perpetual twilight") and the narrative description ("seams of gold stitching their fractured reality," "the woven dawns would grow"). The concept shapes the thematic texture but does not create a mechanical constraint or tactical choice on the page—the keeper does not wrestle with how to weave, what materials to use, or what cost weaving imposes. Late first clear invocation (second half, −0.3), ornamental use (−0.7), swappability (restoration/rekindling could replace it, −0.6). The phrase recurs but remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The attribute "knits communities together" is stated in the opening ("only he could weave them back together") and echoed at closure ("the communities they knitted together would thrive"), but it operates as a goal rather than a trait that constrains or enables a specific action with visible cost. The keeper's methods (playing the lute, singing) do not dramatize the knitting process—threads and stitches are metaphors without on-page mechanics. Early signal (+0.4), closure mention (+0.4), but label-only trait (−0.6), summary-only impact (−0.5). The attribute describes the keeper's purpose without altering his available moves.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Swaddle appears once: "The keeper's hands trembled as he swaddled the light, cupping it like a fragile child, the warmth seeping into his cold fingers." The action is handled on the page with embodied detail (trembling hands, warmth seeping) and leads directly to pressing the light through the mica window, which triggers the townsfolk's awakening. Late first appearance (past midpoint, −0.4), one beat only (+0.4), closure linkage (+0.9), but swappability is high—the keeper could gather, cradle, or channel the light with similar effect (−0.8). The verb's specificity (swaddle as nurturing care) adds texture without imposing unique cost or mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Through forgotten songs is signaled early ("to rekindle a dying realm through forgotten songs," paragraph 1) and drives the keeper's method across multiple beats: he salvages songs from forgotten ages, plucks the lute carved with hollowed-out tunes, and sings aloud, each step releasing light and stirring the townsfolk. The mechanics matter—songs as both memory and catalyst—and the keeper's prior failure ("the notes shattering like glass") adds stakes. Early signal (+0.7), three beats (salvage, play, sing; +1.4), closure linkage (the townsfolk begin to sing, +1.0), but the songs' forgotten quality is told rather than dramatized (−0.5), and the lyric content ("suns that never set") remains generic (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night is the story's sole location, anchored in the opening and sustained throughout. The setting supplies resources (phosphorescent trees, glowing blooms, heartwood lute) and the mica window serves as the threshold through which light spills to the townsfolk. The endless night creates a tonal constraint (no natural light source) and the greenhouse walls pulse with the music, responding to the keeper's efforts. Early signal (+0.8), present across all beats (+1.4), closure linkage (light breaches the walls, +1.2), specificity (alchemical glow, mica, heartwood, +0.6), but the setting does not impose a tactical cost or force a choice—the keeper's success is unimpeded by environmental resistance (−0.9).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The mirror world is mentioned in the opening and closing but functions more as a high-concept label than a timeframe with pressure. The "endless night" establishes atmosphere but does not create a ticking clock or urgency that alters the keeper's tactics—he proceeds at a deliberate pace without time-driven escalation. The phrase "this time" (versus the prior failure) hints at iterative attempts but does not dramatize duration or deadline. Early mention (+0.3), closure reprise (+0.3), but ornamental use (−0.7), no tactical pressure from time (−0.6), swappability (any dying realm label could serve, −0.5).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>To rekindle a dying realm is stated as the keeper's purpose in the opening ("remembered his purpose: to rekindle a dying realm through forgotten songs") and sustained throughout as the dominant stake. The keeper's actions (playing, singing, releasing light) pursue this goal, and the townsfolk's awakening at closure demonstrates partial success. Early signal (+0.7), drives multiple beats (+1.2), closure linkage (+1.0), but the motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory wants or visible friction—the keeper proceeds with resolution rather than doubt (−0.8). The prior failure is mentioned but not shown as a живой cost that complicates present choices (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Bound release operates as a tonal paradox (constraint and liberation) that surfaces in images: the keeper is burdened by his role yet feels "bittersweet release" when the light spills, and he is "bound by the release of the songs he'd carried for so long." The tone modulates from muted opening ("humming with muted vitality") to charged closure ("the townsfolk began to sing"), supporting the accumulative build. Early signal in the premise (+0.5), closure linkage (final image of release, +0.8), but the tone is more asserted than embodied—diction remains elevated and poetic throughout without rhythmic shift under pressure (−0.6), and the final paragraphs summarize the paradox rather than dramatizing it (−0.4).</comment>
