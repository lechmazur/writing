<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias shows consistent motivation (discovering the shape of intentions), but his interior life remains thin—label-only traits ("blithe nature") and diagnostic phrasing ("stubborn resistance," "seeking forgiveness") replace embodied contradiction. The core action (untangling Foster's thread) feels enacted without genuine internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses a path. Emotional progression is tidy rather than irrational; Elias completes his task with "familiar warmth" but no struggle that tests commitment or reveals hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who, where, when by line 3). The piece attempts Causal structure: Elias notices frayed threads → isolates Foster's knot → decodes the promise → releases the echo. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Foster's thread "reconstitutes itself" without Elias forfeiting anything or facing a consequence that narrows future options. The ending offers resolution without a decisive change or visible price, weakening the closure unit required for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, spiral staircase, and constellated work table supply vivid spatial grounding. Sensory detail is selective ("velveteen gloom," "moonlight filtering") and integrated into action. However, the environment remains decorative—no tool, spatial constraint, or recurring object meaningfully alters Elias's choice at closure. The silo provides atmosphere but does not charge the final image or constrain tactics, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear (prevent echo-systems from deteriorating), and one tightening occurs when Elias isolates Foster's thread. Yet escalation is muted—no reversals force trade-offs, and the resolution (thread reconstitutes) arrives without visible cost or agency that forecloses a path. Coincidence does not resolve, but the protagonist's action feels frictionless, lacking the pressure or price that would push this into stronger bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (helping souls find resolution through understanding their intentions) emerges organically from plot. The tapestry's frayed border functions as a purposeful metaphor, and the ending image (Foster's blue thread seamless again) reweights prior material without a stated moral. However, thematic depth is limited by the tidy resolution—no ambiguity or counter-reading lingers, and the final reflection ("the shape of their intentions finally made clear") borders on thematic echo. Strong execution within its scope, but lacks the complexity or earned wisdom for higher bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice is stable, third-person limited with consistent distance and perceptual filter (Elias's lens throughout). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("metaphysical landscape," "temporal gradients") that clashes with the humble-gardener frame, though not severely. No dialogue to assess. The prose carries a distinct texture, but lacks the perceptual signature or rhythmic control under pressure that would elevate it—filter verbs ("noted with concern," "felt the familiar warmth") dull immediacy at key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally clean, but several text artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("the time has come" / "if he didn't act quickly"), template cadence in adjacent lines ("The silo opened… shelves ran… At the center stood"), and figurative overload in non-peak beats ("velveteen gloom that clung to the circular walls like memory itself"). Momentum sags mid-piece with expository interiority that recaps rather than advances. The closure beat is clear, preventing deeper penalty, but artifacts touch multiple paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise (spectral mediator who untangles ghost-threads in a tapestry) offers genre-typical material without transformation—cemetery caretaker with secret nocturnal work is a familiar frame. Specific details (cobalt silo, sovereign case, constellation table) add texture but do not synthesize into a non-obvious angle. The emotional arc (helping a spirit find forgiveness) follows a predictable path with no fresh inflection or risky choice that heightens stakes. Competent execution of known tropes, but lacks the specificity or bold risk that would distinguish it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes the decision to untangle Foster's thread, but his "blithe" nature remains ornamental—it does not constrain or enable key choices with visible cost. His cheerfulness is mentioned in the opening and closing but never tested under pressure or used to shape tactics. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but swappable with "dedicated" or "patient" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sovereign case appears in three beats: introduced at the pedestal, opened to reveal the tapestry, and locked away at the end. It frames the central action and returns with mild reweighting (closure of the night's work). However, it is functionally a container—its "antique" and "silver worn smooth" properties do not constrain choice or alter tactics. Present in all three gates and causally involved, but the object itself is replaceable with any secure storage without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" shapes the dominant stake (prevent echo-systems from deteriorating) and defines Elias's work throughout. The concept is present in setup ("echoes of the recently departed"), middle (Foster's stubborn echo), and closure (echo finally understanding release). However, the "uncharted" quality is asserted more than dramatized—Elias decodes Foster's knot without encountering unknown terrain or surprising mechanics. Functional and present, but the concept's unique promise (uncharted territory) is underexplored.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" describes the shelves once in the opening ("each tenderly organized with instruments and tomes"). It signals Elias's care but does not constrain or enable any on-page action. No visible cost tied to this trait, no middle beat involvement, and no closure linkage. Label-only mention that could be replaced with "meticulously" or "carefully" without affecting plot or character choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Untangle" drives the central action across multiple beats: Elias must untangle frayed threads (setup), isolates and untangles Foster's knot (middle), and completes the untangling to reconstitute the thread (closure). The action is causally essential—removing it would collapse the plot. The method (tweezers, lens, decoding) is tied to this verb throughout. Strong integration, though the ease of execution (no failed attempts or mid-action reversals) prevents a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method (decoding frayed threads in the tapestry's border) is introduced early ("threads unraveling like temporal snags") and drives the middle action (Elias isolates and decodes Foster's thread by recognizing its snag on a golden promise-filament). Present in all three gates and causally necessary—the story hinges on this exact mechanism. However, the mechanics are stated more than tested; no alternative method is considered, and the decoding succeeds on first attempt without friction, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is introduced early (gate, spiral staircase, circular chamber) and houses the entire action. It provides vivid spatial grounding and returns in the closure image ("velveteen gloom of the silo seemed less oppressive"). However, the setting does not constrain choice—Elias's work could occur in any private, enclosed space without altering tactics or outcome. Atmospheric and present, but the silo's unique properties (cobalt, under stars) do not pressure decisions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the chess clock runs down each evening") is mentioned twice: opening and in Elias's reflection mid-story. It signals routine and establishes the nocturnal window but does not tighten decisions—no live clock pressures Elias, and dawn arrives as a framing device rather than a deadline that alters tactics. Present in setup and thematically reprised, but the "chess clock" metaphor remains ornamental. Missing middle gate (no ticking urgency) and weak closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (to discover the shape of intentions) is stated explicitly ("His motivation had always been the same") and drives his choice to untangle Foster's thread. Present in all three gates and causally linked to the action. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no moment where Elias's desire conflicts with cost or faces friction. The closure image ("the shape of their intentions finally made clear") restates the motivation but does not test or deepen it with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" appears three times: opening descent, mid-story description, and closure reflection ("seemed less oppressive now"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly at the end (from oppressive to softer), charging the final image with mild relief. However, the tone remains static through the middle action—no tonal escalation during the untangling beat, and the gloom functions more as atmospheric label than pressure that shapes Elias's choices. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band, but lacks dynamic range.</comment>
