<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to document living houses is told rather than tested on-page. The orris-root encounter triggers immediate understanding without contradiction or struggle; no micro-choice forecloses a live option. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("auditory gold," "cosmic pressure") and diagnostic self-awareness that flattens rather than embodies experience under pressure. The final "knowing" reads as declarative summary rather than earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural inferred from pattern-building (house breathing, objects migrating, orris root). Orientation anchors arrive late (~200 words before "Elias" names the POV, unclear whether Tuesday opening is the cottage or Elm Street). Closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing via the final image of houses "watchful" and "awake," but cost is asserted rather than legible—no choice, renunciation, or visible forfeiture reweights prior material on the page. The displacement ritual (teacup on roof, latch in garden, shard in attic) occurs without resistance or consequence that alters Elias's stance or options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Bayside cottage, sun porch, attic, and garden are named but remain interchangeable backdrops; spatial choreography (Elias crouching, climbing to roof, moving between rooms) is gestured at without embodied detail or constraint. The orris root's "violet fingerprint scent" and "auditory gold" hush are vivid but do not narrow a choice. Salt air and spring blossoms function as atmospheric flourish rather than pressure on the displacement ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving houses are alive—is told in exposition rather than tested by opposition or cost. The displacement ritual proceeds without friction; no reversal or tightening narrows options. Elias's "knowing what must be done" skips the decision beat entirely, and the house's "groaning with pleasure" confirms success without any visible trade-off or price paid. Pressure is declared ("feverish vitality," "cosmic pressure") but never escalates through agency or consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—consciousness of place, sanctification through displacement—is stated explicitly in the penultimate paragraph rather than emergent from image and choice. The orris root "shard of hush" and migrating teacup are introduced as symbolic conveniences without prior grounding. Final reflection ("most profound truths… existed only in liminal moments") delivers a thesis statement in place of resonant image. No non-obvious synthesis or earned ambiguity reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable but narration drifts into elevated register ("inadvertently profound," "displaced objects—the doctrine," "hushed blaze") incongruent with embodied observation. Perceptual signature ("creeping normality noticer") is labeled rather than demonstrated through selective attention. Syntax varies, but figurative density ("drowsy transformation," "luminescent dreaming," "vibrated through his bones like auditory gold") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff, particularly in the orris-touch beat. No dialogue on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "compressed magnitude of quiet that vibrated through his bones like auditory gold," "hushed blaze—a quiet intensity," "streetlights… drowsy transformation… silent dreamers" stack metaphor without coherence. Paraphrase loops: "houses… hum with an inner life while others merely exist as empty shells" restated as "some houses are simply more awake than others." Template cadence in displacement sequence: "The teacup, he positioned… A window latch he moved… Finally, he placed…" Scaffolding ("as he would later call it," "of course") and stock phrases ("liminal moments") dull momentum. Artifacts touch closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—sentient houses awakened by object displacement—lacks grounding in prior causality or world rules; the doctrine appears when needed. "Creeping normality noticer" and "doctrine that moving something significant to where it doesn't belong could awaken… essence of place" read as template mysticism without specific transformation. The orris root's sudden appearance and immediate cosmic effect substitute novelty for earned logic. No risk-taking heightens stakes; the ritual succeeds without complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character present throughout but observation dominates; Elias's sole choice—to perform the displacement ritual—occurs off-page ("knew what must be done") and faces no friction or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orris root appears mid-story (~50%), triggers the hush effect in one beat, and is moved to the attic in the displacement ritual. Two touches across beats but causal pressure is thin; the shard could swap with any mystical catalyst. No closure participation beyond spatial relocation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Concept labeled ("shard of hush") but remains abstract metaphor. The "compressed magnitude of quiet" effect is told rather than shown altering Elias's options or tactics. No visible cost or constraint tied to hush mechanics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" appears once as a descriptor for the orris shard's effect; no on-page action demonstrates the trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Sanctification ritual (displacement of teacup, latch, shard) occurs in final third and succeeds without complication. The action is the story's only decisive move but does not grow from prior conflict; it could be replaced with another mystical gesture. No visible consequence alters Elias's stance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Method signaled late (~70%) and executed in final beats. Displacement mechanics (moving objects "to where they don't belong") are stated as doctrine but never tested or complicated; the house simply responds with pleasure. Mid-band for execution without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Bay setting mentioned frequently (quiet bay, bayside cottage, salt air, spring blossoms) but functions as atmospheric backdrop. No spatial feature constrains the displacement ritual or supplies a resource that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Timeframe "while the streetlights daydream" recurs as poetic motif but imposes no urgency or deadline. Twilight/night passage is vague; no ticking clock shapes Elias's choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Motivation stated in exposition ("why some houses seem to hum") and closing reflection but never dramatized as a conflicted choice with cost. Elias's desire faces no competing want, fear, or friction on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Tone attempts "hushed blaze" (quiet intensity) through elevated diction and mystical atmosphere. Consistent across beats but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image; remains static lyric register rather than a dynamic tonal arc.</comment>
