<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The guardian's motivations are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Anna's grief is embodied through tears and carrying unsent letters, but her interior remains thin—we never see her struggle with conflicting wants. The guardian's "spiralingly calm quality" and "silent empathy" are labels that never constrain a choice or generate visible cost. Backstory about Anna's father exceeds functional need without altering present stakes until the pattern reveal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the guardian arranges shutters across two weeks, Anna approaches, the pattern resolves to encode her father's understanding. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Anna perceives encoded meanings, gains understanding), but the cost is asserted rather than shown—she cries and lingers, yet no present option is foreclosed and no future path visibly narrows. The dental mirror's verification role and the shutter mechanics are told in summary rather than dramatized as choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cobalt dock, wet boards, canal district, and shutters along the east bank provide spatial grounding. The dental mirror constrains one micro-choice (verifying angles), lifting the score slightly. Sensory detail leans visual ("cobalt," "scattered memories," "gleaming shapes") with minimal tactile or auditory texture. The shutters appear in multiple beats but their physical mechanics remain vague—how many, exact placement, how light travels through slats—limiting the environment's pressure on choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Anna seeks help to "see" and resolve grief. Pressure remains static—she approaches, watches, perceives, cries—but no reversal or tightening narrows her options. The guardian's arrangement is complete before she arrives, rendering her passive recipient rather than agent. The pattern reveal delivers information but does not force a trade-off or foreclose a path with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift is required; here the ending repeats the opening's meditative register without reweighting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—silent empathy, teaching darkness the value of stars—is directly stated multiple times ("I can teach darkness the value of stars," "to teach darkness how to appreciate stars"), violating emergence. The shutter-pattern-as-healing motif recurs but remains abstract; we never learn what specific "geometric harmonies" revealed or how they answered Anna's unresolved grief. The final paragraph moralizes ("the most meaningful healing happens without words") rather than trusting image. Conceptual Repricing is attempted but the conceptual cost is not legible—Anna's tears are the only marker, and no present choice or future stance is reweighted on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable on the guardian with brief Anna-focalized moments that remain externally observed. The guardian's perceptual signature—watching, preparing, adjusting—is consistent but generic. Diction elevates into poetic register ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "luminous truth") that reads more authorial than character-specific. The single line of dialogue ("They say you can help people see") and the guardian's non-response maintain voice, but interior access remains thin and the narration frequently tells ("His motivation remained undimmed") rather than showing through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "silent empathy" appears three times, "teach darkness the value of stars" four times verbatim, "spiralingly calm" twice without variation. Template cadence runs: "His [noun] [verb]" opens multiple consecutive sentences. The phrase "within the edge of a half-spoken secret" is poetic but unclear—what secret, whose, and how does it reverberate? Stock metaphors stack without coherence: "puddles held the sky like scattered memories," "tears tracing paths... like miniature tributaries." Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("seemed to hover," "appeared to," "felt different"). Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.0 cumulative in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The guardian-as-healer-through-art premise is familiar; the dental-mirror twist adds a tool but not fresh causality. Shutter arrangements that "only certain eyes could properly interpret" remain unexplained, reducing ingenuity to vague magic. The story's emotional arc—grieving daughter finds closure through artful intervention—follows a well-worn template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The cobalt dock and canal setting provide color but no unique constraint on choice. Risk-averse middle: the guardian succeeds without friction, Anna receives without cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Guardian is present throughout, but his "choices" are complete before Anna arrives—he watches, adjusts shutters, steps back. No on-page decision alters tactics or creates a turn. Observation without agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dental mirror appears in three beats: raised to catch light (paragraph 1), used to verify shutter angles (paragraphs 2, 10), intermittently catches reflections (paragraph 11), returns to pocket (final paragraph). Functional use across beats, but the mirror's specific properties (why dental, why mirrored surface for this task) never constrain a choice or charge the closure. Setup and development present; closure participation is cameo (returned to pocket) rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Silent empathy" is named and described but never tested as a tactic under pressure. The guardian's silence is a trait, not a stake-shaping constraint—he could speak and the plot would proceed unchanged. Concept echoes as theme without altering options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" appears twice as label. No on-page action shows this quality enabling or constraining a choice. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Weave" appears in motivation ("weave these patterns," "weaving light into understanding") and action. The shutter arrangement is the story's central mechanism, present across multiple beats and shaping the closure image. However, the weaving itself is summarized rather than dramatized—we never see the guardian make a difficult choice about pattern placement. Present in setup, development, and closure; causal role is functional but the specifics are told.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Shutter-pattern method is signaled early (paragraph 2: "creating patterns with shutters"), developed in middle (guardian adjusts shutters with precision), and delivers closure (Anna perceives encoded meanings). Mechanics are vague—how do slats catch/reflect light to form "geometric harmonies"?—but the method is causally central. Two-of-three gates met (setup, closure); middle development is described rather than shown as a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Cobalt dock after rain is established in the opening line and recurs (wet boards, canal water, reflections). Setting provides atmospheric detail but does not constrain choice—the pattern could resolve in any reflective space. Water reflections charge the final image (stars dancing across water), lifting closure participation slightly. Postcard description trends low, but the micro-setting (dock, water surface for mirror checks) enables one tactic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" appears once in the opening and is never clarified or tracked. No clock tightens decisions; the guardian has watched Anna for two weeks without urgency. Time is vague and untethered.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to teach darkness the value of stars" is stated verbatim four times. The guardian's desire drives the arrangement, but no friction or cost tests it—he succeeds without obstacle. Told-only; no conflicting want complicates the motive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is named once and the prose maintains a meditative register throughout. Tone is coherent but static—no modulation as Anna approaches or as the pattern resolves. The opening's calm ("spiralingly calm quality") mirrors the ending's calm ("continued his watch"), missing the cadence shift that would charge the final image.</comment>
