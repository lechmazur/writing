<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias remains thinly sketched: his "orderly seed sorter" occupation and monument-building hobby are told rather than shown under pressure. The transformation at the end—"He would become a keeper"—is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses or a difficult choice with visible cost. Interiority relies on generic phrasing ("heart seized," "trembling hands") and the protagonist undergoes zero internal conflict; he simply receives a gift and accepts a new purpose. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values; the piece withholds agency from the character entirely.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is uncertain: the opening suggests Accumulative/Textural (lyric arbor, ritual sorting, monuments), but the middle pivots to Causal plot (prodding the speck triggers a sequence of revelations). Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing ("the keeper of memories") but lacks visible cost—Elias loses nothing and gains infinite purpose. Orientation debt is mild (who/where/when land by ~150 words), so no Orientation Test penalty applies, but the causality of the transformation is entirely external (the speck does all the work). The final paragraph moralizes the theme rather than charging an image, and the "something emerges transformed always" refrain becomes a crutch rather than a constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ashen arbor is vividly rendered in the opening third with selective sensory detail (dangling roots, drifting trees, midnight blossoms during celestial alignments). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elias works at his tray, the speck grows, and the transformation unfolds without spatial friction. The micro-setting (balcony, room, sorting tray) is present but ornamental; no tool, object, or proximity shapes the outcome. The piece satisfies basic anchoring but does not reach the 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice or charge the final image).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the moonstone dust to reclaim lost memories—is declared early but never tested. Elias does not choose between competing goods or pay a tactical price; the Three Moon alignment hands him the answer without agency. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the speck unfolds, reveals, and transforms while Elias watches. The escalation is entirely external convenience, and the resolution ("he would prod new dust specks") promises future action rather than closing a live conflict. Pressure is static reportage rather than a tightening spiral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme—memory, loss, and reclamation—is stated overtly ("bridge between what was lost and what could be remembered") rather than arising from scene particulars. The final paragraph moralizes with "monument to all that would never be forgotten again," replacing image with thesis. Subtext is absent; every revelation is explained on the page. The "something emerges transformed always" refrain is repeated five times but never reweighted with new meaning; it becomes a decorative motif rather than a constraint that complicates choice or charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable (single third-person limited), and perceptual signature is consistent (Elias notices seeds, leaves, and dust through a collector's lens). However, diction drifts into elevated register that clashes with the character's quiet craft ("where time paused during the hush," "mossy delight that spread through his veins"). Dialogue is minimal (one line from the memory keeper) and functional. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose converges on a single lyric cadence that flattens urgency—peak moments ("his heart seized," "gasping") rely on stock intensifiers rather than embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence. "Something emerges transformed always" appears five times with minimal variation. Adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "The moonstone dust wasn't just a memory keeper; it was a bridge" immediately followed by explanation of that bridge. Runs of identical stems ("Another revealed," "A third speck drifted") span multiple sentences in the climax, triggering −0.6 for template cadence. Figurative language is dense but muddy: "mossy delight" is a synesthetic leap that contradicts the established ashen-silver-light palette, and "eyes that held entire galaxies" is a stock image. Line-level artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("His purpose transformed alongside the dust"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—forgotten memories stored in dust specks that unlock during a celestial alignment—follows a widely used template: protagonist discovers magical object, receives exposition from a supernatural being, gains new purpose. The "orderly craftsperson in a fantastical setting" and "Three Moon alignment" are stock genre furniture. No fresh angle emerges: the emotional arc (curiosity → astonishment → acceptance of destiny) and the resolution (passive protagonist becomes "keeper") could transfer to any portal-fantasy frame with minor noun substitutions. The piece does not transform its tropes through specific lived detail, moral calculus, or a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elias appears throughout but makes zero decisions that alter tactics or outcomes. He performs his daily ritual, collects leaves, prods the speck, and watches the transformation unfold. The final declaration—"He would become a keeper"—is a stated intention, not an on-page choice with cost. All key turns are driven by the speck's autonomous unfolding. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates missed (no choice constrains middle or ending). Late limiter and ornamental-use friction apply: −0.5 to −1.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The moonstone dust speck is handled across multiple beats: harvesting from midnight blossoms (setup), prodding during the alignment (inciting turn), and the dust specks scattering to various anchors in the room (payoff). It returns with reweighted meaning (keys rather than memories) and participates in the closure paragraph. All three gates met. However, the speck's transformation is autonomous; Elias does not use it under competing pressures or pay a cost to access it. Causal pressure is moderate (+0.5), closure linkage present (+0.7), but swappability moderate (any magical catalyst could substitute): net ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Regional folklore frames the stakes early ("those who could decode the dust could reclaim what was lost") and shapes Elias's motivation throughout. The Three Moon alignment tightens the timeframe and triggers the transformation. However, the folklore operates as passive backstory; it does not constrain competing choices or introduce tactical friction. Elias never doubts the folklore, faces a skeptic, or pays a cost to honor it. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is thematic rather than causal. Early signal (+0.5), one beat involvement (+0.4), but ornamental use in peak moments: −0.5. Net ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is repeated five times as a refrain but functions as prophecy rather than constraint. It does not limit Elias's options or impose a visible cost; instead, it guarantees success. The attribute is present at setup, development (the speck transforms), and payoff (Elias will continue the cycle), meeting all three gates. However, it is label-only in peak beats—mentioned but not dramatized with tradeoffs. Closure linkage (+0.7) and setup (+0.5) are offset by ornamental use (−0.8) and swappability (any prophecy-fulfillment phrase could replace it): net ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prodding the speck is the inciting action that triggers the entire transformation sequence. It appears at setup (Elias uses his silver needle on seeds), is enacted at the alignment ("prodded a particularly large moonstone dust speck"), and is promised as future action in the closure ("he would prod new dust specks"). All three gates met. The action is specific and irreplaceable—no other verb would carry the same delicate, investigative connotation. Causal pressure strong (+1.2), closure linkage (+1.0), specificity (+0.6). However, the action itself is a single gesture without competing costs or tactical friction, limiting upside. Net ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Building tiny monuments is introduced early ("his secret method") and reappears when the dust specks scatter to them, revealing they are "anchors, helping lost memories find their way home." Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak (monuments are passive recipients, not tools Elias uses under pressure). The method is told rather than shown—we never see him build one on the page. Early signal (+0.6), closure linkage moderate (+0.5), but summary-only use (−0.6) and swappability (any collection or archive could serve the same function): net ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly described in the opening and establishes mood, but it never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects the outcome. Elias's room overlooks the floating gardens, yet the transformation occurs at his desk independent of spatial pressure. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates missed (setting is postcard backdrop, not tactical terrain). Early signal (+0.7), specificity moderate (+0.4), but ornamental use across all beats (−1.0) and no closure linkage: net ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"The hush where past meets prophecy" is invoked in the opening and at the Three Moon alignment, which frames the transformation as a time-bound event. The timeframe tightens the stakes (alignment happens "only" this day) and recurs at closure ("during every hush"). Setup and payoff gates met; development gate moderate (the alignment enables but does not pressure competing choices). Early signal (+0.6), closure linkage (+0.7), but the clock is atmospheric rather than tactical—no countdown alters Elias's moves. Swappability moderate (any celestial event could substitute): net ~5.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Decoding the message in falling leaves is Elias's stated motivation, introduced early and driving his leaf-collection habit. However, it is told ("convinced that their veins formed a forgotten language") rather than dramatized in a scene where he attempts and fails. At closure, the speck projects "the true language of leaves onto the ashen sky," fulfilling the desire without cost or internal conflict. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak (no on-page attempt where this desire complicates another goal). Early signal (+0.7), closure linkage moderate (+0.5), but friction-free fulfillment (−0.6) and summary-only use (−0.4): net ~6.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" appears once in the final third ("creating a mossy delight that spread through his veins"), a synesthetic image that jars against the established ashen-silver-light palette. The tone overall is reverent and lyric, but "mossy delight" is incongruent—mossy connotes damp, earthbound textures, while the arbor is dry, skyborne, and ash-colored. Setup gate missed (tone phrase absent until final third); late introduction cap 4.6 applies. The phrase does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image; it is a single ornamental flourish. Late appearance (−0.8), ornamental use (−0.7), register clash with established tone: net ~3.2.</comment>
