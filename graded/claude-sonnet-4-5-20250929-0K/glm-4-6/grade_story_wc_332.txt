<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The librarian remains abstract—his choices never embody contradiction or genuine internal conflict. Motivation is declared ("to capture a runaway dream") but never tested by competing desires or costs that force a visible trade-off. The palette's success arrives without struggle or failure; no blindspot drives a compounding mistake. Interiority relies on stock poetic phrasing ("luminous absence," "liquid memory") rather than character-particular thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are delayed and vague: "whispering archipelago" and "odd-hour librarian" float without grounding who, where, or when by ~120 words; applying −0.4. The piece declares a quest but offers no on-page reversal, complication, or cost that narrows options—the palette simply works, the dream responds, and the archipelago is healed in a summary cascade. Closure reads as announced success rather than a felt change with visible price. Drive lens is ambiguous (lyric decoration suggests Accumulative, but the text never teaches a pattern or pays off compression); applying −0.4 and capping all categories at 8.0 per lens-ambiguity cross-cap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "whispering archipelago" and "tide-worn shelves" are evocative labels but remain generic postcards—no micro-detail (tool, body constraint, spatial layout) alters a choice or charges the closure. Sensory selection is uniform lyricism rather than POV-filtered urgency. The palette and sunrise are described but never constrain an action or force a tactical shift. Orientation debt (Q2 penalty applied) caps Q3 at 7.0 per cross-cap; execution weaknesses lower the score further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("capture a runaway dream") is signaled but never tested—no false start, setback, or trade-off. The ritual (photography, painting with light) succeeds on first attempt without friction, and the resolution is summarized ("he had done it") rather than dramatized with visible cost. No moment narrows options or forces the librarian to choose between competing goods. The lack of meaningful escalation under any lens prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme ("longing as bridge") is asserted in the final third via direct statement: "cipher of longing was not a code to be broken, but a language to be spoken" and "luminous absence…as a bridge to the impossible." These are thematic echo declarations rather than resonance earned from concrete particulars. The ending explains rather than shows, and no prior image returns reweighted. The piece telegraphs its thesis in prompt-like language, triggering −0.6 for final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Narrative voice is consistent but ornamental—lush diction ("fractured gold," "stolen moonlight," "liquid memory") recurs without POV-specific perceptual signature or modulation under pressure. Distance remains stable (close third), and there is no head-hopping, but the prose reads as generic lyric rather than character-particular thought. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("mosaic of impossible beauty") that feels authorial rather than focalizer-bound. Orientation debt caps Q6 at 7.8 per cross-cap; execution sits mid-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence across the second half: "The whispering archipelago was no longer haunted…" / "The whispering archipelago was whole…" / "The whispering archipelago sang his name…" and repetitive "he had done it" / "some myths were not meant to be archived, but lived" / "some stories were not meant to end, but to illuminate." Applying −1.0 for loops and stems. Figurative language ("liquid memory," "shard of hope or sorrow," "warm blanket") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching, triggering −0.5 for density. Mixed metaphors: light as "liquid memory" and "liquid" pooling in hands, then "swirling" on a palette. Cumulative artifacts yield −1.7 total; line debt (Q7 ≤7.0) disallows 9+ globally per cross-cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise (artist captures abstract dream via sunrise ritual) is a widely used template—magical realism quest with synesthetic tool. The piece does not transform it through specific lived detail, world logic contradiction, or non-obvious moral calculus; applying −1.0 for derivative frame. Execution is competent lyric decoration but offers no fresh inflection: the ritual works, the dream comes home, the community heals. No risk-taking or bold synthesis elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The odd-hour librarian is present throughout and performs the central ritual, but his actions are procedural (raising camera, tracing strokes) without decision points that alter tactics or narrow options. He succeeds on first attempt with no complication. Present in closure summary but not causally active there—the palette, not the librarian, "pulsed" and "would forever burn." Setup and middle beats are met; closure participation is passive mention. Swappable with "artist" or "keeper" with minor edits; applying −0.6. Late resolution of a problem he did not create (the archipelago's longing) applies −0.7. Score: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The watercolor palette appears early (workshop), is used in the ritual (second beat: "began to paint…directly onto its surface"), and returns at closure ("placed it on a pedestal…forever burn"). Three-gate presence qualifies for ≥6.1 eligibility. However, the palette is decorative—its "cool and expectant" surface and "shimmering" colors are described but do not constrain a choice or impose cost. The librarian's success is automatic; the palette functions as a container, not an agent of pressure. Closure linkage is static (pedestal display) rather than causal transformation. Applying −0.5 for ornamental use and −0.4 for swappability (any magical tool could replace it). Score: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "cipher of longing" is named six times but functions only as thematic decoration. It never shapes an on-page choice, constrains tactics, or imposes a trade-off—the librarian simply "learned its dialect" in summary. Setup (early mention) is met; middle development and closure participation are label-only. Applying −0.8 for ornamental use, −0.6 for swappability ("mystery" or "code" would serve identically), and −0.3 for label-only trait. Score: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is described ("his fingers tracing the hues…directly onto its surface") but the attribute does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. The method works without friction; no failure or trade-off tests its mechanics. Present in one beat (middle ritual) but absent from setup as a distinct trait and passive in closure. Applying −0.6 for ornamental use and −0.5 for swappability (watercolor or any medium could replace it). Score: 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Vitalize" appears once in the text ("something to breathe life into the stillness, to vitalize the dream") as a declared need, then the palette glows and the dream responds—summary rather than dramatized action. The term does not shape tactics or recur; it is a synonym for "animate" without unique mechanics. Applying −0.7 for summary-only use, −0.6 for late introduction (second half), and −0.5 for swappability. Score: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Through sunrise photography" is signaled early ("through sunrise photography, he would capture the fleeting moment") and enacted in the ritual beat ("He raised his camera…As the first tendrils of dawn unfurled"). Two beats (setup statement, middle execution) but no complication or cost tied to the method—it succeeds immediately. Missing closure participation (the palette, not the photography, dominates the ending). Applying −0.5 for ornamental execution and −0.4 for swappability (any observational method could replace it). Score: 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The "whispering archipelago" is named repeatedly but remains a backdrop—no terrain feature, resource, or spatial constraint alters the librarian's choices. The setting whispers and sighs but does not pressure tactics. Present in setup and closure (sung name, collective healing) but purely atmospheric. Applying −0.7 for ornamental use and −0.6 for swappability (any island or coastal setting would serve). Score: 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"In the hush of improbable beginnings" opens and closes the piece as a phrase but does not function as a timeframe—no clock, deadline, or temporal constraint shapes decisions. It is a tonal label, not a pressure device. Setup is met as recurring phrase; development and closure participation are absent as causal elements. Applying −0.8 for ornamental use and −0.7 for swappability (any poetic time label could replace it). Score: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To capture a runaway dream" is stated as the librarian's purpose and drives the ritual sequence (setup, middle action). However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—he pursues it without hesitation, friction, or trade-off. Closure mentions success ("he had done it") but does not show the dream's capture altering options or foreclosing a path. Two gates (setup, development) but missing felt cost at closure. Applying −0.6 for told-only motivation and −0.4 for no on-page friction. Score: 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" is named three times and functions as thematic shorthand for the archipelago's longing. Tone is static lyricism throughout—no modulation with pressure, no charged shift at closure. The phrase appears in setup and ending but does not constrain choice or reweight meaning through contrast. Applying −0.7 for ornamental use, −0.5 for static mood, and −0.4 for swappability (any poetic negation could replace it). Score: 3.8.</comment>
