<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's poetic lens and revolutionary past shape his perception throughout, with embodied moments like tracing light eddies and veiling mirrors. His motivation to "reimagine an entire civilization" drives the central choice to smuggle the shard, though the final decision feels somewhat predetermined rather than torn from contradictory impulses. The internal contradiction between academic method and emotional truth operates mostly in reflection rather than forcing simultaneous pulls in scene. Minor deduction for the vision sequence reading as convenient revelation rather than hard-won insight with visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Kaelen on asteroid museum after Chronal Refraction. The closure—smuggling the shard to preserve private memory over institutional narrative—lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost (foregoing official recognition, keeping truth small). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the night ritual with veiled mirrors and drifting light builds density toward the hand-with-flower vision that reweights the dispute from academic to human. One meaningful deepening occurs when visible time congeals around the shard to reveal intimate use. The cost is conceptual and relational but legible on the page in the final renunciation of the board.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid museum with visible time drifting through corridors is vivid and purposeful, creating a textured environment that pressures Kaelen's choices. The maintenance suite with clouded mirrors becomes micro-setting that enables the ritual method. The crystal shard itself functions as object-as-setting, constraining the vision and charging the final image. Sensory details—golden thread light, burnished twilight color in crystal—are selective and POV-filtered through Kaelen's poetic attention. Minor issue: the "artificial weather system" announcing meteor shower feels like convenience staging rather than integrated world logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: how to understand the vase shard's truth against institutional pressure. The night ritual provides one meaningful tightening—covering mirrors, opening the shutter—that narrows options from academic debate to private vision. Kaelen's agency is renunciation (smuggling the shard, refusing to present findings), which forecloses the path of official validation with visible cost. Under Accumulative lens, pressure builds through the light-congealing sequence to the hand-with-flower image. Escalation is modest but present; the meteor storm and ritual create urgency. Weakness: the curators' pressure remains mostly asserted backdrop rather than on-page friction that tests commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—personal beauty persisting in collapse versus institutional narrative—emerges from the shard vision without thesis statements. The hand placing wildflowers on a windowsill answers the academic dispute with human particulars, and the final choice to share poems "in quiet corners" embodies the theme through action. The veil-against-storm motif recurs with shifted meaning from rebel surveillance-blocking to sorrow-management, charging the closure. Minor overreach: "It was a quiet revolution, fought with a shard of crystal and a veil against the storm of time" edges toward thematic echo by articulating the metaphor too neatly in the penultimate line. The closing sentence recovers with concrete image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: poetic diction ("spooling like golden thread," "burnished sorrow"), elevated but character-consistent lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean. The prose rhythm modulates purposefully, slowing for the ritual sequence. Minor register issue: "meticulously curated narrative" and "intellectual lock-picks of the academics" drift slightly corporate/writerly, though still plausibly within an educated revolutionary's idiom. Reflection blocks are anchored to present stimuli (the shard, the light) and tilt present stance toward the smuggling choice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies well with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally dense without pattern payoff: "groaned with the weight of history and the pressure of the void" stacks metaphors; "the light didn't just pass through it; it pooled, wept, and held the color" uses three verbs where two would sharpen. Minor paraphrase loop: "He would not present his findings... Instead, he would smuggle the shard... He would write poems" repeats "would" stems. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he felt") appear frequently but fit the reflective mode. No major clarity issues; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The combination of visible time, baroque asteroid museum, rebel-turned-curator, and mirror-veiling ritual creates a fresh synthesis. The archaeological dispute reframed through intimate vision rather than academic proof offers a non-obvious angle. Emotional truth—grief for unrecorded lives—grounds the speculative elements. Minor derivative note: the "revolutionary in museum of fallen empire" and "small beauty defying collapse" beats echo familiar SFF templates, though the visible-time mechanics and ritual method add specificity. The transformation is present but not yet inevitable-in-hindsight; the hand-with-flower vision feels slightly convenient rather than organically constrained by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's defunct-revolutionary status is signaled early and shapes his anti-institutional stance. His past (protest signs, rebel mirror-veiling) motivates the ritual method and the choice to smuggle rather than present findings. The attribute drives two key beats: recognizing the ritual as his "true work" and deciding to share poems in quiet corners rather than seek official validation. Missing strong middle development where the revolutionary identity constrains a tactical choice under pressure; mostly it flavors perception and primes the ending renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Crystal vase shard appears in three beats: center of exhibit (setup), metal counter during ritual (development as focal object that calms and directs visible time), and wrapped for smuggling (closure participation). Its specific properties—pooling and weeping light—enable the vision and charge the final choice. The shard's transformation from dispute object to private anchor is legible. Strong causal pressure: without the shard's light-interaction, the hand-with-flower vision cannot occur. Minor cap: the shard is somewhat passive in the vision beat; the light does the revealing work while the shard mostly receives attention.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Archaeological dispute frames the initial situation and Kaelen's presence on the asteroid. It provides the nominal conflict (ritual bowl vs. household vase) that Kaelen reframes. Closure explicitly rejects the dispute: "The curators could keep the dates and theories; Kaelen would keep the memory." However, the dispute itself remains abstract backdrop; no on-page curator interaction tests Kaelen's stance, and the vision bypasses rather than engages the dispute's terms. Functional setup, weak middle pressure, thematic presence at closure without causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" is signaled early ("a curse in a world that had already written its final, bitter stanza") and shapes diction throughout. It enables the method: poetic vision as alternative to academic analysis. The trait constrains the ending choice—writing poems rather than reports—with cost (no official influence). Two-gate participation: setup and closure. Missing beat-level demonstration where poetic perception forces a tactical trade-off under pressure; the attribute flavors voice and primes the ending but doesn't narrow options in the ritual sequence itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Devise a new method" anchors the midpoint turn into the ritual sequence. The action is signaled ("he had to devise") and executed (veiling mirrors, placing shard, opening shutter to visible time). It drives the vision beat and enables the smuggling choice. Strong middle development and closure linkage. Minor swappability: "devise" could be "attempt" or "enact" without large structural change; the method's content (mirror-veiling) matters more than the framing verb. The devising itself is brief; most weight falls on execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Covering mirrors during storms is seeded early (rebel days, psychic surveillance defense), returns as chosen method (maintenance suite veiling), and its execution enables the vision. The mechanics matter: veiling creates darkness that lets visible time drift in without chaotic reflection. Three-gate participation with causal pressure: the method's specific properties (preventing sorrow-amplification, calming the light) make the hand-with-flower vision possible. Strong irreplaceability: generic meditation or observation would not produce the same focused revelation. The method shapes the attempt and charges the closure as "a veil against the storm of time."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Baroque asteroid appears throughout: hollowed corridors, Final Dynasty exhibit, maintenance suite. The setting supplies the shard and enables the ritual (exterior corridor for light, mirrors to veil). Micro-setting (maintenance suite, metal counter) provides the stage for the key vision beat. Weak constraint: the asteroid is more backdrop than pressure; Kaelen could perform a similar ritual in many locations with access to the shard and visible time. The "administrators saw him as a relic" asserts time pressure but remains abstract. Two-gate participation (setup, development) with moderate closure presence (the smuggling references "his hab-unit" as destination).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"After the Chronal Refraction" anchors the setting; visible time drifting through corridors is established early and matters throughout. The timeframe enables the method: light that can be directed by the shard. The meteor storm provides urgency for the ritual night. Visible time directly participates in the vision beat (light congeals, paints images). Two-gate participation with causal role. Minor abstraction: "after time becomes visible" is more premise than tightening clock; the timeframe enables rather than pressures. No countdown or urgency from the Refraction itself limiting options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To reimagine an entire civilization" is signaled in paragraph one and drives Kaelen's rejection of academic answers. The motivation is dramatized through contrast (curators want "definitive answers," Kaelen seeks "fluid truth") and tested in the vision beat (seeing the hand, not the emperor). The smuggling choice and plan to write poems enact the desire at closure. Friction is present: reimagining requires rejecting official recognition. Two-gate strong (setup, closure); middle development is implied in the ritual but not stressed as internal conflict. The desire could be more visibly torn between wanting influence and preserving intimacy.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" is named early and saturates the prose: "bitter stanza," "fragment of a shattered soul," weary smiling face, grief for "countless, unrecorded lives." Tone modulates purposefully—elevated and reflective in exposition, focused and ritual during the vision, quiet and resolved at closure. The final image ("quiet revolution") holds the sorrow without amplifying it. Strong coherence across turns. The tone charges the closure by keeping the emotional register consistent with the renunciation: private memory over public triumph. Minor overstatement: "burnished sorrow he felt in his bones" labels the tone rather than trusting embodiment, though the surrounding imagery supports it.</comment>
