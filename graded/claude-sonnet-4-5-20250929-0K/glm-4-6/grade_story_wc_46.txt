<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara exists primarily as a vehicle for ornamental description rather than contradiction or agency. Her "promise to the sky itself" and orphaned backstory arrive as summary labels without on-page friction or cost-bearing micro-choices. Interior states remain smoothly poetic throughout, with no credible irrationality or flawed impulse that complicates her polishing task. The motivation to "share light without using fire" faces no dramatized obstacle or trade-off—she simply executes a method she has already mastered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates atmosphere through lyric density and pattern (zephyr bloom, serpentine coils, pearl of stillness), but no on-page tightening or reversal changes Elara's options or knowledge. The closure—placing polished sea glass on a ledge—delivers the promised action but without felt or conceptual cost; she departs "light" and "earthbound no longer in spirit," a summary claim rather than a visible foreclosure. Orientation penalty waived (grotto, shoreline, stars anchored early), but the absence of escalation and legible cost at closure caps the category.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is anchored early with vivid sensory selection—salt, damp stone, mist, slick walls—and returns at closure when the glass is placed "where the mist coiled." Micro-setting (water's edge, ledge) structures the action. However, the environment supplies no obstacle or constraint; Elara's movements and polishing proceed unimpeded, and the grotto functions as atmospheric container rather than pressure source. The final image charges setting mood but does not constrain the protagonist's choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled: fulfill a promise to share starlight without fire. No on-page reversal, complication, or trade-off tests this commitment. Elara arrives with a mastered method, executes it without friction, and departs satisfied. The "promise made to the sky itself" is told rather than dramatized, and no live option is foreclosed at closure. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that narrows options is required; here the texture remains static throughout, and the final act delivers satisfaction without visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—light offered without consumption, transformation through patience—emerges through recurring images (sea glass worn smooth, flameless fire, pearl of stillness). The final placement invites reflection on presence over brilliance. However, the protagonist never confronts a counter-pull or cost, so the thematic question resolves into gentle affirmation rather than complexity. The closing assertion "earthbound no longer in spirit" states theme rather than earning it through specific friction, and the piece leans toward prompt-label echo ("share light without using fire") in place of dramatized moral calculus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent—lyric diction, elevated register, sensory selection favoring celestial and aquatic imagery—but lacks character-specific bias or blind spot. Psychic distance remains uniformly close and poetic without modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition (zephyr bloom, serpentine curves, pearl of stillness) are present, but the pattern does not tighten or shift at closure, limiting its effect. The prose reads as authored voice rather than Elara's particular idiom under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density without taught pattern or payoff: nearly every sentence carries metaphor (grotto "coiled like a sleeping serpent," glass "pupil dilating in reverence," mist "bowing like a curtain"), creating atmospheric richness that obscures propulsion. Multiple paraphrase loops: "reflectively vibrant" appears three times with near-synonym phrasing; "zephyr bloom" recurs five times without functional variation. Template cadence in mid-section: "The sea glass... / The method was... / The grotto's walls... / As the memories resurface..." Filter-verb stacks dull immediacy ("seemed to sigh," "seemed to press," "seemed to smile," "seemed to hum"). Applying overwriting density penalty (−0.5), loop/scaffold penalty (−0.8), and filter-verb stack penalty (−0.5) totaling approximately −1.8, then disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Premise—earthbound watcher transforms sea glass to fulfill a celestial promise—reads as lyric fulfillment rather than fresh synthesis or risk. The grotto, sea glass, and polishing converge logically but without surprise; swapping "gem polishing" for another craft would require minimal structural change. Emotional arc (yearning → patient labor → satisfied offering) follows a template of gentle resolution without friction or counter-pull. The piece commits fully to its lyric register, which is a strength, but the central question and its answer remain abstract and prompt-adjacent rather than rooted in specific lived cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and frames the story, but her choices do not create turns. She arrives with intention, executes a mastered method, and departs satisfied; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup and closure gates met (character present early and at end), but middle development shows observation and execution rather than choice under pressure. Functional but swappable: another contemplative artisan could fulfill the same arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sea glass is handled in multiple beats: lifted to moonlight, rotated during polishing, weighed twice (literal and metaphorical), and placed on the ledge at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The object's transformation (jagged → smooth → luminescent) mirrors thematic arc. However, the glass does not constrain Elara's choices or create friction; its role is symbolic carrier rather than causal pressure. Specificity (worn by ocean, origins as bottle shard) adds texture. Scores in the 7.0–8.4 neighborhood require the object to drive at least two beats with cost; here it is present and purposeful but does not narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The phrase "pearl of stillness" appears three times, always as theme label or descriptor. The concept (calm luminescence, non-consuming light) shapes Elara's stated goal but does not constrain her on-page tactics or create a choice node. Setup present (framed early as her aim), middle absent (no pressure tests the concept), payoff present (glass becomes "a pearl of stillness" at closure). Functional but primarily thematic echo rather than stake-shaping force. Swappable with "beacon of peace" or similar abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Reflectively vibrant" appears twice as label (once for glass, once recycled for glass again), never enabling or constraining an action. No setup signal before mid-story, no middle development, closure mention is ornamental. The attribute describes desired outcome rather than a trait that imposes cost or trade-off. Present but decorative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Weigh" appears twice: once literal (considering the glass), once metaphorical ("weigh its significance"). Setup present (early mention), development weak (second use is paraphrase rather than new pressure), payoff absent (action does not recur or reshape the ending). The action is specific but easily swappable with "consider," "measure," or "assess" without structural loss. Lyric reprise does reweight meaning slightly, lifting score into mid-5s, but causal pressure remains low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Gem polishing is named, described (grit, water, time), and shown on the page (rotating the glass, achieving pearlescent glow). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The method structures Elara's labor and enables the final transformation. However, no friction or constraint emerges from the method itself—no supply shortage, no failed attempt, no trade-off between speed and quality. Mechanics matter to outcome but do not narrow options or impose visible cost. Scores near essential but stops short of indispensable due to swappability (another craft could substitute with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Serpentine grotto is anchored early, described throughout (mist, slick walls, coiled curves, ledge), and houses the closure act (glass placed on ledge). Setup, development (Elara kneels, works within it), and payoff gates met. The setting supplies atmosphere and a symbolic convergence point ("where earth and sea met") but does not constrain Elara's movements or choices. No access problem, no environmental cost, no tactical pressure. Micro-setting (water's edge, ledge) structures action but remains postcard rather than crucible. Lyric reprise at closure (grotto "hums," walls "glisten") reweights mood without imposing cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"As memories resurface" appears twice as a phrase, framing brief backstory (night she first looked up, her orphaned status). Time element is present but does not tighten decisions or create a clock. No deadline, no urgency, no pressure from temporal progression. Setup weak (not signaled early), development absent (no mid-scene time constraint), payoff absent (closure occurs when Elara decides, not when time forces her). Vague and untracked; trends low per guidance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Motivation "to share light without using fire" is stated early, shapes Elara's goal (polishing rather than igniting), and is fulfilled at closure when the glass glows "without a spark." Setup and payoff gates met, middle development weak (no on-page friction between want and obstacle). The desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices; Elara's "flameless fire in her chest" is metaphor, not felt cost. No trade-off or competing want complicates the pursuit. Functional and present across arc, but friction between want and cost remains low, capping score in mid-5s per guidance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Zephyr bloom" recurs five times (salt and damp stone, jasmine scent, night carrying her forward, wrapping like a shawl). Tone is soft, lyric, contemplative throughout with no modulation under pressure—no tension peak, no cadence shift. Setup present (early mentions), development static (same gentle mood), payoff present but unchanged (mist as shawl at departure). Coherent but single-mood; does not charge the final image with tonal contrast or deepening. Mid-band per static-mood guidance.</comment>
