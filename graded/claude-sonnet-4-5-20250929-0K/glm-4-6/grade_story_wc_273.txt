<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's obsession with time dilation is stated but his actions read as observation-driven rather than pressing choice under conflicting impulses. The "serene anger" is asserted repeatedly ("his anger simmering beneath the surface—not hot or loud, but serene") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The drone functions as extension rather than source of friction, and the ending epiphany ("Time slowed in crisis not because of physics, but because the mind fought to etch every detail into permanence") arrives as tidy realization without visible cost or foreclosed path. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("he had lived too long in the margins, between what was seen and what was forgotten") rather than concrete, character-particular thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (encampment, post-eclipse, Kael's tracker role). The piece tracks an accumulative lens—Kael follows the drone, finds ink, observes patterns—but no meaningful tightening or deepening narrows options or changes knowledge with felt cost. The "revelation" is delivered as summary insight rather than on-page action that forecloses a path; Kael's final understanding leaves him "lighter" and at "peace," a softening rather than a reconfiguration with cost. The ending image ("disappeared into the shadows, not as an act of hiding, but as one of belonging") gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is conceptual assertion, not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment, eastern ridge, and scorched earth provide spatial grounding. Sensory detail is selective ("dust-coated tents," "sandstone shards," "wind picked up") and filtered through Kael's tracker focus. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the vial and ink are found half-buried but their discovery does not constrain Kael's choices or alter his tactics—he kneels, uncorks, observes. The final image of shadows and wind-carved walls supports tone but does not charge the closure with environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why time slows in crisis—is signaled early but remains abstract and observational. Kael's journey from encampment to ridge to ink observation reads as linear accumulation without a reversal or tightening that forecloses options. The drone's "alarm" chirp is noted but does not force a trade-off; Kael "had expected this." The ending delivers insight without visible price: his anger is "tempered" and "reshaped," steps are "lighter," and he allows himself "peace." Escalation under the accumulative lens would require density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost; here the resolution softens rather than charges.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of ephemeral beauty and time's elasticity emerges from the disappearing ink and Kael's obsession. The final line ("The story of time was written in vanishing ink, and he had finally learned how to read it") risks overt thematic statement but is anchored to the ink conceit. However, the piece leans toward philosophizing ("a battle against oblivion, a struggle to hold onto what the world wanted to erase") rather than letting the patterns and Kael's choices generate meaning implicitly. The resolution grants wisdom without ambiguity or counter-reading; Kael's understanding arrives complete and affirmative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Kael; distance is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("serene, like the calm eye of a storm," "he had lived too long in the margins") that feels authorial rather than tracker-particular. Perceptual signature is present (tracker focus on horizon, patterns, fleeting details) but interiority often summarizes philosophy rather than tracking immediate perception under pressure. No dialogue; voice is controlled but leans abstract. The final paragraph's sequence of summary statements ("The world would always demand explanations, but Kael had learned to quiet its noise with silence") reads as thematic summation rather than embodied stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective. However, multiple paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences appear: "not the calm before a storm, but the pause after a fall" / "not hot or loud, but serene"; "disappeared into the shadows, not as an act of hiding, but as one of belonging"; "not because of physics, but because the mind fought." The final third repeats "Kael's [noun]" and "The [noun]" sentence stems across seven lines, creating template cadence. Stock metaphors ("the calm eye of a storm," "time's fractured heart") accumulate without fresh vehicle. Information density is moderate; several beats describe Kael's state without advancing action. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template runs touching the closure third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The albino tracker, artificial hummingbird drone, and disappearing ink combine in a speculative frame, but the emotional arc—solitary figure seeks understanding, finds peace—follows a familiar template. The turn from "serene anger" to "peace" and "lighter steps" reads as resolution rather than transformation with cost. The ink's ephemeral patterns and the time-dilation thesis are worked through but not synthesized into a non-obvious stake or choice. The premise is conceptually tidy: the ink reveals the answer Kael sought, and he accepts it without complication. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies; the template is not transformed by specific lived friction or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout; albino trait mentioned once without causal work. His tracker role shapes observation (scanning, following, perceiving patterns) but no pivotal choice turns on tracker skill with visible cost. He kneels, uncorks, traces patterns—actions are responses to discovery rather than decisions under conflicting pressures. Present in closure but not causally active there; the revelation is granted by the ink, not earned by tracker choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drone appears in three beats: perched at opening, lifts to eastern ridge, hovers above ink, chirps alarm, returns. It catalogues patterns but does not constrain Kael's choices or supply a resource under pressure; it functions as extension of his vision. Present in closure ("returned to his shoulder," "stirred, ready for the next chase") but not reweighted; it remains a tool. Two-gate presence (setup, closure mention) without middle development that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Disappearing ink is the method's vehicle; vial found mid-story, ink spilled, patterns observed, ink dissolves. It shapes the peak beat and supplies the revelation ("unlocking the secret he'd chased for years"). Present in closure via the final line ("written in vanishing ink"). Signals by second third, drives one major beat, charges the ending. However, it resolves a problem (understanding time dilation) that it did not help create; Kael's quest predates the ink. Three gates met but swappability concern (any ephemeral medium could serve) and late arrival limit ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" appears as label twice ("consciously embrace the wild chaos," "still consciously wild") without on-page action that demonstrates the trait under pressure. No visible trade-off or constraint tied to wildness; Kael's behavior reads as methodical observation. Mentioned but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Disappear" recurs as concept: ink dissolves, patterns vanish, Kael "disappeared into the shadows." The final act is thematic rather than tactical; his disappearance into shadows is metaphor for belonging, not a choice that alters outcome. Present in closure image but the action is easily swappable (retreat, return, merge) without structural loss. Lyric reprise but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ephemeral patterns in spilled ink are introduced, observed, and catalogued in one extended beat. The method is signaled ("fleeting as they were intricate," "dissolved, leaving behind traces only his eyes could perceive") and its mechanics matter—the patterns coalesce into a map, then vanish faster. It delivers the revelation but appears late (second half) and does not shape prior attempts. Two gates (middle development, closure linkage) but setup absent; introduced after midpoint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Wind-carved encampment anchors opening and returns in final image ("wind-carved walls whispered their secrets"). The encampment supplies a starting location but does not constrain choices or provide resources that alter tactics. Kael leaves it behind early; the setting is postcard backdrop rather than pressure. Lyric reprise (first paragraph → final lines) without middle development or causal work. Two-gate presence (setup, closure mention) but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Post-eclipse frame is established early ("eclipse's shadow lifted," "sun's reappearance") and the encampment's fires flicker at nightfall in closure. Time passes but does not tighten decisions; no clock pressures Kael's observations. Present in frame but does not alter moves or raise cost. Setup and closure mention without middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to understand time dilation is stated early ("why moments of crisis stretched") and resolved at the end ("Time slowed in crisis not because of physics, but because the mind fought to etch every detail into permanence"). The quest is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices; Kael's steps are "measured but unhurried," his focus "singular." No friction between want and cost on the page; the revelation arrives as insight, not earned through sacrifice. Three gates but minimal dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Serene anger" is asserted three times ("his anger simmering beneath the surface—not hot or loud, but serene," "his anger tempered by the revelation," "his anger had not vanished, but it had been reshaped") without embodied modulation under pressure. The tone does not shift with escalation; Kael remains calm throughout. Present in setup and ending but static, label-only, and not charged by the final image. Two-gate presence without development.</comment>
