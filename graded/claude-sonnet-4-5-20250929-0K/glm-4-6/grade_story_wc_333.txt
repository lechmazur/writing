<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The locksmith remains abstract—"unassumingly bold" is asserted but never tested through a difficult on-page choice with visible cost. His humming method proceeds without internal conflict or risk; the breakthrough arrives via stated resonance rather than earned struggle. The client's absence removes relational pressure, leaving the protagonist unopposed. Interiority consists largely of ornamental perception ("impossible color," "glass harmonica note") that describes process without revealing contradictory impulses or a hierarchy of values under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density builds toward the "soundless snap" release. Orientation anchors late—"workshop," "workbench," and "nexus under starlight" remain vague past 120 words, but the piece teaches a lyric pattern early enough to waive full penalty. The closure unit (ribbon losing color, secrets gone) constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration, yet the cost is conceptual only—no visible forfeiture of the locksmith's resources or future capacity. The final image reweights the lock of hair but does not foreclose a live option or demonstrate a felt price paid by the protagonist.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "shadowed nexus under starlight" and "gap between worlds" remain metaphoric placeholders; no concrete spatial anchors (walls, tools, dimensions) constrain movement or choice. Sensory detail—lavender, rain, "impossible color"—is vivid but ornamental, not tactical. The workshop's geometry "slips sideways" during the climax, yet this effect does not alter the locksmith's method or force a spatial workaround. Micro-setting test fails: no object or body constraint shapes the final action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("free an idea trapped behind fear") is signaled early but never tested by opposition or trade-off. The locksmith's humming proceeds unimpeded; "fear's defense" (overwhelming scent, disorienting geometry) presses in but does not force a tactical shift or cost-bearing decision. The "soundless snap" resolution arrives via stated resonance rather than protagonist agency navigating a narrowed choice. No visible price is paid—no stamina cost, no forfeiture of another client or resource—leaving escalation abstract and closure consequence-free.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—acceptance that past love was "enough" despite loss—emerges through the locksmith's visualization and the ribbon's color fade, a purposeful image. The piece avoids overt moralizing and the final sentence ("another quiet victory in the endless war against fear") frames the work without dictating interpretation. However, the epiphany ("love...sufficient, complete") is told rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the locksmith himself undergoes no internal shift or trade-off that would anchor theme in his particular flaw or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction ("enveloped secrets," "hush of cosmic possibility," "impossible color") is consistent and elevated but risks purple register in peak beats. The single brief Chinese character insertion ("在高空") mid-sentence disrupts voice coherence without pattern-teaching or payoff. Perceptual signature is ornamental rather than character-particular: the locksmith's noticing (lavender, glass harmonica note) describes process but does not reflect a distinct worldview or professional bias that would distinguish this mind from another metaphysical craftsman.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose density is high but figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without escalation or pattern-taught payoff: "cosmic dust," "thin skin of reality," "tremor in the air," "impossible longing," "tide of impossible longing," "prayer of liberation." Mixed vehicle in "tide...pressing in from all sides" conflates liquid and solid pressure. Loop detected: "enveloped secrets" appears three times with synonym churn ("pressed," "intensified," "gone") but no added pressure. The line "another fragment healed, another quiet victory" mechanically summarizes theme rather than charging the image. Overall momentum is slowed by ornamental layering at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The metaphysical locksmith premise is familiar from contemporary fantasy. The story executes the archetype competently but does not transform it—swapping "locksmith" for "healer" or "medium" would preserve the arc with minor edits. The client's physical absence removes a crucible that might generate friction or surprise. The hint-from-starlight method and humming-as-key are atmospheric but functionally generic psychic work. No bold structural or moral calculus risks; the resolution validates the premise without testing its limits or revealing a counter-reading.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and performs the central action (humming, visualizing), but his choices do not create reversals—he waits, observes, hums, succeeds. No decision point where he selects between competing tactics with visible cost. Closure participation is summary ("his work done") rather than a choice that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Appears in three beats: opening (left on workbench), mid-action (held up, grows warm), and closure (ribbon faded grey). The color fade reweights meaning and signals success. However, the locksmith does not manipulate or use the object tactically—it is held passively while he hums. Swappable with another token (photo, letter) without structural break.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Enveloped secrets" is named three times and the tremor/weight metaphor recurs, but the concept does not constrain the locksmith's method or alter his approach. It functions as atmospheric label rather than a puzzle requiring specific tactics. Closure shows secrets "gone" but does not dramatize how their release changes the client or protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Declared in the opening paragraph but never tested. "Unassumingly bold" implies a contradiction (quiet demeanor vs. audacity), yet no on-page moment forces the locksmith to choose boldness over caution or pay a cost for tampering. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears twice: as fear's defense (walls shimmer, scent overwhelms) and as the effect that "ceased" at resolution. The disorientation shapes the middle beat's sensory pressure and its cessation marks closure, making it essential to the turn. However, it does not force the locksmith to adapt his method or choose a new tactic—he "persisted" unchanged—so causal pressure is limited.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Signaled early ("method...requiring a hint given by first star"), observed mid-action ("single, piercing point of silver"), and delivers the "frequency" insight that guides the humming. The star constrains method (locksmith must wait for twilight) and enables the solution, but the mechanics are told rather than dramatized—starlight "showed him...a feeling" without on-page struggle to interpret or apply it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Named repeatedly ("shadowed nexus under starlight," "workshop," "gap between worlds") and supplies the stage for the action. Walls "shimmer" during the climax, but this effect does not alter the locksmith's movements or force a spatial workaround. No concrete anchor (tool placement, threshold distance) constrains choice. Postcard-level description.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Hush of cosmic possibility" and "across decades" gesture at temporal scope, but no live clock tightens the locksmith's work. He waits "patient as a mountain" with no cost for delay, and the action unfolds in a vague duration ("Tonight..."). Time does not pressure decisions or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stated early ("to free an idea trapped behind fear") and drives the locksmith's goal throughout. The visualization of "enough" and the humming are goal-directed actions. However, no friction between this desire and a competing want or cost—he proceeds unopposed and succeeds without forfeiture. Told rather than tested under conflicting pressures.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Improbable longing" matches the ornamental, elevated register and recurs in "impossible longing for the safety of ignorance." Tone is coherent through the middle beat but does not modulate with pressure—the locksmith's calm persists unchanged, and the final paragraph returns to declarative summary ("quiet victory") without tonal charge. Mid-band for consistency without escalation.</comment>
