<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal state is embodied through the coral fragment's pulse and the ache in his hand, creating concrete physical anchors for emotion. The shift from professional translator to wounded listener is traced through micro-choices—leaning closer, decrypting the notes—but the final transformation ("unknot something in himself") relies on metaphorical assertion rather than a visible forfeiture with dramatic cost. The girl functions more as catalyst than character with her own pressure, and her disappearance feels convenient rather than earned. Interiority occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("lotus-hearted ache," "shared anxiety") that read as imposed rather than thought-particular under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (mist-clad atrium, Elias on bench, anesthetic kicking in) arrive within the first 120 words; drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with pattern-building around coral, mist, and the cast notes. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias reframes his pain as "a map, a direction toward something like peace," and the coral fragment pulses a final acknowledgment before settling still, reconfiguring his wound into potential solace. Cost is felt in the return of physical pain and the dissolution of the girl's presence, but remains more emotional than causal—the ache is reframed rather than paid. The middle deepens through the decryption beat, but escalation is textural rather than a clear narrowing of options, and the girl's vanishing avoids testing the new understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atrium is anchored early with selective sensory detail (mist on ferns, stone bench, hidden fountain) that recurs and evolves to support emotional progression. The anesthetic creates a specific perceptual filter ("fuzzing his thoughts but also sharpening his instinct"), and the coral fragment functions as micro-setting—a tactile object whose pulse and coolness constrain and charge key beats. The fountain's revelation and re-concealment by mist mirrors the emotional arc, and the twilight deepening to "bruised purple" charges the final exit. Spatial choreography (bench, cast brushing hand, leaning closer) remains legible, and the mist operates as both atmosphere and thematic vehicle without becoming static postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias seeking solace from the weight of his work—is signaled early and modulates through the encounter with the girl. One meaningful tightening occurs when he begins decrypting the cast notes, narrowing focus from passive observation to active engagement, and the pattern recognition ("'Empty' isn't a word...it's a direction") reweights his understanding. However, the girl's disappearance removes the test of whether this new meaning can withstand continued pressure, and the final cost (returning pain, memory of the cast) is more reflective than a trade-off that forecloses a live tactical path. Agency is present but diluted by the girl's convenient exit and the closure's reliance on internal reframing over choice under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of grafting new meaning onto wounds emerges through concrete particulars: the coral fragment under skin, smudged notes on plaster, scars reframed as maps. The piece resists overt moralizing—"the ache not as a wound but as a map" lands as image rather than thesis—and the coral's final pulse offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a lesson. Subtext operates in gesture (the cast brushing his hand, tracing the spiral) and in the contrast between translator's duty and personal redemption. One minor slip: "lotus-hearted ache" appears twice and reads as authorial rather than earned from scene particulars, slightly diluting the organic emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (translator's eye for patterns, ocean imagery) but diction occasionally elevates into lyric register that feels imposed rather than character-particular: "funeral shrouds," "fossilized promise," "lotus-hearted ache." The girl's single line of dialogue ("It's a code") is functional but her voice lacks distinct texture. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized") appear frequently without voice motivation, and the prose sometimes narrates micro-states ("his expression unchanged, yet he felt a shift") that reduce immediacy. Psychic distance holds steady, but elevated vocabulary in peak beats (decryption, final exit) clashes slightly with the exhausted, anesthetized focalizer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and several lines do double work (coral fragment as talisman and anxiety tracker), but overwriting clusters in the opening third: "funeral shrouds," "twilight's tears," "fossilized promise," "lotus-hearted ache" stack figurative language without pattern payoff, reducing clarity. Paraphrase loops appear ("the anesthetic had finally kicked in, turning the throbbing ache...into a distant, underwater echo" followed by "the anesthetic was wearing off, the pain...returning") and "shared anxiety" / "lotus-hearted ache" recur as near-synonyms. Template cadence in the middle paragraph: "He'd come here...but instead he'd found..." followed by "he hadn't just unknot...he'd unknot..." creates rhythmic monotony. The closure beat ("smiled, a small, tentative thing") is clean, limiting total artifact penalty, but figurative density in the opening and loops mid-text prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of conflict-zone translator, brain coral fragment, and decrypting a child's cast notes is specific and memorable, avoiding template plots. The emotional arc—from professional mediator to wounded recipient of solace—is grounded in particulars (the anesthetic, the smudged ink, the coral's pulse) rather than abstractions. However, the girl's shrewdly innocent wisdom and her vanishing feel like familiar tropes (wise child, convenient exit), and the final reframing of wounds as maps echoes well-worn therapeutic metaphors without a sharp counter-reading. The risk in juxtaposing oceanic and medical imagery is present but not fully leveraged; the piece opts for gentle resolution over a bolder confrontation with the translator's complicity or the cost of grafting foreign meaning onto trauma.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's role as translator frames his pattern-recognition skill (decrypting the cast notes) and his emotional need (solace from mediation work), appearing in the opening paragraph and shaping the decryption beat. His professional identity enables the key turn but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—he never faces a decision between returning to the zone or refusing the role. The trait is present across beats and charges the final reflection ("the tangled line between his translator's duty and his own quiet need"), but closure hinges more on internal reframing than a translator-specific forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The coral fragment is introduced early ("grafted with a sliver of brain coral"), recurs in at least three beats (initial description, shared pulse with the girl, humming during decryption, final acknowledgment), and its tactile state (pulsing, cool, settling still) evolves to charge the ending image. It constrains tactics by grounding Elias's attention and shapes the closure when it "seemed to pulse once more...before settling still, its job done." Swappability test: another oceanic talisman could function similarly with minor edits, but the brain coral's "quiet intelligence" and grafted physicality anchor the shared-anxiety motif specifically enough to resist easy replacement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Shared anxieties appear explicitly ("shared anxiety with the girl") and implicitly (the coral's pulse mirroring emotional states), but the concept operates more as thematic echo than as a stake-shaping force. It does not narrow options or generate a visible tradeoff on the page—Elias and the girl share a moment of recognition, but no choice hinges on whether to engage that shared state. Setup is present; middle and closure participation are ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is applied to the girl's "curiosity that unnerved him more than any soldier's glare" in the opening, but the trait is label-only without demonstrating a trade-off. The girl offers help ("It's a code") and nods knowingly, but neither action reveals a cost or constraint tied to the simultaneous sharpness and naiveté the phrase promises. Late middle appearance and summary-only use cap the score; ornamental mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unknot" recurs three times: initial description of Elias's professional role ("unknot tangled words"), the active decryption beat ("began to decrypt the mess of words, recognizing a pattern"), and the climactic realization ("he'd unknot something in himself"). The action drives the middle turn (decrypting enables the shift from passive observation to engagement) and articulates the closure, but "decrypt" and "unknot" blur function—either verb could replace the other with negligible impact. The action is causally central but not uniquely irreplaceable; a near-synonym ("untangle," "decode") would preserve the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method (decrypting smudged notes on the cast) is signaled early when Elias notices "smudged notes scrawled across the plaster—half-riddles, half-doodles," introduced at the first third mark. The mechanics matter: "'Empty' isn't a word...it's a direction—toward the hole" and "pointed to a spiral near her wrist. 'This is where you start.'" The decryption enables the key turn and shapes the ending realization ("the smudged notes etched into his memory like the coral's patterns"). Specificity (smudged ink, spiral, riddles) resists easy swapping, and the method ties directly to his translator skill, but the actual decryption is narrated rather than dramatized line-by-line, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The atrium is present from the opening ("mist in the atrium") and recurs across beats (stone bench, hidden fountain revealed then re-concealed, exit into night air). Mist functions as both atmosphere and constraint—it thins to reveal the fountain at the moment of insight and thickens again after the girl vanishes, visually tracking emotional shifts. The twilight deepening to "bruised purple" charges the final exit. However, spatial features (bench, fountain) do not alter tactical choices in a concrete way; the setting supports mood more than it pressures decisions. Micro-setting (the cast as object) does more causal work than the atrium itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The anesthetic kicking in is anchored in the opening ("the anesthetic had finally kicked in, turning the throbbing ache...into a distant, underwater echo") and bookended when "the anesthetic was wearing off, the pain...returning with sharp, familiar edges." The timeframe creates a window for the encounter but does not tighten decisions—no clock forces a choice before the drug wears off, and the girl's disappearance is untracked. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development is absent; the anesthetic shapes perception more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is dramatized through Elias's engagement with the cast notes and the coral fragment, introduced early ("meant to ground him") and tested in the decryption beat. The desire is conflicted—he came "not about armistices but about stillness," yet he actively engages rather than resting. The final image ("the ache not as a wound but as a map") lands the motivation's payoff. However, the want versus cost friction is muted; Elias does not sacrifice a live option or endure visible pain to achieve the grafting. The motivation is present across all three gates and shapes the arc, but the cost remains reflective rather than forfeited.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" appears twice as a phrase and pervades the tone through "twilight's tears," "glistening dew," and "bruised purple" imagery. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly—opening melancholy deepens through shared recognition, then lightens at the fountain reveal—but remains largely static rather than charging through escalation. The final smile ("a small, tentative thing") breaks the ache momentarily, yet the tone in the exit paragraph returns to lyric sorrow. Presence across beats is strong, but the tone does not build pressure or reweight stakes; it decorates rather than drives.</comment>
