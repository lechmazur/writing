<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's herbalist identity and olfactory gift are established, but her choices remain largely observational rather than forcing trade-offs. The multi-month time compression reduces embodied stakes to summary ("Three weeks passed"), flattening the pressure that would make her devotion feel costly. Finn's introduction and the village's gradual involvement provide relational texture, but the lack of internal contradiction or meaningful resistance—everything unfolds as hoped—prevents the final "understanding" from reading as earned transformation versus reflective narration. The closing seed-distribution feels generous rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece orients quickly (treetop village, herbalist, seed) and attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens through the months-long cultivation ritual. However, the closure—Elara's realization that wisdom lay in process and community—arrives as articulated insight rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost; the corpse flower's wilt and seed-sharing carry no forfeiture or trade-off that alters her stance. The montage structure compresses key beats into summary ("seasons turned," "seven months"), obscuring the tightening or deepening required for high-band closure. The inferred lens holds loosely, but the ending reads more as thematic Echo than reweighted particulars.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The treetop village is vividly anchored early with selective sensory detail (rope ladder, moonlight-caught web, misty canopy) and the corpse flower's paradoxical scent filters through Elara's olfactory gift, giving the setting a character-specific texture. The porch and soil bowl recur across beats, grounding the ritual. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains a backdrop for internal reflection—preventing entry to the 9-band. Spatial choreography is clean and the idiom is consistent, but the village's physical properties never pressure Elara's decisions at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivating serenity through tending the corpse flower—is signaled early and sustained across the montage. Yet escalation operates through time-passage summary rather than on-page reversals or tightening choices; Elara faces no meaningful resistance, resource constraint, or competing pressure that forces a trade-off. The bloom arrives as hoped, and the realization follows without visible cost or foreclosed path. Under an Accumulative lens, a single decisive intensification would suffice, but the closure moment articulates theme rather than narrowing options, leaving pressure diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme—embracing decay to understand flourishing—emerges through the corpse flower's cycle and the wrapping-paper journaling custom. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("the undercurrent of wisdom she had chased wasn't found in the rare bloom itself, but in the process"), replacing scene pressure with articulated moral. The community's gradual involvement offers concrete particulars, but the ending's thematic Echo and lack of non-literal resonance prevent higher scoring. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into a tidy epiphany without ambiguity or felt counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization remains stable and the prose carries a gentle, descriptive texture consistent with the "wildflower hush" tone. Dialogue, when present, is functional but brief; Elara's exchange with Finn reads naturally without strong subtext. The narrative voice modulates minimally across the montage, maintaining calm register even at the bloom—missing the opportunity to tighten diction under peak sensory intensity. Filter verbs ("noticed," "whispered") appear but remain voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is present in olfactory detail, though other senses receive less character-specific shaping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure breathes appropriately, with no major loops or template cadence. The opening anchors voice and the prose remains clear throughout. However, several beats rely on summary and stock metaphor ("impossible colors," "spider's web catching moonlight") that soften specificity. The final paragraph front-loads thematic articulation, reducing closure to exposition rather than image-driven resonance. Information density is moderate; many lines advance atmosphere more than character choice. No significant artifacts touch the closure beat, but the montage compression and reflective summary prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The treetop village and olfactory-sensitive herbalist offer distinctive particulars, and the wrapping-paper journaling custom is a memorable detail. However, the emotional arc—patient tending rewarded by realization—follows a familiar contemplative template without a non-obvious turn or synthesis. The corpse flower's symbolic freight is well-worn, and the story's transformation test reveals that the plot and emotional beats could transfer to a ground-level garden with only cosmetic changes. The community-building accent and the sensory focus provide texture, but the premise does not achieve bold risk or irreplaceability in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the choice to plant, tend, and distribute seeds. However, most beats are observational or reflective; she does not face a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. The closing seed-distribution is generous rather than conflicted, and the realization arrives as articulated insight rather than a turn driven by her choice. She is central but not causally active in a way that creates key reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed is planted in the opening, returns as sprout and bud across the montage, and blooms at the climax. It anchors the dominant stake and reappears in the final seed-distribution. However, its properties remain largely symbolic; the seed does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—Elara's devotion succeeds as hoped. It is essential to the plot's structure but does not drive a reversal or trade-off, capping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"The undercurrent of wisdom" appears in Elara's journal entry and is named again in the final paragraph's thematic articulation. It shapes the story's thematic intent but does not alter on-page tactics or narrow options in a scene. The concept remains abstract, echoed rather than dramatized as a force that changes choices or imposes cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elara's olfactory sensitivity is established early and used to detect the seed's "paradoxical scent" and to diagnose villagers. At the bloom, she perceives "the subtle sweetness beneath" that others miss. The trait enables her role but does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—there is no moment where her heightened sensitivity forces a trade-off or complicates her goal. It is functional and present across beats but swappable with another herbal expertise.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Journaling recurs nightly and frames the montage structure; the wrapping-paper entries accumulate across months. However, the act of journaling does not drive a key turn or alter tactics—it documents rather than precipitates change. The final realization could occur without the journal if Elara simply tended the plant and gathered the community. The action is present and consistent but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The family custom of doodling on wrapping-paper interiors is introduced in the opening third, appears in Elara's nightly ritual, and Finn contributes a drawing. It adds texture and ties to the community-building theme. However, the mechanics do not constrain a choice or shape the outcome—standard journaling would serve the same plot function. The method is charming but ornamental, present in two beats but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The treetop village is vividly described and anchors the setting early. Homes "built on sturdy branch foundations that had died to provide new life" echo the theme. However, the village's physical properties do not pressure Elara's choices or supply resources that affect the outcome—she could cultivate the flower in any elevated, quiet place. The setting is atmospheric and consistent but does not alter tactics or charge the closure image beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"The turning of the tide's thought" is named as the twilight hour when Elara journals, recurring across the montage. It marks her ritual timing but does not impose a deadline or tighten decisions—she could journal at any hour. The timeframe is poetic but vague, and the seven-month bloom cycle is summarized rather than tracked as a live clock. Time is present but untracked and does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to cultivate serenity within motion" is stated early and reappears in her final realization. It shapes the thematic intent and her choice to tend the flower rather than chase "changing winds." However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—there is no on-page friction between this desire and a competing want or cost that would force a choice. The motivation is consistent but lacks embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tone is gentle, contemplative, and sensory throughout, matching "wildflower hush." Diction remains calm even at the bloom, modulating only slightly to reflect the scent's intensity. The tone is coherent and supports the thematic focus on patience and serenity. However, it does not shift meaningfully under pressure or charge the final image with tonal contrast—remaining static rather than reconfiguring. The tone is well-executed but does not elevate closure.</comment>
