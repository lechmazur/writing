<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Emmie's motivation is clear and consistent—protect the community and avenge her father—but interiority relies heavily on summary ("her determination unwavering") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "comforting unease" label appears without dramatic texture showing what that paradox feels like in a charged moment. Internal conflict is asserted more than enacted; we're told she's steadfast but don't see her wrestle with doubt or cost until the final decision, which lands cleanly but arrives late. The three failed attempts feel mechanical rather than psychologically distinct.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with a because/therefore chain: Silas's betrayal → Emmie's three attempts → final success with recording → choice to preserve the truce. Closure is a Decisive Change (she gains evidence and chooses strategic revelation over exposure), but the cost is conceptual and stated rather than felt on the page—"she decided" summarizes rather than dramatizes the final trade-off. The three "false starts" function as plot moves but lack distinct tactical evolution; each failure feels like a beat repetition rather than a meaningful tightening that narrows options. Orientation is clean and the lens holds, preventing deeper penalties.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the pier is vividly established with "rotting timbers," "dim lantern light," and "ancient pillars," and the setting clearly frames the underground economy. However, the environment doesn't constrain Emmie's movements or choices in a way that charges the closure—she moves freely through the market, and the "sunrise" deadline is told rather than shown tightening space or access. The watch fob and canvas tent are handled on the page, but spatial choreography during the three attempts remains vague (shadows, guards, diversions mentioned without concrete blocking). The final sunrise image is poetic but doesn't reconfigure the physical stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—protect the community from Silas's betrayal—is signaled early and drives the three attempts. However, escalation reads as repetition rather than tightening: each failure (shadow seen, recognized by guard, diversion) doesn't visibly narrow options or raise cost until the final success. The "sunrise" deadline is mentioned but never dramatized as a live constraint altering tactics on the page. Agency is present (Emmie's choices drive the plot), but the resolution—capturing the recording and deciding to preserve the truce—arrives through assertion rather than a visible trade-off or felt price in the final image. The story tells us the stakes are high but doesn't show them compounding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—trust, betrayal, and the fragile social contracts of underground communities—emerges organically from the "truce of hush" premise. The final choice (preserve the community over full exposure) gestures toward complexity, but the ending explains the thematic calculus rather than embodying it: "she decided that the truce of hush was worth saving" is stated, not shown through a concrete dilemma or image. The "comforting unease" phrase and the watch fob's dual role (inheritance and tool) hint at deeper resonance but remain underdeveloped. No overt moralizing, but the final paragraph tilts toward summary rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice carries a period-appropriate texture ("moonshine runner's daughter," "federal agent," "canvas walls"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with the urgency of the moment: "curiously steadfast," "comforting unease," "delicate balances" read as authorial observation rather than Emmie's lived perception. The three attempts show no variation in her internal voice or rhythm under mounting pressure. Dialogue is absent, so naturalism and subtext cannot be assessed. Perceptual signature is present but not strongly character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Emmie adjusted...Emmie clutched...Emmie retreated...Emmie slipped" creates a repetitive stem pattern across the story. Synonym churn appears in "wavered/stood firm," "thwart/expose," and "determination unwavering/desperation mounting." The phrase "comforting unease" is asserted without concrete embodiment. Mid-story summary ("For her second attempt...Again, she was discovered") compresses key beats that warrant dramatization, flattening momentum. Figurative language is sparse and stock ("echoed like distant thunder"). Information density is moderate—most sentences advance plot—but scaffold phrasing ("she was curiously steadfast," "she found herself moving") dulls immediacy. Artifact penalty: −1.0 cumulative for loops, stems, and summary compression of pivotal beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The underground pirate-market premise and moonshine-runner inheritance offer period texture, but the "recording device in an antique watch fob" feels gadget-convenient rather than organically integrated into 19th/early-20th-century plausibility. The three-attempt structure is functional but predictable; each failure is interchangeable rather than revealing new facets of character or world. The final choice (strategic revelation vs. full exposure) is a solid moral calculus but arrives through summary rather than a surprising synthesis. "Truce of hush" is a fresh phrase but underexplored as a social mechanism. Risk-taking is modest; the story plays it safe within genre conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Emmie drives all major beats: inherits the trade and device, pursues Silas across three attempts, captures the recording, and makes the final choice. Her decisions alter tactics (disguise, diversion) and the ending hinges on her stance. Early setup, middle development across all attempts, and closure participation are all present. Causal pressure is clear. Cost is conceptual (choosing strategic revelation over full exposure) but legible. Strong integration with minor deduction for the final choice being summarized rather than dramatized in a charged moment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The watch fob appears in the opening description, is clutched and activated mid-story, and is pressed against the canvas in the climactic recording beat—three distinct touches. Its dual role (inheritance and surveillance tool) is functional and specific. However, it's not reweighted or returned with altered meaning at closure; once it captures the recording, it disappears from the final paragraph. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, but the closure linkage is weak. Causal pressure is present (enables the mission), but no cost is tied to the object itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Truce of hush" is named early and framed as the community's survival pact. It shapes Emmie's final decision (preserve it vs. expose everyone), giving it closure participation. However, the concept is explained more than dramatized—we're told it's enforced by "mutual survival" but never see it tested or constraining a choice until the very end. Middle development is weak; the truce doesn't alter tactics during the three attempts. Setup and payoff gates met, but lack of on-page pressure through the middle beats limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" is asserted once in summary ("she was curiously steadfast in a way her father had been") but never enacted on the page with a visible trade-off. The trait is label-only; we don't see a moment where steadfastness costs her speed, flexibility, or safety. Her determination is mentioned repeatedly, but the attribute itself ("curiously") is ornamental. Setup is present but late (second paragraph), no middle constraint, no closure linkage. Swappable with "determined" or "resolute."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Thwart" drives the entire plot: Emmie's mission is to stop Silas's betrayal, and all three attempts plus the final success serve that action. Early setup, middle development across the attempts, and closure participation when she succeeds and decides how to use the evidence. The action is irreplaceable—changing "thwart" to "expose" or "confront" would require only minor edits, but the tactical through-line depends on preventing the betrayal before sunrise. Strong causal pressure and cost (strategic revelation vs. full exposure). Minor deduction for the final choice being summarized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"False starts" is signaled early ("she would do so through false starts—failed attempts") and structures the middle: three distinct attempts that fail before the fourth succeeds. The method shapes the plot architecture and is specific to the character's approach. However, the mechanics of why each failure matters aren't differentiated—each attempt feels like a beat repetition rather than a tactical evolution that teaches Emmie something new. Setup and development gates met; payoff is implicit (the final attempt succeeds) but not charged with reweighted meaning. Functional but not deeply causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pirate market is established early with vivid detail (rotting pier, dim lanterns, underground bazaar) and frames all action. It provides resources (contraband, diversions, Silas's tent) and social context (the truce). Spatial elements (shadows, canvas walls, slanted beams of sunrise) are handled across multiple beats. However, the setting doesn't constrain Emmie's choices in a way that charges the closure—she moves freely, and the environment's pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical. Setup, development, and mild payoff (sunrise piercing the boards) gates met, but closure linkage is weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is mentioned three times as the deadline for Silas's immunity deal, framing urgency. However, the clock is never tracked on the page—we don't feel time tightening or altering Emmie's tactics during the attempts. The sunrise appears only at the end as a visual marker ("first rays of sunlight") without on-page consequence for what would have happened if she'd missed it. Setup present, no middle development (time doesn't constrain choices), weak payoff. The timeframe is declared but not dramatized as a live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Emmie's motivation—"to capture the sound of trust breaking"—is poetic and drives the recording mission. The phrase is literal (the watch fob records Silas's confession) and thematic (documenting betrayal). Setup is clear, and the goal shapes all middle attempts and the climactic success. However, the desire isn't conflicted or tested—we don't see friction between this want and another cost until the final decision, which is summarized. Causal pressure is strong, but the motivation lacks embodied complexity on the page. Closure participation is conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" is named once mid-story ("The comforting unease that defined her existence settled over her once more") but is never enacted through contradictory sensory detail, rhythm, or tonal modulation. The phrase is asserted rather than woven into the narrative texture. Tone remains declarative and summary-driven throughout, without the intimate, contradictory layering the phrase promises. No setup in the opening, brief middle mention, no payoff. Label-only; swappable with "familiarity of danger" without structural loss.</comment>
