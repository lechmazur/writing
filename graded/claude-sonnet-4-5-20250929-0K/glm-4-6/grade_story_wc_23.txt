<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The navigator's grief and ritual are embodied through tactile detail (tracing coat seams, the warming censer foot), but interiority often veers into abstract declaration ("grief had its own logic") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The choice to stop answering the phone and walk "through" grief arrives without visible on-page cost that forecloses a prior path—it reads as acceptance rather than renunciation with pressure. Micro-choices (sketching the map, placing the censer foot) exist but lack the friction of competing wants that would drive higher-stakes embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early (who, where, when). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the map-building ritual accumulates meaning through repeated handling of the censer foot and patches, culminating in a tonal shift ("the navigation was the solace"). However, the closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration reading as Earned Stasis—lacks a felt cost on the page; the final walk "through" grief is asserted rather than earned by a choice that forecloses options. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but the Cost proof test reveals no exact sentence where a trade-off or price materializes at closure, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The signal station is vividly anchored (failed hydraulics, dusty glass, cold floor, rotary phone) and the censer foot functions as micro-setting, constraining the map ritual and charging the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the navigator's grief-laden attention. The station's silence and the moon's phases subtly guide the ritual's tempo, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint and closure linkage, but pervasive abstract phrasing ("geography of loss," "tomb of static") slightly dilutes spatial immediacy at peak moments, capping the score just below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—navigating loss through ritual—is signaled early and accumulates through the map-building sequence. One tightening occurs when the navigator stops answering the phone, but this forecloses no live option with visible cost; the phone was already ignored. The censer foot's cooling marks completion, yet no trade-off or tension resolves on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight via a pattern break or cadence shift that narrows options; here the final walk is asserted without prior friction, yielding mid-band escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the map ritual and the censer foot's phases, avoiding overt thesis statements. The final image—walking "through" grief with the censer foot in hand—offers a non-literal answer to loss as navigation. However, phrases like "the geography of loss remained, etched into him" and "the navigation was the solace" veer toward thematic echo, diluting earned resonance. The recurrence of patches and the censer foot charges the ending without symbolic convenience, but the closing summary ("the solace was enough") approaches a stated moral, triggering a −0.3 deduction within the 7-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a lyric, grief-saturated perceptual signature (moon as "silver coin waiting to be spent," stars as "unanswered prayers"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful compression in the final paragraph. However, psychic distance wavers: "he'd almost forgotten the last time he'd used it—before the hydraulics failed" injects backstory that does not anchor in a present stimulus, and the closing universal address ("for anyone who dared to navigate their own loss") breaks focalization by invoking a reader-facing perspective. These slips prevent higher scores but do not touch the closure image itself.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several patterns drag momentum: paraphrase loops ("The station's silence wasn't empty anymore; it was filled with the quiet promise of return" echoes prior silence descriptions), stock metaphors ("stars whispered back," "moon hung like a silver coin"), and synonym churn around "loss," "grief," "solace," and "silence." Template cadence appears in the final third: "The navigation was the solace, and the solace was enough. The journey had no end, but that didn't matter." These artifacts cluster near closure, triggering a −1.2 deduction in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The reverse-migration-as-ritual premise and the censer foot as grief compass offer a fresh synthesis, but the execution leans on familiar templates: the isolated keeper in a defunct station, the midnight-phone-call mystery, the map-as-therapy motif. The patchwork coat and moon-phase fluctuation add texture, yet these details remain ornamental rather than driving causal turns. The ending's universalizing gesture ("for anyone who dared to navigate their own loss") and the serene acceptance without visible trade-off soften risk, placing the piece in mid-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The patchwork navigator is present throughout and makes choices (sketching the map, not answering the phone, walking at the end), but these are low-stakes actions that do not create reversals or foreclose live options with cost. The character's role is more observer and ritual-performer than agent driving turns. Two beats (map-building, final walk) involve the navigator, but neither alters tactics under pressure, capping the score in the mid-5s per the gate model and beat-involvement guidance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The censer foot appears in multiple beats (warming/pulsing early, guiding the map sketch, cooling at completion, held during the final walk) and is seeded in the first paragraph. Its bronze patina and moon-phase fluctuation are described, and it functions as a ritual anchor. However, its role is primarily symbolic and descriptive; it does not constrain a choice or impose a trade-off with visible cost. The final reprise charges the ending image but does not reweight prior material causally, placing it in the 6.5–7.0 range per closure linkage and beat involvement, with a −0.2 adjustment for ornamental use at key moments.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Reverse migration is named and thematically central ("tracing the outlines of what had been"), but it does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. The concept remains abstract; the map-building and walk are forward actions framed as "reverse" only by metaphor. It appears early and returns at closure, meeting two gates, but lacks causal pressure or cost linkage, capping it near 5.0 per the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The censer foot's fluctuation with moon phases is described ("softer at half-moon, sharper at full") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action. The moon is present in the setting, yet no choice depends on the phase or its effect on the object. This remains label-only, appearing early and at closure but without visible trade-off, placing it in the low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The action "build" (the map on the floor) occupies the middle section and structures the ritual sequence, meeting setup and development gates. However, the map is ephemeral ("would fade with the dawn") and does not drive a turn or impose cost; it is completed without friction and does not redefine options at closure. The final walk is the closure action, not the building. One distinct beat with moderate causal involvement yields mid-5s per the guidance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Cryptic midnight phone calls are mentioned twice (the phone rings once, the voice is described in summary), meeting setup, but the method is not used or shown shaping attempts—the navigator explicitly does not answer. The calls are declared to deliver coordinates but never enacted on the page. Swappable and summary-only, this lands in the low-functional band with a −0.5 swappability deduction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is anchored early (failed hydraulics, rotary phone, cold floor, dusty glass, window) and recurs across beats, meeting all three gates. The station's silence and isolation pressure the ritual, and the window frames the final moon image. However, the setting does not alter a tactic or supply a resource that changes outcome; it provides atmosphere and ritual space without constraint. Closure linkage and beat involvement elevate it to mid-6s, with a −0.3 ornamental-use adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the hydraulics fail" is signaled in the opening paragraph and anchors the station's defunct state, meeting setup. However, the failure does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; it is backstory context. The midnight phone call implies a clock, but time does not track or escalate pressure. Late first appearance of consequence and no causal role yield low-functional scoring near the 4.6 cap for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to navigate loss is dramatized through the map ritual and the censer foot's use, appearing early and shaping the middle sequence. The navigator's desire is embodied rather than told-only. However, friction between wants and costs is minimal; the ritual proceeds without trade-off, and the final walk is acceptance rather than renunciation with pressure. Two beats and closure presence elevate it into the 6s, but lack of visible cost caps further gain.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Raw solace is coherent through the piece: lyric diction, grief-saturated imagery, the quiet ritual, and the closing acceptance. Tone modulates subtly (silence deepens, stars "lean in," the navigator smiles "a raw, fragile thing") and charges the final image. However, the tone remains largely static across turns rather than shifting with escalation, and the closing summary ("the solace was enough") verbalizes the tone rather than embodying it. Strong closure linkage and coherence yield mid-6s with a −0.3 static-mood adjustment.</comment>
