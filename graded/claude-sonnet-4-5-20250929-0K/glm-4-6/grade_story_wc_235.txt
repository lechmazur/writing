<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior state—temporal confusion and jealousy of past selves—is established early and embodied through the gravestone discovery. However, his journey remains largely contemplative; the peak moment ("For one perfect moment...he began to soar") arrives as epiphany rather than earned choice under contradictory pressure. The jealousy method andchronological confusion function more as atmospheric labels than contradictory impulses that force a visible tradeoff. Interiority occasionally slides into diagnostic phrasing ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") that reads thematic rather than lived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure—Elias's shift from passive documentation to the realization that "beginning again remains the most beautiful rebellion." The cost is conceptual: acceptance of predetermined mortality as liberation rather than trap. Orientation is clear (mountain cabin, post-gravestone discovery). However, the escalation is primarily reflective density increase without on-page micro-choices that narrow options; the final "smile" and perspective shift feel asserted rather than causally compelled by prior scene pressure. The temporal scrambling teaches a pattern but doesn't pay off in altered tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mountain cabin anchors throughout; wind, cold breath, and bruised-purple dusk are woven into Elias's emotional state without postcard excess. The birch bark scroll returns with reweighted meaning at closure, and the physical act of stepping into darkness charges the final image. Spatial choreography (table, door, mountain darkness) remains coherent and the setting's isolation mirrors his existential solitude, constraining social escape and forcing introspection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: distilling temporal chaos into narrative coherence to survive knowledge of his own death. One meaningful deepening occurs (the realization that backward-looking might be freedom), but it arrives via reflection rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The gravestone premise promises high stakes yet the story never tests Elias with a concrete decision—write versus not write, return to the grave versus stay away—that would demonstrate agency under pressure. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist action; the shift is perceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—mortality's weight versus the rebellion of beginning again—emerges from image and action (gravestone, scroll, stepping into night) without overt moralizing. The final line offers a resonant answer to the central question of how to live after seeing one's end. However, several prompt-label phrases ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder," "distill chaos into narrative") hover closer to thematic declaration than organic discovery, and the epiphany lacks friction or competing cost that would deepen ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent literary-philosophical register appropriate to a "lucid dream chronicler," and the temporal confusion is reflected in syntax ("I remember (will remember?) tomorrow's sunrise"). However, several phrases—"feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder," "distill chaos into narrative"—read as imposed concept-labels rather than character-specific perception. The voice is distinct but occasionally tips into explaining its own themes rather than trusting image and action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and sensory detail is selective. However, multiple instances of paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "temporal confusion" / "chronologically confused" / "scrambled existence" cycle across paragraphs; "distill chaos into narrative" / "make sense of the disjointed visions" restate without added pressure. The phrase "birch bark scroll" recurs six times in 800 words with minimal variation. Template cadence in the opening ("Time had grown slippery...or was it last decade? / dates already chiseled...though the end date remained distressingly near") creates artificial parallel structures. These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.4), and synonym churn (−0.3) penalties totaling −0.9, plus minor density loss, lands the score here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—man discovers his own grave and documents temporal confusion—echoes familiar metaphysical territory (Borges, Slaughterhouse-Five's unstuck-in-time motif). The story does not transform the template through occupational specificity (what does a lucid dream chronicler actually do?) or a non-obvious moral calculus; Elias's final acceptance reads predictable given the setup. The birch bark scroll and mountain cabin add texture but don't supply a distinctive synthesis. Derivative premise adjustment (−0.8) and lack of risk-taking that heightens stakes lower the band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his occupation is named early. However, his role as "lucid dream chronicler" remains label-only; we never see him navigate or document a dream in scene, nor does the skill constrain or enable a key choice. He writes on the scroll but the content is retrospective summary. Late middle touch (writing scene) and ornamental use cap integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll appears early (paragraph one), is handled in the writing scene (paragraph five onward), and returns in the final image as "waiting...ready to receive tomorrow's yesterday." It shifts from "constant companion" to active tool to symbolic anchor. However, its specific properties (birch bark versus paper) never constrain a choice or alter tactics; it could be swapped for any writing surface. Two-gate presence (setup, closure reprise) with lyric resonance but swappability limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" is named early and described ("untamed longing for yesterday"), but it functions as thematic atmosphere rather than a force that narrows options. Elias's jealousy of past selves is told more than dramatized; no on-page moment shows him choosing one tactic over another because nostalgia made a path unavailable. The concept echoes in the ending's backward-versus-forward tension but does not shape stakes with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is established early (paragraph one: "Time had grown slippery") and recurs throughout. However, the trait remains descriptive label; it does not constrain an on-page action with cost. Elias never misses a deadline, misjudges elapsed time in a way that matters, or loses an object because past and future blur. The confusion colors his interiority but does not enable or foreclose a choice. Late-penalty waived (present early), but label-only use and swappability cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Soar" appears twice: once metaphorically in childhood dreams (paragraph three) and again in the penultimate paragraph as the breakthrough realization ("he began to soar...not flying...but understanding"). The second instance is the peak turn, reweighting his stance from passive documentation to active rebellion. However, the action is abstract ("understanding") rather than physical; the verb could be replaced with "awaken" or "transcend" without structural loss. Closure linkage and causal role elevate the score, but swappability and late first concrete use limit it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Getting jealous of past selves" is introduced early (paragraph two), appears in Elias's interior monologue (paragraph three), and is revisited in the writing scene (paragraph six: "the method he'd adopted"). The mechanism shapes his survival tactic but does not constrain a concrete choice with visible cost; we never see him reject a forward-looking option because jealousy blocked it. Present across three beats (early, middle, late) but remains more theme than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin is named in the opening line, supplies cold/wind/isolation across middle beats, and frames the final exit into darkness. It anchors location and reinforces solitude. However, the cabin itself—its layout, tools, isolation from help—never constrains a choice. Elias could conduct the same reflective arc in any remote dwelling. Spatial choreography is clear (table, door, night outside) but the specific setting does not alter tactics or charge closure beyond generic "remote place." Setup and closure presence with functional but replaceable role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after seeing your own grave" is established in paragraph one (discovery "yesterday, or was it last decade?") and the grave dates with "end date...distressingly near" create urgency. The premise shapes the dominant stake (how to live knowing the end) and the final rebellion against predetermined fate. However, the timeframe remains abstract; no live countdown or deadline forces a choice within the story's present. The element frames stakes conceptually but does not tighten on-page decisions. Setup, middle coloring, and closure linkage with conceptual cost qualify for mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"To distill chaos into narrative" is named explicitly in paragraph four ("Tonight he meant to distill chaos into narrative") and again in the ending's implicit answer (birch bark scroll "ready to receive tomorrow's yesterday"). It drives Elias's writing action and his final realization that beginning again is rebellion. However, the motivation is told more than tested; no scene shows him choosing narrative over another coping method (e.g., burning the scroll, leaving the cabin). Present early, middle action, closure echo, but friction between want and cost is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Jaded wonder" is named in paragraph four and embodied throughout: Elias documents the impossible yet remains weary ("awareness of magic's mundanity and its persistent, impossible reality"). The tone is coherent through turns and modulates in the ending from weary neutrality ("years of practiced neutrality") to "genuine expression" and the lighter final image. The oxymoron charges the closure by showing that wonder can coexist with knowledge of mortality. However, the label itself ("jaded wonder") is stated rather than entirely trusted to image and voice. Strong coherence and closure charge with minor tell-over-show friction.</comment>
