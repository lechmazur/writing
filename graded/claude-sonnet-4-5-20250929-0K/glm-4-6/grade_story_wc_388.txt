<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's professional skepticism is established early and her sharply observant nature drives the letter reconstruction, but her interiority reads as summary rather than embodied contradiction. The shift from debunker to truth-excavator is declared rather than earned through on-page tension between competing impulses. Her final stance arrives via exposition ("she now understood") instead of a dramatized micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The piece tells us she's changed without showing the moment of renunciation or decision that makes the before/after legible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: progressive discovery through letter reassembly builds toward a final reweighting. However, the closure unit—Maya's decision to "excavate truth" rather than debunk—is stated in the final paragraphs as retrospective summary without an on-page moment where cost or consequence becomes visible. The orientation test passes (who, where, when anchored early), and the two-shard structure (orchard exploration → letter reconstruction) is legible, but the final reconfiguration lacks the felt or conceptual price required for Resonant Reconfiguration. The piece gestures toward Conceptual Repricing (flawed perfection as balance) but the cost remains abstract rather than undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The radioactive orchard is vivid and specific, with amber apples, crimson pears, and hazed sky creating a coherent impossible-ecosystem backdrop. The glass pavilion and its clean air provide a constraining micro-setting that allows Maya to remove her mask, and the Flawed Diamond's physical crack (分割其中心—though the mixed-script intrusion reads as an artifact) anchors the thematic core. However, the orchard's sensory details remain largely static postcards; wind "howls" but doesn't force tactical adjustments, and the contaminated soil's isotope-processing mechanics are told rather than shown altering Maya's approach. The setting informs but does not meaningfully constrain choices at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing or understanding the orchard's anomaly—is signaled early, but pressure remains declarative rather than escalating through on-page reversals. Maya's two weeks of study compress into summary, and the letter reconstruction (the one extended beat) deepens knowledge without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. The final "decision" to write a different report is stated after the fact with no visible cost: no client confrontation, no professional risk dramatized, no moment where she chooses truth over income. Agency exists but the renunciation that should foreclose a path happens off-page, leaving the stakes abstract at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of flawed perfection enabling transformation emerges organically from the diamond's crack and the orchard's thriving imperfection, and the "comfortable lies" motif threads through corporate cover-up and Maya's profession. However, the final paragraphs lean heavily into thesis statements: "precisely what humanity had lost," "false choice between destruction and perfection," and "simply the truth, waiting to be reassembled" all articulate theme rather than letting the image resonate. The Flawed Diamond's conceptual repricing is visible, but the moralizing in the last four paragraphs ("embraced imperfection," "balance at its center") replaces scene pressure with exposition, lowering thematic impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Maya as sole focalizer, and her professional lens shapes what she notices (water marks, grain of paper). However, narrative distance wavers: "her sharply observant eyes" and "her sharply observant nature" feel externalized, and peak moments default to filter verbs ("she discovered," "she understood," "Maya now understood"). The prose carries a uniform explanatory cadence rather than modulating with urgency, and the final paragraphs' elevated diction ("altogether different," "stillpoint of balance") drifts from the grounded investigator voice established early. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not assessed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The text carries pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "sharply observant" appears twice verbatim, "Maya now understood" and "she now understood" echo within two paragraphs, and runs of "The [noun] [verb]" or "Maya [verb]" stems flatten rhythm. Stock phrasing ("against a sky perpetually hazed," "layers of convenient narratives," "something altogether different") and mixed-script artifact (分割其中心) disrupt clarity. High-pressure beats—letter reconstruction, final realization—are summarized ("piece by piece," "by the time") rather than shown in concrete action. Information density is moderate, but scaffold and synonym churn accumulate to −1.0+ in this category, and the closure beat is dulled by exposition rather than image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The radioactive orchard premise and quantum-resonance diamond offer a fresh SF lens, and the letter-reassembly investigation provides tactile specificity. However, the core emotional arc—skeptic becomes believer through evidence—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. The "flawed perfection" motif is telegraphed early and restated rather than discovered, and the closure's "comfortable lies" phrasing echoes prompt language. The piece gestures at risk (corporate conspiracy, radioactive setting) but resolves into thematic summary rather than an image that redefines prior material, leaving the synthesis competent but not inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya as conspiracy debunker frames the setup and her professional skepticism drives the investigation, but her role becomes passive observer during the orchard survey and letter reconstruction. The pivot from debunker to truth-excavator is told in the final paragraphs without an on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle, closure mention) but does not create key turns through choices under pressure; her function is largely to witness and summarize.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Flawed Diamond is introduced early (setup gate), examined in the pavilion (middle gate), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (payoff gate). Its visible crack and quantum-resonance properties differentiate it from generic magical objects, and the stillpoint function shapes the orchard's survival. However, Maya never handles or tests the diamond on the page; it remains described rather than used in beats. The closure repricing ("the diamond's flaw was what made it perfect") leans thematic rather than causal, and the object could be replaced by another anomalous artifact with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "hidden stillpoint" concept is named by villagers early and explained via reconstructed letters, but it does not shape Maya's tactics or constrain choices on the page. The stillpoint functions as thematic backdrop (balance, transformation) rather than a causal force that alters options. It reappears at closure as metaphor ("stillpoint around which this entire impossible ecosystem revolved") but remains abstract; removing the exact term "stillpoint" and replacing it with "equilibrium" or "catalyst" would not break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is named twice verbatim and demonstrated in the letter-reassembly beat (patterns of ink, water marks, grain of paper), satisfying setup and middle gates. The trait enables the puzzle solution but does not impose a visible cost or tradeoff—no moment where hyper-focus blinds her to social cues or drains stamina. At closure, the trait is restated as label ("those observant enough to recognize them") without new consequence. The attribute is functional but replaceable; "meticulous" or "analytical" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears twice: once when Maya discovers the letters ("she could intuit what had really happened") and again implicitly in the final insight. The action drives the middle turn (connecting fragments reveals the conspiracy) and the closure realization, satisfying all three gates. However, the intuition is told in summary ("piece by piece... she could intuit") rather than shown through a dramatized leap or mistake, and the mechanics remain opaque. Swapping "intuit" for "deduce" or "reconstruct" would not break causality, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Reassembling shredded letters is introduced at the midpoint ("discovered her first real clue: shredded letters"), demonstrated across the night-long reconstruction beat (patterns of ink, water marks, grain of paper guide the puzzle), and delivers the conspiracy revelation that reframes the closure. The method shapes Maya's approach (meticulous, tactile work) and the mechanics matter on the page. However, it arrives after the 40% mark and could be replaced by another forensic task (recovering deleted files, decoding journals) without altering the emotional arc, limiting the score to strong mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is anchored in the opening line, provides the investigation's frame throughout (radiation mask, contaminated soil, radioactive winds, glass pavilion with clean air), and charges the final image (trees that shouldn't live, balance amid imperfection). The setting constrains Maya's movement (mask removal only in the pavilion) and supplies the physical evidence (shredded letters in the research cabin) that drives the plot. The radioactive dust storms and isotope-processing roots are specific and irreplaceable, and the orchard's thriving state embodies the theme without being merely decorative. All three gates are satisfied with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the liquidation of the OmniGen Corporation" anchors the timeframe in the opening, and "three months had passed" provides specificity. However, the liquidation itself remains off-page backstory, and the timeframe does not tighten Maya's tactics or create urgency. The two-week study and night-long letter reconstruction compress into summary without a live clock pressuring choices. The timeframe is present (setup gate) but passive; removing "three months" and "two weeks" would not break the story's logic or closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Excavate truth from comfortable lies" is stated explicitly in the final paragraph and implied earlier when Maya is hired to "expose how someone was faking this orchard" but finds no fabrication. The motivation drives her investigation (setup and middle gates) and reframes the closure decision (to write a report that excavates rather than debunks). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—no client pressure, no income risk, no moment where comfort tempts her to lie. The motivation is functional but frictionless, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>
