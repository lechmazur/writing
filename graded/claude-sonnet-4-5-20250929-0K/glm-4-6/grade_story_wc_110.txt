<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The registrar's internal experience remains largely observational rather than conflicted; his decision to step forward lacks the foregrounding of contradictory impulses that would make it feel inevitable. The two figures show more embodied tension (shoulders knotting, trembling hand), but their arc from mistrust to trust unfolds primarily through symbolic gestures rather than dramatized friction with visible cost. The tea invitation and final gathering feel earned by the doodle progression but the registrar's own stakes—what he risks or loses by engaging—never materialize on the page. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("the world had become sharp enough") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive by the opening paragraph (registrar, forecourt, post-verbal world). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the doodle sequence (broken key → cracked mirror → unbroken circle) and the registrar's decision to step into the forecourt, culminating in the tea invitation and the final gathering. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the registrar moves from solitary polishing to shared silence), but the cost remains implicit—loneliness acknowledged, connection offered—without a legible forfeiture or trade-off that narrows options. The final image (tea, forecourt whisper as applause, "freed by honesty, bound by silence") reweights the premise yet the price paid is more atmospheric than actionable, placing closure in the Charged Poise neighborhood without a sharp on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crystal whispering stones and rain-pooled forecourt anchor the setting with sensory specificity (hum, shimmer, lamplight) and recur throughout, charging the final gathering. The abandoned theater and shattered desk supply spatial coherence and trace the post-verbal world without exposition dumps. The lens object and kettle function as micro-setting anchors that enable the registrar's choice to invite the figures inside. However, the setting does not constrain a choice under pressure—it amplifies atmosphere rather than narrowing tactical options—so it does not meet the 9+ gate despite its vivid presence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the registrar will engage or remain isolated—is signaled early and tightens when he steps into the forecourt. The doodle progression (broken key, cracked mirror, unbroken circle) provides one meaningful deepening: the second figure's shoulders relax, the first figure offers the ticket, and the registrar invites them in. However, the escalation is driven more by the figures' symbolic exchange than by the registrar's agency; his move into the forecourt and the tea offer are responses rather than choices that foreclose a path with visible cost. No trade-off or loss appears on the page—no risk that joining them might shatter his quiet or obligate him—so the tightening remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of connection through transparency emerges concretely from the doodle sequence and the registrar's decision to step forward, avoiding direct statement until the final lyric summary. The lens object (clarity "no longer needed") and the forecourt's hum function as recurring images that shift meaning from forced clarity to organic resonance. The final line ("sometimes the loudest truths are the ones we never speak") edges toward overt moralizing but is anchored by the prior particulars—tea, silence, the figures' nod. The piece resists tidy binaries (words unnecessary yet still freeing) and the quiet ending reweights the opening solitude with felt potential. However, the thematic answer is more stated than embodied in a non-literal final action, keeping it just below the 9+ threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization through the registrar is stable, with perceptual filtering (his breath fogging the lens, pulse quickening) that reflects his habitual quiet. The prose carries a consistent lyric register ("resonant hush," "ambiguously clear") that fits the post-verbal premise. However, the narration occasionally drifts into helpful-narrator mode ("He knew then that the quiet wasn't empty") and the final paragraph's summary statements ("Life, he decided, was ambiguously clear") reduce psychic distance at the closure beat. No dialogue is present to judge. Diction remains controlled but the repeated philosophical framing ("the world had become sharp enough," "sometime the loudest truths") begins to read as template cadence rather than character-particular thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is grammatically clean and sensory detail is vivid (crystal whispering stones, rain-kissed, ceramic clinking). However, patterned artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences ("the quiet wasn't empty—it was full of potential, of stories waiting to unfold" followed by lens-as-relic summary; "freed by honesty" repeated three times in the final third), template cadence runs of "The registrar [verb]" across multiple beats, and stock metaphors ("shoulders knotting like tangled thread," "wrapped around them like a blanket"). The final paragraph stacks summary-tell ("the registrar understood," "he decided," "they all knew") that dulls the closure image rather than sharpening it. Filter-verb density ("he'd seen," "he realized," "he knew," "he understood," "he decided," "he glanced") clusters in the final third, flattening immediacy. Apply −1.2 for loops, template cadence, and filter stacks touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The post-verbal world premise and symbolic doodle communication offer a fresh angle on mistrust-to-connection arcs, and the crystal whispering forecourt is a specific, memorable anchor. However, the emotional trajectory (isolated observer witnesses reconciliation, steps forward, offers tea) follows a familiar template without transformation through unexpected cost or tactics. The lens-as-clarity metaphor is straightforward rather than reweighted through action, and the final gathering resolves into a stock epiphany ("the loudest truths are the ones we never speak") that could apply to many stories. The middle-ground hedging (registrar's risk-free invitation, figures' immediate acceptance) avoids bold, specific choices that would anchor the premise in lived consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The quiet night registrar is present throughout and makes two choices: stepping into the forecourt and offering tea. However, these decisions feel reactive—prompted by the figures' reconciliation—rather than creating key turns. His interior work (polishing the lens, eavesdropping, pocketing the lens) does not narrow options or generate new complications. He is more observer than agent; removing him would weaken the frame but the doodle reconciliation between the two figures could proceed independently. Present by ~10% (early), involved in two beats (forecourt step, tea offer), but neither choice forecloses a path with cost or redefines the stakes. Cap at 4.6 for missing strong middle development that constrains later choices; +0.2 for early signal and two-beat presence lands at 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The lens from the projector is introduced in the opening line, handled twice (polishing, fogging with breath), and returns in the final paragraph ("a relic of a time when clarity had to be forced") with thematic reweighting. The lens signals the clarity/honesty theme and the registrar pockets it when "the world had become sharp enough," marking a shift. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure—it functions as a symbolic prop rather than a causal tool. Present early (~2%), appears in three beats (opening, mid-scene fog, final dismissal), closure linkage weak (mentioned but not decisive), specificity moderate (projector lens vs. any clarity object). 3.0 base + 0.3 early + 0.9 three beats + 0.3 specificity + 0.5 lyric reprise – 0.4 ornamental (no pressure role) – 0.7 (not causally active at closure) = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core concept "freed by honesty" is dramatized through the doodle sequence (broken key offered whole, cracked mirror mending) and the registrar's decision to step forward after witnessing transparency in action. The concept shapes the dominant stake (whether mistrust can thaw) and the final gathering enacts the freeing effect. The phrase "Freed by honesty" appears on the page twice, including in the final paragraph, tying concept to closure. However, the concept is more thematic frame than tactical constraint—it does not force a trade-off or narrow options with visible cost. Present by ~30% (doodle sequence begins), drives one major beat (registrar's step), shapes ending (tea gathering as liberation). 3.0 base + 0.5 mid-signal + 0.4 one beat + 0.7 closure link + 0.5 causal (enables step) + 0.6 cost (loneliness acknowledged) – 0.5 (late concept articulation, second third) = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The attribute "ambiguously clear" appears explicitly twice: as a descriptor of the doodles ("ambiguous but clear") and in the registrar's final reflection ("Life, he decided, was ambiguously clear"). The attribute characterizes the post-verbal communication mode and the story's tone, but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. It functions as a thematic label rather than a trait that forces a choice. Present by ~20% (doodles described), mentioned in final third, no middle beat constraint, ornamental use. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; 3.0 base + 0.5 early signal + 0.3 label specificity – 0.7 (ornamental, no pressure role) = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The action "eavesdrop" is present when the registrar leans in to observe the doodles ("decided to eavesdrop. Not through sound, but through the only language left that mattered: symbols"). This choice enables him to witness the reconciliation and later step forward. However, the eavesdropping itself is passive observation rather than a choice that creates a turn or raises cost—he simply watches. The major turn (his step into the forecourt) traces to what he saw, not the act of seeing. Present by ~15%, involved in one beat (observation), enables the step but does not itself narrow options. 3.0 base + 0.5 early signal + 0.4 one beat + 0.5 enables step – 0.8 (swappable: "observe" or "notice" would serve equally) = 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method "cryptic doodles on concert tickets" is signaled early (~12%) and used across three beats: the first figure sketches (broken key, cracked mirror, unbroken circle), the registrar interprets, and the final unbroken circle on the offered ticket marks resolution. The mechanics matter—each doodle shifts the second figure's posture and the progression drives the reconciliation—so the method is not merely ornamental. However, the doodles resolve the figures' mistrust without complication; no failed symbol or misread message raises cost. Present early, three beats, causal (enables reconciliation), closure link (ticket offered), moderate specificity (doodles on tickets vs. any post-verbal sign). 3.0 base + 0.8 early + 0.9 three beats + 1.0 causal + 0.7 closure + 0.4 specificity = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt after rain is introduced in the opening paragraph, recurs when the registrar steps onto it (stones shimmer), and appears in the final image ("the forecourt whispered again, but this time, it felt like applause"). The setting's hum and shimmer create atmosphere and the rain-kissed stones mark the shift to communal presence. However, the forecourt does not constrain a choice or supply a resource under pressure—it amplifies mood rather than altering tactics. Present by ~8%, three beats (opening, registrar's step, final whisper), closure linkage strong (final image), specificity high (crystal whispering stones). 3.0 base + 0.8 early + 0.9 three beats + 1.2 closure – 0.5 (no tactical constraint) = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after words become unnecessary" is established in the opening paragraph and governs the doodle communication mode. It shapes the premise (why symbols matter, why the registrar's spoken "I see you" is described as "unnecessary but freeing") but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The post-verbal world is backdrop rather than pressure; no deadline or time-limited choice appears. Present by ~10%, mentioned twice (opening, final reflection on words), no middle beat where time alters tactics. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; 3.0 base + 0.5 early – 0.5 (ornamental, no clock pressure) – 0.7 (does not constrain choice) = 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to thaw mistrust with transparency" is dramatized through the first figure's doodles (offering the broken key whole, mending the mirror) and the registrar's choice to step forward and say "I see you." The desire is enacted in choices (doodling, stepping, inviting) and conflicted by the second figure's initial tension and the registrar's pulse quickening. The cost is implicit—vulnerability in a post-verbal world, breaking solitude—but not sharply articulated as a trade-off. Present by ~20% (doodle sequence), drives two beats (figures' reconciliation, registrar's step), shapes ending (tea as communal honesty). 3.0 base + 0.5 mid-signal + 0.9 two beats + 0.9 causal + 0.8 closure + 0.6 cost (implicit) = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone "resonant hush" is established in the opening paragraph ("the resonant hush of the world settling into itself") and sustained through quiet action (polishing, eavesdropping, stepping, tea) with modulation at the peak moment (pulse quickening, breath fogging) and the final image (forecourt whisper as applause, ceramic clinking like distant bells). The tone coheres across turns and charges the ending without breaking into noise or flatness. However, the hush is more consistent than dynamically pressured—it does not tighten or release in step with escalation. Present by ~5%, stable across all beats, closure charge strong (final paragraph restates "resonant hush" and "quiet and full"). 3.0 base + 0.8 early + 1.4 three+ beats + 1.2 closure + 0.7 modulation under pressure = 7.1.</comment>
