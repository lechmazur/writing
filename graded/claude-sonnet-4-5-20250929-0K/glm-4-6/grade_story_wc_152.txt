<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias remains fundamentally opaque—his "wisdom disguised as foolishness" is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible trade-offs. The embroidery action repeats in identical stems ("his fingers threading," "the needle darting," "his hands moved faster") without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final "smile" and "mask slipping" are gestural clichés that tell rather than show internal conflict. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; he simply completes the chart and leaves, foreclosing no path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece fails the Orientation Test: by 120 words we know only "cobalt observatory" and "Elias embroidering," with no anchored when, why, or what the conspiracies are. The ending offers no legible closure—Elias finishes his work, the coup is "postponed by a thread," and he leaves with "his work done, for now," which reads as a pause rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with cost. The dominant lens is ambiguous (oscillates between causal embroidery-as-magic and accumulative mood) and never coheres. Applied penalties: Orientation Test −0.4, lens ambiguity −0.4, no legible closure cost −0.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or shapes tactics—Elias could embroider anywhere. Autumn winds "howl outside" and leaves "cling to trees" in postcard fashion without affecting action. The eternal candle is handled across beats and returns in the final image, providing the sole instance of a recurring object that charges closure, lifting the score above ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering conspiracies before the coup—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elias simply stitches faster and "the conspiracies unraveled...with the quiet precision of his needle" in summary. The coup is "postponed by a thread" without agency, mechanism, or visible cost. No escalation is dramatized; pressure is asserted ("time was running out") but not enacted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme of truth-as-embroidery and listening-for-the-unheard is stated overtly ("his job was to find the loose threads," "some stories were never meant to be heard") rather than emerging from dramatized conflict. The final image of the shimmering galaxy-chart offers weak resonance since the chart's completion was never in doubt and no trade-off was required. No plausible counter-reading or ambiguity exists; the ending moralizes without cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias. Perceptual signature is thin—descriptions cycle through "cobalt walls," "eternal candle's flame," "silver thread" without character-specific bias or selective attention under pressure. Diction remains consistent but generic ("shifting allegiances," "encroaching chill of betrayal"). The piece teaches a pattern of parallelism and lyric repetition; while legible, the effect flattens rather than propels.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe template-cadence debt: runs of "The [noun] [verb]" openings across a dozen sentences, plus paraphrase loops ("conspiracies unraveling," "conspiracies unraveled," "conspiracies collapsed"). Stock metaphors pervade ("threads of fate," "tapestry of lies," "web no one else could see"). Filter-verb stacks in the final third ("seemed to sigh," "seemed to deepen") dull immediacy. Applied penalties: template cadence −0.6, paraphrase loops −0.4, stock metaphor strings −0.5, filter stacks touching closure −0.5, total line debt −2.0 with disallow-9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—wise fool uncovering plot via magical embroidery—is a recognizable template (Cassandra/seer archetype + fiber-arts-as-magic trope) executed without transformation. The "disguise wisdom as foolishness" trait is told but never shown in scene. No fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis emerges; the ending's "truth laid bare" and "coup postponed" are abstract declarations lacking lived detail or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout but causal work is absent—Elias embroiders from beginning to end without a choice that alters tactics or a visible cost. The completion of the chart is inevitable and does not turn the plot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The candle appears in at least four beats: flickering beside him, "synchronizing with threads," revealing a new thread, and settling into steady glow at the end. This reprise reweights the closure image slightly, but the candle never constrains a choice or imposes cost. Functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Unraveling conspiracies" is stated as the goal but remains abstract—no specific conspiracy is named or dramatized, no tactic shifts in response, and the resolution is told ("conspiracies collapsed under the weight of his work") rather than shown. Present in setup and payoff but missing middle causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Disguises wisdom as foolishness" is asserted twice but never enacted—no scene shows others dismissing him, no choice is enabled or constrained by the disguise, and no cost accrues. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Synchronize" appears in three lines: threads synchronizing with the candle, searching for the right moment to synchronize a stitch, and the candle's rhythm matching his heartbeat. The term is present but the mechanics are opaque and the final stitch is not shown as the pivot. Swappable with "align" or "match" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Adjacent possibilities" is mentioned twice as Elias's method of moving through timelines, but no mechanics are dramatized and no beat shows this method shaping his choices. Introduced early but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is named in setup and returned to in the final paragraph, but it never pressures a choice or supplies a resource. Autumn is mentioned (winds, leaves) but does not constrain action. Setup and payoff present; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Before the coup" frames urgency twice, and "time was running out" is asserted, but no clock is tracked and no decision is tightened by the timeframe. The coup is "postponed" at the end without showing how the deadline shaped tactics. Setup and closure mention; no live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Listen for unheard stories" is stated in the opening third and returned to in the final lines ("he would keep listening, always"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—Elias listens but never faces a trade-off or friction between this desire and a cost. Lyric reprise without enacted pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" appears in four beats: the observatory's walls hum with it, it grows heavier, presses in during the climax, and lightens at the end. The tone is sustained and modulates slightly with pressure, charging the final image. However, the effect is more atmospheric than decisive, and the modulation is told ("lightening") rather than enacted through syntax or rhythm.</comment>
