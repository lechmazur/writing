<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to learn the rhythm of belonging") is declared but never dramatized through conflicting choices under pressure. Her discovery sequence reads as unobstructed research rather than a hierarchy of values tested by cost. The final "understanding" arrives as epiphany summary ("the rhythm of belonging wasn't about fitting into a place, but recognizing how all things connect") rather than emerging from a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Kaelen appears at 4:52 AM but applies no pressure; the "shared exhale" is atmospheric convergence, not relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present (underwater facility, midnight, Elara's role) but the Drive Lens remains ambiguous—part causal discovery (burnt feather → mechanism), part accumulative texture (plankton patterns), part situational wonder. The closure attempt is Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara "finally learned...the rhythm of belonging"), yet the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page; no live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered. The "burnt feather...left behind by the original lead researcher" reveal at the end is retroactive information dump, not dramatized turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The underwater facility setting is vivid (reinforced windows, bioluminescent plankton, dormant machinery) and the facility's transformation supplies resources. However, spatial choreography during the discovery sequence is vague—Elara moves from "observation screen" to "archives" to activating "the system" without clear movement or proximity. The burnt feather's physical location and Elara's handling of it remain abstract. The setting does not constrain a choice at closure; it provides backdrop for automated wonder.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding belonging—is signaled early but remains abstract. The discovery unfolds without opposition or trade-off; Elara activates the system at 3:17 AM with no price, no competing option, no resource constraint. The plankton display at 4:52 AM is a gift, not an earned reversal. Kaelen's arrival adds no friction. The final paragraph's assertion ("belonging wasn't discovered but created") is thematic summary, not a decision that narrows options or forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the burnt feather and celestial-ocean mapping motif, but the final revelation is delivered as explicit thesis: "the rhythm of belonging wasn't about fitting into a place, but recognizing how all things connect." The "Look closer" message and the system's "softly ingenious design" are told rather than discovered through specific friction. The story invites reflection, yet the ending paragraph moralizes instead of offering a non-literal image. Subtext is present in the plankton/constellation parallel, but thematic resonance is diluted by overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara. Perceptual signature is present in "landscape astrologer training" filtering observation, though the register drifts into expository passages ("Her softly ingenious mind began weaving theories"). Kaelen's arrival is told from outside ("unaware of her discovery yet drawn"), flirting with omniscient assertion. The phrase "shadowseam wonder" is coined but not anchored in Elara's lexicon. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the discovery beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "luminous respite Elara had sought wasn't peace from her work but understanding her place" is immediately restated as "the rhythm of belonging wasn't discovered but created" and again as "Elara had been searching for how she belonged, never understanding that belonging wasn't discovered." Template cadence appears in the 3:17 AM and 4:52 AM timestamp beats, which function as scaffolding rather than pressure. Stock metaphor: "hearts and minds across time" and "dance of light that spanned from seafloor to surface and beyond." Filter-verb stack: "had been," "had sought," "had come," "had just begun" across multiple lines. Apply −0.9 for loops and cadence artifacts touching the closure paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The underwater-facility-as-observatory synthesis is functional but the discovery unfolds without friction or surprise—Elara finds exactly what she seeks with no cost. The "burnt feather left behind...a message written in ash and quill: 'Look closer'" is convenient symbolism rather than a non-obvious turn. The premise (astrologer in underwater city) is high-concept but the emotional arc (isolation → belonging through epiphany) follows a template structure without transformation. The story hedges risk by granting Elara unobstructed success.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara ("landscape astrologer") is present throughout and her research drives the discovery sequence. Her choices—examining archives, cross-referencing star maps, activating the system—advance the plot but lack opposition or trade-off. She does not face a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure), but swappable with any researcher role. Mid-band functional use without causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "burnt feather" appears in the first third (archives, "edges still warm somehow"), is examined mid-story ("carbonized veins"), and returns at closure ("left behind by the original lead researcher"). Two beats of involvement. However, its function is primarily symbolic discovery-trigger; Elara does not handle or use it in ways that constrain her choices. The feather's "warmth" is unexplained and its final reveal is told exposition. Lyric reprise reweights meaning slightly, reaching ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Luminous respite" is named once in the middle ("seeking the luminous respite that comes when scattered knowledge suddenly forms a pattern") and restated at closure ("The luminous respite Elara had sought wasn't peace from her work but understanding"). It functions as thematic label rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page. The concept does not narrow options or enable a visible choice. Present in two gates (middle mention, closure thematic claim), but ornamental. Swappable with any "insight" synonym.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Softly ingenious" is applied twice: to Elara's mind ("Her softly ingenious mind began weaving theories") and to the system's design ("The system's softly ingenious design allowed researchers to see"). Both uses are descriptive labels rather than constraints or enablers of on-page action. The trait does not create a visible trade-off or cost. Present in middle beats but ornamental, no causal pressure. Swappable with "clever" or "insightful."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Captivate" appears early ("The object captivated her immediately") and the burnt feather's hold on Elara motivates the overnight research sequence. However, "captivate" could be replaced with "intrigue" or "fascinate" without structural change. The action is present in setup and middle development, shaping one sustained beat (the research arc), but does not return or reweight at closure. Functional involvement in two gates, reaching ~6.3 via lyric setup and sustained middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" occurs once at 4:52 AM in the final third. Kaelen and Elara's synchronized breath is atmospheric convergence, not a method that shapes attempts or alters tactics. The "fireflies" are immediately clarified as plankton, and the moment is descriptive rather than causal. Late arrival (final third), ornamental, no middle development or setup. Missing setup and development gates; cap at 2.8, reduced for late ornamental use to ~2.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "forgotten underwater city research facility" is anchored early and provides resources (archives, celestial observatory mechanism, bioluminescent plankton response) that enable Elara's discovery. The setting's transformation (mirrors, lenses, harmonics) drives the middle and closure beats. Spatial choreography is vague, but the facility's systems shape the outcome. Present in all three gates with causal involvement in two beats (discovery, activation) and closure participation (plankton display). Essential setting that enables rather than constrains; reaching ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" frames the story; timestamps anchor progression (midnight, 3:17 AM, 4:52 AM, sunrise). The timeframe provides pacing but does not tighten decisions—Elara works uninterrupted and the sunrise arrives as narrative convenience rather than deadline pressure. Present in setup (midnight) and closure (sunrise), but does not constrain middle choices. Functional pacing device; two gates with modest causal role, reaching ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To learn the rhythm of belonging" is stated early as Elara's motivation and restated at closure ("finally learned...the rhythm of belonging"). The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or friction between wants and costs. Elara's research unfolds without sacrifice or competing pull. Present in setup and closure as thematic claim, but not tested in the middle through on-page decisions. Two gates, no causal pressure or visible trade-off; ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Shadowseam wonder" appears once as a descriptor ("the underwater world revealed itself in shadowseam wonder, darkness and light merging into something transcendent"). The tone of awe and discovery is coherent throughout, modulating from curiosity (midnight) to astonishment (4:52 AM). However, the specific phrase is ornamental coinage; the tone could be described as "awe" or "wonder" without the neologism. Present in closure image, consistent across beats, modest charge to the final moment. Functional tone with closure participation; ~5.3.</comment>
