<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("wrest this story from the silence," the memory of gaffer-taping torn cloth). The epiphany that his career ended "when he'd stopped caring about what happened after the applause" arrives abruptly without prior contradiction or micro-choices showing him torn between technical perfection and soul. The final resolve feels slightly unearned because the "after the applause" realization is declared rather than dramatized through a visible renunciation or trade-off that forecloses a path with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when promptly. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through layered reflection and the grille-cloth scrap, then reweights at closure when Leo pockets the scrap and leaves the inventory unfinished. The cost is conceptual (he abandons the paid assignment) but the final image "listen to the silence, and finally understand its song" leans toward RR/Charged Poise without a sharp before/after in tactics or forfeited relationships. The closure reconfigures Leo's stance but the price—walking away mid-job—remains oblique rather than undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quarry trailer is vivid and purposeful: dust, stale coffee, vibrating walls from dynamite provide sensory anchors filtered through Leo's roadie past. The grille-cloth scrap is handled twice (discovery, then pocketed at closure) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (tablet on desk, scrap beside it, Leo locking the door) tracks cleanly. Micro-setting (the scrap, the trailer, the echo valley outside) constrains the reflective choice and supports the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discover purpose after loss, signaled early. One tightening occurs when Leo realizes "the real work often began when the cheering stopped," narrowing his self-concept. However, no external antagonist or constraint forces a trade-off; Leo's decision to leave the inventory unfinished is a renunciation but lacks visible immediate cost (no boss on the page, no money lost, no relationship altered). The pressure is primarily internal and reflective, cohering under Accumulative lens but without a dramatized price that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—finding meaning in the "after," the humble torn aftermath—emerges through the grille-cloth scrap and the memory of post-show camaraderie. The final image "listen to the silence, and finally understand its song" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the contrast between the engineer's sterile inventory and the priceless scrap. One mild slip: "proof that the real work often began when the cheering stopped" edges toward thematic statement rather than pure implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (roadie's ear for percussion, dust, hum). Diction matches Leo's background ("gaffer's tape," "tube amp warming up"). No dialogue present. One register bump: "a collective groan instead of a roar" and "echo valley longing" feel slightly elevated for the established voice, but they remain legible. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear and propulsive. Two issues: (1) Paraphrase loop in the opening—"rubble of his own life" and "assign value to things others had discarded, just as he had been" restate the same metaphor without added pressure (−0.2). (2) Stock metaphor "ghost of the noise he once loved" and "low, steady hum of an old tube amp warming up" are competent but border on generic (−0.3). The closure image "listen to the silence, and finally understand its song" is evocative but leans abstract. Information density is high; no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ex-roadie-turned-appraiser premise is specific and offers fresh angles (valuing broken things, post-show emotional work). The grille-cloth scrap as a literal piece of the past is a nice touch. However, the core emotional arc—disillusioned professional rediscovers purpose through a meaningful object—is a widely used template. The "after the applause" insight feels familiar; transformation is present but moderate. The quarry setting and vintage audio gear add texture without fundamentally altering the arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Leo is present throughout and his choices drive key beats: he examines the estate, recognizes the grille cloth, remembers the Vox amp incident, realizes his career ended when he stopped caring about the "after," and leaves the inventory unfinished. Setup is immediate, middle reflection deepens understanding, and closure hinges on his decision to pocket the scrap and walk away. Two beats: recognition and departure. Causal pressure is moderate—his internal shift enables the final choice but lacks external constraint forcing a trade-off. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the assignment) but not dramatized with immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The speaker grille cloth scrap appears early (discovery in the Ziploc bag), is handled and examined mid-story (recognized as the Vox Super Beatle face Leo once patched), and is pocketed at closure, directly shaping the final action. Three beats: discovery, memory/recognition, and departure with the scrap as talisman. Causal role: the scrap triggers the memory that shifts Leo's understanding and motivates his choice to leave. Irreplaceable: the specific fabric, its origin, and Leo's personal history with it are indispensable to the arc. Cost linkage: choosing to keep the scrap means valuing it over the paid inventory work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "after the applause" concept is signaled early ("all he found were numbered bins and brittle wires" vs. the memory of post-show camaraderie) and articulated explicitly mid-story: "the soul of the job was in the *after*" and "the real work often began when the cheering stopped." It shapes Leo's realization and the final choice to "listen to the silence." However, it functions more as theme than as a constraint that alters tactics on the page. The concept reweights Leo's past but does not create visible friction or a dramatized trade-off in the present scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is mentioned once in exposition ("confidently uncertain about his future, a paradox that kept him moving forward but never toward anything specific") and once at closure ("His confidently uncertain demeanor solidified into something resembling resolve"). It labels Leo's stance but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action. No visible cost or trade-off tied to this trait. The trait is swappable with "ambivalent" or "hesitant" without altering the plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears once: "He had to wrest this story from the silence." It signals Leo's shift from passive appraisal to active engagement but does not recur or drive a second beat. The major turn—Leo's decision to leave the inventory unfinished—could occur without the specific verb "wrest." The action is evocative but not mechanically indispensable; swappable with "recover," "uncover," or "reclaim" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Insulating emotionally with facts" is introduced early ("Leo's method of insulating emotionally with facts had served him well since his public failure") and the estate's "technical manuals and vintage audio gear that numbed him with its precision" and "sound engineer's cheat sheets stared at him, full of frequencies and decibel levels designed to control chaos" exemplify the method. The closure pivots away from this insulation when Leo chooses the priceless scrap over the cold data. Two beats: setup and reprise at closure. The method shapes Leo's past tactics and the contrast charges the final choice, but it is not dramatized through a mid-scene attempt or visible cost during the scene.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer is anchored immediately and provides sensory detail (dust, stale coffee, fluorescent hum, dynamite vibrations). The setting mirrors Leo's isolation and the "echo valley" outside brackets the ending. The trailer's sterility contrasts with the warm memory of the New Orleans club. However, the trailer itself does not constrain Leo's choices—he could have this realization in any quiet workspace. Micro-setting (the desk, the tablet, the scrap) is more active than the trailer location. Two beats: opening anchor and closure departure. The setting supports tone but is not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after failing publicly" is established in backstory ("a botched festival soundcheck that ended his career") and Leo's current job is framed as post-failure recovery. The past failure primes Leo's sensitivity to the grille-cloth memory, but the present scene has no live clock or urgency—Leo could complete the appraisal anytime. The timeframe provides motive but does not tighten present decisions. One beat: backstory setup that colors present reflection. No escalation or cost tied to elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"To discover purpose after loss" is Leo's stated motivation, introduced early ("He needed to discover purpose after loss, but all he found were numbered bins and brittle wires") and reignited at the midpoint ("His motivation to discover purpose after loss ignited"). The grille-cloth scrap dramatizes this desire by offering a tangible link to his lost purpose, and the final choice to pocket the scrap and leave the inventory enacts the discovery. Three beats: initial lack, recognition, and closure action. Causal pressure: the scrap enables Leo to see purpose in "the quiet stories whispered by broken things." Cost: walking away from the paid work to pursue meaning. The motivation drives the arc and is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Echo valley longing" is named once mid-story ("An echo valley longing settled over him, a sound so empty it swallowed even his own breathing") and recurs at closure ("the wind whistling through the valley, a long, lonely echo that no longer felt empty to him"). The tone is coherent—melancholy, reflective, suffused with acoustic metaphors—and modulates slightly at the end when the emptiness is reframed as meaningful. Two beats: label and reprise. The tone charges the final image by reweighting the "echo" from empty to full. However, the phrase "echo valley longing" is slightly forced and the tone is somewhat static across the middle reflection.</comment>
