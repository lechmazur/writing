<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (finding unused courage, fixing what's broken) is established but remains abstract through most of the piece. The core choice—creating a message for Althea and deciding to "vouchsafe" her freedom—arrives late and feels more resolved-in-reflection than wrestled-with on the page. Interiority leans heavily on philosophical abstraction ("unused courage waits, hoarded like a forgotten currency") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The renunciation carries stated weight but minimal dramatized cost; we're told he feels "whole" without seeing what he forfeited to get there.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered backstory, the pillbox discovery, coordinate revelation, message creation, and final resignation. Orientation is clear by the opening beat. The closure effect reads as Earned Stasis (walking away, vouchsafing Althea's future) with conceptual cost (his own erasure, the ephemeral message). However, the escalation is primarily reflective; the on-page action (finding box, reading note, stamping snow, leaving) functions as illustrative staging for interior monologue rather than because/therefore linkage that narrows options. Cost is asserted ("guarantee her a future, a sanctuary carved from his own ruin") but the price—what he loses by walking away—remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff, mist, frozen ground, and the snow-covered plateau are vividly rendered with consistent atmospheric detail. The pillbox's engraving and the stamped cipher in snow supply tactile specificity. The environment enables the message-creation choice (wide plateau, wind that will erase the code) and charges the final image (mist swallowing his form). Spatial choreography is clear across the bluff and plateau. The constraint of ephemeral snow as medium directly shapes his method, meeting the gate for choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: protecting/freeing Althea from the service and his own ruin. The coordinates and tomorrow's date promise a trap, but Elias's agency centers on composing a counter-message rather than engaging the trap itself. The tightening occurs when he chooses invitation over warning, vouchsafe over rescue, but this turn happens off-page between paragraphs; we see preparation and resolution, not the moment of choice. Cost is conceptual (his erasure, her freedom) but the trade-off is told rather than shown in a pressured beat. No reversal or complication tests his resolve once the decision is made.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through selfless creation and "fixing what's broken" emerges from particulars: the engraved pillbox, the ephemeral code, the renunciation of contact. The final image (mist swallowing him, leaving only "silver hush") resonates as conceptual repricing of his former life. However, the piece edges toward stated thesis in lines like "fixing what's broken for her was his only penance" and "He had found the reservoir of courage he sought, not in a heroic act, but in a final, selfless act of creation." The thematic weight rests on assertion more than dramatic discovery. Spring-as-rebirth runs conventional without fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited with stable focalization through Elias. Diction is elevated and literary ("ectoplasmic water," "silver hush," "phantom of warmth") but occasionally slips into thesis-speak ("his motivation was singular," "his purpose now was fixing what's broken"). Psychic distance is close but sometimes toggles to summary overview without clear rhythm. No dialogue. The perceptual signature—spy tradecraft, pattern recognition—appears in the cipher method and trap awareness but is under-leveraged; most narration is atmospheric rather than tactically filtered. Compression and lyricism are purposeful but the voice occasionally feels more authorial than character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and atmospheric with strong imagery ("mist swirled around his ankles like cold, ectoplasmic water," "unfurling it felt like cracking a bone"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "fixing what's broken" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "silver hush" recurs decoratively. Template cadence in reflective passages: "He had always been prudently daring... He had not seen it in ten years... He knew then what must be done." Filter-verb reliance ("He understood," "He felt," "He knew") stacks in the final third, dulling immediacy. Some elevated diction ("vouchsafe") reads as imposed rather than voice-organic. Information density is moderate; several lines restate emotional state without advancing plot.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The burned-spy-seeks-redemption premise is familiar, and the piece follows a conventional arc: discovery of artifact, decoding message, preparing counter-message, renunciation. The ephemeral-code-in-snow method offers a fresh tactical detail. The choice to vouchsafe freedom rather than intervene directly provides a non-obvious moral calculus, but it arrives as summary rather than lived decision. Atmospheric specificity (Zephyr Bluff, mist, spring thaw) and the engraved pillbox supply texture, yet the emotional beats—penance, wholeness, quiet alignment—feel template-derived. The transformation test is borderline: swap names and the arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias (burned spy) is present throughout and his past professional identity frames motivation. His choices (reading the note, creating the counter-message, walking away) structure the arc. However, decisions are more resolved-upon than dramatized; the key turn (choosing invitation over warning, vouchsafe over rescue) happens between paragraphs. The spy trait enables the code method but does not constrain or test him in a high-pressure beat. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is reflective rather than choice-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The engraved pillbox appears in the opening third (half-buried in snow), is handled and opened (revealing coordinates), and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("heavy in his pocket, a physical anchor to his resolve"). Its ivy-and-thorns engraving links to "failed trust" with the woman in Prague, charging backstory. The box enables the plot turn (coordinates prompt action) and anchors closure symbolically. It does not constrain a second on-page choice; its final mention is declarative rather than causally active. Three beats, closure linkage, but moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Fixing what's broken" is stated as Elias's purpose and restated thematically across the piece. It motivates his decision to vouchsafe Althea's future, but the concept functions more as thematic label than dramatized stake. We see the result (message created, decision to leave) but not the process of "fixing" under pressure. The phrase recurs in summary ("his purpose now was fixing what's broken," "Fixing what's broken for her was his only penance") without altering tactics or escalating cost on the page. Told, not shown.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" is introduced as backstory label ("He had always been prudently daring, a careful gambler") and reasserted once ("His prudently daring nature asserted itself; it was undoubtedly a trap, but one he had to walk into"). The trait is told rather than shown in action; Elias's on-page choices (reading note, making message, leaving) are deliberate but not visibly risk-balanced or constrained by this duality. No trade-off where prudence and daring clash on the page. Label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" (to formally grant Althea a future free from the service and himself) is named in the final third as Elias's realization of what his unused courage is for. It reframes his purpose from rescue to renunciation and charges the ending. However, the action itself is conceptual and retrospective; we do not see him grant or enact the vouchsafe on the page, only prepare and resolve. The term appears once, late, without prior setup. It clarifies theme but does not drive a turn in tactics or choice. Functional but swappable with "ensure her freedom" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Codes in accumulated snow" is introduced in the second half when Elias creates a geometric cipher on the plateau. The method is specific (trained in the Carpathians, requires the key only Althea knows, visible from air, ephemeral) and its mechanics matter: wind will erase it, ensuring secrecy. It enables his counter-move (invitation, not warning) and ties to closure (the Zephyr erasing the message as he leaves). Setup is late (~50% mark), but development and payoff are clear. Causal role in one major beat and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff is established immediately and anchors the entire piece spatially. Mist, frozen ground, and the wind (Zephyr by name) supply atmospheric pressure and enable the snow-code method. The bluff provides the vantage and symbolic high ground for Elias's final gesture (pressing palm to stone, turning away). The environment does not constrain a difficult choice but does supply resources (the plateau, the snow) and charges the closure image (mist swallowing him). Strong setup, moderate causal pressure, clear payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"At the tilt of the earth toward spring" is mentioned in the opening paragraph ("the air held the promise of thaw") and invoked metaphorically in the final third ("The spring that was coming was not just a season for the earth, but for him as well"). The coordinates specify "tomorrow," but no on-page clock tightens Elias's decisions. Time functions thematically (rebirth, thaw) rather than as tactical constraint. Present but ornamental; does not pressure pacing or choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To find where unused courage waits" is stated as Elias's singular motivation in the opening third and resolved in the final third ("He had found the reservoir of courage he sought"). The desire frames the arc but is not dramatized in conflicted beats; we are told he seeks it and told he finds it. The realization (courage is for vouchsafe, not fighting) clarifies theme but arrives as summary rather than tested choice. Setup and payoff clear; middle friction minimal. Told more than shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Silver hush" is introduced in the opening line ("the world was a study in silver hush") and reprised in the final line ("leaving only the silver hush behind"). The tone—muted, contemplative, elegiac—remains coherent through Elias's reflections and atmospheric description. Pressure modulates minimally; the tone does not sharpen or break under the coordinates revelation or message creation. The final reprise reweights the opening image, charging closure with quiet finality. Clear setup and payoff; stable mood that supports rather than escalates stakes.</comment>
