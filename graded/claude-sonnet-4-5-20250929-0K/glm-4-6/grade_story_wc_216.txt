<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—"a quiet, persistent need to understand the texture of time passing"—remains abstract label rather than embodied contradiction. The borrowed-time setup never constrains a choice with visible cost; he moves through discovery beats without friction between want and survival pressure. Internal states are asserted ("his heart heavy but hopeful") rather than shown through micro-choices under stress. The final acceptance lacks the foreclosed path or renunciation required for earned closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when clarify only after the urn fragment appears (~25% in). The drive lens reads hybrid—causal discovery moves paired with accumulative mood—but the garage-sale code mechanism arrives as exposition rather than dramatized constraint, breaking because/therefore linkage. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (comfort replaces fear) but the cost is declared, not felt on the page: no specific action is forfeited, no live option closed. Applied Orientation Test penalty −0.4; also cap Q3 at 7.0 per the test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo anchors location and supplies the alcove discovery, meeting minimal constraint. Sensory detail is selective (metallic sheen, cold air, dim lights) and filtered through Elias's curatorial attention. However, the silo's mechanics—how the "no shadow" clue works spatially—remain vague; the alcove materializes conveniently without prior setup. The urn fragment and journal function as micro-setting objects but do not evolve across beats. Cap applied per Orientation Test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (reconstruct the time capsule) is signaled early. The tightening occurs when Elias finds the coordinates and descends, but this move is prompted by luck (finding the music-box listing) rather than protagonist trade-off. The journal's revelations arrive without prior obstacle or cost; Elias never sacrifices time, conceals the find from others, or faces a competing claim. No live option is foreclosed; the ending comfort replaces fear without visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (memory's resilience, understanding over fear) emerges from the time-capsule motif but is stated outright in the final lines: "texture of time passing no longer a fear but a comfort, a reminder that even in a broken world, there were stories worth telling." The urn fragment recurs but does not shift meaning between first touch and closure. The piece resists complexity—Elias's quest succeeds without moral friction or counter-reading. No non-literal answer; the ending summarizes the premise rather than reweighting it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (curatorial, tactile focus) but diction drifts into elevated register during reflection ("the enduring power of understanding"). The narrative withholds the garage-sale code method until late—purposeful elision that pays off, so no penalty here. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the urn examination. Minor: "his breath catching" and "heart heavy but hopeful" trend toward stock embodiment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops: "He wasn't just a collector; he was a custodian" immediately follows the prior description; "mysteries just beginning to unfold" / "mysteries no longer distant but immediate" recycles the mystery frame. Template cadence clusters in the final third: "Elias felt… Elias closed… Elias…" Filter-verb stack ("he realized," "he felt," "he held") dulls immediacy in the journal discovery beat. Figurative language is generic ("still waters," "threads in a larger tapestry"). Applied −1.0 for loops and template runs touching the closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise (damaged time capsule rediscovered via hidden codes) is functional but closely echoes familiar treasure-hunt templates. The "numbers changed meaning" setting detail is mentioned but never constrains a choice or shapes world logic in action. The garage-sale embedding method arrives as exposition rather than a risky or specific tactic. No bold risk or moral calculus; the quest succeeds without complication. Applied −0.8 for derivative structure and swap-ability of the discovery method.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias appears in all beats but his "borrowed-time" status is label-only; it does not force a trade-off (speed vs. thoroughness, sharing vs. hoarding). His choices are observation-driven rather than decision-driven. Present across beats but replaceable with a generic researcher. Missing middle development (no choice constrained by borrowed time); cap 4.6. Swappability −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The urn fragment is handled in three beats: discovery, examination with magnifying glass, descent with it in hand. It delivers the first clue and anchors the quest. However, its surface properties (cracked, worn) do not evolve or constrain later action; it is a static key rather than a dynamic object. Setup +0.5, beat involvement (three) +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage (present during journal find) +0.7, irreplaceability +0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 3.9 = 6.9, rounded down to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The time capsule frames the quest and supplies the journal's purpose. Setup within first third +0.5, beat involvement (coordinates, alcove, journal) +0.9, causal pressure (drives descent) +0.9, closure linkage (journal explains capsule's intent) +1.0, specificity +0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 3.7 = 6.7. Minor swappability (could be "lost archive" with edits) −0.3; late-capsule-purpose reveal −0.5. Final 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" is invoked once when Elias holds the urn: "the world around him stilled… as if the fragment had plucked him from the current of time." This moment does not constrain a subsequent choice or enable a tactic; it is atmosphere. Label-only −0.3, ornamental use −0.7, swappable with "uncanny" −0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 0.0 (no beat involvement beyond mention) −1.4 = 1.6, but present in setup and tied to object, so 3.8 cap for functional-but-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rediscover" is the spine: Elias rediscovers the urn fragment, then coordinates, then the journal. Setup immediate, beat involvement (all three discoveries) +1.4, causal pressure (each find enables the next) +1.2, closure linkage (journal rediscovery completes the quest) +1.2, irreplaceability +0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3. Swappability (could be "uncover" or "decode") −0.6; summary-only in final paragraph −0.6. Final 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The garage-sale embedding method is mentioned in Elias's reflection ("Over the years, Elias had cataloged countless items, each description a secret code") and supplies the music-box coordinates. Setup absent until second third −0.4, ornamental backstory use −0.7, swappable with any hidden-message system −0.6. Baseline 3.0 + mid-beat involvement +0.4 + causal link (coordinates) +0.5 − penalties −1.7 = 2.2; rounded to 2.4 for one causal beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The emerald silo anchors location, provides the alcove discovery site, and delivers the "casts no shadow" clue. Setup immediate +0.6, beat involvement (opening, clue, descent) +0.9, causal pressure (alcove discovery depends on silo layout) +0.8, closure linkage (journal found inside) +0.9, specificity ("emerald" is distinctive) +0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 3.6 = 6.6. Generic spatial use (alcove appears conveniently) −0.6; no tactics shaped by silo's physical constraints −0.7. Final 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After numbers changed meaning" appears in the opening and the journal's account but never tightens a decision or alters tactics on the page. It is worldbuilding atmosphere, not a live clock. Setup +0.4, thematic echo in journal +0.2, ornamental −0.8, swappable with any post-collapse label −0.6. Baseline 3.0 + 0.6 − 1.4 = 2.2, rounded to 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to understand the texture of time passing" is stated in the opening and rephrased at closure ("the texture of time passing no longer a fear but a comfort"). Setup +0.5, lyric reprise +0.4. However, the desire is never dramatized in a conflicted choice—does he rush or linger? hoard or share?—so friction is absent. Told-only −0.8, swappable with "to preserve memory" −0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 0.9 − 1.3 = 2.6; lyric allowance lifts to 4.7 per the guidance for seed → reprise with cost claim.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Tone of "anticipated mysteries" is coherent: each discovery heightens anticipation (urn, clue, coordinates, journal). Setup immediate, modulates across beats +0.9, charges the final image (mysteries "no longer distant but immediate") +0.8. However, tone flattens in the final paragraph into summary satisfaction without tension. Baseline 3.0 + 1.7 + closure linkage +0.9 = 5.6; minor uplift for modulation +0.2 = 5.8.</comment>
