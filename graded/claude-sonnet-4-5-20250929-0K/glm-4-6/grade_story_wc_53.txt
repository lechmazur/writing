<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias remains more conceptual vessel than embodied character. His internal state is told through abstract labels—"chronologically confused time twisted his memories," "regret was a weight"—rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The micro-choices (kneeling, reciting borrowed memories, walking) lack visible cost or genuine resistance; he moves through symbolic stations without friction. The ghost functions as floating metaphor rather than pressure that forces trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through lyric repetition and symbolic deepening rather than causal linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The closure unit—Elias stepping beyond the lagoon, ghost fading, regret left behind—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "the ghost was gone, and so was the regret" tells the shift without showing forfeiture or tactical change. The final image reweights prior motifs yet the price paid remains conceptual and diffuse, weakening the closure's felt impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is vivid and purposeful—mirrored planes, mist, carousel imagery—and recurs throughout to charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (edge, pool, horizon) remains coherent. The camera wheel and carousel horse anchor micro-setting beats. However, the lagoon functions primarily as symbolic backdrop; it does not materially constrain a choice or alter tactics in the way that would elevate into the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escaping the lagoon's hold—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through symbolic accumulation (collecting fragments, confronting the ghost), fitting the Accumulative lens. Yet no on-page reversal narrows options with felt cost: Elias's walk toward the horizon unfolds without resistance or forfeiture. The ghost "lingering but fainter" and regret "no longer defining him" are declared shifts rather than earned through visible trade-offs, leaving escalation abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—letting go of lost futures, reclaiming agency from regret—emerges organically from images (carousel, wheel, ghost, mist). Subtext operates through symbol and gesture rather than direct statement until the final third, where exposition intrudes: "the stories weren't for the ghost. They were for him" and "he was humbly free" tell rather than let the image land. The closing lines sustain thematic charge, but the middle third's over-articulation dulls resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias. Diction is consistent and often evocative ("fractured stillness," "borrowed memory"). Yet perceptual signature is generic; Elias's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias. Register occasionally drifts into abstraction—"chronologically confused time," "negotiate with his own ghost"—that reads more like prompt echo than lived interiority. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning support the Accumulative mode, but the voice lacks the specificity needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "The lagoon had been his prison, but now it was just a place he'd been" restates the closure without adding pressure; "The carousel had halted, but the music—his music—was just beginning" recycles the opening motif mechanically. Template cadence in the final third ("The ghost was quiet… The lagoon hummed… The clouds closed…") flattens propulsion. Figurative language is dense but often mixed or vague: "traded them back to himself" lacks concrete vehicle. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops, template runs, and stock metaphor strings in peak beats warrant −1.2 within Q7, with an additional −0.5 because artifacts touch the closure beat (total −1.7). Starting from a mid-6 baseline, total deduction brings score to 4.7. Final third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Core premise—scavenger negotiating with his ghost in a sky-lagoon—offers surface novelty yet follows a familiar template: symbolic journey from stasis to self-acceptance. The kinetic lagoon and carousel imagery are vivid but not transformed through irreplaceable specificity; a different surreal setting could serve the same emotional arc. The closure reweights motifs purposefully, but the turns feel abstractly inevitable rather than earned through character-particular choice. Emotional honesty is present, yet the path toward resolution remains well-traveled.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his "resolute" trait is mentioned repeatedly. He makes micro-choices (tracing the wheel, kneeling, reciting memories, walking), but these are symbolic gestures rather than decisions that alter tactics or foreclose options with visible cost. His agency is passive observation more than active pressure. Present in all three gates but lacks causal force; swappable with a generic protagonist undergoing symbolic journey. Mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The camera wheel appears in the opening (tracing its curve, turning it over), returns in the middle third (grip tightening, edges pressing), and crumbles in his hand near the end—its dissolution explicitly tied to "eroded ambitions." Three-beat presence with early signal and closure linkage. However, its mechanical role is purely symbolic; it does not enable or constrain a choice under pressure. The object charges the final image but remains ornamental rather than tactically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Eroded ambitions" frames the opening ("much like his own ambitions, which now felt like relics") and returns when the wheel crumbles ("its eroded ambitions dissolving into the mist"). The concept shapes the dominant stake—reclaiming purpose beyond the lagoon—and the closure image reweights it: Elias moves forward despite erosion rather than restoring ambition. Early signal, middle pressure, closure linkage; the concept constrains the emotional arc and charges the final reprise. Solid integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is declared once in the opening third ("chronologically confused time twisted his memories into bits of dialogue, shards of faces") but never dramatized through action. Elias does not misremember, act out of sequence, or suffer visible cost from temporal disorientation. The trait is label-only and does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic. Ornamental mention without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Regret is signaled early ("the regret was a weight that kept him anchored"), recurs in the middle ("the regret was still there"), and explicitly lifts at closure ("the ghost was gone, and so was the regret"). The action shapes the dominant stake and participates in the ending's resolution. However, the mechanics of regret are abstract; no on-page choice enacts or confronts it with visible cost. Present in all three gates but its causal role is thematic assertion rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Collecting fragments of overheard stories" is introduced in the first third and recurs throughout ("He began collecting fragments… recited a borrowed memory… still collecting fragments, still piecing together stories"). The method is present in multiple beats and participates in the closure turn ("this time they felt his own"). However, the mechanics are vague—Elias does not enact gathering in a way that alters tactics or costs him anything tangible. The method charges the thematic shift but lacks physical specificity or strategic consequence. Functional across gates but swappable with generic "searching" or "remembering."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is anchored immediately, recurs in every major beat (edge, pool, mist, humming energy), and shapes the closure image ("stepped into the unknown… kinetic lagoon faded behind him"). The setting's "motion" and "fractured stillness" reflect Elias's internal state and the lagoon's "slowing" mirrors his shift. However, it does not materially constrain a choice—Elias's walk to the horizon meets no spatial resistance. Strong presence and closure linkage, but the setting functions symbolically rather than tactically. High functional integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the carousel halts" frames the opening ("The carousel had halted hours ago") and recurs at closure ("The carousel had halted, but the music… was just beginning"). The timeframe anchors the story's present and the ending reweights its meaning—stasis becomes threshold rather than terminus. Setup and payoff gates are met with clear reprise. However, the halted state does not tighten decisions or create tactical pressure in the middle; time remains static rather than urgent. Lyric integration with thematic resonance but lacks escalatory force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To negotiate with one's own ghost" is signaled early ("a desperate barter to negotiate with his own ghost"), recurs in the middle third (the ghost "lingered just beyond his sight," "wore his old face"), and participates in closure ("The ghost was gone"). The motivation shapes the dominant stake and the final shift. However, negotiation is abstract—Elias does not dramatize tactics, offers, or refusals. The ghost functions as symbolic pressure rather than a second character with whom he transacts. Present in all gates with thematic charge but lacks concrete friction or visible cost in the exchange.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Fractured stillness" is established in the opening ("the fractured stillness of the sky") and sustained through mirrored imagery (carousel frozen mid-rear, lagoon's perpetual motion versus halted carousel, mist and silence). Tone modulates subtly—intensifying during the ghost confrontation, softening as Elias steps toward the horizon. The final image reweights stillness as poise rather than paralysis. Coherent tonal arc that charges the closure without a single static mood. Strong integration across all three gates with meaningful reprise.</comment>
