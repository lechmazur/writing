<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tutor's guilt is consistently embodied through his nervous habits and chess-framed perception. Internal conflict emerges in his trembling fingers and "fierce repose," showing contradictory impulses. The final board recognition earns the shift from guilt to lesson-learned, though the emotional progression feels slightly telescoped. The stalemate insight arrives with adequate causality but borders on epiphanic convenience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The story follows a causal lens: tutor seeks atonement → decodes tapestry → navigates labyrinth → resolves stalemate → achieves forgiveness. The closure delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost (years of guilt winnowed away), and the platinum pawn move crystallizes his redemption. One meaningful tightening occurs when he enters the labyrinth and faces the final board, though the ease of his ultimate insight slightly undercuts the earned quality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The time-frozen village, cobblestones, platinum labyrinth, and tapestry anchor space vividly. The shifting grid of platforms and luminescent light create a distinct environment that constrains movement choices. The labyrinth's "ruthless logic" and the final platinum chessboard charge the closure image directly. Sensory detail (metallic air, refracted rainbows, rain on cobblestones) is filtered through the tutor's chess-tuned perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—self-forgiveness through labyrinth mastery—is clear from the outset. Pressure escalates as he decodes threads, navigates platforms, and confronts the stalemate that caused his exile. The agency is genuine: his mind must find the elegant sacrifice he once missed. The cost is legible (guilt winnowed, years of exile ended), though the labyrinth's challenges feel more described than dramatized with visible risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chess-as-moral-calculus particulars: the stalemate he failed to resolve, the student he betrayed, the move that redeems. The platinum pawn shift offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether past mistakes can be corrected. "Woven hush" and "fierce repose" recur purposefully, charging the atmosphere. The final image—standing unshaken in rain—embodies transformation without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, filtering all perception through the tutor's chess-trained mind. Diction is consistent and purposeful: "winnow," "gambit," "variations," "fierce repose." The prose modulates well between tense navigation and reflective guilt. Perceptual signature is strong—everything reads as strategy, board positions, phantom pieces. Minor filter-verb stacking in mid-passage ("felt," "seemed") slightly dulls immediacy during high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well between contemplative pacing and labyrinth tension. Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, "fidgets productively" appears twice identically, and "woven hush" recurs four times with minimal variation—a minor loop issue. The phrase "fierce repose" operates effectively as a motif but edges toward over-reliance. Figurative language (dewdrops, phantom pieces, chaff in storm) is vivid but occasionally ornamental in non-peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The exiled-master-seeks-redemption frame is familiar, but the platinum labyrinth-as-chess-puzzle and time-frozen village add specificity. The elegant-sacrifice insight feels somewhat template within chess-redemption arcs. The woven-hush concept and fierce-repose tone offer fresh texture, yet the emotional arc (guilt → atonement via symbolic puzzle) follows a well-worn path. The story commits fully to its chess-and-labyrinth synthesis but does not transform the redemption-quest template as boldly as the prose style suggests.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tutor present from opening; his choices drive all major turns: pacing the village, decoding threads, navigating platforms, shifting the pawn. Setup, development (labyrinth choices), and closure (pawn move) all hinge on his agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Platinum labyrinth introduced early as goal, entered at midpoint via decoded thread, navigated as shifting grid, and houses the final chessboard. Its ruthless logic constrains every move and its center delivers closure. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Woven hush appears in opening, thickens upon labyrinth entry, lifts at the end. It shapes atmosphere and tempo but does not directly constrain tactical choices. Functions more as tonal motif than active stake-shaper; lyric reprise with moderate reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Mentioned twice identically ("fidgets productively") in early and mid-passage, describing his nervous habit turned strategic. Does not visibly constrain or enable a key choice with cost; remains largely label-only despite repetition.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Winnowing appears as goal framing (winnow possibilities to find path) and closure metaphor (guilt winnowed away like chaff). Shapes his approach to the labyrinth and charges the ending image. Present in setup and payoff; mid-development use is implicit rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Method signaled clearly in paragraph seven, enacted immediately (crimson thread opens corridor), and its mechanics matter—each knot a clue, each color a direction. Drives the entry beat and demonstrates the decoding skill. Setup and payoff present; middle use implied in platform navigation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Time-frozen village frames the quest, supplies the tapestry resource, and provides the return-home closure locale. The cobblestones and great hall enable key actions. More than postcard but less than active pressure; the labyrinth itself (a subset) does the heavier lifting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Distant thunder opens and closes the story, rumbling during the lull and breaking into rain at the end. Atmospheric bracket with symbolic resonance (internal storm / external storm) but does not tighten tactical decisions or create a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Self-forgiveness drives every choice from pacing to labyrinth entry to pawn shift. The past mistakes (royal match, betrayed trust, failed student) are dramatized in memory and directly tested by the stalemate board. Friction between guilt and redemption-seeking powers all escalation and the final lift.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fierce repose appears three times, capturing the tutor's controlled intensity under pressure. Tone remains coherent through contemplation and climax, modulating from muted guilt to steady resolution. Charges the final standing-in-rain image but does not shift dramatically across turns.</comment>
