<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is rendered through specific, embodied perception—fever aftermath sharpens her "peripherally aware" state into concrete sensory details. Her motivation to "find the weight" drives micro-choices (reaching for the illustration, smudging with charcoal), and the brother revelation earns the final stance shift. However, the epiphany about her brother arrives via summary ("the fever-visions...showed her") rather than dramatized discovery, and the therapeutic precision of "auroral sorrow" and "fault-tolerant oracle" in interiority edges toward diagnostic label-speak that flattens peak emotional texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly (mountain weather station, post-fever, Elara alone) by the second paragraph. The piece accretes pressure through repeated smudging actions that progressively clarify the "swallowed truth," culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the truth is named, contoured by charcoal margins, achieving Earned Stasis with felt cost ("permanent twilight," burden now hers to name). The brother backstory supplies causal grounding, but its delivery via summary rather than staged discovery slightly weakens escalation texture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mountain weather station supplies concrete constraint (isolation, meteorological charts, the sextant) that pressures Elara's reckoning. The botanical illustration becomes micro-setting, handling it across multiple beats (touching, smudging twice, placing beside the sextant) with evolving symbolic charge. Sensory selection is purposeful—hum of station, wool blanket texture, fogged breath on paper—grounding the abstractions. The final juxtaposition (smudged flower beside cold brass sextant) charges the closure image with spatial and symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the weight of the swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens through the smudging actions that progressively narrow interpretive options. Each smudge deepens understanding (truth as absence, brother's erasure by disbelief), culminating in an on-page cost: shouldering the brother's silenced warning. The price is felt ("permanent twilight"), though escalation leans on introspection rather than external complication, and the brother's erasure is recounted rather than shown, limiting immediate dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth as absence, the weight of unacknowledged warnings—emerges through the illustration's margins and the charcoal smudges rather than statement. The Edelweiss shifts from delicate relic to "testament," grounding abstraction in concrete image. The brother's silenced data patterns layer personal grief with occupational epistemology. However, phrases like "fault-tolerant oracle" and "auroral sorrow" risk thematic over-articulation, and the final paragraph's explicit naming ("The weight...was hers to name") edges toward moralizing that replaces scene pressure with declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited to Elara; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close embodiment ("her breath fogging the paper") and slightly elevated reflection. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("swaying certainties," "peripherally aware"), though elevated register ("inoculation," "auroral sorrow") occasionally drifts from immediate crisis texture. The prose reflects Elara's scientific background without leaking into Wikipedia exposition. No dialogue present to assess. Perceptual signature is consistent—meteorological framing colors her grief—but the therapeutic precision of self-description ("fault-tolerant oracle") flattens immediacy at peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (truth as stone, fever as violent inoculation) mostly clarifies. However, template cadence appears in stacked constructions: "It was here she'd been left, here she'd consumed"; "not with her eyes but in the humming quiet"; "not in its substance but in the gravitational pull." The phrase "swaying certainties, persistent flickers that endure" and "fault-tolerant oracle" read as scaffolding from the prompt rather than organic prose. Overwriting clusters in the brother-revelation paragraph, where mixed metaphors ("fractures...in the data," "erased by disbelief") blur without intensifying. These artifacts touch the closure third, preventing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—grief as meteorological void, truth in margins rather than center, botanical precision meeting data erasure—feels specific and non-obvious. The smudging action as epistemic tool transforms a static illustration into active inquiry. However, the "fault-tolerant oracle" frame and "swallowed truth" anchor closely to prompt templates, and the brother backstory (ignored warnings, tragic erasure) follows familiar contours. The piece commits fully to its premise and earns emotional specificity, but the atmospheric vocabulary ("auroral sorrow") and the revelation structure (fever-visions clarify hidden patterns) stay within recognizable genre bounds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara as "fault-tolerant oracle" is signaled early and her "swaying certainties" drive the smudging choices that reweight the truth. Setup and development present; closure participation legible (her visions clarify the brother's erasure). However, "oracle" functions more as thematic label than causal constraint—her visions confirm rather than complicate, and no on-page cost or tradeoff tied specifically to this trait materializes. The trait enables interpretation but does not narrow options or impose visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in paragraph two, is touched and smudged twice (distinct beats), and returns at closure beside the sextant with reweighted meaning (testament, not relic). The illustration anchors the central action and its margins supply the metaphoric frame for truth-finding. Early signal, mid-scene development, and closure linkage all clear. The object is irreplaceable—removing it breaks the smudging logic and the final image's charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" is named early and modeled through Elara's "peripherally aware" flickers. The concept shapes her interpretive stance (certainties that "endure despite interference") and informs the final reconfiguration (truth as shifting mass). However, it functions primarily as interior descriptor rather than external constraint that alters tactics. Present in setup and thematically reinforced at closure, but middle development remains implicit; no on-page choice hinges visibly on this wobble.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" is introduced early and tied to fever-sharpened perception ("whispers in the static," "colors bleeding"). It enables her to catch the sextant glint and informs her epistemic method. However, the trait does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—it grants access without tradeoff. Setup and closure present (final peripheral catch of sextant), but no middle beat where this awareness forecloses an option or demands sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The smudge action is introduced clearly, repeated twice with escalating clarity (beside flower, below roots), and the second smudge triggers the brother revelation that defines the truth's weight. The action is irreplaceable—swapping it (e.g., tracing, tearing) would break the margins metaphor and the gradual accumulation logic. Early signal, two distinct beats, and closure participation (smudged drawing placed beside sextant). The action redefines options by crystallizing absence as substance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Occupying margins" is signaled early ("the method occupying margins where no detail was meant to intrude") and enacted through the smudging beside and below the flower. The mechanics matter—margins as the site where truth appears in negative space. However, the method is declared more than demonstrated; the smudging could read as simple interaction without the explicit gloss. Setup and closure present (final placement "anchors" the flower in "messy...reality of the margins"), but middle development remains implicit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is anchored early and supplies isolation, meteorological charts (now "a lie"), and the brother's sextant. The setting pressures Elara's reckoning by embodying the brother's lost work and providing the tools (charcoal, desk, illustration). Setup, middle use (charts reinterpreted), and closure (sextant beside smudged drawing) all present. However, the station could be swapped for another isolated research outpost without breaking core logic; its meteorological specificity charges theme but does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After fever breaks" is signaled in the opening line and supplies Elara's sharpened, weakened state. The timeframe motivates her clarity ("fever-visions" now accessible) and physical vulnerability (trembling fingers, bare feet). However, the aftermath does not impose a ticking cost or narrow a window—no deadline or decay pressures the inquiry. Setup present, thematic resonance at closure (fever as "violent inoculation"), but middle development as active constraint is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the weight of a swallowed truth" is declared early ("her motivation was simple, agonizing") and drives every smudging action. The desire is conflicted (truth as "stone in her gut," mass "shifting with her memory") and tested on the page through tactile inquiry. The final cost—shouldering the brother's silence—is legible. Setup, development (two smudges progressively clarify weight), and closure (truth named, burden accepted) all clear. However, the phrasing leans abstract; embodied friction between want and cost could sharpen.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is introduced early as "vast, quiet grief" and sustained through the piece (twilight metaphor, "permanent twilight in her heart"). The tone modulates subtly—weakened limbs and muddied thoughts soften into focused inquiry, then settle into contoured resignation. The tone charges the final image (sorrow no longer shapeless, defined by charcoal). However, "auroral" reads ornamental rather than functional—removing the Northern Lights frame would not break tonal coherence. Setup, mood consistency, and closure repricing present, but the specific auroral image does not constrain or reweight a choice.</comment>
