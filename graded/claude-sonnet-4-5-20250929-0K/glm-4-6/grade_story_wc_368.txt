<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is specific and embodied through his dye-master observations, with his heart's rhythm quickening at the wing's shimmer providing concrete physical anchoring. The progression from question to purpose is earned through weeks of sustained attention. Minor deduction: the donor remains abstract—no contradictory impulses complicate his inquiry, and the final shift feels more cerebral than visceral. The renunciation of "motivation to solve" for "compulsion to honor" lands cleanly but lacks visible cost that forecloses a prior path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The weeks-long tracking ritual builds density through repeated observation until the prism-refracted light creates a pattern break that reweights the stake. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elian moves from seeking the donor's identity to embodying their practice, with the cost felt in the replacement of one compulsion by another. The orientation is clear (watchful dye master, floating tea house, post-transplant) and the accumulative pressure coheres. Minor slip: the prism alignment feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior tracking data.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house and valley-mist establish atmosphere; the morpho wing, crystal teapot prism, and sun-trail floor marks ground tactile action. The prism-refracted beam constrains the climactic moment through specific optical geometry. Sensory detail is purposeful (soft morning blues vs. harsh noon silver) and filtered through dye-master perception. Does not reach 9-band: while the prism enables the key turn, the tea house itself supplies mood more than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning why some magnetize stories) is signaled early and tightens through the ritual. The prism-light alignment provides one meaningful deepening that narrows understanding from "question" to "purpose." The cost is conceptual—replacing detective urgency with devotional practice—and legible in the final paragraph's shift. Band guardrail met (7.0+): the tightening forecloses the search-driven option. Does not reach 8.8: the felt price is oblique; no visible trade-off dramatized on the page beyond interior reframing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (attention as prism, devotion over discovery) emerges from concrete sun-tracking rather than assertion. The morpho wing's iridescent caution shifts from philosophical label to lived practice. The ending offers a resonant answer—"live as a prism"—through image (stir-stick into dye vat, valley-mist, finally-his-own heartbeat) rather than moral. Minor deduction: "iridescent caution" as phrase appears early but its thematic weight is told more than constrained in choice until the climax; the leap to "people who learned how to listen" risks abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with dye-master lexicon (madder root, indigo, crucibles). Perceptual signature is consistent: observation filtered through color and light. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the flash, stepping back for reflection). Minor deduction: some phrasing edges toward elevated register ("valley-mist wonder," "quietly explosive in its intensity") that feels slightly imposed rather than voice-organic. No dialogue to assess; filter verbs ("he felt," "he knew") are voice-appropriate and do not dull immediacy here.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance image or state. Minor loops: "The wing did not just change color; it detonated with light. It illuminated in a silent, cascading wave" restates transformation. "Quietly explosive" appears twice within proximity without added detail. Template cadence in middle section: multiple "He saw how" constructions. Figurative language (prism metaphor, alchemy, beacon) coheres but appears in most sentences of the climax without pattern-teaching. Propulsion is strong overall; deductions prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of heart transplant recipient studying light refraction through a morpho wing is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "why do people magnetize stories" into "be a prism for the ordinary" feels earned in hindsight. Risk: the reflective, slow-burn structure without external conflict. Deduction: the prism-alignment turn, while poetic, relies on a somewhat convenient optical coincidence rather than protagonist-driven discovery. The dye-master frame is underused until the final line; swapping profession would not break the arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Watchful dye master: present throughout; observation drives the tracking ritual (middle beat); final choice to "live as a prism" and return to the dye vat links profession to closure. Setup + Development + Payoff gates met. Causal pressure moderate (watching enables insight but does not constrain tactics under conflict). Cost connection present but quiet (renunciation of search, embrace of devotion). Swappability: another contemplative profession (potter, calligrapher) could serve with minor edits; dye-master specificity (madder root, indigo) appears only in final lines. Score: two gates + closure linkage + modest causal work = mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Blue morpho wing: present from paragraph two (setup); tracked daily (middle beat); detonates with light at climax and "settled back" in denouement (payoff). Three gates met. Beat involvement: at least three distinct moments. Causal pressure: the wing's iridescence structures the tracking method and the prism-light alignment triggers the insight. Closure linkage strong: "carefully set aside, his study complete" and its lesson shape the final stance. Irreplaceability high: structural color (not pigment) is load-bearing for the prism theme. Score: strong setup + multi-beat + closure + specificity = upper 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Iridescent caution: named in paragraph two as "philosophy of seeing" (setup); shapes the observation method ("truth dependent on perspective and light"); returns in final reflection as "guide for engaging...attentively" (payoff). Development gate weak: the concept is described and reflected upon but does not constrain a middle choice or narrow options under pressure—it remains thematic overlay. Lyric reprise (early seed → final reweighting) is present and reweights the stake with cost (shift from caution-as-warning to caution-as-engagement). Score: two gates + lyric resonance + moderate thematic charge = upper 5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Quietly explosive: appears twice—"feeling that was quietly explosive in its intensity" (paragraph three) and "quietly explosive instant of total perception" (paragraph five). Setup weak (first use mid-story, label-only). Development: second use marks the climactic flash, enabling the insight (payoff gate met). Causal work: the attribute names the emotional register that makes the revelation land, but does not constrain action or create visible trade-off—it is perceptual descriptor more than trait. Cost connection: the intensity is felt but not paid. Score: two gates (weak setup, strong payoff) + closure linkage + label-only use = low-mid 6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Illuminate: gerund form "to illuminate its secret" signals intent (paragraph two, setup). The tracking ritual attempts illumination (middle beats). The wing "illuminated in a silent, cascading wave" at climax (payoff). Three gates met. Major turn traces to this action: the light-detonation triggers understanding and shifts Elian's purpose. Causal pressure: the action is the mechanism of insight. Swappability test: "reveal" or "disclose" could substitute with minor tonal shift; the word itself is not irreplaceable, but the act of light-based revelation is central. Score: three gates + turn-driving + modest specificity = low 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tracking sun trails: introduced paragraph two ("he began to track the sun trails"), executed over weeks ("Each day...mark the journey"), mechanics matter (penciled map on floorboards, specific angles). Setup + Development gates met. The method culminates in the prism-refracted beam at the climax: "a specific alignment occurred" only because prior tracking mapped the light (payoff gate met). Three gates. Causal pressure: the ritual shapes all middle attempts and enables the discovery. Irreplaceability: the sun-tracking is the story's engine. Score: three gates + multi-beat + closure enabler + high specificity = mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Floating rock tea house: named early (setup gate met). The tea house provides the observatory space and the valley-mist frames mood throughout (recurrent mention). Payoff: valley-mist swirls outside window in final line. Development gate weak: the setting does not constrain a middle choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—it is backdrop. The "floating rock" detail is ornamental; "tea house" anchors locale but could be any contemplative dwelling. Micro-setting option (crystal teapot prism) does constrain the climax, but that is Object B. Score: two gates (setup + weak payoff reprise) + atmospheric function + swappability = low-mid 5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>After receiving the donor heart: timeframe established paragraph one (setup). The donor heart's rhythm "would subtly quicken" during observation (middle beat, development). Final line "his heart beating a rhythm that was finally...his own" closes the arc (payoff). Three gates met. Causal work: the transplant motivates the inquiry and the heart's responses guide attention, but time itself does not tighten decisions—weeks pass without escalating pressure. The timeframe is backdrop for the inquiry rather than a live clock. Cost: the shift from donor-driven to self-owned rhythm is felt. Score: three gates + motivation linkage + moderate closure charge + low time-pressure = mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To learn why some people magnetize stories: stated paragraph one (setup); drives the weeks-long tracking (development); answered and replaced by "honor the lesson" at closure (payoff). Three gates met. Desire is dramatized through sustained ritual and the heart-quickening responses. Friction: the search is renounced in favor of embodiment ("motivation to solve...replaced by...compulsion to honor"), foreclosing the detective path with felt cost. Causal pressure: the motivation structures all beats and the answer reweights the stake. Irreplaceability high. Score: three gates + multi-beat + closure transformation + cost = upper 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Valley-mist wonder: named paragraph one; valley-mist returns throughout ("would rise to meet his windows," "swirling outside his window"). Tone is coherent—contemplative, lyric, luminous—and modulates slightly (velvety blues → harsh silver → spectral detonation → quiet return). The mist charges the final image by anchoring the setting as Elian returns to work. Setup + Payoff gates met; Development weak (tone does not shift under pressure in middle beats; it remains steady wonder). Single mood with cadence variation. Score: two gates + coherent modulation + closure charge + static middle = upper-mid 6s.</comment>
