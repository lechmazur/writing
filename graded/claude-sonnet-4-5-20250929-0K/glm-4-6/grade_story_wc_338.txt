<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is characterized through his occupation and "methodically curious" trait, but these remain largely label-only. His motivation "to interpret silence with empathy" is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. The final "discovery" moment lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives—he simply perceives what he sought. Internal conflict is absent; no competing desires complicate his arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story follows a causal structure but lacks meaningful reversal or tightening. Elias sets up equipment, aligns timestamps, performs a ritual, and succeeds—a linear sequence without complication. The closure offers no decisive change with visible cost; he "finds his purpose" through perception alone. Orientation is delayed (vault location, cathedral context, and great-grandfather's journals all arrive in fragments), applying the −0.4 penalty and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0 per the Orientation Test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The vault setting is vividly rendered with rain-scoured frescoes and rust-colored tears, establishing atmosphere effectively. However, the environment remains largely decorative; it does not constrain Elias's choices or supply resources that alter his approach. The ancient henge appears only on monitors, never pressuring the protagonist spatially. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, but the setting does not reach the 9+ gate of constraining choice or charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reopening the whispered chapel—is signaled early, but pressure never escalates or tightens options. Elias encounters no obstacles, reversals, or costs; each step (setup, alignment, ritual) succeeds as planned. The "discovery" is perceptual, not a choice that forecloses alternatives. No agency-driven turn narrows his path, and coincidence (the distortion appearing at 3:47 AM in both recordings) facilitates rather than complicates resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges around silence, empathy, and knowledge transmission ("some knowledge must be discovered, not taught"), but the final paragraph makes this explicit rather than letting it resonate through image. The whispered chapel concept remains abstract; its thematic weight is asserted ("bridge what could be felt") rather than earned through specific, conflicted experience. The meteorite-and-holy-water ritual and time-comparative method offer specificity, yet the ending's thematic statement ("His great-grandfather's legacy was complete") dilutes resonance with summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Elias's perceptual bias foregrounded (he notices "silences" in atlases, visual cadence in footage). Diction is elevated and consistent, though phrases like "shielded openness" and "methodically curious mind" feel more imposed than voice-natural. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the focalization does not leak. The prose carries a distinct texture, but under peak moments the register drifts toward abstraction ("dimensional fabric," "frequency of existence") rather than Elias's embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clarity is generally maintained, but template cadence recurs: "Elias [verb]" sentence stems dominate, and paraphrase loops appear (e.g., "ancient henge" repeated across adjacent lines; "methodically curious" restated as "perceptive nature"). Figurative density is high without always clarifying ("fresco vault curved like a question mark," "at the spot where a map tears" used both literally and metaphorically, creating confusion). Rhythm is monotonous; paragraph structure varies little. Information density is moderate, with some scaffolding ("As a methodically curious man") that could be cut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—discovering an acoustic anomaly through silent video comparison—offers a fresh angle, and the map-framer protagonist is specific. However, the execution leans on stock mystical tropes (meteorite and holy water, sacred space, great-grandfather's journal) without transforming them through lived detail or moral calculus. The "spot where a map tears" motif is repeated but remains metaphorical rather than causally integrated. Emotional specificity is low; Elias's arc follows a predictable discovery template without bold risk or inevitable-feeling synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his occupation is thematically linked to the ending ("not to chart what could be seen, but to bridge what could be felt"). However, his choices do not create key turns; he executes a plan without adaptation or cost. His perceptiveness is told rather than demonstrated through decisions that alter tactics. The character is functional but replaceable with any determined researcher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The ancient henge appears in setup (great-grandfather's journals), development (on both monitors), and ending (the distortion manifestation). It is handled across multiple beats, yet it remains on-screen rather than physically engaged. Its properties do not constrain Elias's choices or evolve causally. The henge is essential to the premise but could be swapped for any sacred site without altering the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The whispered chapel is seeded early and referenced at closure, satisfying setup and payoff gates. However, it remains abstract throughout—a concept described rather than a pressure that shapes tactics. Its "acoustic anomalies" are never concretely realized on the page; Elias perceives them intellectually rather than encountering obstacles or costs tied to its nature. The concept is thematically present but does not change options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is labeled repeatedly but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. Elias's approach is patient and systematic, but these traits do not create friction, force a trade-off, or alter his path. The attribute is ornamental, serving as character description rather than a driver of choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Reopen" is the protagonist's explicit goal and the story's central action. It structures the narrative (Elias seeks to reopen the whispered chapel) and appears at closure ("reopening the whispered chapel was merely the first map marker"). However, the act itself is perceptual rather than physical or costly; no door is literally opened, no consequence paid. The action is thematically essential but mechanically replaceable with "discover" or "perceive."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled in the second paragraph, developed through the equipment setup and timestamp alignment, and produces the distortion that manifests the chapel. It shapes Elias's attempt across multiple beats and offers specificity (1978 footage vs. yesterday's, 3:47 AM alignment). However, the mechanics remain opaque—why silent video reveals acoustic anomalies is unexplained—and the method succeeds without friction or cost. It is causally present but not irreplaceable; another detection method could serve the same function.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The vault is established early with vivid detail (rain-scoured frescoes, rust-colored tears, question-mark curve) and remains the scene's sole location. It provides atmospheric pressure ("the vault's atmosphere shifted") and is referenced at closure ("dawn broke through the vault's high windows"). The setting charges the final image and supplies the ritual space, though it does not constrain Elias's choices or alter tactics. It is essential to tone and closure participation, reaching the lower threshold for strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"At the spot where a map tears" is used metaphorically throughout (dimensional fabric, physical map fold, dividing known from unknown) but never functions as a temporal constraint or tightens decisions. It is a recurring image rather than a timeframe. The story's clock is vague (three months of research, 3:47 AM timestamps, dawn at the end) and does not pressure Elias's actions or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation is declared in the opening ("His particular motivation to interpret silence with empathy") and echoed at closure ("a much larger journey into empathy, silence"). However, it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost. Elias does not face friction between empathy and another desire; the trait is thematic rather than action-driving. It shapes the premise but does not constrain middle choices or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" appears once ("approached his greatest creation with shielded openness, his heart guarded yet receptive") and describes Elias's stance rather than modulating across beats. The vault's atmosphere is consistently reverent and charged, but the tone does not shift with pressure or charge the final image through cadence change. It is thematically coherent but static, never tested or deepened by escalation.</comment>
