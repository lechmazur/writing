<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and his embodied responses during mist walking carry adequate texture ("cold air stinging his lungs"). The final choice—placing the keystone—is set up by years of searching but the on-page cost is largely conceptual ("memory of authentic creation") rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off that narrows options. Internal contradiction is minimal; the piece tells us he's found what he seeks without dramatizing a meaningful sacrifice or a renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the first paragraph. The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: atmosphere and luminance imagery build toward a final cadence shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael touches "the true essence of magic"—but the felt cost is abstract ("something had changed… in himself") rather than a concrete on-page forfeiture or choice that reweights prior options. The Cost Proof Test cannot point to a specific line where loss or price is legible, triggering a −0.5 deduction in Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire, clouds, and mist are vividly rendered with sensory detail (wind, cold, golden luminance). The keystone and railing are handled objects that ground action. The spire's height and automated systems below create spatial pressure, and the mist-walking sequence uses the environment to constrain movement. This clears the 9+ gate requirement (environment constrains a choice or charges the final image), supporting a score in the 7-range.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early: rediscovering magic with soul versus automated precision. The mist-walking ascent provides a meaningful tightening—Kael steps off the spire into impossibility—but the resolution (placing the keystone, feeling connection) is largely internal and contemplative. No visible price or trade-off narrows later options; the automated systems continue unaware, and Kael descends with "the memory of authentic creation" rather than a dramatized cost that alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—human creativity versus algorithmic perfection—emerges through images (luminance, mist, keystone) rather than overt statement until the final paragraphs, which edge toward summary ("the most powerful spell of all"). The keystone's property ("accommodates impossibilities") functions as a thematic claim more than a concrete stake-shaper. The ending offers a quiet resonance but lacks a non-literal final image that reweights prior material; instead it restates the premise in slightly elevated language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable and clean throughout. Diction ("brilliant dimness," "accommodates impossibilities," "metaphysically") is elevated and consistent with a fantasy register; no mid-paragraph head-hopping. Perceptual signature is adequate—Kael notices warmth and imperfection—though some phrases ("humanity's touch," "sacred recognition") drift toward abstract thematic language. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the voice modulates appropriately from description to contemplation at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied. However, several template stems recur ("Kael [verb]" × 4 openings; "The [noun] [verb]" pattern in exposition), and synonym loops appear ("automated systems" mentioned eight times with near-identical framing, "luminance" described as "lingering," "soft golden," "intensified," "began to fade" in close succession). The figurative claim "accommodates impossibilities" appears three times with identical phrasing, reading as a prompt echo rather than organic prose. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and loops, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—manual magic versus automation—engages a familiar creator-versus-machine trope. The specific setting (icebound spire, forgotten garden keystone, mist walking) provides concrete detail, but the emotional arc (underachieving mage reclaims authentic magic) follows a predictable template without a non-obvious turn. The resolution affirms the initial stance rather than complicating it. The "accommodates impossibilities" phrase and "when creativity gets automated" read as prompt echoes rather than transformations of the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Kael appears in every beat and his decisions (to climb, to mist-walk, to place the keystone) drive the sequence. He is present in the closure image ("something had changed… in himself"). However, his choices do not create reversals or meaningful costs; the ascent proceeds without friction, and placing the keystone produces an epiphany rather than a trade-off. Early signal (+0.5), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+0.8), but low causal pressure and no visible cost (−0.7). Score: 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The keystone is mentioned in paragraph two, handled in the climax ("placed the keystone into its designated slot"), and its properties ("accommodates impossibilities") are invoked at closure. It appears in three distinct beats (pouch, placement, metaphysical tilt). Early signal (+0.5), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.0), but the keystone does not constrain a choice—it unlocks an epiphany without cost. Swappability moderate (−0.4). Score: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lingering luminance is introduced in paragraph four, recurs in the summit sequence, and "intensified" at the keystone moment, then fades. It appears in three beats and frames the closure image. Early signal (+0.5), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+0.9), but it functions as atmosphere and thematic marker rather than a constraint or tactical element. Ornamental use (−0.7). Score: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Accommodates impossibilities" is attributed to the keystone in paragraph two, invoked again in the mist-walking rationale, and repeated at the climax and coda. It appears in four beats. Early signal (+0.5), four beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+0.8), but the trait is told rather than dramatized—no visible trade-off or constraint on action. Label-only (−0.3), summary-only (−0.3), synonym churn (exact phrase × 3, −0.3). Score: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Unstrap" appears once in paragraph three as Kael prepares spell components; it enables the mist-walking sequence. Present in one beat, mid-story introduction (−0.3), functional but easily swappable with "retrieve" or "ready" (−0.6). One beat (+0.4), causal link to next action (+0.5). Score: 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mist walking is seeded in paragraph three, executed in paragraphs four and five, and mentioned in the descent. It appears in three beats and shapes the ascent tactic. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (enables the impossible climb, +0.8), but no cost is attached—the technique works perfectly without struggle or trade-off (−0.6). Score: 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The icebound spire is introduced in the opening line, structures the entire climb, and anchors the closure image. Wind, cold, height, and the contrast with automated systems below create spatial and conceptual pressure. Early signal (+0.7), present in five beats (+1.4), causal pressure (height and mist constrain the method, +1.0), closure linkage (descent image, +0.9), specificity (icebound + clouds + summit, +0.5). Score: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "when creativity gets automated" is declared in the opening and restated in the coda. It provides thematic context but does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Kael's midnight window is mentioned once but never tested. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), but no on-page pressure or deadline that alters tactics (−0.8). Ornamental (−0.5), label-only (−0.3). Score: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the sacred in the simple" is stated in paragraph one, reflected in Kael's manual spell choices, and affirmed in the coda. It appears in three beats and frames the closure. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+0.8), but the desire is told more than dramatized—no on-page choice pits this want against a conflicting cost or fear (−0.7). Summary-only (−0.4). Score: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" is invoked once as a descriptor in paragraph six and echoed in the luminance imagery (golden light in darkness). It appears in two beats and contributes to atmosphere. Mid-story introduction (−0.3), two beats (+0.9), tone coherence (soft light vs. harsh automation, +0.6), closure linkage (the fading luminance charges the final image, +0.8), but the phrase itself is ornamental and not integrated into action (−0.5). Score: 5.5.</comment>
