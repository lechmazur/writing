<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orion's motivation—preserving his daughter's final sounds through haunted firmware—is embodied and specific, but the emotional arc is largely told through exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The guilt that drives him is legible, yet the key realization arrives via device translation rather than enacted choice under pressure. Micro-choices (touching the amber, preparing tomorrow's tattoo) are present but feel mechanically linked to backstory rather than wrestling with live contradiction. The final renunciation ("I tether you properly now") feels more ritual than a forfeiture that closes off a path with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who and where early (constellation tattooist, laboratory) and establishes a single stake (releasing trapped sounds/guilt). However, the closure—Orion writing a letter and whispering to the amber—lacks decisive change or visible cost; the "different kind of silence" is asserted rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending gesture (letter-writing, dreaming) recounts resolution rather than enacting it. The causal chain (amber resonates → device translates → Orion prepares tattoo) is present but the final image of peace and steady hands tells us the change rather than showing the cost or foreclosed path required for closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly anchored with antique cabinets, resonance equipment, and the grandmother's desk, and these objects recur throughout. The amber on the examination table constrains the climactic beat (Orion touches device to amber, triggering the memory translation). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (whiskey-burning static, spidery script, meteor hush), filtered through Orion's professional lens. The micro-setting (amber, desk, tattoo equipment) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrain choice or shape closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—releasing trapped sounds and confronting guilt—is signaled early, but escalation is diffuse. The piece traces a single tightening (amber begins resonating → device translates Orion's voice → preparation of Lacerta tattoo), yet this sequence feels like discovery rather than a choice under pressure that narrows options. Agency is largely receptive (Orion learns, understands, prepares) rather than a decision with visible tradeoff. The cost (guilt "tethered properly") is asserted in the denouement without an on-page action that forecloses a live alternative, keeping the score in mid-band despite coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—grief, memory, and the weight of untranslatable loss—emerges organically from the firmware mechanics and Orion's tattooing practice. The amber and insect function as a recurring image that shifts meaning (from impulse purchase to guilt repository), and the final constellation (Lacerta, "someone carry your constellation") resonates without moralizing. However, the ending risks overstatement ("even the quietest cry can become a constellation bright enough to guide others home"), edging toward thematic summary. The piece invites reflection on how loss finds form, earning mid-high band despite the slightly declarative close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited, and the perceptual signature is specific to Orion's craft (cosmic patterns, resonance frequencies, "ghosts of vibrations"). Diction is mostly controlled, though "分毫" (a Chinese character meaning "tiny bit") jars against the otherwise consistent English idiom and register. The prose modulates with pressure (static "like whiskey burning through wires"), and the grandmother's letters provide voice texture. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that harm immediacy. The single orthographic anomaly and slight exposition in the letters prevent higher band entry, but distance and focus hold throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high (amber, firmware, constellations interwoven), but several scaffold phrases dull momentum: "His life's work was to release them, if only for a while" and "some sounds require decades to find their form" read as thematic summary rather than scene propulsion. The final paragraph overexplains the resonance effect rather than trusting the image. No major loops or template cadence, and the opening anchors voice effectively. The slight overwriting in peak beats (explaining rather than showing the firmware's resolution) and the expository close keep the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooing, haunted firmware that translates baby cries, and amber-trapped memory offers a fresh, non-obvious angle on grief and preservation. The piece commits to its premise without hedging, and the specificity (Lacerta, Geminids shower, resonance equipment) avoids generic abstraction. The emotional core—a father encoding his daughter's sounds into clients' skin—feels earned rather than sentimental. However, the framing (laboratory of lost sounds, time folds) risks high-concept ornament, and the ending's explanation ("tether you properly now") leans toward articulating rather than enacting transformation. The boldness and specificity elevate the score despite the slight overstatement at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orion is present throughout and makes key decisions (purchasing amber, touching device to amber, preparing Lacerta tattoo), but his choices feel reactive rather than driving turns. He observes, understands, and prepares, but does not wrestle with a dilemma that alters tactics under pressure. The character shapes two beats (acquiring amber, interpreting its resonance) and participates in closure (writing the letter, whispering), meeting two of three gates. His role is essential but lacks the causal pressure of a choice with visible tradeoff, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The amber appears early (impulse purchase from collector), drives the climactic beat (resonates with equipment, triggers memory translation), and is present in the closure image (placed on grandmother's desk, addressed in final whisper). It handles or is used in three distinct beats (examination table, device contact, final placement) and its prehistoric prisoner metaphor charges the theme of time-trapped memory. The amber's specific properties (insect inside, resonating frequency) are irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage push the score toward high band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is introduced early (grandmother's letters explain it) and drives the central mechanic (translates baby cries, acts erratically, then harmonizes). It shapes two key beats (equipment unrest, translation of Orion's voice) and enables the ending gesture (preparing tattoo with harmonized firmware). However, the firmware's "haunting" feels more metaphor than enacted constraint—it resists and then cooperates without an on-page action or tradeoff that tests Orion's tactics. The concept is present and functional but could be replaced with a less fantastical device without breaking the emotional arc, keeping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The attribute (translates baby cries) is seeded early via grandmother's letters and explained as preserving the daughter's final sounds. It constrains Orion's work (the machine's purpose) and enables the climax (translation of "I'm sorry, little star"). The trait is handled in two beats (exposition, climactic translation) and directly informs the closure (tattoo will carry Lacerta mapped with Orion's guilt). However, the translation itself is summarized rather than dramatized—we are told the device speaks Orion's words, but we do not see a tradeoff or choice that tests the trait under pressure. The attribute is essential but its mechanics remain abstract, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tether is introduced via the grandmother's letters ("how to tether living memories to the ink") and recurs in the climax ("Orion finally understood how to tether this specific guilt to resolution") and closure ("I tether you properly now"). The action shapes three beats (instruction, realization, final gesture) and is irreplaceable—removing "tether" would collapse the story's central mechanic of binding memory to constellation tattoos. The verb's specificity (not "preserve" or "encode") charges the ending image. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage earn mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Handwritten letters from the grandmother's desk are introduced early (antique writing desk, secret drawer, spidery script) and provide the firmware's backstory and tethering instructions. They shape two beats (exposition of firmware mechanics, connected letters enabling Orion's final understanding) and participate in the closure image (Orion writes "one last letter" on the desk). However, the letters' mechanics are largely expository—they inform rather than constrain on-page action. The method is present and functional but could be replaced with another information source (a journal, a voice recording) with minor edits, keeping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is anchored early (first sentence) and recurs as a textured space (antique cabinets, resonance equipment, examination table, grandmother's desk). Setting details constrain action (amber on examination table, equipment connection, desk placement) and charge the final image ("filled with a different kind of silence"). The lab's "ghosts of vibrations" metaphor integrates with the haunted-firmware concept, and the spatial choreography is clear across all beats. The setting is irreplaceable—this story cannot occur in a generic studio. High causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage push the score toward 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe phrase ("when time folds in on itself") appears twice: early as exposition and in the climax when the amber captures memory. It provides atmospheric texture but does not constrain tactics or create a ticking clock. The piece unfolds in a single night (setup to midnight to morning), but this linear progression does not tighten decisions. The phrase is present and thematically consistent but remains metaphorical rather than a live temporal pressure that narrows options. Functional but replaceable, trending mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation (to hush the dissonance of old guilt) is seeded midway ("guilt that had soured his equipment") and made explicit in the penultimate paragraph ("his own desperation to hush the dissonance of old guilt"). It drives two beats (equipment unrest, realization) and informs the closure gesture (tethering guilt properly). However, the motivation is largely told rather than enacted—Orion does not choose between competing desires under pressure. The phrase "hush the dissonance" is specific and irreplaceable, but the lack of on-page friction between wants and costs keeps the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Meteor hush is mentioned twice: the amber fell "during the meteor hush of last winter's Geminids shower" and the closing line ("May someone carry your constellation until the meteor hush returns us to starlight"). The tone is quiet and elegiac throughout, modulating from unrest (whiskey-burning static) to peace (final silence). The phrase charges the ending image and creates a lyric callback, but it does not constrain action or drive a beat. The tone is coherent and purposeful, earning mid-band for its reprise structure, but it trends replaceable—another celestial metaphor could serve similar thematic ends.</comment>
