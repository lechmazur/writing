<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eliza's claustrophobia is mentioned but never constrains a choice—paradoxically she feels "free" underwater, which undercuts the trait's dramatic potential. Her mentor's disappearance and the codex provide backstory motivation, but her decision to "dissolve" and join the trapped consciousness lacks embodied hesitation or visible cost in the moment; the transition reads as acceptance without struggle. Internal contradiction is present (spelunker fearing confinement vs. finding freedom in pressure) but remains告知 rather than dramatized through micro-choices. The final "calling" feels declared rather than earned through on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (cables, gold fleck, phase transitions) and the final stanza reconfigures Eliza's state from solid explorer to liminal guardian. However, the closure unit—her dissolution into a new existence—occurs through passive transformation rather than protagonist choice, and the cost (leaving physical life) is asserted in retrospect rather than felt in the transition moment. The "return" action and tidal timeframe frame the piece but the escalation is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The submerged facility is vividly anchored: "water that seemed somehow thicker," monitors frozen in 30-year loops, undersea cables "draped across the lab floor like electric serpents." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Eliza's perception. The gold fleck functions as micro-setting, constraining her path and charging the final image when it "blazed with sudden intensity." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The environment directly enables the phase-transition closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what happened to her mentor and the trapped researchers—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric density rather than decision points; Eliza encounters no obstacles, makes no tactical shifts, and faces no reversals. The tightening occurs in the final act when the gold fleck synchronizes with the cables and she begins to dissolve, but this is enacted upon her rather than driven by her agency. The cost (leaving physical existence) is conceptual and asserted rather than viscerally felt in the moment. Under an Accumulative lens this passes, but agency remains weak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of memory, witness, and liminal existence emerges organically through the facility's frozen state, the trapped consciousness, and Eliza's transformation into guardian. "To stand by the unremembered" integrates with her final choice without overt moralizing. The gold fleck and cables function as motifs that reweight at closure. However, the ending's resonance is partly undercut by the explanation ("she would remain until the next phase transition") which edges toward thesis statement. The phase-transition concept charges the final image but also risks abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "water that seemed somehow thicker," "ozone despite being submerged." Diction is consistent and elevated, matching the premise. However, register occasionally drifts into exposition ("According to his scattered notes, the cables weren't just data carriers...") that feels more like narrator explanation than Eliza's lived thought. The line "系统 of invisible things" appears to be a Unicode artifact or untranslated fragment that disrupts voice. Psychic distance remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Strong figurative language: "each doorway a threatening mouth," "electric serpents," "crushing hush." However, paraphrase loops appear: the gold fleck's pulsing/brightening/blazing is restated multiple times without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "She had come... but found instead" and "The gold fleck became... still tracking" echo each other structurally. The phrase "crushing pressure" appears three times. Minor filter-verb density ("felt herself beginning to dissolve") in the climax. No artifacts touch the closure image directly, but cumulative drag is present.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar elements (abandoned research facility, consciousness upload, liminal existence) with specific detail: tidal timeframes, quantum signatures, the illuminated codex. The gold fleck as inheritance and navigation tool offers a fresh inflection. However, the core arc—explorer discovers facility, learns of trapped consciousness, joins them—follows a well-worn template without transformation through unexpected moral calculus or lived complication. The phase-transition mechanism and the "stand by the unremembered" framing elevate but don't fully escape derivative structure. Emotional truth is present but the resolution feels preordained rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eliza is present throughout and her claustrophobia is mentioned early, but she makes no key choices that alter tactics. She observes, descends, touches a cable, and accepts dissolution—all passive or reactive. Her mentor's codex guides her path. The transformation happens to her rather than through her decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gold fleck appears in the opening third, tracks invisible signatures in the middle (guiding her to the lab), and blazes at closure when Eliza dissolves, becoming her "companion in this new existence." It shapes three distinct beats and charges the final image. However, it functions more as a navigation device than a constraint that forces hard choices.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Undersea cables are introduced early as "conduits for consciousness," pulse throughout the facility, and synchronize with the gold fleck at closure to enable Eliza's phase transition. They shape the core stakes (understanding the trapped researchers) and enable the ending transformation. Present in setup, middle, and payoff with causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tracks invisible things" is established early via the gold fleck's function and guides Eliza's descent to the central lab. At closure she perceives "the beautiful, terrible signatures of consciousness caught between phases." The trait enables navigation but doesn't constrain action with visible cost—she never chooses between tracking and another conflicting need.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Return" is seeded in the codex text ("one must return through phase transitions") and enacted at closure when Eliza joins the trapped researchers, "finally returned to the place she belonged." The action redefines her state from explorer to guardian. However, it's unclear what she's returning *to*—the researchers? A destined role? The ambiguity slightly weakens causal clarity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Phase transitions" are mentioned in the codex early, linked to tidal changes and dimensional barriers, and explicitly enacted at closure: "she felt herself beginning to dissolve, no longer solid but transitioning." The method shapes the ending and is signaled in setup, but its mechanics remain abstract—how does touching the cable trigger it? The means matters but lacks tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility frames the entire story, supplies the cables and equipment that enable closure, and creates the "frozen in poses of sudden abandonment" atmosphere. Eliza navigates its corridors, reaches the central lab, and the facility's "failing windows" witness her transformation. Setup, middle navigation, and closure participation all present; the setting directly enables the phase-transition ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Between tidal changes, when the moon held its breath" opens the story and the codex specifies "phase transitions that occur between tidal changes when dimensional barriers thin." At closure "the tide began to turn outside" triggers the gold fleck's intensity. The timeframe is signaled and participates in closure, but it doesn't actively constrain Eliza's choices—she doesn't race a clock or adjust tactics as time runs out.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To stand by the unremembered" appears in the codex text Eliza has "memorized" and is fulfilled at closure when she becomes "a guardian standing by the unremembered." The motivation is told through the codex and narratively asserted at the end rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. She seeks answers and finds a calling, but no on-page friction tests whether she truly wants this vs. escaping or saving them.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Crushing hush" is invoked directly twice: "crushing pressure" appears throughout and "crushing hush of the deep gave way to something else—a sound like breathing." At closure "crushing pressure had been replaced by a profound stillness that weighed nothing and everything simultaneously" and the final line mentions "crushing hush of eternal tide." The tone is coherent and modulates from oppressive to transcendent, charging the final image.</comment>
