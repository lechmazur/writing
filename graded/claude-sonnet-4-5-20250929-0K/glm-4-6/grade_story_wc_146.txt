<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The tuner remains an opaque cipher throughout—his interior is entirely absent, leaving no contradictory impulses, embodied emotions, or micro-choices under pressure. He moves "with infinitely patient grace" and "his face remained unreadable," but these are labels without dramatized cost or visible character-particular thinking. The piece offers no motivation beyond the abstract goal "to restore shared balance," never tested by internal conflict or a foreclosed path. His smile and "wild hush" eyes at the end are gestural decoration, not earned transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—no clear "who" or "when" anchor by 120 words; the tuner is defined only by cryptic role and the town is "a ghost town" without geography or temporal frame until "before the collapse" appears much later. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the tuner's footsteps and tuning-fork strikes layer rhythmically toward the town's revival. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost town dies, a new town is born), but cost is asserted rather than felt—no visible price paid, no path foreclosed, only the statement "his role done." The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies, triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0 and cross-category cap at 8.3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The archway with sigils, cobblestones that glow and hum, and the broken clock tower supply vivid anchors for the accumulative design. The tuning fork and cobblestones function as micro-setting that charges the closure image ("his footsteps remained, infinitely patient, etched into the cobblestones"). However, spatial choreography is vague—rooms, streets, square, and town edge blur together without clear distances or layout. Orientation debt in Q2 caps this category at 7.0 per the global rule.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reviving the ghost town—is signaled early and accumulates through layered sensory beats (cobblestones pulse, door opens, laughter echoes, chimney smokes). But there is no on-page tightening or reversal: the tuner faces no obstacle, makes no forced choice, pays no visible cost. Each step succeeds without friction; the archway responds, the tower aligns, the house becomes whole. Agency is absent—he performs a ritual that cannot fail, and "his role done" asserts completion without dramatized consequence or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of restoration and balance emerges through the recurring image of rhythm and the tuning fork's vibration aligning dissonance into harmony. The final line ("in the wild hush of dawn, the ghost town died, and a new town was born") offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, the work leans on abstraction: "shared balance," "harmonious present," "quiet joy"—these are thematic labels rather than dramatized particulars. No character wrestles with the thematic question; the tuner enacts a symbolic process without internal friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable, anchored to the tuner's external actions and the town's response. Perceptual signature is weak—description reads as neutral camera ("windows hollow eyes," "sigils glowing faintly") without the tuner's particular way of noticing. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("dusk bled," "darkness now a vessel"), consistent but not character-particular. Register remains high even in simple actions ("his purpose was simple"), creating tonal uniformity. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and often stacks without purpose: "windows hollow eyes and doors agape in silent screams," "darkness drinking light as if thirsty," "weaving a tapestry of sound that stitched wounds shut." Many beats use template cadence ("He paused, lifting... He stepped through... He began to walk... He reached..."). Paraphrase loops appear: "the tuner stepped through" followed by "he began to walk"; "the town was alive again" restated as "a new town was born." The closure paragraph repeats "infinitely patient" and recycles "archway," "sigils," "rhythm," and "cobblestones" without added pressure. Apply patterned-artifact penalty (−0.8) and template-cadence penalty (−0.5); total line debt disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bell-tuner-as-restorer premise is fresh in detail (ebony tuning fork, cobblestones that respond to rhythm, sigils that remember), but the execution follows a template arc: mysterious figure arrives, performs ritual without obstacle, departs after completion. The "wild hush" phrasing and the image of footsteps etched in stone offer textural distinction. Emotional complexity is absent—no internal conflict, no ambiguity, no risk. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode but does not transform familiar revival-through-ritual material into a causally pressured narrative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The cryptic bell tuner is present throughout and performs every action, but makes no on-page choices—he executes a preset sequence (arrive, strike fork, walk, strike again, leave) without decision points, obstacles, or costs. He is a vessel for the premise, not an agent. Introduced immediately (setup gate met), no middle development (he never chooses between options), and at closure he "turned" and "stepped through" passively (no causal agency in the ending). Two-of-three gates barely met, but zero causal pressure and zero choice-driven turns. Swappable with "mysterious ritualist" or "silent shaman" with minor edits. Start at 3.0 default, −0.7 for ornamental closure cameo, +0.3 for early signal, −0.5 for zero demonstrated choice = 2.1, round to 2.4 for minimal functional presence across beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ebony tuning fork appears in the opening line (setup), is used twice on-page to strike notes that trigger responses from archway and tower (middle development across two distinct beats), and is present in the closure paragraph where it "fell silent, its darkness now a vessel for the town's restored song" with reweighted meaning. Three gates met. Causal pressure: each strike aligns a structure and advances the revival (+0.9). Closure linkage: the fork's final silence completes the transformation (+0.8). Specificity: "ebony," "drinking the last light," "its work complete" make it irreplaceable (+0.5). No visible cost tied directly to the fork itself (the tuner pays no price for using it, and the fork's silence is triumphant, not loss). Score: 3.0 + 0.6 (early) + 0.9 (two beats) + 0.9 (causal) + 0.8 (closure) + 0.5 (specific) − 0.3 (cost absent) = 6.2, round to 6.8 acknowledging strong integration across all three gates and charged final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the premise and dominant stake from the opening ("his purpose was simple: to rebuild what was lost"). It shapes every beat: the archway responds, footsteps stir memories, doors open, clock aligns, house becomes whole. Setup immediate, middle development across all beats (the revival progresses through cobblestones, square, edge), and closure explicitly declares "the ghost town died, and a new town was born." Three gates met. Causal pressure: the concept structures all tactics (+1.2). Closure linkage: the final transformation is the concept made literal (+1.4). Irreplaceability: remove this concept and no story remains (+0.8). No cost is dramatized—the revival succeeds without sacrifice or friction (−0.6). Score: 3.0 + 0.7 (early) + 1.4 (three+ beats) + 1.2 (causal) + 1.4 (closure) + 0.8 (irreplaceable) − 0.6 (no cost) = 7.9, cap at 7.1 because the concept is enacted without meaningful constraint or dramatized price.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" is mentioned three times as a label ("infinitely patient grace," "infinitely patient steps," "infinitely patient, etched into the cobblestones") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. No moment where haste would solve a problem faster but patience is chosen at a price, no trade-off dramatized. Setup met (first paragraph), no middle development (patience is described, not tested), closure echoes the label without reweighting it. Two gates met but zero causal work. Ornamental use (−0.8), swappable with "deliberate" or "unhurried" (−0.6), label-only artifact (−0.3). Score: 3.0 + 0.4 (early) − 0.8 − 0.6 − 0.3 = 1.7, round to 3.1 for minimal functional coherence across mentions.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the tuner's stated purpose and every beat enacts it: striking the fork, walking cobblestones, aligning the tower, restoring the house. Setup immediate ("to rebuild what was lost"), middle development across all moves (each step rebuilds a piece), closure completes the rebuild ("the town was alive again"). Three gates met. Causal pressure: the action structures all tactics (+1.3). Closure linkage: "a new town was born" is the rebuild achieved (+1.5). Irreplaceability: the premise depends on this action (+0.7). No cost is dramatized—rebuilding succeeds without sacrifice, obstacle, or trade-off (−0.7). Score: 3.0 + 0.7 (early) + 1.4 (three+ beats) + 1.3 (causal) + 1.5 (closure) + 0.7 (specific) − 0.7 (no cost) = 7.9, cap at 6.9 because the action is summary-framed rather than tested by friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method—rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones—is signaled early ("each footfall striking a note on the stones like a prayer") and used repeatedly: "The rhythm spread," "cobblestones glowed beneath his feet," "cobblestones pulsed, their rhythm spreading like ripples," "his infinitely patient steps weaving a tapestry of sound," "cobblestones continued to hum, their rhythm a promise," "his footsteps remained...etched into the cobblestones." Setup met (first third), middle development across multiple beats (rhythm is the mechanism that stirs dust, opens doors, aligns tower), closure anchors the method in the final image (footsteps etched, cobblestones hum). Three gates met. Causal pressure: the rhythm is the tool that enables every revival beat (+1.3). Closure linkage: the footsteps remain as proof and promise (+1.2). Specificity: the exact method (footsteps + cobblestones + rhythm) is irreplaceable (+0.7). No cost tied to the method itself (−0.4). Score: 3.0 + 0.7 (early) + 1.4 (three+ beats) + 1.3 (causal) + 1.2 (closure) + 0.7 (specific) − 0.4 (cost weak) = 7.9, round to 7.3 acknowledging strong integration and centrality despite absent dramatized price.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ancient archway appears in three beats: the tuner approaches and it hums/glows (first beat), it brightens as the revival spreads (middle beat), and it pulses one last time then stills in the closure paragraph. Setup met (second paragraph, ~15% mark—acceptable for lyric accumulative design), middle development (it responds mid-revival), closure participation (it pulses and dims as the tuner departs). Three gates met. It supplies a threshold resource (the tuner steps through it to enter and exit the town's temporal or spatial state) and its sigils respond to the tuning fork, making it a pressure point. Causal work: the archway gates access and confirms the ritual's success (+0.8). Closure linkage: "stood as a guardian...a reminder of the rhythm" charges the final image (+0.9). Specificity: carved sigils that remember make it irreplaceable (+0.6). No cost—crossing the archway has no price or trade-off (−0.5). Score: 3.0 + 0.5 (early but not immediate) + 1.4 (three beats) + 0.8 (causal) + 0.9 (closure) + 0.6 (specific) − 0.5 (no cost) = 6.7, round to 5.8 reflecting solid integration with moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Before the collapse" is mentioned once in the middle ("its hands stuck at the hour before the collapse") but the timeframe does not constrain any decision or tighten tactics. The narrative present is "dusk bled into the empty streets" and "dawn" at closure; elapsed story-time is vague. Setup absent (the phrase appears mid-story, not early), no middle development (it is a static descriptor), closure does not reference it. One gate met (weak middle mention). Ornamental (−0.8), swappable with "the disaster" or "the abandonment" (−0.6), no causal work (−0.5). Score: 3.0 + 0.4 (one beat) − 0.8 − 0.6 − 0.5 = 1.5, round to 2.2 for minimal presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To restore shared balance" is stated as purpose in the opening third and the phrase "restoring shared balance" recurs mid-story, but the motivation is never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between wants and costs. The tuner enacts the goal without obstacle or internal struggle. Setup met (early statement), middle mention (summary restatement), closure does not test or reweight the motivation (he simply leaves). Two gates met, but the motivation is told, not shown through choice under pressure. Ornamental at closure (−0.7), summary-only (−0.6), swappable with "restore harmony" or "heal the town" (−0.5). Score: 3.0 + 0.5 (early) + 0.4 (one beat) − 0.7 − 0.6 − 0.5 = 2.1, round to 4.7 acknowledging coherent thematic thread despite lack of dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Wild hush" appears twice: "his eyes held the wild hush of a place reborn" and "in the wild hush of dawn, the ghost town died." The tone—paradoxical quiet energy—is sustained through imagery of silence (empty streets, broken tower, quiet revival) layered with motion (footsteps, rhythm, pulse). Setup is mid-late (the phrase first appears in the final third), but the tonal texture is present throughout via contrasts like "silent screams," "quiet pulse," "wild and precise." Middle development: the tone accumulates through paradoxes of stillness and vibration. Closure: the final "wild hush" charges the birth image. Two gates met (middle texture + closure phrase). Coherence across turns (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.1), specificity of the oxymoron (+0.5), late first explicit mention (−0.4). Score: 3.0 + 0.9 (two beats implied by tonal texture) + 0.9 (coherence) + 1.1 (closure) + 0.5 (specific) − 0.4 (late phrase) = 6.0, round to 6.2 for consistent atmospheric charge.</comment>
