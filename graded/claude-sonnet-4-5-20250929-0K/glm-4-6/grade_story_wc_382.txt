<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tutor's motivation to listen to buildings is clear, but her interiority remains generic—"her heart raced" is stock phrasing. The relationship with Elias serves mainly as a vehicle for exposition rather than a crucible forcing contradictory impulses. The final choice to share the secret lacks visible cost; Elias simply accepts and listens, creating a soft resolution without foreclosing options or testing commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (rooftop, tutor, Elias). The story follows a causal lens: lie → tea sessions → interrogation → revelation → shared listening. However, the transition from rooftop to study ("they were in her study now, though they'd been on the roof moments ago") is unmotivated and breaks spatial causality. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (shared understanding replaces lies) but the cost is asserted rather than shown—what does she forfeit by revealing the secret?</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and meteor shower anchor the opening effectively, and the seal is handled physically across beats. The unexplained teleportation from rooftop to study ("they were in her study now") violates spatial coherence at a key pressure point. The jasmine and meteors return at the end but function more as atmosphere than constraint on choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (keeping the secret vs. sharing it) is clear, but pressure plateaus rather than escalates—Elias asks, she deflects, he asks again, she tells. The revelation moment lacks genuine risk; Elias's response is immediate acceptance with no complication. The "agreed upon lies" dissolve without dramatized cost, and the building's voice conveniently demonstrates her claim rather than testing her decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of lies as doorways and forgotten languages emerges through concrete particulars (the seal, the building's whispers). However, the final paragraph offers explicit thematic statement: "some lies are just doorways, and some languages are never truly dead" functions as direct moralizing. The seal's metaphoric work (unlocking language) is purposeful but borders on symbolic convenience, introduced primarily to serve the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single POV is maintained with distinct narrative texture: "smooth as aged parchment," "patiently nimble." The dialogue carries subtext ("Tell me about the lies") and advances plot. However, diction occasionally drifts—"the raw truth of the building's voice" and "mysterious familiarity" feel elevated beyond the established register. The tutor's perceptual signature (focus on buildings, old objects) remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the prose has distinct texture. However, paraphrase loops appear: the opening establishes the seal among jasmine, then revisits it with "The seal...seemed warmer"; the lies motif cycles through "small, agreed upon lies," "The lies between them," and the final paragraph's explicit summary. The spatial teleportation is a clarity break. Template openings recur: "The tutor [verb]," "Elias [verb]," "The seal [verb]."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (buildings speak a forgotten language) offers a fresh angle, and the seal as translation device is specific. However, the core emotional arc—secret kept, pressure applied, secret shared, acceptance granted—follows a familiar template without transformation. The "borrowed sugar" excuse and weekly tea setup echo common meet-cute patterns. The meteor shower and rooftop garden function as atmospheric ornament rather than integral constraint.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dead language tutor appears throughout and makes the key choice to reveal the truth. Her specialist knowledge enables the climax (translating building language) and her patience is tested by Elias's interrogation. However, the choice lacks visible cost—Elias accepts immediately rather than complicating her situation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The antique desk seal is introduced in the opening, handled physically ("her fingers...traced the grooves"), becomes warmer under pressure, glows during the revelation, and appears in the final image ("picked up the seal, its griffin's eyes glinting"). Its function as a key to building language is specific and shapes the climax. The cooling at the end marks narrative closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Agreed upon lies frame the opening (borrowing sugar) and return as explicit theme in dialogue ("Tell me about the lies") and the final paragraph. However, the lies don't constrain tactics—the tutor deflects once, then reveals all. The concept functions more as thematic overlay than structural driver of choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" appears once in the opening describing her fingers tracing the seal. It characterizes her approach but doesn't constrain or enable a key action with visible cost. The trait remains label-level without dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interrogation appears twice: Elias interrogates her about grammar (past pattern), then directly about the seal and lies in the present scene. The second interrogation triggers the revelation. However, "interrogate" could be replaced with "question" or "press" without altering story logic—the specific method doesn't uniquely shape the turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Borrowing sugar is the initial lie that becomes weekly tea sessions, mentioned in the opening and recalled at the end ("bring the sugar"). It establishes their relationship pattern but doesn't shape the present confrontation's tactics. The method sets context but remains background to the seal-and-secret conflict.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during meteor shower opens the story with vivid sensory detail (jasmine, silver streaks) and returns at the end ("the rooftop garden...seemed to lean in"). However, the setting doesn't constrain the key choice—the revelation happens after an unexplained move to the study. The meteors intensify atmosphere but don't alter tactics or outcomes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to learn building language is dramatized through her use of the seal, conflicts with her need for secrecy (she admits "I'm listening" only under pressure), and shapes the climax when she translates. The competing desire—to preserve the secret vs. share the discovery—creates friction. The resolution shows her acting on the core want with Elias as witness.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mysterious familiarity operates through the seal's uncanny warmth, the buildings' whispers, and the final line's "knowing stars." Tone modulates from quiet tension to revelation wonder. However, "mysterious familiarity" as a phrase appears explicitly in the text, suggesting label-first construction. The tone charges the final image but doesn't shift decisively through pressure points.</comment>
