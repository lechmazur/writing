<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The beautician mortician's motivation ("to capture one last spark") is clearly stated but not tested by competing desires or internal friction. Her practiced method unfolds without meaningful doubt or cost to herself—no skill failure, no personal price for the extraction, no visible tradeoff. The voyager is inert, so no relationship pressure exists. Interiority remains abstract ("profound quiet," "familiar weight") rather than embodied contradiction under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through description and ritual toward a closure image (the emerald placed in the box). However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the protagonist succeeds without setback. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes her enduring role—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized ("threshold of stillness had been crossed" tells rather than shows a forfeiture or altered state).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail (obsidian slab, "radiant hush," shimmering curtain). The emerald chip's physical properties (facets scattering light) charge the final moment when it glows. The setting does not constrain a choice (no resource scarcity, no spatial obstacle), but the aurora's flare in the penultimate beat and the grotto's sigh add atmospheric weight to the closure image, meeting the micro-setting allowance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled: extracting the memory before decay. Yet the protagonist encounters no meaningful obstacle—no failed attempt, no ambiguous signal, no cost to the retrieval itself. The sequence is linear: she waits, finds the pattern, infuses the chip, succeeds. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening moment or pattern break would suffice, but here the "coarse grain of decay" does not complicate her method or force a tactical shift. The cost ("voyager's face… settled into deeper repose") is passive and lacks felt consequence for the protagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory's preservation against oblivion—emerges through the emerald chips as a "constellation of saved moments." The story avoids overt moralizing and offers a non-literal answer (the paradox of "life born from stillness"). However, the thematic question is not truly tested; the protagonist's success is unproblematic, so the stakes remain illustrative rather than transformative. The final image (floating serene, waiting for the next spark) resonates but does not reweight prior material with new cost or irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person POV with stable psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present ("lucidly watchful," attention to electromagnetic sea) but diction occasionally drifts elevated ("threshold of stillness," "radiant hush") in ways that feel ornamental rather than character-specific. The prose modulates little under pressure—her interior tone remains calm throughout, even during the memory extraction. No dialogue. Vocabulary is controlled but leans toward lyric generality ("profound quiet," "familiar weight") over idiosyncratic specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are generally strong, but several passages loop conceptually: "threshold of stillness" recurs three times without evolving meaning; "radiant hush" and "profound quiet" restate atmosphere; "lucidly watchful" appears twice as a label. Sentence openings vary, yet the closing paragraph stacks synonym phrases ("serene as the aurora, a silent guardian… waiting for the next spark") that paraphrase the premise rather than advance it. Figurative language is dense ("skyborne grotto," "emerald chip… a prison for the ephemeral") but remains legible. Minor template cadence in the final third: "She felt… She was… She floated…"</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The beautician mortician and memory-extraction premise offer a fresh synthesis. Execution is competent but safe: the protagonist's flawless success and the serene, static tone avoid narrative risk. The voyager's laugh under a binary sunset is a vivid detail, yet the story does not explore friction (conflicting memories, ambiguous echoes, cost to the beautician). The ending reaffirms the premise rather than transforming it. Proximity to genre conventions (psychopomp caretaker, memory as object) is handled cleanly but without bold complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The beautician mortician is present throughout and performs the key action (memory extraction). Her choice to "wait" and "latch onto" the signal drives the middle beat. However, her decisions do not create turns—she executes a practiced method without obstacle or adaptation. The ending shows her waiting for the next client, a continuation rather than a choice that alters stakes. Setup present; middle involvement functional; closure participation passive (she places the chip in the box, a completion rather than a redefinition). Causal pressure is limited. Swappable with another skilled practitioner.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald chip is introduced early ("From her silk-lined pouch"), used in the extraction beat (placed on chest, flares with light), and returns in the ending (placed in the velvet box among others). Three distinct beats. Its properties (facets, internal glow) are specific and visualized. It enables the core action and charges the final image as part of the "constellation of saved moments." Removing it would break the story's material logic. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. The chip does not constrain a choice (she succeeds without friction), preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"A threshold of stillness" appears in the opening ("grotto's threshold of stillness deepened") and closing ("threshold of stillness had been crossed"). It frames the ritual's atmosphere and the protagonist's passage from waiting to completion. However, it does not shape tactics or constrain a choice—it remains a thematic marker. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is absent. The concept reweights the ending image slightly (the act of crossing reinforces her role), but its function is more tonal than causal. Lyric reprise that does not narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" is mentioned twice: opening paragraph ("She was lucidly watchful") and closing paragraph ("She was lucidly watchful, always"). Both are label-only descriptions; neither instance shows the trait enabling or constraining an action. No cost or tradeoff tied to this quality. The extraction sequence relies on patience and focus, not heightened watchfulness. Setup present; no middle or closure participation. Ornamental and swappable with "attentive" or "focused."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Infuse" is the central action: signaled early ("Her task was to infuse it with the echo"), dramatized in the middle beat ("she began to infuse the emerald chip, drawing that feeling… into the stone"), and completes the arc (the chip "held warmth"). The entire ritual sequence depends on this verb. Removing it would require structural rewrite. Three beats; causal and closure participation. However, the action succeeds without friction or adaptation, and no cost is tied to the act of infusing itself (the voyager's deeper repose is passive). Strong integration but lacks the tradeoff or visible price for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Finding patterns in static" is introduced as her "method" and "skill honed over decades." The middle extraction beat dramatizes it: "she sifted through the noise… A pattern began to emerge—a faint, repeating signal… she latched onto it." Setup and development are present. The method shapes her attempt and distinguishes her expertise. Closure participation is weaker—the final image does not return to pattern-finding. The method does not face failure or require adaptation; one application without friction. Functional and specific but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora are established in the opening sentence and recalled in the ending ("the grotto waited," "aurora momentarily flaring"). Vivid description throughout. The setting provides atmosphere and the material anchor (obsidian workbench) but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The aurora's flare in the penultimate beat adds recognition but is passive. Setup and payoff present; no middle choice shaped by environment. Lyric reprise that charges the ending image without tactical pressure. Postcard beauty elevated slightly by the final flare.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"To capture one last spark before oblivion" is stated explicitly in paragraph one and drives the extraction sequence. The protagonist's focus on finding the voyager's joyous moment dramatizes the motive. Closure links back: the emerald "held warmth… ghost of that long-ago laughter," fulfilling the goal. However, no friction or cost is attached to the pursuit—she succeeds without sacrifice or competing desire. Setup, development, and payoff are all present. The motivation is clear and pursued but not tested by internal conflict or external obstacle. Functional but not deeply conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" is introduced early ("air thrummed with a radiant hush") and returns in the closing paragraph ("held onto the radiant hush that filled her world"). The tone remains serene and elevated throughout, modulating minimally under the extraction's pressure. The phrase charges the final image, reinforcing the protagonist's enduring stillness. However, the tone does not shift with escalation—her calm is static. Setup and payoff; limited middle modulation. Coherent but lacks the tonal turn that would demonstrate mastery. Lyric consistency without dynamic range.</comment>
