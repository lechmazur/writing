<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tinkerer's interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophizing ("uncertainly certain," "befriend uncertainty") rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The protagonist's key choice—to follow the compass after placing broken parts in the pool—arrives without prior dramatized struggle between competing impulses; the laugh and the decision feel declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Emotional progression flattens into a single epiphanic mood rather than contradictory states layering across beats. The final renunciation lacks visible cost; we're told he's ready but don't see what path he forecloses or what he sacrifices by leaving the parts behind.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph, satisfying the test. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the tinkerer's stance shift toward accepting chaos, crystallized when he places the broken parts in the pool and follows the compass), but the cost remains abstract—he decides not to fix clocks anymore without showing what livelihood, identity, or concrete option he forecloses. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (building density through recurring images: compass, waterfall, broken clocks) but the final image doesn't decisively reweight prior material; the compass "glows faintly, its needle steady now" after spinning wildly, yet this shift isn't causally linked to his choice or to any persistent constraint he navigated. The phrase "that was the only way to truly mend time" summarizes theme rather than landing cost through image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall and greenhouse are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (glowing moss, mist, rusted tools, swirling leaves), and the compass rose recurs across beats, but the environment's constraint effect is minimal—the tinkerer's descent and discovery feel guided by atmospheric curiosity rather than spatial or material pressure that narrows his options. The compass "tugs him forward" without clear stakes tied to the physical space; the pool and pedestal are postcard staging rather than resources or obstacles that alter his tactics. The final image of the compass pointing "toward the horizon" is generic rather than grounded in the cavern's particulars, missing the chance to charge closure with setting-specific weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to embrace uncertainty or continue seeking order—is signaled early but remains abstract across beats. The descent through the trapdoor and discovery of the whole clock offer one meaningful tightening (the tinkerer sees a completed version of his project), but the resolution hinges on passive realization rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. He "doesn't need to fix them anymore" and decides to follow the compass, yet no on-page consequence shows what he risks or loses—his workshop, his livelihood, his identity as a tinkerer—by abandoning his craft. The waterfall and clock are props that deliver insight rather than forces that escalate pressure or demand a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through recurring motifs (compass, broken clocks, waterfall) and is woven into action, but the final paragraph's direct thematic summary ("maybe, that was the only way to truly mend time") replaces scene pressure with a stated moral, triggering a −0.6 penalty. The compass rose as a recurring object shifts meaning—from "honest" refusal to choose north to a steady guide at the end—but this transformation isn't causally earned by the protagonist's choices; it happens coincidentally when he reaches the pedestal. The story gestures toward complexity (order versus chaos) but resolves into a tidy epiphany rather than a resonant, non-literal answer grounded in specific cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice carries a distinct, lyrical texture with purposeful compression ("the latter half of the climb steeper than the first," "a sound like the universe exhaling"), and the POV remains stable in third-person limited focalized through the tinkerer. However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction not clearly rooted in the character's lexicon ("befriend uncertainty in planning," "the moments when reality shifted"), and internal thought at peak beats leans toward thematic exposition rather than embodied perception under stress. Free indirect style is generally clean, though the phrase "uncertainly certain" recurs as a label without dramatized contradiction in his micro-choices. No dialogue is present, so dialogue bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is vivid, but several prose artifacts dull momentum. The phrase "uncertainly certain" appears twice as a conceptual tag without embodied demonstration, and the final third stacks filter verbs and passive constructions ("was alive," "was meant to," "was full of") that flatten immediacy during what should be a high-pressure beat. Paraphrase loops appear: "He would never fix all the broken clocks, but he would learn to live with their brokenness" restates the prior decision without added pressure. The closing line's abstraction ("that was the only way to truly mend time") summarizes rather than charges through image. These patterns trigger cumulative deductions in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—a tinkerer who repairs broken clocks but cannot fix his own life, guided by a compass that refuses north—gestures toward originality but resolves into a familiar template: descent into a mystical space yields epiphany about embracing chaos. The compass rose and subterranean waterfall are atmospheric but feel like symbolic conveniences rather than irreplaceable elements that shape the turn; swapping them for other mystical objects would leave the emotional arc intact. The final realization ("the answer was in the chaos itself") lands as a platitude rather than a fresh synthesis grounded in specific, lived detail. No bold structural risk is taken; the linear descent-and-discovery arc follows a well-worn path without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The broken-clock tinkerer is present throughout and his identity frames the premise, but his key decisions (to follow the light, to descend the staircase, to place the broken parts in the pool) feel passive or reactive rather than choices that create meaningful turns. His observation dominates; the final stance shift ("ready to befriend uncertainty") is declared rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, payoff) but lacks causal pressure that narrows options under stress.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The admiral's lost compass rose appears in the opening (setup gate), guides the tinkerer's descent by "tugging him forward" (middle gate), and at closure its needle "locks onto a new direction" and "glows faintly, its needle steady now" (payoff gate). It is handled across multiple beats and its meaning shifts from "honest" refusal to a steady guide, but the shift happens coincidentally when he reaches the pedestal rather than through his agency. The compass enables movement but doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost; it's a magical guide rather than a tool whose properties create friction or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core concept "beneath the ashes" appears literally (the trapdoor hidden beneath ashes of a dead fire pit) at the midpoint and leads to the subterranean chamber, shaping one beat by prompting the descent. However, the concept remains spatial rather than altering stakes or tactics under pressure; the ashes are a discovery cue, not a constraint or cost. Present in middle and payoff gates, but its thematic resonance (hidden truth, warmth under decay) is gestural rather than woven into the protagonist's choice at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The attribute "uncertainly certain" is labeled twice in narration ("uncertainly certain it would work," "uncertainly certain of his next move") but never demonstrated through an on-page action where the trait creates a visible trade-off or cost. It functions as thematic decoration rather than a constraint that shapes his tactics or a friction that complicates his decisions. Present in setup and payoff but ornamental; easily swappable with "ambivalent" or "hesitant" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The action "improvise" is signaled when the tinkerer decides to use the compass's erratic dance to guide his descent ("He decided to improvise, using the compass rose around his neck to guide him"), but this beat is brief and does not drive major turns. The improvisation doesn't create a visible cost or narrow options; it's a method he chooses without on-page friction or consequence. Present in middle gate, but the descent and discovery would proceed similarly if he had brought a flashlight or rope. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The method "through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse" appears once when the tinkerer follows the glow into the greenhouse, leading to the trapdoor. The greenhouse is a transitional setting rather than a means whose mechanics matter; the swirling leaves are atmospheric rather than a constraint or resource that shapes attempts. Present in setup (the greenhouse is attached to the cavern and mentioned early) and middle (he steps through it), but absent from the closure. Functional transit but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall is vividly rendered with sensory detail (roar, mist, glowing moss, crystal-clear pool) and is present throughout the second half. It houses the pedestal and whole clock (middle gate) and at closure the compass points "to the heart of the waterfall," charging the final image (payoff gate). However, the waterfall doesn't constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—it's a mystical discovery space rather than a pressure that forces a trade-off. Present in setup (mentioned as echoing in the workshop), middle, and payoff, but functions more as atmosphere than as micro-setting that shapes action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "when coincidence becomes pattern" is the project's design goal (the clock "designed to stop when coincidence became pattern") but this threshold never arrives on the page or tightens decisions. The whole clock's hands point to "a time that didn't exist," gesturing at the concept, but no on-page moment shows coincidence crystallizing into pattern or a temporal pressure forcing the tinkerer's stance. Present in setup and thematically echoed at payoff, but lacks middle development as a live constraint. Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to befriend uncertainty in planning" is stated in narration ("He believed progress lay in embracing the unknown, in learning to befriend uncertainty in planning") and recurs at closure ("He was ready to befriend uncertainty"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs. The tinkerer's actions (following the light, descending, placing parts) don't show him struggling with uncertainty; he moves smoothly toward acceptance. Present in setup and payoff, but the motivation doesn't create visible on-page trade-offs or constrain a beat.</comment>
