<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mender's interior life shows concrete embodiment (quartz eye whirring, fingers stained with dirt) and her persistence is anchored in specific loss. However, the daughter remains entirely off-page and abstract, reduced to "stubborn grin" and a departed ribbon—no contradictory impulses act in scene, only reflective longing. The final choice to plant symbols feels more ritual than a decision that forecloses options with visible cost. Interiority occasionally drifts into label-speak ("hope," "resilience—false, but functional") without full dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the mender layers relics (ribbon, seed, key, candle) into soil, building density toward a final image of the orchard as bridge. Orientation anchors quickly (cathedral rafters, post-breach timeframe). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the planted seed and imagined daughter's return crystallize options, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than sharply legible—no specific path is foreclosed on the page, only a quiet assertion of persistence. One meaningful deepening occurs (planting becomes bridge-building), sufficient for this length, but the final beat lacks a decisive on-page price that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters setting is vivid and specific, filtering through the mender's trade and loss (stained glass, rope ladder, roots clinging to arches). The ribbon pressed into soil and the seed planted between trees are tactile, micro-setting moves that constrain her ritual. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting charges the final image (orchard as bridge), meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but does not alter a mid-scene choice under pressure—it functions more as symbolic stage than active constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: mend the breach with her daughter. The mender's planting ritual provides one meaningful deepening (symbols become bridge-promise), and her persistence is clear. However, no live reversal or tightening forecloses an option—she faces no opposition, and the seed's acceptance ("trembled, a pulse of life") arrives without cost or tradeoff. Agency reads as endurance rather than a choice that narrows paths. The breach and daughter's departure are recounted, not dramatized, so escalation remains reflective rather than pressurized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—deciduous vows that shed and regrow—emerges organically from the orchard imagery and the mender's ritual without overt statement. The final image (ribbon fluttering, seed waiting, imagined laughter) offers a resonant answer to whether trust can regrow, avoiding a stated moral. Subtext operates in the gap between planted symbols and uncertain return. However, the thematic weight leans on the concept label itself ("deciduous vows") rather than building entirely from scene particulars, and the wisdom feels more asserted ("accidental wisdom") than earned through a specific on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (quartz eye processing weight, orchard leaning in, whispers of prayers). Diction is purposeful and filtered through the mender's trade idiom. However, elevated register occasionally clashes with immediacy ("testament to her own resilience—false, but functional" reads meta-commentary; "fractured trust" and "bridge generational wisdom" edge toward prompt-echo phrasing). No dialogue is present. The voice modulates with the ritual's progression but does not degrade under stress, keeping psychic distance consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally and information density is solid (ribbon, seed, key, candle each carry dual freight as relic and symbol). Clarity is high, with no spatial confusion. However, template cadence appears in repetitive sentence stems ("The mender [verb]" × 5 times; "She had always [verb]" × 2) and synonym loops recur around "breach" and "promise." Figurative language clusters heavily ("leafy sea," "dappled rivers," "whispers brushing cheeks") without clear pattern-teaching, pushing toward overwriting in the opening third. The closure beat is clean, so non-closure artifacts trigger −0.6 total within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The orchard-in-cathedral premise offers a fresh visual synthesis, and the quartz-eye mender is character-specific. However, the emotional arc—estranged parent ritually planting hope for reunion—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn. The "deciduous vows" concept is stated rather than discovered through action, and the breach remains abstract (no details of the contract or its severing). The planting ritual, while vivid, could be replaced with other symbolic gestures (lighting candles, carving names) without fundamentally altering the stakes or closure, signaling moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The quartz-eye mender is present throughout and her observation (examining ribbon, pressing objects into soil) drives the ritual. However, her choices are iterative rather than pivotal—no single decision creates a turn or alters tactics. She is named early, involved across multiple beats, and present at closure, but her agency reads as persistence without a distinct cost-bearing choice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The daughter's hair ribbon is introduced early (first paragraph), handled in two distinct beats (examined on ascent, pressed into soil), and returns in the final image (fluttering in breeze). Its frayed edges and faded color carry emotional freight. However, it does not constrain a choice or change tactics—it is planted as symbol, not used as tool. Lyric reprise reweights it (promise to return), landing it in the mid-6s for resonance without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Deciduous vows are named explicitly ("She had always believed in deciduous vows") and echoed thematically (shedding/regrowing), but the concept does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics. It functions as a thematic label rather than a constraint the mender navigates. Present by setup, mentioned in reflection, and implicit at closure, but ornamental—removing it would not break the story's logic, only its metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" appears once as a label ("daughter's stubborn grin—endearingly feisty") without constraining or enabling an on-page action. The daughter is entirely off-page, so the trait cannot generate cost. Ornamental mention only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Persist" is signaled early ("she would persist"), drives the planting ritual across multiple beats (kneeling, pressing ribbon, urging seed, lingering until sunset), and anchors the final image (seed as testament to persistence). However, it does not create a turn or redefine options—it is the mender's sustained mode rather than a decisive action with a visible cost. Two-gate integration (setup, closure participation) lifts it to low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Forgotten bag contents (satchel with melted candle, rusted key, seed) are introduced early, used twice (retrieving seed, pressing key and candle into soil), and present at closure as planted relics. The method shapes the ritual's mechanics but does not alter a choice or tactic under pressure—she simply uses what she has. Functional across two beats with closure linkage, but replaceable with other relics without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lush orchard spanning cathedral rafters is introduced immediately, anchors spatial choreography (rope ladder, soil between trees, roots on arches), and charges the final image (orchard as bridge, roots entwined with promises). It pressures the mender's choice of ritual site and supplies the soil resource. Early signal, beat involvement across the scene, closure linkage, and specificity (stained glass, vaulted ceiling) make it essential. Removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the breach of contract" anchors the temporal frame in the opening and is recounted twice (breach tore family, severed in anger). However, it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—the mender's ritual unfolds without deadline pressure. Present in setup and referenced, but does not constrain tactics or escalate urgency. Functional but passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to bridge generational wisdom is stated explicitly ("she had to bridge generational wisdom, somehow") and enacted through the planting ritual (key from her mother, ribbon from daughter). It drives the mender's choices across two beats (pressing relics, imagining daughter's return). However, it is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between the desire and a competing want tests the motive. Setup, development, and closure participation present, but dramatization is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Accidental wisdom is named once ("a flicker of something accidental—wisdom, perhaps") and operates as a tonal signature: the mender's epiphanies arrive quietly (seed needing time, orchard keeping promises). Tone is coherent and modulates with the ritual's progression from tentative to assured. However, the "accidental" quality is asserted rather than demonstrated through surprise or misapprehension—her actions are deliberate throughout. Present but more label than lived effect.</comment>
