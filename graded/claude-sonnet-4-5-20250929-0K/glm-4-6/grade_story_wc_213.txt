<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's profession and philosophy are established, but interiority remains thin and label-driven ("credibly curious," "favoring listening over noise" stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses). The peak choice—switching systems—lacks visible internal conflict or cost; he simply executes procedure. Backstory about evolution of methods and sensor calibration fills space without forcing present micro-choices that alter tactics. Embodied emotion and contradictory impulses under pressure are absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors arrive promptly. The sequence—sensor check → glue drying → test activation → bell pull → data logging—traces a logical arc, but no meaningful reversal tightens options. The "switch" from electronic to bell is procedural, not a forced choice with visible cost. Closure reads as satisfied completion rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the final paragraph offers thematic summary ("favoring listening over noise") instead of an on-page cost that forecloses a path. The storm's arrival is prospective, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary, thin air, and cloud-sea below establish vivid altitude atmosphere. Sensory detail (wind shifts, aurora, "solstice hush") is selective and voice-consistent. However, the setting functions largely as backdrop; the anemometer, bell rope, and control panel are described but do not materially constrain Elian's choices. The "microclimate variation" he notices does not alter his test sequence. The final image invokes the sanctuary but does not charge it with new pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ensuring warning systems function for the communities below—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page failure or human consequence dramatizes urgency. The test sequence unfolds without opposition or complication. Elian's "switch" to the bell is presented as planned redundancy, not a forced trade-off. The approaching storm is noted but does not arrive to test his work on the page. No visible price is paid; the closure declares preparedness without demonstrating cost or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The theme "favoring listening over noise" is stated multiple times rather than emerging from concrete action. The cathedral bell versus electronic siren offers a promising contrast, but the piece tells us ancient methods endure rather than showing a moment where the old method saves what the new cannot. The final paragraph moralizes ("he had done everything possible") instead of offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. Epiphany is asserted, not earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains mostly consistent within Elian's technical idiom ("anemometer," "atmospheric layers," "microclimate variations"). However, phrases like "windblown sanctuary" and "impossible structure built by those who had climbed too high" drift toward lyric elevation without clear POV motivation. Perceptual signature is present (notices air pressure shifts, wind direction) but does not degrade under stress or modulate with emotional intensity. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs: "Elian adjusted…," "Elian wiped…," "Elian approached…," "Elian activated…," "Elian made notes…," "Elian completed…," "Elian paused…" across the entire piece. Synonym churn around "sanctuary" and "systems." The phrase "favoring listening over noise" appears three times verbatim, functioning as scaffold. Stock metaphors ("coiled like a sleeping python," "sea of white below") lack fresh specificity. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate procedural completeness without advancing pressure. Final paragraph stacks filter verbs and summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The storm-siren tester role and high-altitude sanctuary offer mild freshness, but the emotional arc—dutiful technician completes test, feels satisfied—follows a template without transformation or risk. The bell-versus-electronic-siren contrast is a familiar old-versus-new trope, executed at surface level. The "solstice hush" and aurora are vivid but decorative. No bold structural or perspectival choice; no turn that reweights prior material. The piece could function unchanged with different names and a different mountaintop occupation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and performs the test sequence, but his choices are procedural rather than dramatized with internal friction. The "humble" modifier appears once in narration without behavioral grounding. He observes, calibrates, and logs; no decision alters tactics or stakes. His role shapes the premise but does not drive a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cathedral bell rope is introduced early ("coiled like a sleeping python"), touched again when Elian contemplates it, and pulled with "three measured tugs" during the test. It returns in the penultimate paragraph as "ready, a backup for the backup." However, its use is part of a planned sequence, not a forced choice. The rope's thematic resonance (ancient failsafe) is told rather than charged by a moment of need.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Zero hour" is mentioned twice: once as the moment "for testing would begin" after glue dries, once in the final paragraph as "zero hour from a moment of crisis into one of preparedness." It frames timing but does not narrow options or create visible cost. The concept is applied thematically rather than shaping on-page stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" appears once as a label ("His credibly curious nature had led him to discover…") in backstory summary. No on-page action demonstrates curiosity with a cost or constraint. The trait is told, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elian switches from the automated storm siren to the cathedral bell system during the test sequence. The action is signaled early ("Time to switch systems") and executed on the page. It drives the comparison between warning methods and supplies the piece's thematic contrast. However, the switch is procedural rather than a crisis choice; it does not redefine options or close a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Tracking microclimate variations" is mentioned three times: as an evolved method, as noted wind-shift observation, and in the final paragraph. The wind shift Elian notices "always preceded the massive electrical storms," but this knowledge does not alter his test sequence or force a tactical adjustment. The method is present but does not shape attempts or closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "windblown sanctuary above the clouds" is established early and sustained with sensory detail (thin air, wind against stone and glass, cloud-sea below). It supplies atmosphere and altitude-specific sound transmission challenges. The setting enables the premise but does not constrain Elian's choices during the test; his moves would function similarly in any remote high-altitude station. Micro-setting (control panel, eastern window, bell rope location) is present but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the glue dries" is noted twice: in the opening section as a precondition for testing, and again at closure ("The glue had fully dried"). It establishes a brief waiting period but does not tighten decisions or function as a live clock. The timeframe is mentioned rather than pressuring the sequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To favor listening over noise" is stated three times verbatim as Elian's philosophy and motivation. It is told as backstory ("a philosophy that had saved lives") and reasserted in the final paragraph. The bell-versus-siren test enacts the concept, but no on-page friction or cost dramatizes the desire. The motivation is present but label-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Solstice hush" is named twice: in the opening ("creating a solstice hush that made his ears strain") and in the penultimate paragraph ("In this moment of solstice hush"). The tone of quiet, thin-air stillness is sustained through the piece and modulates slightly with the aurora and bell resonance. It coheres with the contemplative mood but does not charge the final image with new pressure; the ending drifts into summary rather than crystallizing the hush with cost.</comment>
