<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to uncover silenced histories is established, and his final action arranging "REMEMBER" shows embodied commitment. However, the retrocognitive trap functions more as atmospheric label than embodied constraint driving micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction is minimal; his arc from cataloger to translator feels more asserted than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The diary's warmth and ink bleeding onto skin gesture toward embodiment but remain decorative rather than forcing a visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: beach-debris messages accumulate meaning, the lagoon reveals itself as memory-vault, and the final "REMEMBER" reweights the opening "PARLEY." Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing—the lagoon shifts from mystery to living ledger—with felt cost (diary's cipher broken, Elias bound as translator). Orientation anchors promptly (floating library, Elias, lagoon, dusk). However, the retrocognitive flooding and shape's appearance feel convenient rather than causally motivated by prior choices; the diary "clicks" without clear mechanical groundwork, weakening the because/therefore linkage even under an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, driftwood letters, floating library, and beach debris function as active setting elements that constrain Elias's method and charge the closure image. The rope ladder descent, kelp and manacle use, and debris circle around the zeppelin's shadow ground spatial choreography. Sensory detail is vivid ("bruised violet," "obsidian," "searing reverie") and filtered through archivist idiom. The lagoon's surface "crawling with names" at the retrocognitive peak directly pressures his final choice to arrange "REMEMBER," satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the lagoon's truth—is signaled early and pursued through arranging messages. The shape's reply "THEY BURY US" and Elias's "WHY?" constitute one meaningful tightening that narrows options. However, escalation depends heavily on the diary's convenient "click" and the shape's appearance rather than protagonist agency under pressure. The final "REMEMBER" message carries conceptual cost (Elias bound as translator, pull weakened but "never over"), but the price feels more thematic assertion than a visible trade-off that forecloses a live path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory as resistance, histories demanding witness—emerges through the beach-debris parley method and the lagoon-as-ledger concept. The final image "love, like sand, leaves patterns even in the dark" attempts resonance but tilts toward direct statement rather than non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the debris exchanges and the shape's whispered "Patience." The piece resists simplistic resolution (the parley "never over"), and the activist's vanishing/reappearance through debris avoids allegory. However, the closing paragraph's meta-commentary ("truths arrange themselves," "retrocognitively trapped, yet unbroken") states theme rather than letting the diary's wordless presence and debris circle hold it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; Elias's archivist voice colors perception ("vault door," "ledger of grief"). Diction is purposefully elevated ("obsidian eye winking shut," "searing reverie") and consistent with a solemn civil-rights archivist's idiom. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bounded ("retrocognitively trapped" as narrative label, "surprisingly tender" in the penultimate line). The shape's whispered "Patience" and debris reply carry subtext, but no second on-page speaking character tests voice distinction. Psychic distance remains controlled; no filter-verb stacks harm immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the opening/closing anchor effectively (floating library → library ascends). Information density is high in the lagoon descent and message exchanges. However, multiple paraphrase loops weaken propulsion: "the diary's encryption clicked… flooding his mind" immediately followed by "He knew then what he had to do"; "the truth was a tide" rephrased as "relentless, encrypted, and surprisingly tender"; the penultimate and final paragraphs restate closure implications rather than trusting the image. Template cadence appears in mid-story beats ("arranged… formed… whispered… replied"). Stock metaphor "bones to water" and "vault door" clichés dull specificity. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template runs (−0.5), and stock strings (−0.3) totals −1.0 within Q7 non-closure cap, but artifacts appear near closure ("The end? No—just another debris message") which disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The beach-debris-as-message parley, retrocognitive trap, and floating archive-zeppelin combination offers a fresh synthesis. The lagoon-as-memory-eater vault and activist's debris-encoded vanishing provide a non-obvious angle on silenced histories. However, the "archivist discovers hidden diary that traps them in the past" and "mysterious body of water holds dark secrets" are recognizable templates. Transformation occurs through the tactile debris method and the concept of histories arranging themselves, but the final meta-turn ("The end? No—just another debris message") undercuts earned resonance with self-aware cleverness. Specificity in the manacle, scalloped shell, and kelp letters grounds the vision, lifting it above pure abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elias's choice to descend, arrange messages, and file the diary creates key beats. His kneeling to trace "PARLEY," scavenging debris for "FREE," arranging "WHY?" and "REMEMBER" are on-page decisions that alter tactics. The final filing note and smile demonstrate earned stance. Present in setup (archivist cataloging silenced histories), middle (message exchanges), and closure (filing, watching lagoon shrink, remaining translator). However, many pivotal moments—retrocognitive flooding, shape surfacing, diary slipping—happen to him rather than arising from his agency under pressure. Causal role in two beats (descent decision, final "REMEMBER" arrangement) and closure participation earns mid-band, but swappability with a generic "researcher" without major rewrites limits irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears in setup (shimmering below, calling), middle (surface crawling with names, shape emerging), and closure (eye winking shut, pinpoint). It constrains Elias's method (messages placed at its shore) and charges the final image (debris circle, pull weakened). Handled across three distinct beats with evolving meaning: mystery → memory-eater → sealed ledger. The "obsidian eye" reprise and the lagoon's surface clearing at dawn reweight prior material. Removing it would break the story's spatial logic and the parley's target. Strong integration across all gates with causal pressure and closure linkage, though the descriptor "obsidian" does some heavy atmospheric lifting that could be replaced with another dark-water image with moderate rewriting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary appears in setup (found days ago, ciphered text), middle (clicks like a vault door, pages warm, ink bleeding), and closure (weightless, cipher broken, filed under "Recovered Voices"). It enables the retrocognitive trap and the activist's voice. The diary slipping from Elias's coat and revealing the lagoon as memory-eater is a key middle beat. Its "encryption" shapes stakes (uncovering the lagoon's secrets) and the final filing/note constitute closure participation. However, the encryption mechanism remains vague—what caused it to "click"?—and its discovery is backstory rather than on-page event. Swappable with "mysterious artifact" or "cursed journal" with minor edits. Two-gate presence (middle, closure) with some causal work but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is introduced in the opening paragraph, returns at the activist's final-hours vision, and mentioned again near closure ("retrocognitively trapped, yet unbroken"). However, it functions primarily as atmospheric label rather than constraint with visible cost. The visions flood Elias, but he does not struggle against the trap or make a choice shaped by its mechanics—he arranges messages during and after visions without the trap altering his tactics. No clear tradeoff or price tied specifically to being "trapped" versus simply "remembering" or "witnessing." The attribute is present across beats but remains ornamental, not causal. Late first full articulation (after the diary clicks) and label-only use in closure paragraph apply −0.6 and −0.3 respectively.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Parley" appears as the first driftwood message Elias finds, the diary's author's activist stance, the closing reflection ("the parley was never over"), and is titled in the note's final image. It frames the story's central question and Elias's method (arranging messages as dialogue with the lagoon/past). However, as an action it is diffuse—arranging debris constitutes the parley's method, but the parley itself is more thematic concept than discrete event. The opening "PARLEY" message sets expectation and the closing reprise reweights it, qualifying for lyric-resonance allowance. Removing "parley" and substituting "dialogue" or "negotiation" would require rewording but not restructure. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with thematic but not mechanical causal pressure. Lyric reprise earns ~6.0 eligibility, but swappability and mid-scene absence lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arranging beach debris as messages is introduced with the opening "PARLEY" in driftwood, taught by Elias scavenging shells/chains/sea-glass for "FREE," used again for "WHY?" in kelp, the shape's reply "THEY BURY US," and Elias's final "REMEMBER" using manacle/shell/diary shard. The method is signaled in setup, drives at least three middle beats (Elias's attempts and the shape's response), and charges closure (debris circle, the note "Some truths arrange themselves"). Mechanics matter: the method requires tactile scavenging, specific objects, and the lagoon's response depends on it. Removing this method would collapse the story's tactical spine. Strong integration across all gates with causal pressure, though the shape's ability to reply in debris feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The floating library on a zeppelin provides the opening frame (gondola, porthole, rope ladder descent) and closing bookend (library ascends, years later drifts over dunes). It establishes Elias's profession and the archive where he files the diary. However, it does not constrain choices or supply resources that affect the lagoon encounter—Elias could have arrived by any means. The zeppelin's "anchored shadow" forming a circle around the debris at dawn is a vivid closure image but passive. Setup and closure presence without middle development caps at ~4.6 per the gate model. The library functions as elegant setting but is swappable with "archive outpost" or "research station" without restructuring the core conflict.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the letters are found" timeframe is present: Elias found the diary "days ago," descends "now," arranges messages as "the water darkened" and "dawn broke," and "years later" new letters appear. However, the time progression is loose and does not tighten decisions—there is no clock or deadline pressure. The transition from dusk to dawn brackets the lagoon encounter but elapsed time within that window is vague. The "years later" coda shifts time but introduces no new tension. Setup (diary found days ago) and closure (years later) presence without middle development that alters tactics. Time is tracked but does not constrain or enable; "the next night" or "immediately" would not change the story's pressure. Functional but replaceable, trending mid-low per band guidance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to uncover the truth in tension" is dramatized through his descent despite the diary's cryptic warnings, his kneeling to trace "PARLEY," scavenging and arranging messages, and his final filing note. The motivation is conflicted: he is "called" by the lagoon yet the diary warns him, and he feels the pull weaken but knows "the parley was never over"—acceptance of ongoing cost. However, much of the motivation is told in the opening ("he'd spent years cataloging") rather than tested on the page through a choice where uncovering truth competes with another desire. The scavenging and arranging beats enact the desire; the final stance crystallizes it. Setup, middle beats, and closure presence with some friction (warnings vs. compulsion) earn mid-6 band, though the competing "wants and costs" could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Tone of "searing reverie" is established early ("bruised violet," "half-remembered lie," "bones to water") and sustained through "searing reverie of those lost," "the ink bleeding onto his skin like penance," "surprisingly tender, even when it buried you alive." The tone modulates from solemn opening to intense middle (retrocognitive surge, lightning crack) to reflective closing (smile, the library creaking onward). However, the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("The end? No—just another debris message") breaks the reverie's coherence with self-aware cleverness, and "surprisingly tender" feels like an authorial intrusion rather than Elias's perception. Tone charges several beats but does not hold cleanly through closure. Setup and middle presence with purposeful modulation, but the closure wobble and tonal inconsistency in the final lines prevent higher scoring.</comment>
