<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to discover what trees witness is clear and sustained, but the protagonist remains observational rather than conflicted. Internal contradiction is absent; Elian proceeds methodically through research without genuine struggle or competing impulses. The final "trembling hands" gesture attempts embodied emotion but arrives too late to establish a pattern of contradictory desire under pressure. No meaningful cost forecloses a path—Elian continues maintenance work unchanged, smiling at secret knowledge.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (maintenance worker, labyrinth corridors, sextant discovery) arrive early. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (knowledge that trees absorb human emotions), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift on the page. The storm-tower sequence attempts a climactic turn, yet the breakthrough ("trees take in human emotions as they did sunlight and rain") lands as explained insight rather than a choice that narrows options. One meaningful deepening is present (months of dream-mapping coalesce), but the final image (Elian resuming duties, smiling) does not reweight prior pressure with undeniable felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The labyrinth's intricate passages, skylights, and tower are vivid and purposeful. The sextant as recurring object constrains Elian's research method and charges the storm-tower climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (rain, lightning, moonlight breaking through clouds). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The piece satisfies the micro-setting allowance: the sextant and tower setting participate in the final image, though the trees themselves remain distant backdrop rather than proximate constraint on a pivotal choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering what trees witness) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through months of dream-mapping, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows live options with visible cost. The storm-tower sequence offers atmospheric intensity without forcing a trade-off; the sextant "pulses with ethereal light" and reveals the answer without Elian risking or sacrificing anything tangible. Coincidence (moonlight breaking through clouds, weighted release mechanism heard below) complicates timing but does not test commitment. The resolution is observational epiphany, not protagonist agency under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (invisible histories, trees as witnesses, maintenance of memory) emerges from recurring images and Elian's notebooks. The sextant transforming "unspoken grief into measurable columns of liquid light" offers a charged central metaphor. Subtext operates in Elian's secrecy and the labyrinth's unwitting visitors. However, the final paragraph edges toward summary ("the maintenance of places also required the maintenance of their invisible histories") rather than letting the image alone reweight meaning. The ending provides a non-literal answer to the central question but leans on articulation rather than pure dramatic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV with stable focalization through Elian. Perceptual signature is present (tool belt clinking, recognition of release mechanism, notebook documentation). Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent. No dialogue appears. A mild register drift occurs in phrases like "quantified sorrow" and "botanical witness," which edge toward abstract lexicon not fully grounded in a maintenance worker's idiom, though they serve the conceptual premise. Psychic distance modulates appropriately during the storm-tower sequence. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear and rhythmically varied. Information density is solid; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "quantified sorrow" recurs in similar constructions without fresh pressure, and "the sextant's purpose" / "the device healed" / "the astronomer's tool" rotate synonyms for the same object across adjacent beats. Figurative language ("mundane miracle," "moonlight broke through the clouds, bathing the scene in an otherworldly glow") accumulates in the climax without mixed metaphors but edges toward stock imagery. Template cadence is minimal. The opening and closing lines bookend effectively. Mild scaffold detected in the phrase "the miracle as mundane as clockwork" (abstract label without immediate embodiment).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The sextant-as-emotion-measurer premise offers a fresh synthesis of astronomer's tool and intangible grief. The "trees witness human experience" angle transforms a familiar trope through the sextant's quantification mechanic. However, the emotional resolution—Elian discovering trees absorb emotions as growth rings—feels more conceptual than inevitable in hindsight; the middle dream-mapping could be swapped for other mystical research without altering the core. The maintenance-worker frame adds specificity, yet the protagonist's arc (observer throughout) does not offer bold risk or unexpected synthesis. Within-band: solid execution of premise without transformative turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian (labyrinth maintenance worker) is present across all beats and frames the story. Setup: first paragraph. Development: months of dream-mapping research constrain method. Closure: present in final paragraph. However, Elian's choices do not create key turns—observation and documentation dominate; the climactic breakthrough is granted by moonlight and coincidental timing rather than a decision that alters tactics. The character enables the plot but does not drive reversals. Functional but largely passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sextant (astronomer's broken sextant) appears in multiple beats with evolving function. Setup: discovered in corridor K-17, early paragraph. Development: absorbs sorrow, heals in moonlight, used to deconstruct pillars of grief via dream-mapping. Closure: carried to tower, pulses with light, reveals tree-memory connection in final sequence. Causal pressure: enables the quantification method and the climactic revelation. Specificity: bronze frame, arms aligned, chambers holding liquid light. Strong integration; the exact object matters to plot and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow (core concept) is seeded early ("transforming unspoken grief into measurable columns of liquid light") and recurs as the sextant's function. Development: Elian deconstructs sorrow into constituent parts, mapping fragments. Closure: the concept reappears in the final observation ("quantified sorrow had been measured and understood"). However, it shapes method more than stakes or tactics under pressure—Elian's research proceeds without the concept constraining on-page choices or imposing visible cost. Present across beats but more thematic echo than pressure driver. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heals in moonlight (attribute) appears early: "The device healed in moonlight, its fractures visibly mending when bathed in the silver glow." Development: implicit in months of repair work. Closure: "the sextant hummed with this revelation, its broken pieces fully healed in the moonlight" during storm-tower sequence. The attribute enables the final breakthrough—without moonlight healing, the sextant cannot pulse and reveal the tree connection. However, the healing itself is not shown constraining a choice or imposing a visible tradeoff; it functions as enabling condition rather than active cost. Causal but not deeply pressured.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Deconstruct (action) is mentioned: "Elian realized they could deconstruct the pillars of quantified sorrow collected by the sextant." Development: the method involves mapping dreams to break down sorrow into fragments. Closure: the merged dream sequence in the tower represents the culmination of deconstruction work. However, the action itself is told rather than dramatized—no on-page scene shows Elian actively deconstructing in a way that narrows options or raises cost. Swappable with "analyze" or "interpret" without major structural loss. Present and functional but mid-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>By mapping scattered dreams (method) is signaled in paragraph three: "by mapping scattered dreams that materialized as misty apparitions throughout the labyrinth during quiet hours, Elian could break down the sorrow into its constituent parts." Development: Elian documents findings over months of midnight sessions. Closure: "scattered dreams they had been mapping for months suddenly merged into a coherent sequence" in the tower. The method constrains Elian's research schedule and provides the mechanism for the breakthrough. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown in dramatized beats—no single scene depicts Elian mapping a dream under pressure. Functional causal link but not pressure-driver.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stormlit tower by moonlight (setting) is introduced in paragraph four and anchors the climactic sequence. Setup: "the highest tower of the labyrinth" with "the oldest tree in the region" visible. Development: storm and lightning create atmospheric pressure; moonlight breaking through clouds provides the healing light. Closure: the tower setting enables the sextant's revelation and the visual connection (golden threads to the distant tree). The setting supplies resources (moonlight, vantage) that affect outcome. Spatial choreography is clear. Strong closure linkage, though the tower itself does not constrain a choice—it is chosen location rather than forced constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>At the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor (timeframe) appears once: "At the moment a pin was heard in a silent corridor below—a sound Elian recognized as the weighted release mechanism they had repaired weeks earlier—the sextant began to pulse with ethereal light." The phrase marks synchronicity but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock that alters tactics. The pin sound is coincidental timing rather than a deadline Elian must race. Mentioned in the climactic beat but ornamental to pressure. Swappable with other coincidental markers.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>To discover what trees witness (motivation) is stated early: "Elian's true motivation, the secret they never shared with the labyrinth's administrators, was to discover what trees witnessed after generations of standing sentinel over human sorrows and joys." Development: drives months of research, dream-mapping, and the storm-tower expedition. Closure: the answer arrives ("trees took in human emotions as they did sunlight and rain, converting our quantified sorrow into growth rings"). The motivation is sustained and shapes the plot arc. However, it is not dramatized as conflicted—no on-page friction between wants and costs, no moment where Elian risks administrator discovery or sacrifices another goal. Told desire without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Mundane miracles (tone) is introduced early: "a miracle as mundane as clockwork" and recurs in the final paragraph: "the ordinary miracle of this knowledge." The tone balances wonder (liquid light, ethereal glow, golden threads) with routine (tool belt clinking, maintenance duties resumed). Modulation is present: the storm-tower scene intensifies lyricism, then returns to workday calm. The tone charges the final image (Elian smiling at invisible histories). However, the phrase "mundane miracle" feels slightly forced as label rather than fully emergent from scene texture. Coherent and purposeful but edges toward thematic signpost.</comment>
