<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to heal/understand scars is clear and her arc from "eraser" to "reader" is traceable, but the epiphany arrives through plant telepathy rather than earned dramatized pressure. Internal contradiction is present (wanting closure vs. opening wounds), yet the plants function as convenient wisdom-dispensers rather than forcing micro-choices. The therapy-speak peaks in "tunnel vision, focusing only on the surface without plumbing the depths" and "awareness" as the final beat label, pulling interiority toward diagnostic abstraction. Samuel's scene offers relational pressure but remains brief; the apology feels asserted more than tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Maya, tower, dawn, post-procedure) land within the first 120 words. The lens reads Causal-hybrid: plant telepathy triggers realization, which drives the apology visit and the decision to change practice. However, the closure cost is stated rather than dramatized—"I should have helped you understand them" and the decision to "begin teaching" lack on-page friction or sacrifice. The frosted hourglass recurs but remains static; Samuel's touch at his faded scars provides a micro-turn, yet the cost of Maya's prior erasures is told in retrospect rather than felt in present stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tower at dawn, coffee rings, and frosted hourglass supply concrete anchors and the plants become a functional micro-setting that constrains Maya's perception. Sensory detail is selective (silver sand, rustling fern, meteor hush) and the final image reuses the hourglass with thematic charge. The apology visit to Samuel lacks spatial grounding—no description of his environment or the drive's landmarks—but the tower frame holds coherent pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Maya's recognition that erasing scars erases stories, signaled early. The tightening occurs when plant whispers force her to re-see Mrs. Chen's request and her own scars, then the Samuel visit provides a modest escalation. However, the turn is cognitive rather than forced by external resistance; Samuel's acceptance arrives without friction, and the decision to change her practice faces no on-page obstacle or visible sacrifice of income, reputation, or patient expectations. Pressure accumulates under a lyric-Causal hybrid but the cost remains conceptual and future-oriented.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—that scars are stories deserving to be read, not erased—emerges organically from coffee rings, the frozen hourglass, and Maya's realization about her displaced miracle. The final image (hourglass sand "like tiny scars, each holding a story too precious to discard") reweights prior material without overt moralizing. Minor slip: "closure comes not from erasing, but from reading" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary, and "awareness" as the climactic insight is slightly abstract, but the particulars (plants, coffee rings, temple scars) anchor the concept enough to avoid empty philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; Maya's perceptual signature (scars as constellations, coffee rings as road maps) is consistent and voice-motivated. The multilingual insertion ("crisis_line_748" शांत"्च्ड) breaks legibility mid-sentence without establishing a pattern or POV rationale, reading as artifact rather than character-specific code-switching. Dialogue with Samuel is brief and functional; the plants' "whispers" are reported rather than quoted, maintaining filter control. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("meteor hush," "displaced miracle") that fits the lyric frame but risks distancing the reader from embodied immediacy at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language (concentric coffee rings, silver sand, meteor hush) charges key images, but several beats loop: "The frosted hourglass…never quite shifting" reappears three times with minimal progression, and "closure" is both Maya's trait and the thematic keyword, creating synonym churn. Template cadence: "She had developed…she understood…she had been displacing…she realized" stacks similar stems. The penultimate paragraph summarizes the resolution ("Tomorrow, she would begin teaching…") rather than dramatizing a first teaching beat. No fatal opacity, but density dips in the final third as telling replaces showing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "doctor who erases scars learns they hold stories" premise is familiar from countless healing-reversal narratives; plant telepathy as the catalyst reads as quirk rather than organic transformation. The piece does not lean on cliché wholesale—coffee rings as metaphor and the frozen hourglass provide specific anchors—but the emotional arc (hubris → epiphany → apology) follows a predictable template. Samuel's easy acceptance and the frictionless pivot to a new practice model avoid the harder, riskier choice of showing a patient who refuses forgiveness or a colleague who challenges her about income loss.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Maya is identified as a "closure seeker" in the opening and her habit of "opening wounds" (literally via surgery, metaphorically via erasure) is stated. The plant-telepathy realization and the Samuel visit are her choices, meeting the middle-development and closure-participation gates. However, the choices alter her stance more than her tactics under resistance; Samuel does not push back, so the decision is not tested. The trait is present across beats but does not narrow options with visible cost—she simply decides to pivot, and the story ends on intention rather than enacted consequence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears in paragraph two, returns in paragraph five, and closes the story. Its "silver sand frozen in time" is described three times, but Maya never handles it or attempts the restart mentioned early; it remains a static symbol. The final image ("its sand shimmering like tiny scars") reweights it thematically, satisfying the lyric-reprise allowance, but the object does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic in any beat. Present in setup and payoff; absent in development.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Displaced miracle" is named explicitly and reinterpreted at closure: first as the scar-removal technique, then as the plant telepathy, finally as the scars themselves. The concept shapes the dominant stake (what counts as miraculous healing) and the final recognition reconfigures meaning. However, the displacement mechanic—one miracle replacing another—does not constrain on-page tactics; Maya does not lose the telepathy or face a cost for having used her technique. The concept is thematically active but not tactically binding.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Plant telepathy is introduced early, recurs across three beats (ficus, fern, orchid), and delivers the key insight that scars should not be erased. It enables the realization but imposes no visible cost or tradeoff; Maya does not struggle to shut out the voices or sacrifice anything to gain the ability. The trait is functional but could be replaced with a human mentor or a journal entry without structural loss. Present in setup, development, and payoff, but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Tunnel" appears twice: as a verb in Maya's realization ("tunnel vision…without plumbing the depths") and in the resolution ("how to tunnel into their own marks"). It is metaphorical rather than a physical action on the page. No dramatized tunneling beat occurs; the word could be replaced with "examine" or "explore" with minimal edit. The metaphor ties to the theme but does not drive a key turn or constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Coffee rings are introduced early as "maps to someone's pain," return when Maya begins to see "patterns…road maps of healing, circles of resilience, spirals of survival," and close the story as "invitations to understand." The method is signaled in setup, reweighted at the recognition beat, and charged in the final image, satisfying the lyric-reprise standard. However, Maya does not physically examine rings to make a choice; they function as recurring metaphor rather than active investigative tool. Present in all three gates but ornamental in mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The tower at dawn anchors the opening and closing frames, and "quiet" is reinforced by "meteor hush" and the isolation that allows Maya to hear plants. The setting provides atmosphere and the solitude enables introspection, but it does not constrain a choice—Maya could reach the same realization in a clinic or home. The drive to Samuel's house briefly shifts location but lacks spatial detail. Present in setup and payoff; minimal tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wears off" is stated in the second sentence and repeated once ("The anesthesia had worn off"), but no time pressure tightens decisions. The dawn setting implies a window, yet Maya's drive to Samuel and return that evening occur without clock awareness or urgency. The timeframe is mentioned but does not alter tactics or narrow options; it could be removed without affecting the arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Maya's desire "to learn to read the stories in scars" is stated early and directly drives the conflict: she has been erasing instead of reading. The realization beat hinges on this want, and the closure decision (to teach reading rather than erasing) fulfills it. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in friction—no on-page scene shows her failing to read a scar or choosing erasure over understanding under pressure. Present in setup, development, and payoff, but the want does not face a test that forces her to choose between competing goods.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears three times, reinforcing a quiet, contemplative tone consistent with dawn, solitude, and introspection. The tone supports the lyric-reflective lens and modulates minimally (the Samuel scene is gentler, the plant whispers add strangeness), but it does not shift under pressure or charge the final image with tonal contrast. Coherent and stable, but static; the hush does not break or deepen to signal cost.</comment>
