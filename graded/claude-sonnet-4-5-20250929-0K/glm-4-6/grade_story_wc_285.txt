<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The coachman's interiority remains abstract and labeled rather than embodied—"spindrift serenity," "distill complexity into essence"—without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The brother's deathbed charge and the figure's arrival are told rather than dramatized with micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final smile feels unearned; no visible cost forecloses a path, only relief that the vigil has ended. Motivation stays declarative; we're told he waits to fulfill a promise but never see him wrestle with doubt or impatience that would make the choice credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late (passengers mentioned but never grounded spatially; the inn's gutters appear without establishing the inn). The closure unit—handing over the needle and feeling weight lift—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is asserted ("weight of his vigil lift") rather than shown through forfeited option or changed stance. The figure's identity (brother's eyes in theirs) is mystical convenience that resolves without causal setup. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (fog, needle, promise layered), but the final beat doesn't reweight prior material through image; it summarizes emotional release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Fog, river, and rain gutters establish atmosphere and the gutters function as a timed constraint (waiting until they stop ticking). The boat midstream and the figure's arrival provide spatial choreography. However, the setting remains postcard-descriptive in key beats—"shades of gray," "canvas," "spindrift"—without constraining a micro-choice or altering tactics. The yarn needle anchors as micro-setting object but its presence is more symbolic than functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (fulfilling the palimpsest promise) is declared but never tested; the coachman waits passively until the figure arrives. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the fog lifts and the figure appears as scheduled convenience. The handover lacks visible cost—no forfeited path, no trade-off, only asserted lightness. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should build through density or pattern break; here it dissipates into relief without escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of layered memory and stitching torn fragments is signaled through "palimpsest promise" and the needle's metaphor. The final image attempts resonance ("rewritten in the quiet clarity of the morning") but the answer remains stated rather than shown through particular action. The phrase "distill complexity into essence" and "spindrift serenity" repeat as thematic labels without concrete embodiment. The ending offers conceptual repricing but the cost is abstract, not legible in a specific forfeiture or changed relationship.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person close on the coachman; distance control is consistent. Diction elevates into literary register ("palimpsest," "percolated," "spindrift") that fits the contemplative tone but risks abstraction over character-particular perception. Dialogue between coachman and figure feels sparse and functional; no subtext or evasion, just transactional exchange. The phrase "wind-broken reeds" and "weary wisdom" tilt toward stock poetic phrasing rather than fresh idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "The promise was simple and yet not" echoes "some truths could only be spoken aloud once…"; "The fog thickened, softening the edges…" restates atmosphere already established. Template stems recur: "He had understood then…" "He rose…" "He mounted…" Filter-verb reliance ("saw his brother's eyes," "felt the weight") dulls immediacy in key beats. Figurative density ("percolated," "spindrift," "palimpsest") clusters without clear causal linkage, and mixed metaphors ("secrets bubbling up like whispers") muddle sense. Closure beat summarizes emotional shift rather than landing on concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The vigil-at-river-crossing frame and mystical handover of a relic echo familiar Gothic/fabulist templates without transformation through specific world logic or fresh moral calculus. "Palimpsest promise" and "spindrift serenity" function as prompt-label ornaments rather than integrated narrative drivers. The brother-as-figure reveal and the needle's vague power ("stitch together what time has torn apart") remain abstract conveniences. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece hedges toward atmospheric median without committing to concrete stakes or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The coachman waits passively for most of the narrative; his sole decision is to hand over the needle when prompted. Setup is present (he sits on the riverbank in paragraph one), but middle development shows observation and memory, not choice. Closure participation is mechanical: he complies with the figure's request and feels relief. No key turn traces to his agency; the figure's arrival drives resolution. Late first-person action (mounting the coach) occurs after stakes are resolved.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Yarn needle appears in beat one (tucked in coat pocket), beat two (memory of brother pressing it into his hand), and closure (he holds it up and hands it over). Setup and closure gates are met; middle development is memory-only. The needle's "purpose served" and its absence afterward suggest reweighted meaning, but its function remains symbolic—no specific constraint or enabled tactic. Swappable with any small keepsake without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "palimpsest promise" is named and explained as a vow "layered with meaning no one else could decipher," but it never shapes on-page tactics or forces a choice. It functions as thematic label rather than stake; the coachman's waiting and the figure's arrival proceed identically whether the promise is palimpsest or simple. No cost tied to its layered nature. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Closely attentive" is mentioned once in paragraph one ("closely attentive… to the layers beneath") and demonstrated through ambient listening, but no on-page action turns on this trait. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic with visible cost. The figure arrives regardless of the coachman's attentiveness; the trait is label-only and swappable with "patient" or "vigilant."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Percolate" appears once ("The river's current percolated beneath the surface, its secrets bubbling up like whispers") as atmospheric description. No major turn traces to percolation; the metaphor is static and does not alter the coachman's actions or the figure's arrival. Easily replaceable with "murmured" or "whispered" without narrative impact. Ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Through ambient awareness" is named in paragraph one as a "skill honed over decades of listening." The coachman strains to catch the river's whispers, and the "percolating whispers coalesced into a single, clear message: it was time." Setup and middle signal are present, but the mechanics remain vague—how does ambient awareness function differently from ordinary listening? The method does not shape a failed attempt or force a trade-off. Functional but generic; swappable with "intuition."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fog-bound river crossing is established in the opening line and maintained throughout. The fog's lifting reveals the boat midstream (middle beat), and the crossing serves as the spatial anchor for the handover. The setting pressures the coachman by isolating him and supplying the temporal constraint (rain gutters ticking). Closure occurs at the water's edge. Setup, development, and closure gates are met; the setting drives two beats and frames the ending. However, it remains somewhat interchangeable with any liminal waiting-place.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "until rain gutters stop ticking" is introduced in paragraph one and functions as a stated endpoint for the vigil. The coachman notes the gutters have "stopped ticking" in dialogue at closure. Setup and closure gates are met, but middle development is absent—no on-page moment shows him tracking the sound or adjusting tactics as it changes. The clock is told rather than dramatized; it does not tighten a decision. Functional placeholder rather than live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to distill complexity into essence" is stated in paragraph one and echoed in the brother's deathbed instruction ("piece together the fragmented stories"). It remains abstract and uncontested; no on-page beat shows the coachman struggling between distillation and another want or wrestling with what essence means. The handover feels obligatory rather than chosen under friction. Told-only; no dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Spindrift serenity" is named twice (paragraph one "his spindrift serenity" and closure "lightness of spindrift serenity") but functions as label rather than modulated texture. The tone remains static—contemplative, patient—without tightening under pressure or charging the final image through rhythm or diction shift. The coachman's first smile in months arrives without earned tonal turn. Present but ornamental; does not evolve with stakes.</comment>
