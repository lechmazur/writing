<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is given a conceptual obsession (categorizing clouds by emotion, proving empty spaces remember) but his moment-to-moment choices remain observational rather than pressured. The father's death and the cable severance are told in flashback or summary, never forcing on-page contradiction or trade-off. The final whisper and journal entry assert resolution without dramatizing a cost that forecloses a path. Interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical declarations ("spooled wholeness," "quietly explosive") rather than embodied sensation or micro-choice under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story offers a Conceptual Repricing in the final image (clouds rearranging into a circle, "the sky remembers everything"), but the cost remains asserted rather than felt on the page. The cable snap occurs off-stage before the narrative opens, so the inciting event is backstory; the gondola's descent is passive drift with no on-page reversal driven by Elias's agency. Orientation anchors who and where early, but "after the string breaks" as timeframe remains vague—no countdown or escalating consequence tightens the drift. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (building density through recurrent motifs), yet the closure image arrives as a convenient visual symbol rather than a pattern break that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gondola as micro-setting provides a contained spatial frame and charges the final landing jolt. The brass telescope recurs across beats, anchoring tactile detail (cool weight, fogged lens) and family history. However, the sky itself remains a catalog of cloud types without constraining Elias's choices—he observes rather than navigates hazards or resource limits. The final circle of clouds is a convenient visual payoff rather than an environmental pressure that alters his tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is declared early but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. Elias's journal entry and whispered assertion ("You remember") occur without a reversal that narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The gondola's passive descent and safe landing deflate any threat of physical consequence. No live antagonist, time pressure, or resource scarcity escalates the drift into a forced choice with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of absence as presence and "spooled wholeness" recurs in multiple metaphors (cable-cut cumulus, void as weight), but the final paragraph moralizes directly: "loss was not an ending but a spooled wholeness, waiting to be unraveled." The closing circle of clouds offers a non-literal image, yet it arrives as a convenient visual gift rather than emerging from prior particulars under pressure. The piece gestures toward emotional complexity (grief for the father, obsession with the sky) without dramatizing the friction between those layers in a pivotal choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single-POV narration maintains a consistent lyric register, but diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("spooled wholeness," "quietly explosive tune," "tapestry of emotion") that read more as authorial commentary than Elias's lived perception under stress. Psychic distance remains stable, and no head-hopping occurs. However, the prose leans heavily on recursive sentence stems ("He whispered," "He lifted," "He closed") and stacked filter constructions ("He felt the quiet explosion of understanding") that dull immediacy in peak beats. The voice is distinct but not character-particular—could belong to any philosophically inclined sky-watcher.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Pervasive figurative overload in high-pressure beats: "the wind hummed a quietly explosive tune," "wound in the cerulean skin of memory," "clouds rearrange themselves into a perfect circle" pile metaphor upon metaphor without clarity gain. Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines—"he sought to memorialize the void" / "he set the telescope down… and began to categorize the clouds anew" / "He memorialized the break by naming the clouds"—recycle the same conceptual action without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate: "He + past verb" sentence stems appear nine times in the opening half. Figurative density (−0.6), paraphrase loops (−0.4), and template cadence (−0.5) combine for −1.5 total; artifacts touch the closure beat ("clouds rearrange themselves"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The aviation meteorologist + cable-snapped gondola + categorizing clouds by emotion premise offers specific occupational detail, but the emotional arc (grief for father, obsession with proving emptiness remembers) follows a familiar contemplative-observer template. The transformation test fails: swap Elias for any introspective sky-watcher and the plot holds. The closing circle of clouds is a tidy symbolic payoff rather than an earned, non-obvious synthesis. No bold structural risk or unconventional perspectival choice heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his occupation (aviation meteorologist) is named early, satisfying setup. However, his choices remain observational—adjusting the telescope, whispering to the void, scribbling in his journal—none of which create key turns or narrow options. The landing occurs passively ("the world rushed up to meet him") without his agency. Two gates (setup, middle presence) are met, but no closure participation or causal pressure; score trends mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The brass telescope appears in at least four beats (gripping it, setting it down, lifting again, final lens fogged) and is linked to the father's history, satisfying setup, development, and closure participation. It anchors tactile detail and charges the final moment ("still in hand, its lens fogged with the breath of the heavens"). However, the telescope enables observation but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure—Elias would categorize clouds with or without it. All three gates met; causal role is modest; score trends upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Spooled wholeness" is named twice (once mid-story, once in the final reflection) as a thematic label but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. Elias does not face a choice between wholeness and fragmentation, nor does the concept enable or foreclose an action. It reads as an abstract motif rather than a dramatized pressure. Setup and payoff present as echoes; no development beat; cap at 4.6 for missing middle gate, further reduced for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is used four times as an atmospheric descriptor (wind's tune, farewell, reminder, revelation) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It remains a tonal label without embodied consequence. Present in setup and closure as mood, but no middle beat where the trait alters a choice; missing development gate caps at 3.4, further reduced for label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Memorialize" is signaled early ("he sought to memorialize the void") and recurs in the middle ("He memorialized the break by naming the clouds"). The final journal entry and closing whisper extend the action into the ending. However, the act of naming clouds does not create a major turn—Elias's situation and options remain unchanged whether he memorializes or not. All three gates met; causal role is thematic accent rather than plot driver; score trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Categorizing clouds by emotion is introduced in the opening third ("charting cumulonimbus as rage, cirrus as longing") and applied in the middle ("began to categorize the clouds anew… by the feelings they evoked"). The method shapes his attempt to prove the thesis and is echoed in the final naming ("Cable-Cut Cumulus, Stratus of Severed Threads"). All three gates met; the method guides his observational strategy but does not narrow options or impose a visible cost. Lyric reprise reweights the stake modestly; score trends upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sky gondola is present throughout, anchoring spatial containment and creating the condition for Elias's drift. It swings, tilts, rotates, and finally lands, affecting his physical orientation and the closing jolt. The severance of the cable creates the inciting situation (though off-stage), and the descent structures the temporal arc. All three gates met; the gondola constrains movement and enables the final landing beat, though Elias's choices remain observational rather than tactical. Causal role is strong for setting; score trends solid mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the string breaks" frames the premise, but the timeframe remains vague—no clock, countdown, or escalating consequence tracks the descent. The gondola "drifted lower" and "neared the ground" without urgency shaping Elias's tactics. Setup present as premise; no middle pressure from time; closure (landing) arrives without time-driven cost. Missing middle gate caps at 3.4; slight lyric return lifts modestly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that empty spaces remember" is declared early and recurs in Elias's whispers, journal entry, and final assertion. It anchors his categorization project and charges the closing revelation. However, the desire is never dramatized in a conflicted choice—no on-page friction between the want and a competing cost or fear. Setup and payoff present; middle development weak; score trends mid-band for told motivation with lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Dusty starlight" appears twice (telescope lens capturing it, "speck of dust in the starlight") as an atmospheric note but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image decisively. The tone remains elegiac and abstract throughout, with no cadence shift at the closure beat to reweight prior material. Setup and closure mentions present; no middle modulation; score trends mid-low functional band.</comment>
