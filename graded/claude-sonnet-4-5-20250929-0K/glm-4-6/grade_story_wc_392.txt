<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are declared but rarely tested through embodied choice under pressure. The interiority relies heavily on abstract formulations ("watchful calm was a mask," "fortified vulnerability") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The father backstory surfaces as exposition rather than friction that alters a present micro-choice. The final "smile, the first genuine one in years" reads as an unearned epiphany, not a renunciation or endurance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who/where/when are anchored early, but the closure lacks on-page cost. The protagonist walks deeper into the tunnel and then "stepped out...into the light of a new day"—a metaphorical declaration rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt consequence. The investigation premise (rusted panel, cut wires, inscription) sets up a mystery but resolves through narrated realization ("she understood") instead of dramatized action or forfeiture. Under a Causal lens the because/therefore chain breaks at closure; under Accumulative the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The subway maintenance tunnel provides concrete sensory anchors (curved walls, rusted panel, dampness) and the lantern's glow charges several beats. Spatial choreography is mostly clear. However, setting does not constrain a pivotal choice—Elara kneels, traces, freezes, stands, and walks without the environment forcing a tactical trade-off or enabling a specific outcome at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>A dominant stake (investigating the transit worker's death, breaking free from past control) is signaled early but never faces a concrete on-page test that narrows options or imposes cost. The inscription "They walk among us" triggers adrenaline but no consequent action or price. The protagonist's agency at closure is walking forward, metaphorically reclaiming her story—told rather than shown through forfeiture or renunciation. No reversal or tightening choice that foreclosed a live option with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of liberation and reclaiming story is overtly stated in the final paragraph ("The controlling influence was broken, and she was finally free") rather than earned through image or action. The lantern and Underground Railroad motif are invoked but not transformed—they remain symbolic conveniences. The ending offers a thematic summary, not a resonant non-literal answer that reweights prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and the perceptual signature is present (sensory detail filtered through Elara's investigator lens). However, diction drifts into elevated register under pressure ("fortified vulnerability," "reverberate through her entire being," "declaration of independence") that clashes with the procedural POV. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The final beats lose specificity, substituting metaphor for concrete perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Template cadence and paraphrase loops pervade the text: "The lantern's light flickered...The lantern's glow seemed to reverberate...The lantern's light wavered...The lantern's light steadied...The lantern's light reverberated one last time." Stock metaphors ("roots," "shackles," "armor," "stepping stones") appear in most sentences of high-pressure beats without transformation. Register drift into abstract diction ("entangled memories," "fortified vulnerability") weakens immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("declaration of independence," "silent promise"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—investigator confronting parent's suspicious death—follows a widely used template without fresh synthesis. The lantern functions as a portable symbol rather than a plot engine with unique properties. Emotional turns are declared ("she understood," "finally free") rather than earned through specific, non-obvious character choice. The ending's metaphorical light is a familiar closure image that does not transform prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's role as preventable death investigator is present throughout (she kneels, traces the panel, catalogs details) but her professional observations do not create a key turn—she narrates her realization about her father rather than making a choice that alters tactics or cost. Meets setup and development gates; absent from closure participation (no investigative decision shapes the ending). Swappable with "detective" or "inspector" with minor edits. Late in the story she shifts from investigating the victim to internal epiphany without investigative action driving the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lantern appears in nearly every paragraph, providing light and symbolic continuity. It is handled ("cool against her palm"), its light flickers and steadies across multiple beats, and it appears in the final sentence ("The lantern's light reverberated one last time"). However, its use is largely atmospheric—Elara does not make a tactical choice enabled or constrained by the lantern's properties. Meets all three gates (setup, development, payoff) but remains ornamental rather than causally indispensable. The Underground Railroad backstory is invoked but not integrated into the investigation stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" is named twice and surfaces as backstory exposition (father's oil smell, his expectations, his transit-worker accident). These memories inform Elara's motivation but do not constrain or enable a present choice—she does not have to navigate conflicting or unreliable recollections that alter her tactics in the tunnel. The concept is thematic rather than operational. Meets setup; absent from middle development (no choice forced by memory entanglement) and from closure (final image is metaphorical freedom, not memory resolution).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Watchful calm" is labeled three times ("Her watchful calm was a mask," "Elara's watchful calm returned"). It describes her bearing but does not constrain or enable a visible on-page action with cost—she kneels, traces, freezes, stands, and walks without the trait forcing a trade-off (e.g., missing a clue due to excessive caution, or preventing panic at a price). Label-only use without visible cost. Present in setup and payoff, absent from middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Reverberate" appears four times, mostly describing the lantern's light or emotional echoes ("the letters striking a chord that reverberated through her entire being"). The action is atmospheric rather than causal—no major turn traces to a reverberation that changes options or knowledge. The verb could be swapped for "pulse," "echo," or "glow" with negligible structural impact. Present across beats but ornamental; does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Empirical observation" is mentioned once ("her empirical observation honed to a razor's edge") as a label. Elara traces a panel and notes cut wires, but the method's mechanics do not shape her attempts or constrain her choices—she does not test a hypothesis, compare evidence, or face a trade-off between observation rigor and time pressure. The investigation resolves through narrated insight ("she understood") rather than empirical process. Present in setup, absent from middle and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The subway maintenance tunnel is present throughout, providing spatial grounding (curved walls, rusted panel, dampness) and the inscription reveal. Elara kneels, traces, and moves deeper. However, the setting does not supply a resource or constraint that alters the outcome—she could conduct the same internal journey in another location. The tunnel charges atmosphere but does not force a tactical choice or enable closure. Meets all three gates with purposeful sensory detail, but remains mid-band due to limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"After the drought ended" is mentioned in the opening paragraph as context (the rains "unearthed memories") but does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions or alters tactics. The drought's end is backstory, not a clock. The investigation and Elara's internal arc unfold without time pressure or temporal constraint on the page. Present in setup only; absent from development and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation to break free from her father's controlling influence is stated early and recurs throughout ("desperate need," "controlling influence was broken"). It drives Elara's presence in the tunnel and her determination to reclaim her story. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants and costs—she does not face a choice between freedom and another desire, or pay a visible price to achieve liberation. The ending declares freedom without showing forfeiture. Meets setup and thematic payoff; middle friction is narrated rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fortified vulnerability" is named once and the tone attempts to balance resolve and emotional exposure across the narrative. Tone modulates with pressure (adrenaline surge, the father's voice echoing, calm returning as "armor"). However, the final paragraph shifts to declarative triumph ("she was finally free") that abandons the vulnerability thread, reading as a single static mood at closure rather than a charged coexistence of strength and exposure. Coherent through middle turns but does not hold tension at the ending image.</comment>
