<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's spiritual curiosity is labeled rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak ("spiritually curious," "foggy lucidity") and abstract emotional states without specific embodiment. The protagonist's transformation from rational artist to mystical healer unfolds through declaration rather than dramatized micro-choices with visible cost. The past-life memory and vial function as convenient backstory props rather than constraints that force difficult trade-offs on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The Orientation Test is marginally satisfied—who/where/when anchor by ~120 words—but the drive lens remains ambiguous throughout, wavering between Accumulative (image layering) and vague mystical causality. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias realizes his purpose), but the cost is asserted rather than legible: no prior path is visibly foreclosed, no concrete price paid. The piece never teaches a coherent pattern; the camera obscura method appears functional but arbitrary, and the ending distributes healing to passersby without dramatized resistance or consequence that alters Elias's options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct with wisteria offers vivid opening detail, but spatial choreography blurs once the camera obscura projections begin—where Elias stands relative to pedestrians and how the projection physically works remain vague. The setting pressures no choice; the viaduct could be swapped for any atmospheric location without altering tactics. The camera obscura as micro-setting constrains one beat (breathing onto the lens), lifting the score modestly, but the body and tool usage lack the specificity needed to charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is declared late (paragraph 5) and never tested by on-page opposition or scarcity. No meaningful tightening occurs; Elias's breathing method succeeds instantly without friction, cost, or adaptation. The passersby's healing happens off-stage as convenient result rather than earned reversal driven by protagonist agency. The lens remains unclear, so escalation cannot be judged coherently, and no credible price forecloses a path at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The theme of unused love and mystical healing emerges through repeated labels ("pilgrim of sparks," "fragments of love") rather than image and action. The final paragraph explicitly states the thematic thesis ("some artists capture images, while others..."), replacing scene pressure with summary. The camera obscura and wisteria return at closure but without reweighting prior material through new cost or contradiction. The piece gestures at spiritual complexity but resolves into a tidy epiphany without ambiguity or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent in register and tense, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("delicate opposition," "foggy lucidity," "invisible currents") that clashes with immediate perception under pressure. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias; Elias notices in writerly metaphor rather than through the lens of a camera obscura artist. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "understood") stack in reflective beats without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the piece: "Three days had passed since the past life memory surfaced" is immediately re-explained; "spiritually curious" recurs as label without varied embodiment; stock metaphors ("light and shadow danced," "webs of light") appear in most beats without fresh vehicle. Figurative density in high-pressure moments (the healing sequence) mixes incompatible vehicles (sparks, webs, bridges, currents) without coherence. The final paragraph loops thematic summary across three adjacent sentences, flattening momentum. Penalty range: −1.2 for loops and density clutter touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—mystical healer uses camera obscura to release stored love—feels derivative of prompt assembly rather than organic synthesis. The transformation from rational artist to spiritual healer follows a template arc (skeptic receives past-life memory → acquires magical object → heals others) without fresh inflection. The camera obscura and Buddhist iconography exist as exotic flavor rather than irreplaceable logic. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece hedges toward safe, mood-driven exposition.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias appears throughout but his key "choice" to heal is asserted rather than dramatized as a decision under pressure. His actions (adjusting the camera, breathing on the lens) follow a pre-determined mystical script rather than forcing tactical adaptation or trade-offs. Setup present, weak middle development (no reversal), closure participation is passive (he lowers the camera and realizes his journey). Two gates barely met; no causal pressure or irreplaceability. Cap 4.6 for missing strong development; swappability and summary-only involvement lower to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear is mentioned in paragraph 2 (late setup) and dabbed on the lens in paragraph 6, but its unique properties are never tested—any mystical substance could replace it. No cost or constraint ties to the tear; it functions as convenient mystical fuel. Two beats (receiving it, applying it) but no closure reweighting. Cap 4.6 for late setup; swappability and ornamental use lower to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Pilgrim of sparks" appears as phrase and theme label in paragraphs 2, 4, and 8, but never shapes on-page tactics or alters options under pressure. It remains abstract metaphor rather than lived constraint. No closure participation beyond thematic echo. Ornamental use and label-only treatment apply; score 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is stated twice as label without embodied action or trade-off. The trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it functions as character résumé rather than dramatized attribute. Label-only, no causal pressure, no closure linkage. Score 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Heal" appears in the title of paragraph 6 and drives the final sequence, but the act unfolds without resistance, adaptation, or cost—passersby simply smile and forgive. Setup late (paragraph 6), weak middle development, closure participation via passive summary ("others..."). One beat with minimal cost. Swappability (any mystical action could replace it) and late signal lower to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The breathing method is mentioned in paragraph 3 ("came to him in a dream"), executed in paragraph 4 (breathing cycles), and applied at closure (paragraph 6, "breathed onto the lens"). Three beats, but mechanics remain vague—how breathing reveals love-sparks is never clarified, making it functionally arbitrary. Setup, development, and closure participation present but swappable and non-specific. Score 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct with wisteria opens the story and provides atmospheric anchoring, but exerts no spatial constraint or resource pressure on Elias's actions. He could perform the same healing in any evocative location. Setup strong, no middle development, weak closure participation (wisteria petals fall as decorative coda). One gate strongly met; postcard use without tactical pressure. Score 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Three days had passed since the past life memory surfaced" anchors the timeframe in paragraph 1, but the phrase does no causal work—the memory is recounted as settled backstory rather than live urgency. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics at any point. Setup only; no development or closure use. Cap 4.6 for missing two gates; vague ticking lowers to 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where unused love is stored" crystallizes explicitly in paragraph 5 (late signal) and drives the healing sequence, but no friction or competing desire tests it on the page. Elias succeeds instantly without cost or adaptation. Setup late, weak development, closure participation via thematic summary. Two gates barely met; told-only desire without on-page conflict. Score 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is named in paragraph 7 and retrospectively applied to Elias's state, but the prose does not modulate to enact the tone—diction remains consistently elevated and declarative rather than oscillating between clarity and blur. The tone is asserted as label rather than built through rhythm and image. Late setup, no middle development, weak thematic closure participation. Told-only; score 5.3.</comment>
