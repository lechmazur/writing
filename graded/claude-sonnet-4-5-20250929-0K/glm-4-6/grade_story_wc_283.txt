<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to spin a prophecy into raw possibility") but never tested by competing impulses or genuine costs. The button-cataloging method arrives as stated rather than discovered through struggle, and her "quietly inspired" stance remains label-only—no moment shows her suppressing excitement or choosing restraint over expression. The final turn ("fate was not a chain but a lattice of choices") reads as epiphany without prior misbelief dramatized on the page, and the "shared wisdom" mechanic bypasses her own friction entirely.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph (waiving orientation penalty), but causality remains thin: buttons unlock the prophecy through accumulation rather than motivated turns, and the hourglass defying gravity at the end introduces a rule change not cued earlier. The closure image ("sand began to rise") gestures toward transformation but the cost is conceptual only—no tactical path was foreclosed, no relationship altered, no visible price paid for this outcome. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through the sorting sequence, but the final beat does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the prophecy simply "unravels" as promised.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The amber warehouse and canyon echo jar are vividly described and anchored early, and the tactile handling of buttons (star-shaped, blacksmith's thumb imprint) adds lived-in texture. However, the space functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no door locks, no shelf collapse, no spatial limitation alters her approach. The hourglass ticking and "sand a relentless descent" offer urgency labels but never force a triage choice; she completes the cataloging without friction from the environment itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("unscramble the fate foretold for her village") is declared early but never tightened—no moment where a wrong button choice threatens the prophecy or where the echo fades if she delays. The cataloging proceeds without reversal or deepening; the final button placement triggers the resolution rather than testing her commitment. Agency is present (she sorts and places) but the cost is missing: no option foreclosed, no tactical trade-off, no visible consequence of her method versus an alternative she considered and rejected.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme ("fate as lattice of choices") emerges clearly but is stated in the penultimate paragraph rather than earned through image or irony. The buttons function as motif but do not constrain choice or shift meaning across beats—they accumulate without tension. The final line ("hope") and the prophecy-unscrambling arc resolve into a tidy moral without ambiguity or counter-reading, and the "shared wisdom" concept is asserted ("seeped into her") rather than dramatized through a specific button-driven micro-choice that reveals competing values.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly with no head-hopping, and the opening ("knelt… hands poised") anchors spatial stance. Diction is generally consistent, but the prose drifts into abstract registers ("tapestry of choices," "lattice of choices," "raw possibility") that feel authorial rather than character-filtered. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices buttons and echoes but her way of noticing (trade-schooled, village-local, prophetically attuned?) never shapes what she sees or how she interprets it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and opening/closing anchor the arc, but paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third: "The prophecy unraveled… not a fixed path but a tapestry" is restated as "fate was not a chain but a lattice" three paragraphs later (−0.2). Template cadence runs appear ("She found… Another…" and "The hourglass… The canyon echo… The prophecy…"), dulling momentum in the cataloging sequence (−0.4). Figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching ("amber warehouse," "canyon echo," "unearthed silence," "tapestry," "lattice") but remains mostly coherent; however, "spin a prophecy into raw possibility" mixes metaphor vehicles (textile + energy state) without clear logic (−0.3). Aggregate artifacts reduce propulsion but do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise (prophecy + lost buttons + hourglass magic) stitches three high-concept elements without organic synthesis—removing buttons and substituting any other cataloging task (stars, stones, echoes themselves) would leave the arc unchanged. The "quietly inspired" trait and "unscramble" action are prompt-visible and do not transform into lived-in specifics. The village and cliffs remain setting-template rather than this village with its droughts, feuds, or founding myth. No moment offers a non-obvious turn; the arc proceeds from prophecy problem → cataloging solution → wisdom unlocked in a linear template familiar from chosen-one and artifact-quest structures.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout and performs the key action (cataloging), but her decisions are procedural rather than choice-laden—no moment where she selects one button over another under competing pressure or rejects an alternate method. She is present at closure but does not make a high-stakes turn there; the hourglass inversion happens to her environment rather than through her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The canyon echo jar is handled in the opening beat (knelt above it), mentioned during cataloging ("resonated with each placement"), and bursts forth at closure ("no longer a murmur but a chorus"). However, it does not constrain a middle choice or reweight its own meaning—it simply amplifies on cue. Its mechanics (hum matching heartbeat, growing clearer, then bursting) are consistent but do not impose cost or tactical friction; removing it and using any resonant object would preserve the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Shared wisdom" is asserted ("seeped into her") but never dramatized as a choice-shaping force—no moment where one button's embedded regret stops her hand or where conflicting wisdom from two buttons forces a synthesis. It functions as thematic label rather than on-page stake or tactic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" is mentioned in the opening and closing paragraphs but never enables or constrains an action—no scene where she must suppress visible excitement to avoid alarming the echo, or where quiet observation reveals a button detail louder colleagues would miss. It remains descriptor rather than lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Unscramble" is the declared goal and the prophecy does unravel by the end, creating a before/after around comprehension. However, the unscrambling itself is passive (the echo does the work) rather than an on-page action Elara performs—she arranges, and the result follows automatically. The term appears early and at closure, satisfying setup and payoff, but middle development shows accumulation rather than unscrambling moves.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cataloging lost buttons is signaled in paragraph seven, detailed across the middle third (sorting by color/size/story, handling star and disc buttons), and the final button placement triggers the climax. The method's mechanics matter (arrangement, tactile handling) and shape the middle beats. However, no moment shows the cataloging method imposing cost or requiring a trade-off versus an alternative; it succeeds as described without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The amber warehouse beneath cliffs is anchored early with vivid detail (resin smell, slanted light, high windows) and bookends the arc (opening knelt inside, closing stepped outside). However, it supplies atmosphere rather than constraint—no spatial or material feature of the warehouse alters her approach or the outcome. Micro-setting (the buttons and hourglass) does more causal work than the warehouse itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" appears in the title position and the hourglass ticking/"sand a relentless descent" recur as urgency markers, but no on-page moment shows time pressure forcing a tactical shift—she completes the cataloging without truncation or triage. The sand rising at the end reverses the clock rather than forcing a deadline choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To spin a prophecy into raw possibility" is stated as motivation in paragraph four and reprised at closure ("spun the prophecy into something new: hope"). The desire is clear and frames the goal, but it is never conflicted—no moment where spinning the prophecy risks the village's stability or where she must choose between unscrambling and leaving fate fixed. The motivation drives the plot but does not create friction or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unearthed silence" is named once in the warehouse description and "the hourglass turned with deliberate grace" echoes the quietness, but the tone does not modulate under pressure—the narration remains steady and declarative through the cataloging sequence and climax alike. The final image ("quietly inspired") attempts tonal closure but restates the opening register rather than charging it with the arc's cost.</comment>
