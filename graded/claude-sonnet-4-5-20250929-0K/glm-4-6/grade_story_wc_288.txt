<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority consists almost entirely of abstract contemplation ("brittle awakenings," "crystalline shell around her heart") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final decision to "translate her knowledge" is declared rather than tested by competing pressures. Embodied emotion is absent; we get labels like "isolation" and "sorrow" but no micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under stress. The single-POV frame is maintained, but the protagonist reads as a vessel for theme rather than a mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story lacks a legible closure with cost. The ending declares transformation ("no longer just a survivor, but a guardian of memory") but no on-page choice forecloses a path or alters tactics—Elara's situation at the close is functionally identical to the opening. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural by intent, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake; the piece simply accumulates reflective declarations. Orientation is present early (who, where, when), preventing a heavier penalty, but causality is absent: no because/therefore linkage drives the stated awakening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tidal library and brass sundial are vivid as images but function as postcard description rather than constraint. The sundial is handled twice, but neither touch alters a choice—it reflects her state without shaping tactics. The floating library's tidal nature is asserted metaphorically but never pressures movement or access. Sensory hierarchy is absent; the narration offers visual tableaux without embodied perception filtered through urgency or professional lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("translate isolation into independence") is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the protagonist drifts through reflection without a live choice that forecloses a path. The story declares escalation ("each brittle awakening had been preparing her") yet shows no pressure point where want conflicts with cost. Agency is missing: Elara's final stance is a passive acceptance rather than a decision with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated rather than emergent: "Independence begins with acceptance" is declared mid-story, and the final paragraph moralizes the arc without resonance from particulars. The brass sundial and stone circle are symbolic tokens that do not constrain choice or charge the closure. No earned wisdom arises from concrete experience—Elara's insight is asserted, not dramatized. The piece substitutes thematic echo for scene pressure, particularly in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, but the perceptual signature is generic: "atomically reflective fingers," "brittle awakenings," and "cosmic cycles" read as register-elevated vocabulary imposed on the narration rather than filtered through character-specific noticing. No dialogue appears (acceptable under the policy). Diction remains consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—every sentence maintains the same elevated, metaphor-dense cadence regardless of emotional stakes. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice converges with theme rather than revealing a mind in motion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "brittle awakenings," "crystalline shell," "atomically reflective," "tidal library," "cosmic cycles" stack without causal work, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.6). Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "isolation…wrapped around her like a shroud" / "profound loneliness of being the last of her kind" and "brittle awakening" recurs five times without reweighting. Template cadence is visible in parallel "The [noun]'s [quality]" constructions across adjacent sentences. Clarity suffers under the metaphor load, and momentum stalls as reflection loops without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise (last survivor in a floating library) is familiar and not transformed through specific choice or constraint—removing "Dragon-Kin" or "tidal library" and substituting near-synonyms would leave the emotional arc unchanged. No turn or intensification grows from prior particulars; the ending's declared transformation could occur in any contemplative-survivor story. The piece hedges into abstraction ("cosmic energies," "universal forces") rather than anchoring universals in tactile specificity. Emotional honesty is present, but the design reads as a median response to a prompt rather than a singular artistic stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout as the last Dragon-Kin who coexisted with extinct species, but her status as "contemporary" never drives a key turn—she observes and reflects without making a decision that alters tactics. The extinct-species context supplies backstory but does not pressure present choices. Label-only trait (−0.3), swappable premise (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The brass sundial is handled in two beats (tracing fingers early, placing palms later) and returns in the final paragraph with symbolic reprise, but its mechanics do not constrain choice—it reflects her state without enabling or narrowing options. Present in setup, middle touch, and closure mention satisfies the gate model, but causal pressure is absent. Lyric resonance is attempted but the reprise does not reweight the stake with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" recurs as a thematic label throughout but never shapes an on-page stake or tactic. The concept is mentioned five times yet remains abstract; no moment shows fragility constraining or enabling action. Present in setup and echoed at closure, but purely as thematic claim rather than causal force. Label-only (−0.3), no beat involvement beyond ornament.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Atomically reflective" appears three times as a descriptor (fingers, eyes, skin) but never constrains or enables action with cost. The trait is visual decoration; removing it would not alter any choice or closure image. Label-only mention (−0.3), no causal work, easily swappable with "metallic" or "shimmering."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Coexist" is invoked repeatedly (coexisted with extinct species, coexist with memories, coexist with loneliness) but functions as thematic vocabulary rather than action that shapes turns. The story asserts Elara has learned to coexist, but no on-page beat demonstrates the method or cost. Present in setup and mentioned at closure, yet swappable with "endure" or "accept" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The ancient stone circle's hum is mentioned in setup and middle ("through these vibrations, Elara had learned to coexist") and recurs at closure, but the mechanics remain vague—how the hum enables connection is asserted, not shown. The method does not shape an attempt or constrain a choice. Present across beats but summary-only (−0.4), no specific causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tidal library is introduced early and its floating, cyclical nature is emphasized throughout; it appears in the final descent beat. The setting's tidal rhythm is metaphorically linked to Elara's emotional state, but it does not pressure movement, access, or tactics. Present in setup, middle, and closure; mild causal signal (floating through clouds implies isolation) but remains largely atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"After the reincarnation memory surfaced" anchors the timeframe in the second sentence, and "the day after remembering" / "seasons later" mark progression. However, the memory itself does not tighten decisions—centuries have passed without urgency. Time is tracked but does not create a live clock that alters moves. Present in setup and mentioned later, but no escalation tied to elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Translate isolation into independence" is stated as Elara's goal early and recurs at closure ("translate her knowledge…into a language of independent hope"). The desire is declared and the final paragraph claims success, but the translation is not dramatized through conflicted choices or visible cost—we are told she decides to act, not shown her weighing competing wants. Present in setup and closure; mild causal signal but told-only execution.</comment>
