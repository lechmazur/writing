<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and his contradictory impulses—isolation versus exploration, grief versus purpose—operate simultaneously on the page. The sketch custom provides embodied ritual that anchors emotion without therapy-speak. His "blessed pariah" status and its attendant pain drive micro-choices (tracing the compass, pausing to catch the shimmer, deciding to chart the ghostly stars) that feel earned. The final smile and readiness to navigate land as credible endurance rather than epiphany, though the transformation from survivor to explorer could have been more viscerally costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The accumulation—shimmer noticed, ghost sky overlaid, insight struck, maps drawn—tightens through density increase and cadence shift, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elias's exile crystallizes into purpose with the final image of the growing wall map. The cost is felt: his family is lost, his isolation persists, yet the "echoing silence" becomes "alive with potential," a renunciation of ease in favor of exploration. No causality breaks; closure lands under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck constrains and charges the final image: its "temporally stretched" nature enables the ghost-sky overlay, and the deck's oppressive silence modulates from tomb-like to "alive with potential." The compass rose and parchment function as micro-setting elements that anchor Elias's ritual and discovery. Spatial choreography (window, console, deck) remains clear. The phantom constellation's angle and brightness details demonstrate selective, purpose-driven description filtered through Elias's cartographer lens, though occupational depth is minimal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: turn confusion into exploration. The story delivers one meaningful tightening—Elias's glimpse of the shimmer deepens into the ghost-sky overlay, forcing the realization that "true north" is relative stability between temporal bubbles. This insight forecloses passive mourning and reconfigures his family custom into active cartography. Agency is decision and endurance: he chooses to sketch the phantom stars rather than only the familiar sky, and his status as "blessed pariah" becomes a lens. The cost is legible: his suffering is instrumentalized, his isolation persists, but now with direction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—loss as compass, suffering as lens—emerges from the sketch ritual, the ghost-sky overlay, and the compass rose's shift from relic to tool. The family custom reweights from remembrance to discovery without statement. The final image (two maps beside the compass, aligned with phantom vision) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how exile can become exploration. Subtext operates in the "profound, echoing silence" and the transformation of the deck from tomb to beacon. No thematic echo or moralizing; the particulars (charcoal, parchment, gilded applique) carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization remains stable and tight to Elias's perceptual signature: "silence stretched like taffy," "black velvet canvas," "sane world" as mythical. Diction fits a reflective, somewhat elevated register appropriate to a station technician turned cartographer. The prose modulates from oppressive ("tomb of echoes") to purposeful ("scratch of charcoal… a sound of defiance") as pressure mounts. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("trying to catch," "realized what he was seeing") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Brief register drift into slightly ornate phrasing ("alchemizing into purpose") in peak beats, but internal voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs appear: "His fingers traced… cool against his skin" / "his charcoal sure and steady… a prayer… anchor himself" and the repeated "He [verb]" stems in the middle section ("He lifted his gaze… He focused… He reached out… He realized"). The figurative load is heavy ("taffy," "black velvet," "dying embers," "smoke," "physical blow," "alchemizing," "fulcrum") without always advancing pressure. Clarity remains intact and the closure image is clean, so artifacts do not obscure causality, but the density triggers −0.6 in Q7 per the patterned-artifact pack, preventing 9+ eligibility globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—temporal distortion observation deck, family sketch custom as cartography tool, "blessed pariah" lens—feels specific and non-obvious. The ghost-sky overlay and the insight that "true north" is relative stability between bubbles offer a fresh angle on isolation-as-exploration. Emotional particulars (anniversary grief, charcoal ritual) ground the premise. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact details. No close echoes of famous lines. Risk-taking (accumulative design, heavy interiority, quiet ending) heightens stakes without gimmickry, warranting +0.3 within band. Derivative premise guardrail does not apply; the lived detail and moral calculus are distinctive.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "blessed pariah" status is established early (hated yet spared, survivor of advocacy and loss) and shapes two key choices: pausing to catch the shimmer (his "uncanny ability" enables perception) and choosing to sketch the ghost stars rather than only memory. His suffering becomes a lens in the climax ("his status… finally made sense"), altering tactics from mourning to cartography. Present in closure ("no longer just a survivor; he was an explorer"). Meets setup, development, and payoff gates. Causal pressure +0.9; closure linkage +1.0; two beats +0.9; specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3, rounded to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gilded compass rose applique appears in three beats: Elias traces it early ("artifact from a sane world"), it "seemed to hum" under his attention as he sketches, and it aligns "perfectly with the phantom vision" in the final image, reweighted from relic to tool and "his freshly charted true north." Setup +0.5; three beats +1.4; closure linkage +1.2; specificity (ornate design, metallic surface, promise of direction) +0.6; cost connection +0.3. Base 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0, rounded to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"True north" is seeded early (compass rose as "promise of direction, a concept now as mythical") and drives the central insight: Elias realizes true north is "not a fixed point, but a direction of relative stability, a path between the temporal bubbles." This realization shapes his choice to chart ghost stars and redefines his purpose. Present in closure ("his freshly charted true north"). Setup +0.6; causal pressure (enables new tactics) +1.2; closure linkage +1.3; two beats +0.9; specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5, capped at 6.8 due to remaining primarily conceptual/thematic until the insight beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The deck being "temporally stretched" is established early ("bubble where seconds could feel like eternities") and enables the ghost-sky overlay by holding snapshots from other timelines. This constraint makes Elias's discovery possible. Present in closure setup (the overlay persists as he finishes). Setup +0.5; causal pressure +1.0; one beat +0.4; closure linkage (indirect: enables the final map alignment) +0.7; specificity +0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0, rounded down to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "glimpse" (shimmer at the edge of vision) is the inciting action: Elias pauses his sketch, focuses, and the shimmer coalesces into the ghost-sky overlay, which triggers his insight and redefines his purpose. Removing this exact action collapses the turn. Setup (midpoint) −0.3; causal pressure (redefines options) +1.6; closure linkage (maps drawn because of this glimpse) +1.4; two beats (glimpse → focus → overlay) +0.9; specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.2 = 7.2, rounded to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The family custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries is established early, grounds Elias's grief, and becomes the method for discovery: he sketches the ghostly stars, noting variations, which lets him chart temporal currents. The custom appears in three beats (unrolling parchment, drawing Orion, drawing the ghost stars) and drives the climax ("the family custom… had become an act of discovery"). Present in closure ("a family custom that had become a beacon"). Setup +0.7; three beats +1.4; causal pressure +1.4; closure linkage +1.6; specificity +0.7; cost connection +0.5. Base 3.0 + 6.3 = 9.3, rounded down to 8.2 to avoid overreach given some passivity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck is anchored early (reinforced plasteel window, chrono-lab below, void above) and its temporal-stretch property enables the ghost-sky overlay. The deck's oppressive silence modulates from tomb to "alive with potential," charging the final image. Present throughout and in closure. Setup +0.7; three beats (opening, shimmer, ending) +1.4; causal pressure +1.2; closure linkage +1.4; specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3, rounded down to 7.6 due to primarily atmospheric rather than tactical constraint in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" anchors when (anniversary day, post-event) and establishes the deck as frozen ruins. The shutdown backstory motivates Elias's pariah status and isolation. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions within the scene; no live clock alters tactics. Setup +0.6; causal pressure (sets condition, not tactics) +0.6; one beat +0.4; specificity +0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.0 = 5.0, rounded to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To turn confusion into exploration" is signaled early ("quiet mantra") and dramatized: Elias's choices (tracing the compass, catching the shimmer, sketching the ghost stars) embody the shift from mourning to cartography. The motivation drives two key beats and is crystallized in the climax ("confusion… alchemizing into purpose"). Present in closure ("no longer just a survivor; he was an explorer"). Setup +0.7; two beats +0.9; causal pressure +1.3; closure linkage +1.3; cost connection (exile persists) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6, rounded down to 7.4 for slight abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" tone is coherent throughout: "tomb of echoes," "profound, echoing silence," silence that "lessened" then "returned… less empty, more alive." The tone modulates with pressure (oppressive → defiant scratch of charcoal → alive with potential) and charges the final image ("a testament"). Setup +0.7; three beats +1.4; closure linkage +1.2; specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8, rounded down to 6.7 for occasional drift into ornate phrasing that slightly tensions the established quietness.</comment>
