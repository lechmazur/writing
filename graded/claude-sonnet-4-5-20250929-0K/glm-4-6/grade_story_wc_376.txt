<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's physical wilting response to dishonesty provides a concrete constraint, and her decision to distribute the messages shows agency under pressure. However, her internal contradictions remain underdeveloped—the piece tells us she depends on candor but doesn't dramatize competing impulses acting simultaneously in peak moments. Marius's confession arrives conveniently late, and his motivations (hoping she wouldn't find the fragment while visiting her workspace regularly) lack embodied tension. The final transformation feels asserted rather than earned through visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal lens: map discovery → postal hub exploration → plate fragments → revelation → message distribution. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who/where/when by the second paragraph). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through community candor blooming, but the cost remains abstract—"wilted parts...remained faded" tells us loss occurred off-page rather than showing a specific, visible price paid in the final image. The council's prior suppression provides setup, but Elara's final act (sending messages) faces no on-page resistance or trade-off that would charge the ending with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic skies and the calligrapher's workspace are established early with sensory detail (iridescent dust, warped floorboards, garden lamps). The postal tubes provide a concrete infrastructure that enables the climax. However, spatial choreography during the distribution hub exploration remains vague—we don't track Elara's movement through "piles of rust and crystal-dust" in a way that constrains her search. The gilded leaves and zinc plate constrain the final choice (she uses her calligrapher's tools to copy and send fragments), qualifying for micro-setting credit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—is signaled in the opening third and drives the treasure-map piecing and hub exploration. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marius's complicity is revealed, narrowing Elara's trust and forcing her to act alone (or with him as ally under new terms). However, the message distribution itself encounters no visible obstacles or costs; we're told it happens and communities respond, but no on-page resistance tests her commitment. The wilting provides a recurring pressure mechanism, but it functions more as atmosphere than a tactical constraint that alters her moves at the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus institutional denial emerges from the postal fragments and Elara's physical sensitivity to dishonesty. The final image of "candor blooming" and new gold-spattered growth gestures toward earned resilience, but the thematic answer arrives through summary rather than a resonant particular: "communities finally addressing their crisis" is told, not shown through a specific micro-moment. The wilting metaphor is deployed consistently but feels engineered for theme rather than discovered through scene pressure. The phrase "terrible gift: the inability to thrive in shadows" borders on explicit thesis statement, reducing ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to Elara's sensory experience and calligrapher's lens (matching ink patterns, tracing zinc etchings). Perceptual signature is present: she notices text and symbolic details others might miss. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with immediate crisis ("comprehension struck," "fragile glass sanctuary") and some interiority edges toward thesis-speak ("crushing weight of withheld truths that had killed their city"). Marius's dialogue is functional and the question "What are you finding?" pursues a clear goal, but his voice doesn't distinguish itself rhythmically from Elara's narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally solid (the map becomes a postal route; the plate contains intercepted messages). However, the piece suffers from template cadence in several beats: "She had first noticed," "Now, beneath warped floorboards," "Back in her workspace" use identical positional openers without voice motivation. The phrase "her calligrapher's patience serving her well" and "her calligrapher's sensitivity to truth" repeat the same stem structure. Stock metaphors like "gold in her veins growing dull" and "candor took root" flatten peak moments. The final paragraph's "terrible gift" construction reads as scaffolding that could be cut without loss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of physical truth-detection, lost postal fragments, and greenhouse dystopia offers a specific premise, and the calligrapher angle provides occupational texture. However, the core emotional arc (suppressed truth revealed, community healed through honesty) follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn. The wilting-skin mechanism is inventive but underexploited—it never forces Elara into a lose-lose choice where honesty itself costs her something she values beyond vitality. The ending's community awakening is earnest but predictable; no moment reweights prior material in a way that feels inevitable only in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara as gilded-leaf calligrapher is introduced in the opening line, her occupation enabling both the piecing-together of the map (matching ink patterns) and the final message distribution (drafting on gilded leaves, sending through postal tubes). Her choice to distribute the fragments despite personal cost (permanent wilting) drives the closure. However, her profession's specific constraints don't force tactical trade-offs in middle beats—calligraphy skill is more color than lever. Present in setup, middle, and ending; causal in two beats (map reconstruction, message sending); irreplaceability is moderate (another detail-oriented profession could substitute with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The zinc-etched postal plate fragment appears first in the distribution hub (end of first third), is reread "until her eyes burned," and triggers Marius's confession. It's handled across three beats: discovery, study causing wilting, final tracing before message drafting. The plate's content (intercepted warnings, lovers' promises) directly reveals the council's suppression, narrowing Elara's options and motivating the climax. The specificity of "zinc-etched" and "faint impressions of words never delivered" matter to the calligrapher premise. Closure linkage is strong but indirect—she drafts new messages inspired by the plate rather than using the plate itself in the final image. Setup late (~35%), but multiple beat involvement and causal pressure elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Candor in small moments is declared as Elara's dependency ("her very vitality depended on candor in small moments, not grand declarations") and the ending asserts "small pockets of candor blooming...candor took root in small moments." However, the concept remains abstract—we don't see a specific small, mundane exchange dramatized where minor honesty alters immediate stakes. The wilting mechanism enforces truth-detection broadly but doesn't distinguish small moments from large revelations. The concept shapes theme more than it constrains on-page choices; Elara's final act (mass message distribution) is a grand gesture, not a small one. Present as a label, not a tactical engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Wilting near dishonesty is introduced in the council meeting flashback and recurs in three beats: council memory, Marius's evasion (patterns fade), and Marius's confession (patterns return to gold). The trait forces Elara to recognize Marius's knowledge ("You knew") and constrains her social navigation. The permanent wilting at the end ("wilted parts...remained faded") marks a cost, though this is told rather than shown through a specific forfeited ability. The attribute is causally active but its tactical constraint is mild—she never has to choose between pursuing truth and preserving her vitality in a way that costs her something else she values. Setup early, two distinct beats, moderate cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rereading appears in three forms: rereading the fragmented text of the postal plate, rereading with Marius ("Together, they reread the full series"), and the piece's motivating question ("where do lost conversations go when they've been silenced?"). The action of sustained, patient rereading enables the revelation of the aquifer contamination and council suppression. Elara's calligrapher patience is tested through this action. However, the dramatic weight rests more on discovery than on the interpretive act itself—once she pieces together the map and finds the plate, the content is straightforward. The action is integral but somewhat swappable (she could have "deciphered" or "decoded" with similar effect). Setup, middle revelation, and closure motivation present; causal in two beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Piecing together the shredded treasure map found under floorboards is introduced early ("beneath warped floorboards...shredded fragments") and the method is foregrounded ("For weeks she committed to piecing together...matching ancient ink patterns"). The calligrapher's pattern-matching skill makes the method character-specific. However, the actual process is summarized in one sentence rather than dramatized across beats, and the map's mechanics (why shredded? who hid it? why under her floorboards?) remain unexplained, reducing causal texture. The method leads to the postal hub discovery, but the shredded-map device feels more like a plot unlock than a constraint that shapes her attempts. Setup clear, one causal beat (leads to hub), closure indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The sprawling greenhouse city under toxic skies is anchored in the opening paragraph and recurs through "transparent domes," "pressurized tubes," "sectors," and the dried central oasis. The toxic sky provides the root cause (radiation leaching into the aquifer) and the greenhouse enclosure explains the postal tube infrastructure that enables Elara's final distribution. The setting supplies both the problem and the solution mechanism. However, the environment doesn't constrain Elara's movement or tactics in a felt way—she accesses the distribution hub and sends messages without spatial or atmospheric friction. The setting is essential to premise and closure logic but functions more as backdrop than tactical pressure. Setup immediate, closure participation strong, causal linkage moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the oasis dries" is established early ("Three cycles had passed since the central oasis had dried up") and the crisis (water shortages, rationing) provides ongoing pressure. However, the temporal urgency remains vague—"weeks" of map-piecing and "years" of prior contamination are mentioned, but no countdown or deadline tightens Elara's choices. The phrase "these desperate times" asserts urgency without a clock that alters her moves. The oasis drying is setup and motivation, but time itself doesn't escalate the conflict or charge the ending. The piece could occur at any point post-drought without structural change. Setup clear, stakes framing present, tactical constraint absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where lost conversations go" is voiced on-page ("her persistent question: where do lost conversations go when they've been silenced?") and drives the map-search and hub exploration. Marius echoes it at closure ("You asked where conversations go when they're lost"). However, the motivation is more philosophical than visceral—Elara's personal stake in recovering these specific conversations (as opposed to general truth-seeking) remains unclear. We don't see her lose a particular conversation that makes this quest urgent to her individually. The desire is present and shapes plot, but lacks internal friction or competing costs that would deepen it. Setup, middle action, closure callback present; moderate causal force.</comment>
