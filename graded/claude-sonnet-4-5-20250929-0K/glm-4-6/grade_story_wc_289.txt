<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("thread that connected all things," "filament of pure meaning") rather than concrete, embodied contradiction. The climactic realization—that secrets are "tesserae" in a mosaic—arrives as declared epiphany without prior on-page struggle between contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ghostwriter profession is mentioned but never constrains a choice; we see no client interaction, no letter-writing pressure. Embodied emotion is thin: "felt a pull," "warming in his hand," "flood" of secrets—all tell rather than show physiological specificity under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding that he is "woven irrevocably into the pattern") but the cost remains abstract and unfelt on the page—no visible forfeiture, no tactical shift, no relationship or opportunity foreclosed. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (storm → nest → sculpture → realization), and the pattern holds, but the final image ("no longer feeling separate") asserts transformation without dramatizing what Elias loses or gives up. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early). The nest-to-sculpture echo provides one meaningful deepening, satisfying minimum escalation for this length, but the ending's conceptual repricing lacks the undeniable pressure or felt price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lotus temple, lily pond, and post-rain sensory details (ozone, damp earth, prismatic light) are vivid and selective. The sculpture "The Rejoin" functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's path ("his path dictated not by the designated floor arrows but by the shape in his palm"). Spatial choreography is clear: pond edge, meadow, sculpture interior. The nest twig, though small, acts as a tactile anchor that charges the final movement, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion (object constrains choice and charges closure). Minor penalty: the meadow/installation transition feels slightly abrupt, and the "adjoining meadow" anchor could be tighter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early: Elias seeks "the thread that connects all things." The sculpture walk provides one meaningful tightening (tracing the spiral with the nest as key), and the final flood of interconnected secrets delivers a reweighting. However, agency is passive—Elias is guided, feels a pull, receives insight—rather than making a choice that forecloses a path. No visible price is paid; no live option is rejected. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is present but lacks the felt cost or trade-off that would elevate the score into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (interconnection, the weaver woven into the tapestry) emerges through images: storm, nest spiral, sculpture, mosaic of secrets. The final paragraph's "woven irrevocably into the pattern of everything" risks overt statement but is anchored by the prior spiral motif. The piece resists simplistic resolution, leaving the nature of the thread ambiguous. However, the epiphany language ("understood at last") leans toward articulation rather than resonant implication. The ending image (Elias looking back at the temple) offers a non-literal answer but the thematic payload is diluted by the explanatory interiority in the climax paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture: "prismatic quiet," "verdine island," "colossal, metallic God's-wort." Perceptual signature is character-specific (a ghostwriter attuned to symbols and meaning). Narrative distance tightens appropriately during the sculpture walk. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor penalty: phrases like "inevitably whimsical mind" and "a certainty that defied logic" edge toward telling rather than showing the focalizer's mode of perception, and "God's-wort" reads as an obscure term that may not fit the character's established lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and imagery is vivid ("each drop a tiny, shattered jewel"). Information density is high in the opening and sculpture paragraphs. However, the climax paragraph contains multiple paraphrase loops: "They were not separate; they were colors... They were not his burdens; they were his tesserae"—synonym churn that restates the same revelation. The phrase "no bigger than his palm" and "miniature galaxy of organic purpose" add decorative layers without advancing pressure. Stock metaphor "thread" recurs without evolving specificity. These artifacts cluster near closure, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the Q7 rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (ghostwriter seeking universal connection finds it through storm debris and public art) offers a lyric angle but leans on familiar writing-workshop motifs: the artist's epiphany, the symbolic object, the transformative walk. The nest-spiral-to-sculpture echo is elegant but predictable once set up. "The thread that connects all things" is a generic abstraction without the grounded specificity that would make it feel inevitable. The transformation test is weak: swap "ghostwriter" for "poet" or "translator" and the arc holds unchanged. Risk-taking is moderate; the lyric compression is purposeful but does not heighten stakes or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias's profession as ghostwriter is mentioned in the opening and thematically echoed (keeper of secrets), but he makes no on-page choices tied to letter-writing. No client interaction, no decision to write or withhold, no professional constraint that narrows options. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The twig spiral is handled twice: found at the pond edge, then held and used as a "key" to trace the sculpture's path. It seeds the closure image (spiral as map of interconnection) and returns with reweighted meaning. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (enables the walk) (+0.8), closure linkage (charges the final realization) (+1.0). Swappability is low; the spiral shape is specific. Total positive ~3.2. Late first mention in paragraph three (−0.3). Net: strong mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "keeper of secrets" concept frames Elias's identity and provides the thematic material (client secrets as tesserae), but it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics. It functions as backstory and theme rather than active pressure. Present in setup and payoff, missing middle development. Cap at 4.6 per missing-middle rule; decorative mention −0.3, thematic claim without action pressure −0.2 = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Inevitably whimsical" is asserted in paragraph two ("his inevitably whimsical mind") but never shown through action or choice. No on-page moment where whimsy enables or costs. Label-only trait. Cap 2.8 per missing closure participation; label-only −0.3 = 2.5, round to 2.8 for minimal presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Rejoin" is the story's title concept and the sculpture's name. Elias's walk through the installation is the central action, and the climax hinges on his reconnection to the thread. Early signal (sculpture introduced paragraph four, action begins paragraph five), two beats (approach, interior walk), causal pressure (the walk triggers the flood of insight), closure linkage (the action of emerging redefines his stance). Swappability is low; "rejoin" is thematically load-bearing. Positive signals ~4.2. No major frictions. Strong essential integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The public art installation "The Rejoin" is introduced in paragraph four, shapes the middle beat (Elias walks through it, tracing the spiral), and enables the climax. Its mechanics matter: the silver ribbons, the spiral form, the gaps casting light. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (the walk is the method for the epiphany) (+1.2), closure linkage (+1.0), specificity (the sculpture's design is unique) (+0.5). Total positive ~4.1. Introduced at ~40% mark, slight late penalty (−0.2). Net: strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The lotus temple and lily pond are vividly described in the opening and returned to in the final line. They provide spatial anchor and lyric bookend, but they do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The sculpture (adjacent to the temple) does the causal work. Setup and closure presence; missing middle development. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake (Elias now sees himself as part of the pattern), allowing ~6.0 ceiling per the lyric-resonance allowance. Decorative description −0.3, missing middle −0.5 per cap, swappability (could be any serene landmark) −0.3 = 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the cloud bursts" anchors the opening and establishes the post-storm clarity that seeds Elias's insight. The timeframe is present in setup and thematically tied to renewal, but it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. No middle pressure from time. Setup and thematic payoff; missing middle. Cap 4.6; lyric reprise (storm → clarity → final temple image) +0.5 = 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to find the thread that connects all things" is stated in paragraph two, dramatized through his walk (seeking the thread via the sculpture), and fulfilled in the climax (he feels the thread as a flood). Three beats: statement, walk, realization. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (the desire drives the walk) (+1.0), closure linkage (the realization answers the want) (+1.2). Friction: the want is told more than shown through micro-choices with cost (−0.6); summary-only in the climax (−0.3). Net: solid integration with lyric payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Prismatic quiet" is named in paragraph one (water drops as jewels), recurs in paragraph five ("the prismatic quiet... intensified"), and charges the closure (Elias emerges into a reconfigured perception). The tone modulates subtly: stillness → intensification → emergence. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (the tone's intensification primes the epiphany) (+1.0), specificity (the prismatic metaphor is consistent) (+0.4). Total positive ~2.9. Static mood in middle paragraphs (−0.3). Net: strong coherent tone that supports closure.</comment>
