<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gardener's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority remains thin—no contradictory impulses emerge under pressure, only a single-note sensitivity about darkness. The "protected vulnerability" is asserted rather than dramatized through competing desires. Micro-choices (adjusting mirrors, packing tools) advance the project but reveal no internal cost or trade-off. The ending change—neighbors adopting his practice—feels declarative rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (fire escape, harbor, apartment building). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: installation → observation → community adoption. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (neighbors placing mirrors), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path on the page. The final image reweights the gardener's work through diffusion, yet the price of his labor (time, isolation, risk of dismissal) is told rather than felt in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The luminous harbor and fire escape provide vivid spatial grounding, and the bitting gauge tooth becomes a tactile anchor across beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—mirrors could be adjusted with any fine tool, and the fire escape functions as backdrop rather than pressure point. Sensory detail is selective (moonlight, rusty metal, pink-orange dawn) but does not narrow the gardener's options at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bringing light to dark spaces—is signaled early and maintained. The installation sequence accumulates detail but lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; the superintendent's acceptance removes potential opposition without conflict. No on-page cost alters tactics: the gardener completes his system, then maintains it, with no trade-off or forfeited path visible in the ending. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The light/darkness motif threads through the piece and avoids overt moralizing until the final phrase—"after the final petal drops, new forms of beauty and light can still flourish"—which tilts toward thematic summary. The concept of "wistfully pragmatic" illumination emerges from particulars (mirrors, sea glass, gauge tooth), and the neighbors' adoption offers a non-declarative answer. The ending's resonance is muted by the lack of visible cost, preventing full thematic depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled, though some phrases ("protected vulnerability," "spiritual darkness") edge toward abstract therapy-speak rather than the gardener's concrete idiom. Filter verbs ("he believed," "he knew") appear but remain voice-consistent. The perceptual signature—moonlight calculations, harbor rhythm—is present but not stressed under pressure; the ending maintains distance rather than tightening into the gardener's immediate experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and varied, but several loops and near-paraphrases appear: "after the final petal drops" is used three times, "wistfully pragmatic" twice, "protected vulnerability" twice. The phrase "rhythm of oars in water" appears twice in identical form without reweighting. Template cadence in the middle section ("Each reflective surface… the bitting gauge tooth served…") slightly dulls momentum. No figurative muddle or major artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping deductions modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—light-reflection network as winter solace—offers a gentle twist on urban-gardener tropes, but the execution follows a predictable arc: problem identified, solution implemented, community adoption. The bitting gauge tooth provides specificity, yet the emotional and plot beats (loss of blooms → mirrors → neighbors inspired) hew close to familiar templates. No bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus elevates the synthesis; the transformation from flowers to light is poetic but anticipated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gardener frames the story and makes key choices (collecting materials, installing panels, maintaining the system), present across setup, middle, and ending. His decisions drive the installation sequence, but no choice narrows options or incurs visible cost—he completes the project without opposition or trade-off. Causal pressure is low; his agency advances plot but does not alter tactics under resistance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The bitting gauge tooth appears in three beats: found (paragraph 2), used for micro-adjustments (paragraphs 3 and 5), and packed away (paragraph 7). It enables precision work, but any fine tool could substitute with minor edits. No cost is tied to its use, and it does not return with reweighted meaning at closure. Present and functional, but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"A quivering hush" appears once (paragraph 2) as atmospheric description. It does not shape stakes, constrain choices, or alter tactics. The concept of anticipatory stillness is present but ornamental; removing it would not break story logic. Echo-only, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is used twice: paragraph 1 labels the gardener, paragraph 6 restates the label. The trait informs his methodical approach and modest expectations, enabling the light system as a credible (not grand) gesture. However, no on-page action shows a cost or trade-off tied to this balance of sentiment and practicality. Functional characterization, but label-dominant.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>"Instill" appears once in paragraph 6 ("sought not to instill false hope but to create something tangible"). The phrasing clarifies motive but does not drive a major turn; the gardener's creation of the light system is the central action, and "instill" describes intent rather than method. Swappable with "offer" or "provide" without structural loss. Present but not load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"With the rhythm of oars in water" appears twice: paragraph 1 (the gardener has memorized it) and paragraph 5 (he works with that rhythm). The phrase colors his movement but does not constrain mechanics or choices—the installation could proceed identically without this rhythmic frame. Atmospheric method, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight anchors the opening, provides the light source for the mirror system, and recurs in the dawn closure (paragraph 7). Moonlight is essential to the project's logic, and the harbor setting frames the gardener's perch. However, the harbor itself does not pressure choices or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is backdrop. Moon positioning matters (paragraph 5), giving the setting modest causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the final petal drops from the old rosebush" appears in paragraphs 1, 4, and 10, marking the seasonal transition that motivates the project. The timeframe establishes urgency (winter approaching) and seeds the thematic contrast (blooms → light), with a lyric reprise at closure. However, no on-page clock tightens decisions; the gardener completes his work over weeks without temporal pressure altering tactics. Purposeful framing, modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To reflect light into dark corners where none would otherwise reach" is stated in paragraph 2 and restated in paragraph 6. The motivation drives the entire plot (collecting materials, installing mirrors, maintaining the system) and is tested across multiple beats. However, it is told rather than conflicted—no friction between the gardener's desire and a competing cost appears on the page. Clear and sustained, but dramatization is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" appears twice (paragraphs 4 and 10). The tone is asserted via the narrator's summary ("concealed a deeply sensitive nature," "never sharing his purpose") but not modulated through the gardener's voice or choice under pressure. The ending maintains a gentle, distanced register without tonal shift or charge in the final image. Static mood, label-reliant.</comment>
