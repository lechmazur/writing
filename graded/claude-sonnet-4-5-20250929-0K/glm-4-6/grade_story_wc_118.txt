<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aria's internal life is dominated by perceptual labels ("sensitively perceptive nature") rather than embodied contradictions. Her motivation to collect wall stories remains abstract; no on-page micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values under pressure. The final "hint of stirring" reads as convenient uplift rather than earned transformation with visible cost. The character functions as a vehicle for exposition rather than a mind in genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a post-dream-apocalypse premise but never dramatizes a choice that narrows options or alters tactics. Aria's decision to "probe the mysteries" leads to discovery without friction; the diary pages reveal backstory that reframes the premise but does not create a present-tense reversal. The ending "hint of stirring" implies hope without on-page cost or a legible before/after in Aria's stance. Closure reads as thematic assertion rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The silo library is anchored early with evocative detail ("bronze quiet," "circular silence"). The tapestry fragment and containment field provide concrete objects that Aria handles across multiple beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains a backdrop for exposition. The final image does not charge the space with new meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the Dream Extinction—remains intellectual and abstract. Aria encounters no live obstacle; the spectral imaging device works without complication, and the diary entries deliver exposition on demand. No reversal or tightening narrows her options. The "hint of stirring" at the end suggests thematic resolution without demonstrating a cost or trade-off that Aria paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of lost imagination and the "displaced axis" emerges through the medieval weaver's diary and the tapestry's dragons. However, the final "hint of stirring" states hope rather than earning it through a non-literal image rooted in prior particulars. The piece edges toward allegory without fully dramatizing the conceptual cost. The ending avoids overt moralizing but also lacks the charged ambiguity that would invite reflection beyond the immediate premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains stable third-person-limited distance and a consistent elevated register ("bronze quiet," "half-burned diaries"). However, diction occasionally drifts into generic descriptor phrasing ("sensitively perceptive nature," "the Great Unraveling") that blurs specificity. No dialogue appears to test character voice. The perceptual signature is tied more to the premise than to Aria's particular way of noticing under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentences are grammatically clean but exhibit template cadence: "Aria moved," "Aria decided," "Aria recorded." The opening and mid-section rely on summary phrasing ("For three years since," "More diary entries revealed") that stalls momentum. Stock metaphors ("embers refusing to die," "fabric of the world") appear without fresh context. Information density is moderate; many lines restate the premise rather than advancing pressure. The final image ("faintest hint of stirring") lacks the concrete specificity that would charge it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic historian premise and the "last human to dream" frame are familiar templates executed without a sharp transformative angle. The medieval weaver's coven and the tapestry dragons feel ornamental rather than inevitable. The "displaced axis" concept remains abstract; it could swap for other metaphysical breaks with minor edits. The ending's "hint of stirring" gestures toward hope without risk or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Aria, the "odd historian," is present throughout and her role is signaled early. She decides to probe the diaries and later records the archive, but these choices do not create reversals or narrow live options. Her function is observational; the story could proceed with another archivist making identical moves.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears early, is examined across multiple beats, and returns in the final paragraph when Aria seals it. Its dragons are linked causally to the diary's revelation about dimensional guardians. However, the tapestry itself does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it remains a symbol rather than an active pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "displaced axis" is named and explained as the metaphysical separation between reality and imagination. It frames the backstory and informs the diary discovery. However, it does not alter Aria's present tactics or force a trade-off on the page. It functions as thematic backdrop rather than a story-shaping constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Aria's "sensitively perceptive" trait is declared in the opening paragraph and enables her to detect "emotional resonance" in walls. This ability allows her work but never imposes a visible cost or forces a difficult choice. The trait is label-only; no scene dramatizes a perceptual trade-off or friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The action "probe" is enacted when Aria activates the spectral imaging device and reads the diary entries. This sequence occupies the middle third and delivers the central revelation. However, the probing succeeds without complication; swapping "probe" for "examine" or "decipher" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are introduced early, reside in a containment field, and require the spectral imaging device to read. They supply the backstory that reframes the premise. However, their fragility does not create on-page risk; Aria's method works smoothly. The diaries shape the middle development but do not impose cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is anchored in the opening paragraph with vivid detail ("circular silence," "bronze quiet"). Aria moves through "chamber nine" and uses her research table. The setting provides atmosphere but does not constrain her choices or supply a resource that alters outcome. It remains descriptive rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last human dream is dreamt" is stated early and establishes the world's premise. However, no present clock pressures Aria's decisions; she works methodically without urgency. The timeframe functions as backstory context rather than a live constraint that tightens her tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria's motivation "to collect the stories walls have heard" is declared in the third paragraph and mentioned when she records the archive at the end. It explains her occupation but is never tested by a conflicting want or cost. The desire is told rather than dramatized through a difficult choice with friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The tone "bronze quiet" appears in the opening and recurs as "the bronze quiet" when Aria records the archive. It establishes a muted, elegiac register that persists through the piece. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure or intensify at closure; it remains static rather than charging the final image with felt cost.</comment>
