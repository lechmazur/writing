<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eloise's motivation (overdue apology) is clear and drives the action, but her interiority leans heavily on scaffolding ("her voice a mix of gravel and starlight") rather than embodied contradiction. Alistair's ghost voice arrives only at the end, limiting his presence to exposition. The relationship reads as told backstory ("You were just a girl") without dramatized tension in the present moment. The final choice to deliver the apology lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no competing impulse struggles on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story opens with clear orientation (who, where, dominant stake) and follows a causal arc: Eloise retrieves the bottle → applies the oscillator → achieves contact → delivers apology → resolution. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the apology delivered, bond mended), but the cost is abstract ("peace") rather than a visible forfeiture or changed option. The orchard demolition frame is set up but never returns to pressure the climax. Lens: Causal with accumulative touches; holds through closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sheet music archive is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("fine dust," "dissonant chorus"). The perfume bottle is described but not used as a spatial constraint—it could sit on any shelf. The orchard frame is mentioned twice but never affects Eloise's choices or the ending image. Micro-setting (the bottle, the oscillator) functions adequately but doesn't charge the final moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (deliver apology to Alistair) is clear and present throughout. The oscillator provides one meaningful tightening: it succeeds where prior methods failed, narrowing options. However, the climax lacks a live trade-off or visible price—Alistair's forgiveness arrives without resistance, and no competing want (fear of rejection, cost to her reputation) complicates the choice. The ending dissolves sorrow into "peace" without foreclosing a path or altering tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of "imperfect miracles" is declared in reflection but not embodied—the miracle here appears perfect (sorrow dissolves, bond mended, no remainder). The apology motif recurs but without reweighting; the final image ("quiet monument") tells rather than shows resonance. The story resists a stated moral, but the ending summarizes theme ("one long-held silence had been broken") instead of letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eloise's POV is stable with a distinct perceptual filter (gossip-column exorcist lens, metaphor habit). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; the exchange with Alistair carries subtext and advances plot. The phrase "voice a mix of gravel and starlight" drifts into purple register, and the ghost's lines ("You were just a girl") feel generic rather than character-particular. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Opening and closing lines anchor voice and image effectively. However, scaffolding and paraphrase loops appear: "gossip-column exorcist" is explained twice in the opening paragraph; "time to try something new" and the oscillator description overlap functionally. The phrase "gravel and starlight" is metaphorical muddle—voice texture cannot be both simultaneously. Minor template cadence in the climax ("The blue light brightened, and the voice grew stronger") without rhythm variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Gossip-column exorcist" and "induced currents" offer fresh angles, but the emotional arc (guilt → apology → forgiveness → peace) follows a familiar template without transformation. The oscillator method is introduced but not tested or resisted; Alistair accepts immediately. The orchard demolition and "imperfect miracles" premise suggest complexity but are not integrated into the resolution. One fresh inflection: the electrical-spiritual translation device.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eloise (gossip-column exorcist) is present throughout and her choice to use the oscillator drives the key turn. However, the occupation detail (gossip-column framing) does not constrain her method or shape the apology scene—she could be any exorcist. Setup and closure participation present; middle development is functional but the trait remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The antique perfume bottle appears early, is retrieved and handled in the middle, and is the vessel for the climax and closure image. It constrains choice (she must retrieve it, attach leads) and the final return to the shelf charges the ending. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage present; swappability moderate (any vessel could work, but the iridescent fragility adds specificity).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Imperfect miracles" is stated in reflection but not demonstrated—the miracle here reads as complete (sorrow dissolves, bond mended, no imperfection visible on the page). The concept appears in the reflective passage but does not shape tactics or constrain the oscillator's success. Present as theme claim, absent as on-page pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Advises through metaphors" is mentioned in reflection ("she'd always advised her clients through metaphors") but no metaphor appears on the page in dialogue or thought that constrains a choice. The trait is told, not dramatized. Ornamental mention without action consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Reconnect" is the central action: Eloise attempts it throughout, the oscillator enables it, and the apology dialogue completes it. The action is signaled early, drives the middle turn, and defines the closure. Two beats (preparation, contact), causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. Irreplaceable—removing reconnection breaks the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through induced currents" (the oscillator method) is explained and used in the climactic beat, shaping the means of reconnection. However, it arrives late (second half) and succeeds on first try without resistance or cost. One beat (climax), closure participation present, but no middle development or complication. Functional but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sheet music archive is anchored early and provides atmospheric detail (dissonant whispers, dust, towering shelves). However, it does not constrain Eloise's choices—the apology could occur in any haunted space. The orchard frame is mentioned but does not pressure the ending. Setup and atmosphere present; causal constraint and closure charge absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The orchard demolition timeframe is mentioned twice (opening, final paragraph) but never creates urgency or alters Eloise's tactics. The "clock chimed softly" at the end is decorative—no deadline pressures the apology. Present as atmospheric detail, absent as escalation or cost driver. Setup yes, development and payoff no.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To deliver an overdue apology" drives Eloise's entire arc: she retrieves the bottle to apologize, the oscillator enables contact, and the dialogue completes the motivation. The desire is dramatized in action (climbing the ladder, attaching leads) and voiced at the climax. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage all present. Cost is stated ("we don't have to be trapped") but not visibly paid—no competing want complicates the choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is present in diction balance: technical detail (oscillator, leads) grounds the ghostly premise. However, tone flattens at the climax—the blue light and Alistair's voice lean soft ("mournful," "peace") without the grit returning to charge the final image. Coherent through setup and middle; loses tension at closure when ethereal overwhelms.</comment>
