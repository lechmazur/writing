<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's occupation and gift are established, but her interior remains abstract—"whisper to ghosts" and analyzing dreams are told abilities without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final paragraph gestures toward renunciation ("see you soon") but no prior choice forecloses a path with visible cost; the director's investigation happens off-page, so agency is displaced. Motivation is stated ("salvage something pure") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. Diagnostic self-awareness ("they leave echoes," "weaves truth carefully") flattens interiority into exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The lens reads as Causal-Situational Hybrid: Elara discovers Nikolaus's message, then plants truth in the director's dreams, leading to investigation. However, the closure—"another spirit found peace"—summarizes consequence rather than showing a decisive on-page change or felt cost; the director's awakening and subsequent investigation occur off-stage. Themelted snow globe facilitates connection but its mechanics remain vague, and the final paragraph loops back to readiness without transformation. One meaningful tightening (Nikolaus reveals company negligence) narrows knowledge, but the resolution is asserted, not dramatized, leaving cost implied rather than legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine, candle-light, and melted snow globe anchor setting with sensory specificity ("ethereal blue light," "breath fogging in the circled air"). The globe constrains Elara's method and appears in the closure beat ("glinting with captured light"), charging the final image. Spatial choreography between shrine, ghost-ship, and research stations tracks cleanly. However, the wreck-diving occupation and arctic environment remain largely decorative—no tactile detail of diving or cold affects a present choice, and the shrine's carved-ice walls serve atmosphere more than action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing the truth behind the *Northern Star*'s sinking—is signaled early and drives the sequence: dreams grow frantic, Nikolaus reveals negligence, Elara plants the truth. One meaningful tightening occurs when Nikolaus shows the compromised hull, narrowing Elara's options to direct intervention. Yet the peak choice (implanting truth in the director's dreams) happens off-stage between paragraphs ("that night, Elara exposed the truth"), and the director's investigation is summarized rather than dramatized, displacing agency. Cost is told ("exhausted") but not shown altering tactics or forecloseging a path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—salvaging truth from wreckage, mediating between life and death—emerges through the ghost-whisperer premise and the *Northern Star* investigation. The melted snow globe recurs, its warped glass and "borrowed starlight" seeding a motif of fractured connection. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("stories waiting beneath the surface, more truths needing exposure through the windows between worlds") rather than letting image and action carry resonance. "Salvage something pure" is declared motivation, not dramatized cost, and the ending offers comfort ("see you soon") instead of a non-literal reconfiguration of the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, with Elara's perceptual signature—ghost-whisperer idiom, liminal-space navigation—establishing voice. Diction is controlled ("ethereal," "translucent as wind-pressed ice") and matches a practiced mystic's lexicon. However, several phrases drift into elevated register without dramatized pressure ("weaves truth carefully, never revealing too much of the liminal space") and recycle near-synonym constructions ("flickering flames and eternal cold," "candle-lit shrine, melted snow globe glinting"). Dialogue with Nikolaus carries subtext but remains brief; no second living character appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("scent of diesel and salt," "wind-pressed ice"), but multiple scaffold patterns accumulate: "her gift—whispering to ghosts"; "She called it her Window of Connection. Strange how its fractures…"; "They leave echoes," she explained…though she always weaves truth carefully." Paraphrase loops appear ("stories waiting beneath the surface, more truths needing exposure") and thematic labels replace scene pressure in the final paragraph. Filter-verb stacks ("would sit," "had been changing," "would learn") dull immediacy in expository beats. The phrase "borrowed starlight" recurs three times without reweighting, and "candle-lit shrine" + "melted snow globe" are named repeatedly without evolving function.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The wreck-diver ghost whisperer + dream-infiltration premise combines familiar elements (medium, investigator) without a fresh synthesis—swap "dreams" for "séance" or "visions" and the arc remains unchanged. The melted snow globe as "Window of Connection" is a symbolic convenience introduced early but not transformed through character choice. Emotional territory (grief, justice, mediation) follows expected contours, and the ending offers closure without cost or surprise. The glacier shrine and borrowed-starlight tone add texture but do not heighten stakes or complicate the investigation in a non-obvious way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's occupation frames expectation and her decision to expose the truth drives the ending, but the key turn—implanting the investigation trigger—happens off-stage ("that night, Elara exposed the truth"). She observes, interprets, and mediates, yet no on-page choice narrows live options or trades one cost for another. Present in setup, development (Nikolaus encounter), and closure (tracking the echo), satisfying the gate model, but causal pressure and cost remain summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears in three beats: shrine description (setup), evening meditation ("flickered"), and closure ("glinting with captured light"). Its "warped glass" and "broken ship figurine" seed the "Window of Connection" motif, and the final mention charges the image with "borrowed starlight." However, the object is described and named but not handled or used to alter a tactic; it facilitates connection abstractly without constraining choice. Early signal, closure linkage, and lyric reprise support mid-band; lack of causal pressure and swappability (any mystical focus object) limit higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" is named once as "Window of Connection" (the globe) and echoed thematically in the final paragraph ("windows between worlds"). The concept frames the ghost-whisperer premise but does not shape a specific on-page tactic or force a trade-off. Setup is present (shrine paragraph), closure echo exists, but middle development is absent—no choice hinges on whether a window is open, closed, or fractured. Functional but replaceable with "bridge," "threshold," or "portal."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is stated once in exposition ("she always weaves truth carefully, never revealing too much") and enacted when Elara plants the truth in the director's dreams. However, the enactment is summarized, not dramatized—no scene shows her choosing what to reveal or withhold, and no visible cost or friction results from the constraint. Label-only mention in setup, implied use in the climax (off-page), absent from closure. No on-page tradeoff demonstrates the trait under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Expose" drives the story's resolution: Elara exposes the company's negligence by weaving it into the director's consciousness, triggering an investigation that will expose the truth to thirty-two families. The action is signaled in the dominant stake, enacted at the climax (though off-stage), and referenced at closure ("truths needing exposure"). However, the peak moment is summarized ("that night, Elara exposed the truth") rather than dramatized, and the action could be replaced with "reveal," "uncover," or "transmit" without altering structure. Present across all three gates, shapes two beats (Nikolaus's revelation, director's awakening), but summary-only execution and moderate swappability limit higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The method—analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams—is introduced in the third paragraph and provides the vehicle for both discovery (technician's dreamscape showing Nikolaus) and resolution (implanting truth in the director's dreams). Setup is clear, development shows Nikolaus appearing in dreams, and the method enables the climax. However, the mechanics remain vague ("sifted through sleeping minds"), and the method is told rather than shown constraining or complicating a choice. Functional across all three gates, but replaceable with "visions," "psychic link," or "spirit communication" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The candle-lit glacier shrine is described in detail (setup: "walls glowing with ethereal blue light," "flickering flames and eternal cold") and houses the snow globe. It reappears in the closure paragraph ("in her candle-lit shrine"). However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara could meditate and connect from any quiet space. The shrine provides atmosphere and anchors the mystical tone but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Present in setup and closure, absent from middle development beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To salvage something pure from the wreckage" is stated explicitly as Elara's motivation and recurs implicitly in the closure paragraph ("more stories waiting beneath the surface"). The desire drives the investigation—Elara pursues Nikolaus's truth to bring accountability to the families—and the ending gesture ("see you soon") affirms ongoing commitment. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through a conflicted choice or visible cost; no friction between "salvage" and another want appears on the page, and exhaustion is mentioned but does not alter tactics. Present in setup (stated), development (implicit in pursuit), and closure (restated), but lack of on-page friction and cost limits reach.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears three times: shrine description ("seemed borrowed from starlight itself"), spirit's departure ("dissolved into starlight borrowed and returned"), and final paragraph ("arctic night pulsed with stories"). The tone—ethereal, cold, liminal—is coherent through turns and modulates with the spirit's peaceful departure, charging the closure image with the motif's return. However, the phrase is repeated without evolving function, and tone remains static (mystical solemnity) rather than shifting under pressure. Closure linkage and lyric reprise support mid-band; lack of modulation and templated recurrence limit higher reach.</comment>
