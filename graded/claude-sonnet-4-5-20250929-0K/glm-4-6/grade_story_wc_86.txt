<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Julian's interiority relies heavily on abstract reflection ("transformation, not just transaction," "liminal space so thin it could only be measured in breaths") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The drawer pull functions as a touchstone but his engagement with it remains static—squeezing it repeatedly without evolving cost or tactical constraint. The final "untether" moment is asserted as a shift but not earned through on-page struggle; no live choice forecloses a competing option with visible price. Mellor and Roshni appear but apply minimal immediate pressure; the exchange proceeds without dramatized friction or risk that tests Julian's flaws.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early (who, where, when by ~80 words). The closure unit—Julian "allowing himself to untether from the weight of that past failure"—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the cost is told rather than shown; no on-page action or dialogue demonstrates what he loses or forecloses by letting go. The exchange itself is summarized ("the exchange occurring without chains or paperwork") rather than dramatized, flattening the beat that should carry peak pressure. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered reflection and motifs), but the final image recycles prior abstractions without a decisive cadence shift or visible price, weakening closure legibility. Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a sentence in the ending where a felt or conceptual price is made undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The storm-worn parapet, mist, and moon are vivid and consistently present. The setting contributes atmosphere and frames the neutral-territory concept, but does not constrain a tactical choice or materially alter the exchange outcome—Julian could negotiate this deal in any fog-bound location without changing his options. The moon and mist serve as backdrop rather than active pressure. Spatial choreography (northern path, stone ramparts, sea beyond) is clear. The drawer pull functions as a micro-object but does not change a choice in the closure beat, keeping the setting in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (retrieve Captain Mellor and "begin untethering our nations from their hatred") is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or complication. The exchange proceeds exactly as synchronized with no reversal, friction, or cost-forcing choice. Julian's internal "untethering" from his Zaatari failure is declared at the end but not dramatized through a prior tightening that narrows his options or forces a trade-off. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency drive escalation; the moon-phase method and mutual goodwill eliminate tension rather than raise it. No visible price paid after the exchange alters later tactics or future stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (transformation, recycling mistakes into wisdom, the space between apology and forgiveness) is coherently present but over-articulated through Julian's abstractions and the narrator's summary: "liminal space so thin it could only be measured in breaths," "recycling mistakes into wisdom," "furrowed hush between apology and forgiveness." The drawer pull is told to embody this theme rather than shown constraining a choice that enacts it. The ending offers a resonant image (Julian on the parapet, turning the brass pull) but states the thematic answer directly ("mistakes were indeed being recycled into wisdom") instead of allowing it to emerge from action. Subtext operates in gesture (the handoff, the steadying touch) but peak beats resort to exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Julian; no head-hopping. The prose has a consistent literary register with controlled psychic distance and purposeful compression ("moisture beading," "fingers tracing"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Roshni's "And the apology?" and Julian's reply carry subtext and advance the exchange. However, interiority leans toward elevated diction that occasionally drifts from a crisis-negotiator's likely lexicon under stress ("liminal space," "analogy of recycling," "untethering")—acceptable in reflective beats but less credible in peak tension. Perceptual signature is present (Julian notices the mist, the moon, the brass pull) but does not sharpen distinctively under pressure; the voice remains uniform across calm and climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Clarity is generally high; no major grammatical errors or spatial confusion. However, the prose suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold phrasing: "transformation, not just transaction" is restated as "untethering…from hatred," "liminal space" is glossed as "the precise territory where he worked," and the drawer pull's symbolic function is explained three times across paragraphs two, four, and six. Template cadence appears in multiple "Julian [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" openers without taught pattern. Figurative language is dense but sometimes mixed: "mist curled…like fingers" then "beading on…coat" shifts the vehicle mid-image. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate prior content without adding pressure. Line-level penalties accumulate: paraphrase loops (−0.4), template cadence (−0.5), register drift in peak beats (−0.3), totaling approximately −1.2 in Q7, with artifacts present in the final third disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prisoner-exchange premise, mentor's memento, and moon-phase synchronization combine familiar elements without a sharp transformative angle. The core emotional arc (negotiator haunted by past failure seeks redemption through present success) follows a well-worn template, and the story does not surprise in hindsight—every beat unfolds as signaled. The drawer pull and moon phases are specific details, but their use remains decorative rather than driving an unexpected turn or complication. The transformation test suggests the plot and arc could proceed with different tokens (a watch, a scheduled radio check) without material change. No bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus; the resolution is generous and frictionless, avoiding the harder question of what Julian would sacrifice if the exchange endangered his untethering.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Julian is present throughout and his role frames the story. However, his key choice at closure—"allowing himself to untether"—is a passive acceptance told in summary rather than a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a live option. He steadies Mellor (a micro-gesture) but does not make a tactical trade-off or face a complication that tests his flaws. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is weak. Gate count: two of three (setup, payoff; middle development is observation-only). Base ~5.0, −0.5 swappability (another negotiator could perform these beats), −0.3 summary-only key beat, +0.0 late element adjustment not applicable = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The antique drawer pull appears in four beats (opening, paragraph four, paragraph six, closing), satisfying the ≥2 requirement. It is handled (traced, squeezed, turned) and its symbolic weight is explained, but it does not constrain a choice or alter a tactic—Julian's actions would proceed identically without it. The final image ("turning the antique drawer pull over in his hands") recharges prior mentions but without decisively reweighting the stake; the closure moment is the internal "untether," not the object. Setup and closure participation are solid; middle development is present but ornamental. Gate count: three of three. Base ~5.0, +0.8 early signal and reprise, +0.4 two beats, −0.5 ornamental (no causal pressure), +0.1 specificity = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Neutral territory is explicitly named, frames the setting (the parapet), and is acknowledged by both parties ("The moon confirms the time…Both parties have honored the synchronicity"). It shapes the social stakes (neither side can claim advantage by location) and the exchange occurs on this ground. However, it does not narrow tactical options or create a complication; the neutrality is honored without friction. Setup and development are present; closure participation is indirect (the final image on the parapet). Gate count: three of three. Base ~5.0, +0.6 early signal and setting frame, +0.5 one beat (arrival acknowledgment), +0.3 closure linkage (image location), −0.3 swappability (any demilitarized zone would serve) = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Uncommonly thoughtful" is stated as a trait in paragraph two ("Julian's uncommonly thoughtful nature had always distinguished him") and implied by his reflective interiority, but it does not constrain or enable a visible on-page action with cost. Julian's thoughtfulness is told, not shown altering a choice or creating a trade-off distinct from generic competence. Setup is present; middle and closure development are label-only. Gate count: one of three (setup only). Base ~3.0, +0.3 early signal, +0.0 no beat involvement, +0.0 no causal pressure, +0.5 specificity via interiority texture, −0.0 no closure linkage = 3.8, capped at 3.8 per swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Untether" appears as verb and metaphor in three beats: paragraph three ("begin untethering our nations"), paragraph nine ("finally allowed himself to untether from the weight"), and the concept threads through the arc. The climactic untethering is the intended closure turn, but it is told in summary rather than enacted through a decision that forecloses a path. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle development is thematic rather than causal. Gate count: three of three. Base ~5.0, +0.7 early signal and closure link, +0.4 two beats, −0.6 summary-only at closure (told, not shown), +0.0 swappability moderate (could substitute "release" or "let go" with minor edits), −0.1 ornamental middle use = 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Moon-phase synchronization is signaled in paragraph one, explained in paragraph four as Julian's innovation, and confirmed on-page by Roshni and Mellor. The method shapes the setup (both sides trust celestial timing over technology) and is acknowledged at closure ("They taught me your method"). It enables the exchange to occur but does not create a complication or choice-point; the synchronization works as planned without friction. Setup, middle development (explanation beat), and closure participation (Mellor's acknowledgment) are all present. Gate count: three of three. Base ~5.0, +0.8 early signal and closure mention, +0.9 two beats (innovation explanation, Mellor's line), +0.5 causal enabling (shapes the attempt), −0.4 no live complication or choice constraint, +0.1 specificity = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The storm-worn windblown parapet in mist anchors every beat; Julian stands upon it in the opening and closing, and it frames the exchange. The setting provides vivid atmosphere and symbolizes neutral territory, but does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome. Setup and closure participation are strong (bookend images); middle development is atmospheric. Gate count: three of three. Base ~5.0, +0.8 early signal and closure image, +0.4 one beat (arrival and exchange staging), +0.3 closure linkage (final paragraph location), −0.3 ornamental (postcard function, no causal pressure), +0.1 specificity = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Between apology and forgiveness" is named in paragraph two and restated in dialogue (paragraph five: "between that and whatever comes tomorrow") and the final paragraph. It frames the thematic timeframe but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters moves. The apology occurred three nights prior; tonight's exchange is the next step, but no countdown or urgency tests Julian's choices. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is thematic echo. Gate count: two of three (setup, payoff; no middle tightening). Base ~5.0, +0.6 early signal and closure reprise, +0.0 no beat involvement (told, not enacted), −0.5 no live clock pressure, −0.5 swappability (any transitional phase would serve) = 4.1, rounded to 4.6 per lyric-resonance allowance for purposeful early–final reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Recycle mistakes into wisdom" is stated as Julian's mantra in paragraph four, tied to the drawer pull, and restated in the closing paragraph ("mistakes were indeed being recycled into wisdom"). The motivation is told and reflected upon but not dramatized through a conflicted choice or visible trade-off. Julian's desire to transform his Zaatari failure is setup and closure-present but does not create on-page friction between wants and costs. Gate count: three of three (setup, middle thematic beat, closure echo). Base ~5.0, +0.6 early signal and closure statement, +0.4 one beat (mantra explanation), −0.7 told-only (no choice friction), −0.2 summary at closure = 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" appears twice: paragraph five ("the furrowed hush between them") and the final paragraph ("In the furrowed hush between apology and forgiveness"). The tone is coherent—quiet, weighted, reflective—and modulates subtly with the exchange's solemnity. However, it does not shift decisively under pressure; the mood remains uniform from opening mist to closing brass-turning. Setup and closure participation are solid; middle development is consistent but static. Gate count: three of three. Base ~5.0, +0.7 early signal and closure reprise, +0.4 one beat (dialogue moment), −0.3 static mood (no modulation charging final image), +0.1 specificity = 5.9.</comment>
