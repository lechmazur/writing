<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to discover the orchard's resilience source is signaled early and drives her navigation, but her interiority remains abstract—"her mind racing with implications" tells rather than embodies thought under pressure. The arrow-tip discovery triggers a visible plant-growth surge, yet her response is largely observational; no micro-choice forces a trade-off between competing goods. The final "promise of resilience forged in chaos" reads as unearned epiphany rather than embodied cost, and the therapeutic framing ("a lesson," "a student of the echoes") flattens agency into passive reception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Kael, *Gleaner*, Xylos orchard, gravity inversion hour) land within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Causal: water-flow navigation → arrow-tip discovery → growth acceleration → central tree with tamed energy. One meaningful tightening occurs when the arrow tip hums and the sapling surges, narrowing Kael's tactical focus to the orchard's core. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—"the orchard had taken a wound and turned it into strength"—but the cost remains conceptual and off-page ("vulnerability" declared, not dramatized). The ~120-word orientation window is met, so no Orientation Test penalty applies, but the closure cost is asserted rather than felt on the page, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The floating rock arches, inverted rivers, and bioluminescent flora anchor spatial choreography cleanly. The arrow tip embedded in a boulder and the central tree with pulsing roots constrain Kael's path, and the "sweet decay and new growth" olfactory detail filters through her mission focus. The gravity inversion timeframe shapes urgency ("the whirling silence returned as the gravity shift neared its end"), and the *Gleaner*'s anchoring maneuver reflects lived-in piloting. The final tree "swaying not in wind but in rhythm with the echoes" charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the orchard's resilience source—is signaled early and pursued through navigation, extraction, and core investigation. One on-page tightening occurs when the arrow tip's energy surge forces Kael to follow water flows to the convergence point, narrowing her tactical options. However, no live trade-off or visible loss alters her approach; the "fragile equilibrium" is mentioned but never tested by a choice that risks failure. The ending declares the orchard's vulnerability without dramatizing a cost Kael pays or forecloses, leaving escalation conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of resilience-as-learned-adaptation emerges from the arrow tip/tree symbiosis, and the "whirling silence" motif bookends the piece with purposeful recurrence. Yet the final paragraph telegraphs the thesis directly: "she carried a lesson," "a promise of resilience forged in chaos," and "without repeating the arrow's mistake" read as explicit thematic statements rather than resonant images. The orchard's "violent past" and the protagonist's shift from pilot to "student of the echoes" are asserted rather than earned through on-page friction, and the moral ("wield their wisdom without repeating the arrow's mistake") arrives as platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Kael's sensory and tactical focus. Perceptual signature is present: "the gathering of echoes was most pronounced," "her gloved fingers tightened," and the water-flow navigation filter perception through her piloting expertise. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("agronomists across the galaxy," "a testament to survival written in stolen energy") that feels authorial rather than character-specific under pressure. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The final "Kael smiled—her quest had just begun" reads as tidy closure rather than lived-in stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose carries moderate information density and clear spatial choreography, but several patterns dull momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "the orchard's resilience baffled agronomists" / "the orchard's resilience wasn't innate—it was learned" restates the same concept across beats. Template cadence runs in the middle: "The air smelled... / As she extracted... / The attribute was undeniable... / The echoes grew louder..." stacks filter-adjacent constructions without variation. The final third deploys stock metaphors ("a testament to survival written in stolen energy," "a harbinger of growth and consequence") and thesis-like summary ("she carried more than an artifact—she carried a lesson") that replace scene pressure with explanation. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, plus −0.3 for stock phrasing in the closure zone, totaling −1.1 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The orchard-planet premise with gravity inversion and floating arches offers visual freshness, and the arrow-tip catalyst provides a concrete mechanism for resilience. However, the emotional arc—lone explorer discovers ancient artifact explaining ecosystem mystery—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived cost or moral calculus. The "stolen energy" metaphor and the pilot-becomes-student framing read as stock SF tropes executed competently but without a non-obvious synthesis. The final "her quest had just begun" ending is a genre placeholder that avoids risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's choices—adjusting harness, navigating by water flow, extracting the arrow tip, following echoes to the core—drive all major beats and the closure sequence. She appears in the first sentence and her decisions narrow tactical options (anchoring to the boulder, securing the artifact, ascending). However, her agency at closure is observational ("she glanced back") rather than a choice that forecloses a path, and her shift to "student of the echoes" is declared intent, not on-page decision with cost. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff (partial: present but not causally active). Two gates met → eligible to ~6.0; causal pressure +0.9; closure linkage (observational) +0.4; swappability (generic explorer role) −0.5. Total ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The broken arrow tip appears at mid-story ("a shattered arrow tip embedded in a floating boulder"), is extracted with embodied action ("a jolt ran through her—the metal hummed"), triggers the sapling's growth surge, and reappears in the containment unit at closure ("the arrow tip glowed faintly"). It shapes two beats (discovery/extraction, core investigation) and carries symbolic weight at the ending. Setup (mid-story) −0.3; two beats +0.9; closure linkage +0.7; causal pressure (enables growth acceleration discovery) +0.8; specificity +0.5. Total ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"A gathering of echoes" is introduced early ("the gathering of echoes was most pronounced"), recurs at mid-story ("the echoes grew louder"), and returns at closure ("in rhythm with the echoes"). However, it functions as atmospheric motif rather than a force that constrains choice or alters tactics. The echoes "recognize" the artifact and "converge," but Kael's navigation follows water flow, not echo-pattern. Setup ✓, Development (ornamental), Payoff (thematic only). Two gates (setup, payoff) → eligible to ~6.0; no causal pressure −0.8; ornamental use −0.7; lyric reprise (early seed → final image) +0.5. Total ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plant-growth acceleration is demonstrated on-page when the arrow tip causes a sapling to surge ("its leaves unfurling as if time had accelerated"). This visible trait confirms the artifact's power and motivates Kael's pivot to the orchard core, where the central tree's pulsing roots reveal long-term adaptation. The attribute enables two beats (discovery, core investigation) and underwrites the closure's "stolen energy" thesis. Setup (mid-story) −0.3; two beats +0.9; causal pressure (narrows search to core) +1.0; closure linkage (tree's adaptation) +0.9; specificity (unique catalyst) +0.6; cost (orchard vulnerability declared) +0.3. Total ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Discover" frames Kael's mission from the opening ("she intended to discover its source") and structures all major beats: navigating to the arches, discovering the arrow tip, discovering the growth-acceleration effect, discovering the central tree's adaptation. The final "The pilot discovered then that the orchard's resilience wasn't innate" is the closure pivot. Setup ✓, Development ✓✓, Payoff ✓. Three gates → eligible ≥6.1; three beats +1.4; causal pressure (each discovery narrows options) +1.2; closure linkage (final realization) +1.5; irreplaceability (mission verb) +0.6. Total ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Water-flow navigation is introduced early ("navigating by water flow, following the inverted rivers") and reappears at mid-story ("she followed the water flow toward the orchard's core"). It guides Kael's path but does not constrain a choice with cost—she could plausibly navigate by visual landmarks or sensors. The method enables spatial progression but remains interchangeable with other piloting techniques. Setup ✓, Development (functional), Payoff (absent). Two gates → eligible to ~6.0; one beat (early) +0.4; causal pressure (weak: enables but does not constrain) +0.3; swappability −0.6. Total ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches anchors every scene: Kael drifts between arches, anchors the *Gleaner* to a boulder, and ascends through the canopy at closure. The arches supply verticality and navigation challenge, and the central tree is spatially located "at the center of the arches." The setting pressures piloting choices (anchoring, careful descent) and charges the final image. Setup ✓, Development ✓, Payoff ✓. Three gates → eligible ≥6.1; two beats +0.9; causal pressure (anchoring required, fragile equilibrium) +0.8; closure linkage (tree at center, canopy exit) +1.0; specificity (floating arches unique) +0.7. Total ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The gravity-inversion hour is signaled in the opening ("this hour on the planet Xylos") and returns near closure ("the whirling silence returned as the gravity shift neared its end," "the gravity settled"). However, the clock is not tracked visibly—no countdown or urgency-driven choice. The timeframe provides atmospheric frame rather than tightening pressure. Setup ✓, Development (absent: no mid-scene time check), Payoff (atmospheric return). Two gates (setup, payoff) → eligible to ~6.0; ornamental use −0.7; lyric reprise +0.4; no causal pressure (no choice altered by clock) −0.8. Total ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To find the source of resilience" is stated early ("she intended to discover its source") and drives every beat: water-flow navigation, arrow-tip extraction, core investigation, final realization. The motivation is consistent and pursued without wavering, but no internal friction tests it—Kael never weighs abandonment, risk, or competing desire. Setup ✓, Development ✓✓, Payoff ✓. Three gates → eligible ≥6.1; three beats +1.4; causal pressure (guides all choices) +1.0; closure linkage (final discovery) +0.9; no friction (told-only desire) −0.6; no visible cost (mission succeeds cleanly) −0.4. Total ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Whirling silence" appears in the opening ("the whirling silence that only this hour on the planet Xylos could bring"), at mid-story ("in the quiet chaos"), and returns at closure ("the whirling silence returned," "the whirling silence of space"). The phrase evokes paradox (motion/stillness) and modulates from atmospheric to cosmic scale, charging the final image. However, the tone does not shift with pressure—every beat maintains the same meditative register. Setup ✓, Development (static), Payoff ✓. Two gates → eligible to ~6.0; lyric reprise (early → ending with scale shift) +0.6; closure linkage (final line reweights) +0.7; static mood (no modulation under discovery pressure) −0.5; ornamental middle use −0.4. Total ~5.7.</comment>
