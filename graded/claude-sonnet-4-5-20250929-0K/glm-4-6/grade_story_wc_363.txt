<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reach her brother is declared but never tested by on-page choices that force trade-offs. Her "wistful" quality and the brother's disappearance are told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or specific memory that shapes present action. The weaving sequence describes effort ("fingers bleeding") but never shows what she risks or forecloses—no decision point where she must choose between competing goods. Interiority relies on abstract phrases ("wistful resolve," "latent sacrifice") rather than concrete thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The orientation test fails: "forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest" and "loom spinner" are labels without spatial or temporal anchors by 120 words, and the disorientation does not pay off at closure—apply −0.4. The closure unit is a Charged Poise attempt (she "threaded a needle through its seams," prepared to weave again), but the cost is asserted ("sacrifice was latent," "trembling hands") rather than shown as a forfeited option or altered relationship. The piece cycles through weaving, collapse, rising, and re-commitment without a causal because/therefore link or a meaningful tightening that narrows her choices. Drive lens unclear: lyric texture suggests Accumulative, but no density increase or pattern break reweights the stake at the end—apply lens-ambiguity penalty −0.4 and cap all categories at 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The orchard and bamboo forest are named repeatedly but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—pure postcard description. The loom appears in nearly every paragraph yet remains abstract; no detail about warps, shuttle, or thread tension shapes her weaving tactics. The jigsaw edges and amber bead are handled, but their physical properties (weight, texture, how they attach to the loom) are omitted, leaving the mechanics vague. Spatial choreography is clean within the single location, preventing a lower score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—carry a message to her brother—is declared early but never faces an on-page test that forces Elara to choose between competing options or pay a visible price. The story loops through weaving → collapse → rising without escalation: each cycle restates effort but does not narrow possibilities or raise cost. The jigsaw edges and amber bead glow and pulse, but these are effects, not obstacles or trade-offs. No reversal or tightening choice alters her tactics; the "message" is complete in one uninterrupted attempt with no friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme—connection across separation, sacrifice—is declared in abstract labels ("latent sacrifice," "wistful resolve," "raveling silence") rather than emerging from concrete events. The amber bead recurs but its meaning does not shift; it sparkles at the start and remains "a silent promise" at the end without reweighting prior material. The final paragraph offers a thematic statement ("The raveling silence would not claim her, not while she had a thread left to spin") in place of a resonant image. No earned insight arises from the weaving act itself; the orchard "breathed with her" is metaphor without consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice lacks a perceptual signature: diction remains uniform whether describing her interior state, the orchard, or the weaving, with no modulation under pressure. Figurative language is dense but generic ("threads of time," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "woven void") and could belong to any narrator. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she thought," "she felt") stack in mid-pressure beats without voice motivation. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance stays consistent but does not vary purposefully to support emotional turns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "The raveling silence lingered, but now it held a thread of hope, a spark in the darkness" immediately follows "she would not falter. The message had been sent, and she would wait, weaving, until the silence unraveled completely." Template-cadence runs appear in the final third ("The stoically sparkling bead was her compass, the puzzle edges her map, and the loom her voice" / "The hush of time's unraveling tapestry was no longer a barrier, but a path")—three parallel constructions in adjacent lines, apply −0.6. Stock metaphor strings ("threads of time," "fabric of existence," "tapestry") reduce specificity. Figurative density in most sentences of high-pressure beats ("The orchard blurred, the bamboo dissolving into mist as her loom became a vessel between realms") without pattern-teaching, apply −0.5. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disqualify 9+ globally and escalate Q7 penalty to −1.2 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The premise—weaver sends message across mystical distance using amber bead and puzzle edges—is a stock fantasy template (artisan + talismanic object + impossible task). The loom-as-portal and "raveling silence" metaphors are familiar from myth and YA fantasy without fresh inflection. The puzzle edges arrive from a rummage sale with no prior setup, reading as convenience rather than earned synthesis. No transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; the story could be recast with a painter and canvas or musician and instrument with no structural change—apply derivative-premise adjustment −0.8 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara (wistful loom spinner) is present throughout and the weaving action occurs, but her choices do not create turns—she begins weaving, completes the message, collapses, and rises to weave again in a loop without friction. "Wistful" is a label mentioned twice ("wistful loom spinner," "wistful resolve") but does not constrain her approach or generate internal conflict. Setup present, closure cameo present, but no middle development beat where her character trait alters tactics. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle development gate). Ornamental trait label −0.3, summary-only involvement (no decision shown) −0.3, swappable with "determined" or "devoted" −0.5. Rounding down: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Tree sap amber bead appears in paragraph one (held in palm, "warm to the touch"), pulse-aligns with puzzle edges mid-scene, flares/dims at closure, and remains on the loom in final paragraph—four distinct beats, +0.9. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.9 (sits on loom in final image, reweighted as "testament" and "compass"). However, the bead's "warmth" and "pulse" are effects, not mechanics that constrain her weaving; she never chooses to use it differently or pays a cost tied to it specifically. Swappable with any glowing talisman −0.5. Rounding down: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Core concept "a raveling silence" is named in paragraph two and recurs six times, including final paragraph. It frames the barrier ("woven void that separated worlds") and the ending claims she "threaded a needle through its seams." Setup present, closure reprise present. However, it never shapes an on-page tactic: Elara does not navigate the silence differently after encountering it, nor does it impose a cost that alters her choice. It functions as thematic metaphor rather than obstacle. Lyric reprise reweights the stake nominally (silence now holds "a thread of hope"), eligible up to ~6.3, but swappability (could be "consuming fog" or "endless void") and lack of causal pressure lower the score. Two gates (setup, payoff) allow ~6.0 ceiling; ornamental metaphor −0.5, theme-only claim −0.4, summary linkage (not dramatized pressure) −0.3. Rounding: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Attribute "stoically sparkling" modifies the amber bead three times as a descriptor. It never constrains an action: the bead's sparkle does not cost her anything or enable a tactic she couldn't otherwise perform. Label-only mentions with no on-page cost, trend low per guidance. Present (setup + closure cameo) but ornamental throughout −0.8, swappable with "faintly glowing" or "steadily shining" −0.5. Rounding: 2.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Action "recommence" appears explicitly in paragraph four ("she had to recommence her work") and again in the penultimate paragraph ("as she recommenced her work"). The first instance launches the weaving sequence; the second caps the closure. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0. However, the action itself is generic: "recommence" could be swapped with "resume," "begin again," or "return to" without structural change −0.5. The story does not explore *why* restarting carries unique cost compared to first attempts. Closure participation keeps it in mid-band. Rounding: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Method "through jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box" is introduced in paragraph five (search at forest's edge, found edges, pieced blindly, formed border around loom). They glow and complete a circle at the climax, then lie scattered in final paragraph. Setup present (though late, ~40% mark, cap 4.6 applies), middle beat (bordering the loom enables the weaving), and closure participation (edges "fulfilled" and remain as artifact). The rummage-sale origin is convenient (no prior mention of needing them) but the mechanics—edges as border, glowing to complete circle—do matter to the weaving sequence. Late introduction −0.3, resolves a problem not primed −0.7 (she didn't seek them; they appeared when needed), swappable with "enchanted frame" or "ritual circle" −0.4. Three gates met (late setup, middle, payoff) allows ≥6.1 eligibility, but frictions pull down. Rounding: 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Setting "forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest" is named in opening line and recurs in final third. The orchard "blurred" during weaving and "returned to focus" after collapse, then "breathed with her" at closure. Setup present +0.5, closure reprise +0.7. However, the setting never pressures a choice or supplies a resource: the orchard and bamboo are backdrop, not constraint. The loom could be anywhere; no detail about the orchard's layout, fruit, soil, or bamboo density alters her tactics. Lyric reprise at end reweights tone nominally but does not change options. Two gates (setup, payoff) allow ~6.0 ceiling; ornamental postcard description −0.6, swappability (could be "abandoned garden" or "hidden grove") −0.5. Rounding: 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Timeframe "through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" is a metaphoric phrase recurring five times. It does not track clock time or impose a deadline. Elara weaves "for the first time in years" (paragraph eleven), but this retrospective claim does not tighten present decisions. The phrase serves thematic texture, not escalation. No setup as a constraint, no middle pressure from time running out, closure reprise as metaphor only. Ornamental metaphor −0.6, no causal pressure −0.8, swappable with "through eternity's fraying threads" −0.4. Rounding: 3.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to carry a message across impossible distance" is stated in paragraph three ("Her motivation burned within her") and drives the entire weaving sequence. Setup +0.6, middle beats (weaving the word "wait," casting threads as memories) +0.9, closure (message sent, "she had carried her message") +1.0. The motivation is dramatized through action (weaving, bleeding fingers, collapse) but lacks internal conflict—no competing desire or cost that forces a trade-off. She pursues the goal without friction or doubt. Told intensity ("burned within her") rather than embodied friction −0.5, no on-page moment where she must choose this over something else she wants −0.4. Rounding: 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Tone "latent sacrifice" is named once ("Her sacrifice was latent, unspoken") and implied throughout via "bleeding fingers," "collapsed," "trembling hands," "cost of such impossible distance." The tone of endurance and price pervades from early beats (silent loom, oppressive quiet) through closure (orchard as "battleground," threads as prayer). Setup +0.5, modulates with weaving pressure +0.4, charges final image (bead as "testament," hands trembling) +0.8. However, "latent" implies hidden cost, yet the narrative repeatedly declares the sacrifice in summary rather than showing a visible forfeiture. Tone coherence across turns is present but static in mood (somber throughout, no modulation to lightness or doubt). Theme-label claim ("latent sacrifice") stated rather than embodied −0.5, summary assertion of cost −0.4. Rounding: 4.3.</comment>
