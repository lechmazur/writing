<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clearly established (need to dull specific memories), but his actions largely unfold without embodied contradiction or struggle. The gift of tasting memories and emotional contagion remains label-only until the closure; no on-page micro-choice tests these traits under pressure before the pavilion scene. Interior texture defaults to stock phrasing ("heart hammered against his ribs like a trapped bird") and therapy-adjacent exposition ("desperate need to sandpaper rough memories"). The final return grants relief without a visible cost or foreclosed path—his gift remains, the pain is dulled, but no dilemma or renunciation accompanies the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early; the drive lens reads Causal (goal pursuit → method → subsumption → relief). The closure—Kael absorbs the pavilion's remorse and his specific memories dull—lands on the page, but the cost is underspecified: he can now cook without tasting his parents' deaths, yet the text declares "emotional contagion in his touch had lessened" without dramatizing what that loss or change forecloses. The sequence is motivated (gift → dreams → rain → tidal pool → pavilion → absorption → return), yet the middle lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; Kael's descent proceeds without a second decision or complication that narrows options. Closure fits Decisive Change structurally, but the "felt cost" test is not satisfied on the page—relief is granted, trade-offs are asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The desert-fortress-after-rain frame is vivid and anchored early. Sensory details—"rain-slickened stones still weeping moisture," tidal pools as star mirrors, bioluminescent coral—are purposeful and POV-filtered. The pavilion's icebound coral columns and the hexagonal ripple constrain Kael's method (he follows anomalous wave patterns), meeting the micro-setting standard. The final return to "fortress baked in the returning desert heat" recharges the opening image with thematic weight. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the setting supplies the resource (rain-formed pools) that enables the goal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escape unbearable memory through subsumption—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, the escalation consists of a single linear sequence: fortress → tidal pool → pavilion → absorption → return, with no on-page reversal, complication, or choice that narrows options mid-journey. The rain creates access, but luck (not protagonist choice) opens the path; Kael's agency is decision to descend, not a trade-off or sacrifice that alters tactics. At closure, the relief is granted without a visible price—"emotional contagion…had lessened," but no capability, relationship, or future option is demonstrably foreclosed on the page. The lens is Causal, but the tightening required for ≥8.0 (a live option foreclosed or a trade-off forced) does not appear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—carrying inherited pain, the cost of numbing specific agony through shared sorrow—emerges from the premise and closure image. The "sturdy exterior…betrayed by brittle fractures" metaphor explicitly links fortress and protagonist, crossing into on-the-nose symbolism. The final line, "cook for others without serving his own pain as secret ingredients," lands as direct theme statement rather than earned resonance. Backstory reflection (the coral pavilion dream, father's fall, mother's death whispers) occupies substantial word count but remains summary; no on-page micro-choice tests these memories before the pavilion. The concept of "stored remorse" is vivid, yet the thematic payoff defaults to relief-without-ambiguity, missing the complexity or counter-reading the rubric rewards.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout. Voice modulates with emotional intensity—sensory lushness in the pavilion scene, tighter syntax during Kael's descent—without head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature is present: a chef who tastes memory would notice "salt on his tongue" and "bitterness." However, diction occasionally drifts into stock lyricism ("heart hammered against his ribs like a trapped bird," "brittle fractures spreading through its ancient mortar") that reads generic rather than character-particular. No dialogue on the page; voice remains internally consistent but lacks the idiosyncratic texture that would push into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear with purposeful sensory detail and no major grammatical errors. Rhythm varies, and paragraph structure supports scene progression. However, figurative density is high in expository passages without pattern-teaching: "remorse collected like seafoam," "columns of regret reached," "liquid mercury." The fortress-as-Kael metaphor ("sturdy exterior…brittle fractures") is over-explained rather than trusted to image. Minor loops appear: "knowing his touch could transfer emotions" and later "emotional contagion in his touch," "desperate need to sandpaper rough memories with coarser ones" restates the same mechanism. Template cadence in backstory blocks ("He dreamed nightly…," "His motivation drove him…") flattens momentum. Peak beats (pavilion discovery, absorption) are vivid, but expository scaffolding before and after them accumulates to −0.8 total within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The chef-with-sensory-gift and underground-repository-of-emotion premises echo familiar fantasy templates. The combination—tasting memories + coral pavilion beneath desert sands + stored remorse—is specific and atmospheric, yet the emotional arc (haunted chef seeks magical relief and finds it) resolves without transformation or cost that surprises. The hexagonal ripple detail and icebound coral imagery are vivid, but the story does not subvert the quest-for-healing frame or follow an unexpected implication. The pavilion grants exactly what Kael sought with no ironic reweighting or complication at closure. Transformation test: swap "chef/taste" for "painter/see" and "coral pavilion" for "crystal archive," and the arc holds unchanged—indicating insufficient synthesis beyond the surface elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's chef identity and memory-tasting gift are established early and frame his motivation. However, the gift does not constrain an on-page choice or create a beat-level complication; it remains backdrop until the pavilion, where absorption of remorse dulls his specific memories. The return image shows him slicing vegetables and kneading bread without the old bitterness, a functional payoff but not a causal driver of the middle journey. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with thematic linkage, but no middle beat where the trait forces a tactical decision or trade-off. Swappability is moderate—another sensory curse (e.g., hearing ghosts in ingredients) could serve similarly with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The coral icebound pavilion is seeded in the opening dream sequence, described in detail during Kael's descent, and supplies the climactic absorption beat. It constrains method (accessible only after rain, found via tidal pool analysis) and its "columns of regret" and "liquid mercury" remorse pool are specific, irreplaceable images. The pavilion appears in three beats (dream, discovery, absorption) and charges the closure—Kael's relief is possible only because of this location's stored remorse. However, the pavilion does not resist or complicate; it grants exactly what Kael seeks without a second cost or surprise, limiting its causal pressure. All three gates met, strong specificity, closure linkage clear, but swappability test: another magical repository (e.g., a tower of frozen tears) could function with moderate rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stored remorse is the pavilion's defining property and the mechanism of Kael's relief. The concept is signaled early ("place where remorse collected like seafoam") and drives the goal: subsume accumulated sorrow to dull his own. At closure, "histories of hundreds flooded his senses" and "each memory sandpapered down" show the concept in action. However, the stored remorse does not create a dilemma or alter tactics—Kael touches it and receives the promised effect without complication. One key turn (absorption) is shaped by this concept, meeting mid-band criteria, but the concept does not constrain or pressure a second choice. Setup, payoff present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Emotional contagion through touch is introduced in the opening ("his touch could transfer emotions…another burden") and mentioned once mid-journey ("knowing his emotional contagion might alert those searching for him"). At closure, the text states it "had lessened, now merely tinged with shared humanity." The trait appears in setup and payoff but never constrains an on-page action with visible cost—no beat where Kael avoids or risks touch, no moment where contagion alerts pursuers or complicates the descent. Label-only treatment; easily removed with no structural break. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff summary), but no middle beat and no causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Subsume" is the story's pivotal action: Kael's descent, the pavilion discovery, and the absorption beat all build toward this verb. The climactic moment—"He needed only touch it, to absorb the accumulated sorrows…his fingers brushed against the cold surface"—is the story's decisive change. The action is seeded early ("by subsuming the stored remorse"), pursued through the tidal pool and descent, and completed on-page with immediate consequence (memories dull, contagion lessens). All three gates met; irreplaceable (the story's goal is to subsume, not merely visit or witness). Causally central, closure-defining. One micro deduction for the passive second half of the absorption paragraph ("histories…flooded," "merged") where agency briefly blurs, but the act itself drives the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Analyzing tidal pool formations is the method by which Kael finds the pavilion entrance. It is taught in exposition ("passed down through generations…analyze the tidal pool formations and follow those whose ripples didn't match the wind's direction") and executed on-page ("Kael knelt beside the largest pool…When he spotted it, the perfect hexagonal ripple that defied physics"). The method is specific, irreplaceable (random wandering would not work), and shapes one key beat (discovery). However, it appears only in the middle; no setup before the midpoint and no reprise or complication at closure. Two-gate partial (middle, no early seed or ending charge). Functional but not deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The desert fortress after rain is the story's spatial anchor and opening image. Rain creates the tidal pools that enable Kael's descent, and the fortress's "rain-slickened stones" and "brittleness" mirror Kael's state. At closure, "The fortress baked in the returning desert heat, its sturdy exterior once again masking its brittleness—just like Kael" reprises the opening metaphor with added resonance. The setting supplies the resource (rain-formed access) that makes the quest possible. However, the fortress itself does not constrain a mid-journey choice or force a tactical adjustment; it is frame and metaphor rather than active pressure. Three-gate presence (setup, middle resource, ending reprise), thematic charge clear, but causal role is enabler, not obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"At the close of an unspoken dream" appears in the opening as the moment Kael wakes with salt on his tongue, signaling the nightly pattern. The phrase recurs conceptually ("nightly dreams of the coral icebound pavilion") but does not tighten decision or create urgency. No on-page clock pressure; Kael descends when rain falls, but the timeframe does not narrow options or force a trade-off. The "close of a dream" frame is atmospheric but ornamental—removing it would not alter causality or stakes. Setup only; no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—to sandpaper rough memories with coarser ones, to dull specific pain through overwhelming sorrow—is established early and drives every beat: standing at the ramparts, descending to the pools, seeking the pavilion, absorbing the remorse. The motivation is contradictory in a productive way (seeking pain to escape pain) and shapes the climactic choice. At closure, the goal is achieved: "he could slice vegetables without tasting the moment his father fell." However, no on-page friction between want and cost appears—Kael pursues the goal without hesitation, second thought, or sacrifice that tests his commitment. Three-gate presence (setup, middle pursuit, payoff), strong specificity, but the lack of a complicating choice or visible renunciation caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sturdy brittle" is explicitly metaphorized in the opening ("The fortress had withstood countless sieges, yet its sturdy exterior was betrayed by brittle fractures…much like his own facade") and reprised at closure ("The fortress baked…its sturdy exterior once again masking its brittleness—just like Kael"). The tone of endurance-masking-fragility coheres through the piece: Kael's trembling hands, the pavilion's frozen coral in desert heat, the sand giving way beneath his knees. The tone modulates appropriately—lyrical in the pavilion, tighter during descent—and charges the final image. However, the explicit statement of the metaphor in both opening and close reduces subtext and overexplains the tone rather than trusting image alone. Three-gate presence, coherent modulation, closure linkage, but directness lowers the band.</comment>
