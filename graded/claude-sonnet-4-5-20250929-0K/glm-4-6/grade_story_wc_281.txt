<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is established as an "affectionate skeptic" with a clear goal (map and silence the psychic static), but her interior remains abstract—she processes the telepathic intrusion through metaphor and art-project logic rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The somatic markers (chest tightening, thumb twitch) are mentioned but never dramatized as competing with her creative flow or forcing a micro-choice that costs her something on the page. The final shift to "cartographer of the soul" reads as declared insight rather than earned renunciation, and no visible path is foreclosed with cost—she gains mastery without losing control, safety, or a prior stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elara moves through the studio, layering colored light in response to phantom emotions until the chaos "organizes." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the noise doesn't vanish but becomes legible architecture), but cost is asserted rather than shown—no specific choice, tool, or relationship is sacrificed to achieve this order. The orientation is prompt (who, where, what by the opening), and the single-scene continuous structure fits the length, but the ending reconfigures meaning through summary ("she had devised a language") rather than a charged image or action that makes the price undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The light painting studio is vividly anchored with LED strips, prisms, adjustable arms, and the muscovite sliver at center; spatial choreography is clear throughout her movement. Sensory detail (diffuse glow, color bleeding, fractally precise rainbows) is selective and filtered through Elara's artistic POV. The studio enables her method (light painting) and the final image (crystalline rainbows), charging the closure, which pushes the score into the 7+ band despite the lack of constraint—nothing in the environment forces a trade-off or narrows her options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—filter the psychic noise before it erodes her—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: Elara executes her plan without friction, setback, or a moment where the somatic markers overwhelm her control and force a costly choice. The "hours bled into one another" compresses the work, and the tightening ("the noise didn't vanish, but it organized") is declared rather than dramatized through a specific failed attempt or renunciation. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the story offers summary of effort rather than an on-page escalation that narrows options or reveals a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—translation of chaos into legible architecture, the artist as cartographer of collective emotion—emerges from image and action (the light-painting map, the muscovite refraction) rather than thesis statement. The final image (fractally precise rainbows) reweights the opening static shock with resonance, and the "willowglass hope, brittle and flexible at once" avoids tidy moral. However, "she had forged something new from the wreckage" and "a visual symphony of the human condition" edge toward meta-commentary, and the thematic question (how to live with unwanted connection) is answered more through assertion than a non-literal, charged image that holds ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (artistic, metaphor-laden, attuned to light and pattern). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("cartographer of the soul," "willowglass hope"), though some phrases ("the storm she'd created," "beautiful, terrible architecture") drift toward elevated register without stress justification. No dialogue present. Psychic distance remains close, and the prose reflects Elara's interiority without filter-verb stacks, but the voice converges toward summary abstraction in the final third rather than staying rooted in sensory immediacy under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the story exhibits paraphrase loops: "The pill had promised unity but delivered a discordant chorus" is restated as "telepathy pill had been a catastrophe, a corporate nightmare" without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear in the opening ("It had been three weeks… It was fractally precise… She was, by nature") and the closure sequence ("She had devised… She had forged…"). Stock metaphor appears ("storm of empathy," "pocket of stillness") and "fractally precise" is repeated three times across the text without evolving meaning. These artifacts dull momentum in the final third, triggering a −0.8 deduction in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The telepathy-pill-recall premise is derivative (widely used in speculative templates), but the light-painting-as-filter angle offers a specific synthesis. Elara's method (somatic markers → colored light) is fresh in execution, and the muscovite sliver as anchor provides a concrete particular. However, the emotional arc (chaos → mastery) follows a predictable template without risk: Elara succeeds without cost, and the ending ("breathtaking," "soaring") wraps the transformation in stock triumph language. The premise transformation is present but not deep enough to fully escape the template's gravitational pull.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her skepticism is mentioned, but her choices (placing the sliver, moving through the studio, casting colors) are execution of a plan rather than decisions that create key turns. No moment where her affection or skepticism generates friction or reversal—she observes her own process and succeeds without a choice that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The muscovite sliver is handled in three beats: opening (traced), middle (placed at workspace center), and closure (picked up, "testament to complexity"). It anchors the light-painting setup and refracts the final rainbows, charging the ending image. However, its properties (fractally precise layers) do not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—it functions as symbolic anchor rather than causal instrument, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The telepathy pill recall is the inciting premise (static shock, psychic residue) and shapes the dominant stake (filter the noise). It appears in opening exposition and closing reflection ("telepathy pill had been a catastrophe"), framing the problem Elara solves. However, the recall itself does not alter on-page tactics or generate a mid-scene complication—it is backstory that primes the goal rather than a live mechanic that constrains her choices during the light painting.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" is applied three times: to the muscovite's layers, to the patterns of overheard thoughts, and to the final rainbows. It functions as thematic echo and metaphor but never constrains or enables an action with cost—Elara does not choose a fractal approach over another method, and the trait remains descriptive rather than tactical. Label-only use across all mentions.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Devise" appears explicitly ("she needed to devise a method") and drives the middle beat (she devises the light-painting protocol). The final reflection ("she had devised a language") reprises it at closure, reweighting the stake. However, the devising is told in summary rather than dramatized through trial, error, or a specific trade-off that tests the method's mechanics, limiting causal pressure to setup and thematic payoff without middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Somatic markers are signaled early (tightening chest, thumb twitch as "landmarks") and named as the translation mechanism ("wherever a somatic marker flared… she would cast a specific color"). They shape her protocol and reappear in the middle ("movements becoming a fluid, instinctual response to phantom sensations"). However, the markers are never dramatized in real-time—we do not see a specific inhale or chill trigger a color choice with cost or hesitation, so the method remains conceptual rather than tactically tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The light painting studio is present throughout, anchoring who/where in the opening and supplying the tools (LED strips, prisms, adjustable arms) that enable Elara's method. The studio's diffuse glow and shadow-dance texture charge the atmosphere, and the final image (rainbows skittering across walls) is inseparable from the space. The setting does not constrain a choice (she has all the tools she needs without friction), but it participates causally in setup, development, and closure, meeting all three gates and scoring in the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the static shock" is signaled in the opening ("three weeks since") and the closing ("after the static shock's chaos, she would impose order"). The timeframe establishes backstory and frames the present action, but it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—the hours "bled into one another" without urgency or a deadline that alters Elara's tactics. Setup and payoff present; middle development (timed pressure) absent, capping score at ~4.6 per gate model, reduced for swappability (any recovery window would function identically).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden pathways" is stated as Elara's goal in the opening and reprised at closure ("She could see the hidden pathways now"). The motivation drives her choice to create the light map and is tested in the middle (exhausting, profound work), meeting all three gates. However, the desire is never conflicted—she does not weigh illumination against rest, safety, or another want, and no on-page cost dramatizes the friction between the goal and its price. Functional across beats but without the tension required for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope, brittle and flexible at once" appears once in the final paragraph, naming the tone rather than embodying it across turns. The story maintains a hopeful, determined register throughout (Elara moves from strain to mastery), and the closing image (spirit soaring, breathtaking) matches the declared tone. However, tone does not modulate with pressure—no moment where hope fractures under the psychic noise and must be rebuilt—so the effect is stable mood rather than a charged tonal arc. Late signal, lyric reprise at closure, no middle modulation: scores in the 5.5–6.3 lyric-resonance band.</comment>
