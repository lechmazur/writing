<comment>The ghost bride functions primarily as a symbolic construct rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "mournful elation" and internal conflict over betrayal are told through exposition rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The botanist remains reactive throughout, never making a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost—he gasps, stumbles, reaches, but never acts against competing wants. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her love a knife that had carved them into eternity") and label-only emotions without embodied particulars.</comment>

<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. However, the closure unit lacks on-page cost: the bead "clatters to the floor," she fades, and he whispers her name—no decision, renunciation, or stance crystallization that forecloses a path with felt consequence. The final assertion "he knew, beyond all doubt, that she would return" tells future intent rather than landing a present reconfiguration. Under a causal lens, the botanist's memory surfaces unbidden and the bead "flares" without his agency; under accumulative logic, the final image recycles earlier descriptors without reweighting them. The debt is declared "paid" but no visible price alters his present options or emotional state on the page.</comment>

<comment>The orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with bioluminescent flora, silver-barked trees, and luminous pomegranates that establish a distinct sensory palette. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop—no environmental constraint shapes a choice or alters tactics. The carved stone bead, which could serve as micro-setting, is handled passively (held, hummed, flared by magic) rather than enabling or constraining a decision. The final image of the orchard "listening" is evocative but ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—repaying a debt across lifetimes—is signaled early but never tested by on-page choice or trade-off. Escalation proceeds through summary and passive magic (the bead "wove threads," "flared," memories "surfaced unbidden") rather than protagonist agency. The botanist's "understanding" arrives via epiphany, not a narrowing of options or a decision under competing pressure. The ghost's "approach" unfolds through atmospheric touches (scent, cold kiss, whisper) but no reversal forces her to alter tactics or pay a visible cost before she dissolves. The ending recycles the same glowing-orchard imagery without deepening or tightening the central pressure.</comment>

<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Theme of "debts across lifetimes" and "lovingly venomous" love emerges through recurring images (ash, bead, betrayal) but remains largely asserted rather than discovered through scene pressure. The bead's symbolic weight is told ("a promise, a curse, and a testament") rather than charged by a final action that reweights its meaning. The phrase "resonant awakenings had only just begun" explicitly states theme rather than allowing it to emerge. Subtext operates in some silences (her mouthed name heard clearly) but the backstory exposition of betrayal and tragedy is delivered wholesale rather than through implication or dramatic irony. The ending offers an evocative image but not a non-literal answer that transforms prior particulars.</comment>

<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent elevated register ("susurrus of regret," "ephemeral cameo appearances") that sometimes drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("lovingly venomous," "resonant awakenings," "mournful elation") rather than organic character perception. Diction is ornate but controlled; however, the botanist's internal texture is thin—his perceptual signature defaults to generic shivers and glances rather than character-particular noticing. Psychic distance holds steady but lacks modulation under peak emotional pressure (the memory flash and reunion are narrated at the same remove as earlier description). No dialogue appears on the page.</comment>

<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>Prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings. However, overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "shimmer," "luminous," "phosphorescence," "translucent," "ephemeral," "spectral," "trembling light" crowd the orchard sequence without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear ("her form as faint as the lace of a bride's veil torn by time" / "a bride of mist and sorrow"; "the bead in her grip hummed" / "the bead glowed brighter"). Template cadence runs through multiple "She [verb]" and "He [verb]" constructions in the reunion beat. Stock metaphors ("love a knife," "tears… rivers of starlight," "wrap around his heart like a final, lingering kiss") dull immediacy at closure. Figurative density in the final third disallows 9+ globally and applies −1.2 in Q7 for overwriting and loops touching the closure beat.</comment>

<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>The ghost-bride-seeking-forgiveness-across-lifetimes premise follows a widely used romantic-supernatural template without transformation through world logic or non-obvious moral calculus. The orchard greenhouse and bioluminescent flora offer vivid surface detail but do not inflect the familiar arc. The "lovingly venomous" paradox and "mournful elation" tone are asserted through prompt-language labels rather than discovered through specific, embodied contradiction. The carved bead functions as a stock magical anchor without unique properties that complicate the reunion. Derivative premise triggers −1.0 in Q8; no bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>The ashen-veil ghost bride is present across multiple beats (drifting through orchard, brushing his awareness, appearing at climax) but makes no decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She "desires," "watches," "presses," "reaches," yet her actions are passive observations and atmospheric touches rather than choices under competing pressure. The final dissolution ("with a soft sigh, she faded") is unearned by prior agency. Present in setup, middle touches, and ending image, but swappable with any spectral figure seeking closure; causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The carved stone bead appears in three distinct beats: first held by the ghost ("warm in her spectral grasp"), mid-story humming with symbols, and finally flaring at the reunion before clattering to the floor. Its symbolic meaning is asserted ("the key to the resonant awakenings," "a promise, a curse") rather than evolving through action. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; instead it passively "wove threads" and "pulsed" via magic. Present in setup, middle, and ending; however, the botanist's closing of his hand around it is a static gesture without visible cost or altered option. Meets two gates (setup, payoff) but lacks middle development and causal pressure; lyric reprise elevates slightly but swappability remains high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>2.4</grade>
<comment>"Resonant awakenings" appears as a thematic label in exposition ("the resonant awakenings she sought," "the resonant awakenings had only just begun") but does not shape on-page stakes or constrain tactics. The botanist's memory "surfaces unbidden"—awakening happens to him rather than through a choice he makes under pressure. The concept is ornamental, serving as prompt-echo rather than a driver of plot mechanics or decision points. Mentioned in middle and ending but only as theme claim, not as active stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>2.1</grade>
<comment>"Lovingly venomous" is asserted twice as a label ("Their love had been lovingly venomous," "her love—lovingly venomous… wrap around his heart") without dramatizing the paradox through a single on-page action that shows both tenderness and harm with visible cost. The backstory tells us she betrayed him, but no present beat enacts the venomous-love tradeoff. The trait exists only as thematic decoration, not as a constraint or enabler. Present in middle exposition and final summary; no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The act of "ghosting" structures the entire plot: the bride drifts between rows, brushes against his awareness through scent/touch/whisper, and appears at the climax. The method of haunting drives multiple beats and the reunion turn. However, her ghostliness could be replaced with any supernatural remoteness (spirit, vision, dream visitation) without altering the emotional arc or his passive reception. Present in setup (first appearance), middle (cameo touches), and ending (dissolution); causal involvement in multiple beats but high swappability and no cost tied specifically to being a ghost versus another form of spectral presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>"Through ephemeral cameo appearances" is explicitly named and demonstrated: she manifests as scent, cold kiss, whisper, then briefly as "a figure of trembling light." The method is signaled early and shapes her approach tactics across the middle beats. However, the mechanics are passive (he perceives, she fades) rather than creating friction or forcing her to adapt when a cameo fails. Present in setup, middle brushes, and ending appearance; functional but the exact method (cameo versus sustained haunting) does not alter his choices or her cost. Two gates met; causal pressure modest.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>The "alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night" is vividly established in the opening and provides a coherent spatial frame for all action. The luminous flora and silver-barked trees create atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—he tends plants, she drifts among them, and the orchard "listens" at the end without the space itself altering tactics or imposing cost. The specific locale (orchard versus any other liminal space) is swappable. Present in setup and charged in final image, but lacks middle development where the environment shapes a move.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>1.8</grade>
<comment>"Over the hush of winter-cracked fields" appears only in the final paragraph as a framing phrase, with no prior setup or middle development. Time is untracked: the haunting unfolds in a vague endless night with no clock pressure or temporal constraint that tightens decisions or alters tactics. The winter image is ornamental scene-setting, not a driver of urgency. Missing setup and middle gates; late mention in ending does not constitute closure participation since it adds no cost or reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>4.3</grade>
<comment>"To repay a debt across lifetimes" is stated early ("She had come to repay a debt") and restated at closure ("The debt was paid"). However, the motivation is never dramatized through a choice where repayment conflicts with another want or imposes visible cost. The ghost drifts, watches, and fades; the botanist receives memories passively. No friction exists between the desire to repay and a competing impulse—she simply executes the task and dissolves. Present in setup and ending assertion, but told-only without on-page tension or tradeoff. Meets two gates but lacks conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>"Mournful elation" is named early ("Her desire was a paradox of mournful elation") and echoed in the reunion beat ("their reunion as beautiful as it was impossible," "tears welled… rivers of starlight"). The tone modulates slightly as pressure builds—opening sorrow, climactic intensity, final lingering kiss—but the diction remains uniformly elevated and melancholic without sharp tonal shift or break that charges the ending differently. The paradox is asserted rather than enacted through rhythmic or lexical contrast. Present in setup, middle touches, and ending; coherent but static mood without decisive modulation under peak pressure.</comment>
