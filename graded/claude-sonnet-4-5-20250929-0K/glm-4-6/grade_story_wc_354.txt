<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias remains largely static throughout, observing and meditating rather than making choices that alter his stance. His interior life is told through abstract labels ("thoughtfully precise," "hopeful melancholy") rather than embodied contradiction. The final "peace" arrives as assertion, not earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. Therapy-speak phrases like "channel each feeling into understanding" flatten what should be a decisive moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchored by ~40 words (pass). The piece accumulates reflective texture but lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost at closure—Elias arrives seeking understanding and departs with understanding, a static trajectory. The "eclipsed covenant" and his exile are summarized rather than dramatized, so no prior option is visibly foreclosed. The story tells us he has found peace but does not show what he renounced or paid to reach it. Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or density break reweights the stake with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus supplies vivid sensory detail (lavender/charcoal twilight, basalt texture, hum) but remains postcard description—it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The worry stone's dent is described repeatedly yet never used to solve a problem or block an option. Spatial choreography is clear, and the twilight atmosphere is consistent, but the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover beauty in the difficult"—is declared but never tested by a concrete choice or reversal. Elias stands, meditates, and departs with no on-page tightening that narrows options or raises cost. The "eclipsed covenant" and expulsion are backstory summary, not present conflict. No turn or deepening occurs; pressure remains flat throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of exile-as-transformation is stated overtly ("not an ending but a different kind of beginning") rather than earned through image or action. The final paragraph moralizes: "the one that mapped the human heart" is a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure. The worry stone's dent shifts from "failure" to "imperfect journey" via assertion, not dramatized reweighting. Subtext is largely absent; meanings are announced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("hopeful melancholy settling over him like the twilight") that feels authored rather than character-specific. The narrative voice is competent but generic, lacking a perceptual signature that would distinguish Elias's way of noticing under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs (e.g., "by translating silence" repeated four times; "thoughtfully precise" twice; "eclipsed covenant" three times without added meaning). Template cadence in multiple paragraphs: "The [noun] had [verb]... The [noun] was... The [noun] seemed..." Stock metaphors ("the board that mapped the human heart") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to warm," "could see") dull immediacy. Penalty: −0.9 for loops and template stems touching closure paragraph. Artifacts in final third disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The exiled-mentor-seeking-redemption premise is familiar and executed without transformation. The magnetic nexus and celestial alignment add surface novelty but do not integrate causally. The "translating silence" conceit is repeated as a label without mechanics or friction. No risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis; the ending's "peace" is a predictable resolution for this template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and focalizes all beats, but his choices (stand, meditate, place stone, depart) do not create turns or alter stakes. He observes and reflects rather than deciding under pressure. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but his agency is passive. Two-gate minimum met (setup + closure cameo), but no causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The worry stone appears in beats one (tracing surface), two (grounding meditation), and three (placing on ground at closure). Its dent is described repeatedly and the final placement "lining up its dent with a bright point" reprises it with slight reweighting. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—it remains a symbolic prop. Three gates met (setup, middle touch, closure reprise) with lyric resonance, but swappable for any keepsake without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The "eclipsed covenant" is mentioned five times as backstory label—his expulsion from the academy—but never dramatized or tested on the page. It frames his past but does not shape present stakes or tactics. Introduced early (setup gate met) but absent from middle choices and closure action; it is theme-claimed, not pressure-applied. Late transformation is asserted ("not broken but transformed") without cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully precise" is applied twice as a label ("thoughtfully precise in his approach," "the thoughtfully precise man") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. We are told he is precise; we do not see a moment where precision costs him or saves him. Ornamental trait without tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Correlate" appears three times: he correlates star movements with encoded messages, magnetic shifts with conversation fragments, and magnetic patterns with his evolution. The action is told, not shown—we never witness the mechanics or see correlation succeed or fail. It does not drive a turn; easily swappable with "analyze" or "interpret." Present in setup and middle summary, absent from closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"By translating silence" is repeated four times as a label for Elias's method but never operationalized. We are told he translates silence into meaning, wisdom, and unspoken words, yet no scene demonstrates how or shows it succeed/fail under pressure. The method is asserted in closure paragraph but does not shape prior attempts or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus at twilight anchors every beat and supplies vivid atmosphere (lavender/charcoal, hum, star emergence). Twilight's progression (last rays disappear, first stars appear) tracks time and modulates mood. However, the nexus does not constrain choice—Elias could perform the same meditation anywhere. Setup and closure gates met; middle development weak (no tactic altered by location). Postcard use, not pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Before the next phase" is mentioned three times, creating nominal urgency ("time was running out"), but the deadline never tightens a choice or alters tactics. Elias completes his meditation and departs with no consequence for lateness. The timeframe is declared, not dramatized. Setup gate met, closure gate weak (he finishes "before the next phase began" with no cost for proximity).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To discover beauty in the difficult" is stated twice and frames his motivation, but it is never tested by friction. Elias seeks beauty and finds it (peace, understanding) without competing desire or visible cost. The motivation is told, not shown through conflicted choice. Setup and closure gates met (he achieves his goal), but no middle choice where beauty competes with another need.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Hopeful melancholy" is named once in the final paragraph and implied by the twilight's "lavender and charcoal" palette and Elias's arc from exile to acceptance. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (tension → acceptance), and the final smile embodies the duality. However, tone is largely told ("hopeful melancholy settling over him") rather than sustained through rhythm or image choice across beats. Closure participation is direct but late-labeled.</comment>
