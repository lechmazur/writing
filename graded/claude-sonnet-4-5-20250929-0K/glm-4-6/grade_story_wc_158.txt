<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The poet is characterized almost entirely through label-only interiority ("shyly unstoppable," "quiet determination") and abstract descriptors rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Emotion remains performed rather than embodied—"his insomniac eyes wide with wonder" and "his heart still thrumming" feel generic rather than character-particular. The final choice (reaching for the blossom) lacks visible cost or internal conflict; the pain simply "dissolves" without renunciation or struggle. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure; the protagonist witnesses transformation passively rather than earning it through agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—spatial grounding (cliff, shell, sea) arrives piecemeal without early anchoring—triggering the Q2 penalty. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the blossom's arrival and pain's transformation, but cost is asserted rather than demonstrated: pain "dissolves" into light without any visible forfeiture or decision that forecloses a path. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (centuries of longing, recurring motifs), yet the ending delivers a convenience resolution—the blossom appears, solves the poet's suffering, and promises continuation—undercutting earned closure. The new postcard ("The next chapter is yours") reads as a soft reset rather than reconfiguration with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell receives vivid description ("pearlescent walls humming with the ghosts of long-dead tides") but functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The cliff and reef-shadow sea frame the blossom's arrival yet remain postcard imagery rather than micro-setting that pressures tactics. The galaxy postcard appears in the poet's pocket at the cliff, a minor spatial detail, but its presence there does not affect the action. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful in places (the off-key wind, the blossom's shimmer), lifting the score above pure ornament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming pain into beauty—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The poet's insomnia and centuries of longing are told rather than dramatized through a meaningful tightening; no on-page reversal narrows options. The blossom's arrival is coincidence (it floats above the waves, unprompted), and its resolution of the poet's suffering lacks agency: he reaches, pain dissolves, armistice achieved. No visible price is paid; the ending offers continuation ("the next chapter is yours") rather than a trade-off or foreclosed path. Pressure remains static across the narrative, with no escalation under the Accumulative lens that would reweight the stake with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The core theme—pain photosynthesized into beauty—is stated explicitly multiple times ("photosynthesize pain into beauty," "blossom armistice") rather than emerging from concrete events. The final image (blossom absorbing pain, transforming it to light) offers visual resonance, yet the transformation is asserted without dramatic cost, undercutting earned wisdom. The galaxy postcard and recurring motifs (lullabies, reef-shadow, constellations) accumulate texture but do not constrain choice or reweight prior material with visible consequence. "Blossom armistice—when the war of the heart ends, and beauty becomes the truce" reads as thematic echo, restating the premise in the margins rather than letting it arise implicitly from action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature is consistent (lyric, metaphor-heavy diction anchored in the poet's occupation). Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the universe was returning the favor," "a soul at peace") that feels authorial rather than rooted in the character's idiom under stress. The prose texture is distinct—long, incantatory sentences—but the narrative stance flattens urgency: peak moments (touching the blossom) receive the same measured cadence as exposition. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent, though the narration occasionally claims knowledge beyond the immediate moment ("across centuries") without grounding it in present perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Template cadence and synonym churn pervade: "he had outlived kingdoms, watched empires rise and fall," "pain wasn't something to be erased but something to be transformed," "each one a testament to the beauty that arose from longing." Paraphrase loops recur—"the blossom armistice" and its variants appear five times, restating the same concept without added pressure. Figurative density in most sentences ("ink swirling like nebulae," "pearlescent walls humming," "reef-shadow joy") without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers overwriting penalties. Stock metaphors ("pain bloomed into constellations," "his heart full of the joy") and filter-verb stacks in the final third ("he found," "he knew," "he continued") dull immediacy. The final paragraph's artifact concentration—template stems, abstract labels, thematic summary—disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—immortal poet in a shell, centuries of longing, pain transformed by magical blossom—combines familiar fantasy-lyric tropes without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "blossom armistice" concept is poetic but operates as metaphor rather than grounded world logic with cost. Emotional beats follow a predictable arc: suffering → magical intervention → peaceful resolution, with no complicating friction or risk. The galaxy postcard, lullabies, and reef-shadow imagery feel ornamental rather than inevitable; removing any could be replaced with minor edits. No fresh inflection or synthesis that feels specific to this voice and setting; the transformation test fails—plot and arc could transfer to different names and places unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The insomniac poet is present throughout but makes only one choice on the page: reaching for the blossom. That choice does not alter tactics or narrow options—pain dissolves automatically upon contact. Observation dominates: he traces the postcard, works at his desk, notices the melody, witnesses transformation. Setup is clear (first paragraph), but middle development shows no decision under pressure, and closure participation is passive witnessing. Late penalty (blossom appears in fourth paragraph, ~60% mark) and ornamental use (centuries of craft are told, not shown constraining a beat) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The galaxy postcard appears in four beats: traced in the opening, described as compass with inscribed message, hums in the poet's pocket at the cliff, and a new blank postcard appears on the desk at the end. Setup is strong (first line), and the final reprise reweights meaning (blank postcard = next chapter). However, the postcard does not constrain a choice or enable tactics under stress; it remains symbolic rather than causally active. The middle beats describe rather than pressure. Lyric resonance (early seed → final return) and closure linkage lift the score into mid-range, but swappability (any keepsake could serve the role) and lack of visible cost tied to the object prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Blossom armistice" is named explicitly five times and frames the thematic premise (pain blooms into beauty, war of the heart ends). Setup is early (first paragraph's "pain bloomed into constellations," explicit mention in third paragraph). However, the concept operates as theme rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page—the blossom appears, armistice is declared, no on-page friction tests its terms. The poet does not negotiate or enact the truce through choice; it arrives as magical resolution. Functional but replaceable: "healing flower" or "peace offering" could substitute with minor edits. Ornamental use and lack of causal pressure cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" appears twice as a label ("as he'd once heard a lover describe it," "shyly unstoppable, as always") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The trait is told rather than shown through visible tradeoffs—no moment where shyness hinders or quiet persistence enables a tactical choice under pressure. Setup is present (first paragraph), but no middle development or closure participation that dramatizes the attribute's mechanics. Label-only mentions and swappability (any descriptor of persistence could replace it) trigger cap.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Ensconce" appears once in the second sentence: "he'd ensconce himself in the gargantuan shell." Setup is early, but the action is past habitual rather than a present choice that turns the plot. The shell setting houses the poet's work across centuries, yet the act of ensconcing does not redefine options or create a major turn—it establishes static backdrop. No middle development where ensconcing constrains a choice, and no closure participation where the action or its reversal shapes the ending. Easily swappable with "retreat," "hide," or "shelter" without structural change. Functional role in setup but replaceable mechanics cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind appear in three beats: mentioned in second paragraph, carry closer in fourth paragraph (drawing the poet out), and return in the final paragraph ("his heart still thrumming with the half-sung lullabies"). Setup is present, and the melody prompts the poet to leave the shell—a middle choice—though the decision lacks visible cost or friction. Closure participation is label-only (heart thrumming) rather than the method shaping the final image or tactics. The mechanics of how lullabies enable or constrain are vague; they signal rather than pressure. Swappable with any ambient sound (chimes, song, call) with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is present in setup (second paragraph: sanctuary, pearlescent walls, perched on cliff), houses the poet's work across multiple beats (desk, drafts, shell's curved windows), and frames the return in the ending (he returns to the shell, finds the new postcard). Three-gate presence and spaced involvement across beats lift the score. However, the shell does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains backdrop and refuge without causal pressure. Micro-setting use (body, tool, or object that alters tactics) is absent; the shell's properties (pearlescent, humming walls) are described but never leveraged. Functional setting role but lack of tactical constraint prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Across centuries of longing" appears three times as a phrase and frames the poet's immortal timeline. Setup is early (first paragraph), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics—centuries pass without a live clock or deadline that alters moves. The poet has "outlived kingdoms, watched empires rise and fall," yet this vast span creates no urgency or cost on the page. The blossom's arrival and resolution occur in a single night, ignoring the centuries' pressure. Time remains abstract and vague rather than tracked with consequence. Ornamental scale (epic backdrop) without mechanics that shape attempts or narrow options. Missing middle development and closure participation caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to photosynthesize pain into beauty" is named explicitly twice and frames the poet's craft across centuries. Setup is clear (first paragraph: "turning sorrow into art," second paragraph: "photosynthesize pain into beauty"). The desire drives the poet's nightly work (desk piled with drafts) and connects to the closure (pain transforms into light via the blossom). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through on-page friction—no choice where the desire to transform pain conflicts with another want or imposes visible cost. The blossom grants the transformation without the poet's active struggle or renunciation. Functional linkage to closure but lack of conflicted choice and visible tradeoff caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy" appears three times: "reef-shadow sea" (second paragraph), "reef-shadow joy of the sea" (fourth paragraph), "another reef-shadow dawn" (final paragraph). The phrase establishes a lyric tone—melancholic beauty tinged with solitude—that modulates subtly (sea → joy → dawn) as pressure shifts from longing to resolution. Setup is early, and the final reprise charges the ending image with tonal continuity. However, the tone remains static rather than undergoing a meaningful pressure-driven shift; the same wistful register persists through the climactic blossom encounter without tonal friction or intensification. Coherence and purposeful reprise lift the score, but lack of modulation under peak stress and single-note mood prevent higher bands.</comment>
