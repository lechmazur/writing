<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's interior voice is consistently established through his interpretive lens ("Silence isn't absence...It's information too"), but motivation remains largely asserted rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The "find the beginning in every ending" desire is stated but never tested against a credible cost or alternative path; his trajectory feels like a predetermined meditation rather than a choice under pressure. Embodied emotion is thin—no visceral contradiction or struggle surfaces when the signal resolves, just confirmation. The ending's smile and understanding arrive without prior friction that would make renunciation or acceptance feel earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early (tower city, gorge, lunar perigee, receiver setup). The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural lens—tuning as a process of discarding assumptions, building through sensory layering toward the "shard of hush" resolution—and the pattern is taught. However, closure lacks visible cost: Elias discovers the signal's source (the fragment's Hollywood echo) and pockets it with quiet satisfaction, but no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered, no price paid on the page. The final image ("every ending is just another frequency") restates the premise rather than reconfiguring it with felt consequence, yielding a Conceptual Repricing that remains abstract rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tower city, gorge, and lunar perigee are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (latticework bones, wind as chorus, moonlight refracting through the fragment). The fragment itself—handled, placed in the resonance chamber, pocketed—functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (Elias at console, edge of gorge) and sensory hierarchy reflects his professional lens (copper glinting, static dissolving, crystalline hum). The environment constrains action (isolation, nighttime tuning window) and the fragment's warmth and facets enable the discovery, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to decode the signal—is signaled early and pursued through a single tightening: Elias discards assumptions, tunes deeper, and locates the signal's source within the fragment. However, escalation is minimal; the signal "strengthens" and "resolves" without reversals or trade-offs that narrow options. The discovery is confirmation rather than a turn that forecloses a path. No secondary pressure (time, resource, risk) complicates his work, and the ending awards him the answer without dramatized cost, leaving the stake abstract and the resolution frictionless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme—listening, fragmentation, and recursion—emerges organically from the setting and action (abandoned city, salvaged fragment, tuning as discarding). The "shard of hush" and the fragment's Hollywood echo seed a meditation on forgotten stories and cyclical beginnings. However, the final lines ("every ending is just another frequency"; "silence was never just silence") drift toward overt thematic statement rather than letting the image speak. The closure offers a lyric reconfiguration but stops short of a non-literal answer with felt cost, leaning on articulated wisdom rather than earned particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured, with purposeful elevation ("latticework...skeletal chorus," "serenely electric," "liquid silver") that matches Elias's poetic-technical stance. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into arch abstraction ("the act of listening, of piecing together fragments") that feels more thematic than character-particular under pressure. The closing lines ("some beginnings are found in the most unexpected endings") edge toward narrator-commentary rather than staying anchored in Elias's specific perceptual signature. No dialogue is present to test subtext or distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm and imagery are controlled, with varied syntax and vivid specificity ("copper glinting serenely electric," "liquid silver," "gorge stretched into darkness"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: the "shard of hush" is restated across three paragraphs without added pressure; "beginning in every ending" recurs as label rather than evolving image. Template cadence surfaces in the closing paragraphs ("he knew he'd be back—always listening, always tuning"; "silence was never just silence. It was a story waiting to be heard"). These loops and the scaffold-like final summary ("The shard of hush had taught him...") dull momentum and trigger the artifact penalty, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The combination of celestial signal interpreter, Hollywood fragment, and abandoned tower city offers a distinctive premise. However, the emotional arc—solitary expert achieves confirmation and understanding—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived friction or non-obvious cost. The fragment's "residual fame" is a fresh detail, but its discovery and use proceed without surprise or resistance. The ending's recursive wisdom ("every ending is just another frequency") restates the premise rather than reweighting it through a turn earned in hindsight, leaving the piece competent but not indelible.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his profession frames the action (adjusting the receiver, placing the fragment, tuning). However, his choices do not create turns; he executes a predetermined process (discard assumptions, tune deeper, discover source) without encountering friction that forces a pivot. The role is essential to setup and closure participation but lacks middle development that would constrain or complicate his path. Functional across two gates but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Hollywood star fragment appears early (salvage backstory, "no bigger than his thumb"), is handled in the middle beat (placed in resonance chamber, flickering and pulsing), and charges the closure (pocketed, "gentle glow," "hum faintly"). Its crystalline structure and residual fame enable the signal discovery, and its warmth recurs to reweight meaning. Three-gate presence, causal pressure, and closure linkage push it into the essential band. Swappability is low; the fragment's Hollywood origin and physical properties matter to the premise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" is introduced early and recurs across multiple paragraphs, but it functions primarily as a poetic label rather than shaping on-page tactics. Elias does not wrestle with what the shard is or adjust his method in response to its properties; it resolves as "laughter, applause, and the weight of a thousand forgotten stories" without altering his choices. Present across setup and closure but ornamental in middle development, yielding functional but replaceable integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" appears twice (receiver's copper, fragment's light) as vivid description but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. It colors atmosphere without altering Elias's approach or the fragment's function; a near-synonym ("calmly luminous") could replace it with minor edits. Label-only use across two touches, no causal pressure, trends low-functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tune" is the dominant action verb, anchoring setup (adjusting the dial, "not with a knob, but by discarding assumptions"), middle development (tuning deeper, forcing out preconceptions), and closure (the signal resolves, he withdraws the fragment). The act of tuning drives the escalation and discovery, making it integral across three gates. However, the mechanics remain abstract; "tuning" is asserted rather than dramatized with specific adjustments or tradeoffs that narrow options, limiting its indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Discarding assumptions" is signaled early ("forcing out every preconceived notion of what a signal *should* be") and recurs in the middle ("discarding another assumption: that the signal came from beyond the stars"). The method is named and shapes his approach, satisfying setup and middle development. However, the mechanics remain told rather than shown; we do not see which assumptions are tested or what cost their rejection carries. Present across two gates with lyric closure resonance ("the act of listening, of piecing together fragments"), but causal work is thin, placing it in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tower city and gorge anchor all three gates: setup (latticework, skeletal chorus, lunar perigee), middle (tower's steel bones vibrate, wind falters), and closure (gorge whispers approval, city as witness). The setting supplies isolation that enables Elias's solitary work and the perigee tightens the tuning window. Spatial choreography is clear (console, edge, gorge below) and the environment's "vibration" and "breath-holding" charge the discovery. Essential across beats and ending, though the pressure remains atmospheric rather than mechanically constraining tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lunar perigee is introduced early ("oversized glare," "had arrived") and marks the closure boundary ("began to wane," "as the moon retreated"). It provides a temporal frame and atmospheric pressure (air thrums, tower vibrates), but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. Elias does not race the perigee or adjust his method in response to its waning; it functions as backdrop rather than live clock. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with thematic accent but minimal causal work trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To find the beginning in every ending" is stated early and recurs in the middle ("the beginning hidden in the ending of the old world's broadcast era") and closure ("every ending is just another frequency"). The motivation frames his interpretive stance and charges the final realization. However, it is articulated rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; Elias pursues it without friction or doubt that would make the discovery feel earned. Present across all three gates with thematic resonance but lacks on-page pressure or tradeoff, placing it in the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tone blends poetic elevation ("skeletal chorus," "liquid silver") with grounded technical detail (receiver, resonance chamber, dial) in a way that reads as fantasy practicality—lyric wonder anchored by tactile objects. The tone modulates subtly (wonder rising as the signal resolves, quiet satisfaction at closure) and remains coherent across turns. However, the practicality remains thin; the receiver's mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated with specific constraints or costs. Tone charges the final image but does not deeply constrain choices, placing it in the mid-essential band.</comment>
