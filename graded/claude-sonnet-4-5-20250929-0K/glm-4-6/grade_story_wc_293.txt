<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's "dynamically observant" trait is claimed but rarely constrains action with visible cost. Her decision to pursue the mystery feels unmotivated beyond curiosity—no competing need, fear, or internal contradiction shapes her choice to return daily. The hitchhiker and later glass-fragment collectors remain generic figures who apply no relational pressure. The ending's turn to "bridge between possibilities" arrives as an epiphany unearned by prior struggle or sacrifice visible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (mystery deepens through fragments, scaffold map, musical discovery), but closure arrives as explanatory summary rather than a decisive image or cost. The hitchhiker's vanishing is told ("became not speculation but reality") rather than shown with sensory particulars that anchor disorientation. The final paragraph explains the theme ("pixelated amnesty wasn't about forgiveness") instead of letting the final action reweight prior material. Orientation is delayed: we learn "bridge-song fiddler" and "mountain scenic pullout" but the specifics of where she stands and what tourists see arrive piecemeal across the first third without a clean anchor by ~120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty of −0.4 and capping Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The mountain pullout, old stone bridge, and construction site scaffold appear but function as interchangeable backdrops rather than constraints that shape Elara's tactics. The scaffold wrap is discovered on "the third day" and decoded "for hours," yet no physical detail—wind direction, scaffold height, visibility angle—alters her approach. The wet-plate glass flake returns in the night examination and final moon scene, shifting from relic to musical resonator, which charges the closure image moderately. The Q2 Orientation Test penalty was applied; Q3 remains capped at 7.0 per the waiver consequence rule.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving the impossible real—is declared early but never tested by a live cost. Elara's nightly vigil and fragment assembly unfold over "months" without visible trade-off: no lost income, damaged relationships, or physical toll that narrows her options. The climax moment ("she felt the air begin to shimmer") offers no choice or renunciation; she plays, understands, and continues. One tightening occurs when the scaffold map is decoded, but it opens discovery rather than foreclosing a path with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of "pixelated amnesty" and "sculpting possibility from never" is stated outright in the final paragraph: "it was about seeing what was always there, just beyond normal perception." The glass flake and musical bridge-song recur but carry no ironic reversal or non-literal answer—they illustrate the thesis. The "motivation" phrase "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" appears verbatim in narration, reading as prompt echo rather than lived insight. No ambiguity or counter-reading complicates the moral; locals dismiss her, but no consequence or friction tests her conviction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping, and the perceptual signature ("dynamically observant," fiddler's ear for pattern) is asserted. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("luminous disbelief," "digitalized pardon," "transitioned") that clashes with a street musician's lexicon under pressure. The hitchhiker's dialogue ("The truth is never whole") and Elara's interior monologue share the same abstract, thesis-like cadence. Purposeful compression in the months-long summary is not taught as a pattern and reads as transit rather than lyric elision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear: "She returned to the pullout daily, playing her fiddle while scanning… On the third day…" and "She spent hours deciphering… eventually realizing…" echo stock progression markers. The phrase "pixelated amnesty" appears five times with synonym churn ("digitalized pardon," "a way to make sense of the impossible"). Filter-verb stacks ("She discovered," "She learned," "She began documenting") cluster in the middle third. Mixed metaphor: "sculpt possibility from the ashes" conflates tactile craft with combustion residue. Deductions total approximately −1.4 in Q7 for paraphrase loops (−0.4), template cadence (−0.5), and filter-verb stacks near peaks (−0.5).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The vanishing-hitchhiker premise and mysterious-artifact-as-puzzle follow widely used templates without fresh synthesis. The glass flake containing "multiple faces" who "had vanished" and the "thin places between worlds" read as stock paranormal tropes. Elara's arc—doubt to belief to cosmic role—proceeds along predictable stations. The "bridge-song fiddler" detail offers modest occupational specificity, but her music's mechanics (how notes "resonate with the glass flake") remain abstract. No bold risk or lived detail transforms the familiar frame into something inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Bridge-song fiddler appears in setup (tuning by the bridge, playing for tourists) and at closure (playing under the full moon), but her musical choices do not create key turns. She plays, discovers, documents, and plays again without a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The trait is scenic rather than causal. Swappable with "street performer" or "wandering artist" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Wet-plate collodion glass flake is handed to Elara in beat one, examined by magnifying glass in beat two (revealing faces), and used as a musical resonator in beat three (final moon scene). It appears in or shapes the ending and its properties (fragment, pixelated image, shifts meaning) are specific. However, it does not constrain a choice—Elara never risks losing it, trading it, or choosing one course over another because of it. Present in closure but not causally active there; cost is generic scene pressure rather than tied to this object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Pixelated amnesty is introduced in the night examination ("something like pixelated amnesty"), recurs as "digitalized pardon," and is explained in the final paragraph ("wasn't about forgiveness—it was about seeing what was always there"). It functions as a thematic label rather than a mechanic that changes Elara's options or tactics. Never tested, only claimed. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Dynamically observant is claimed in paragraph one ("a trait that had saved her more than once") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. She notices the scaffold flutters, but any observer could; no trade-off or mistake tied to hyper-vigilance appears. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Recount appears when Elara tells "the few locals who would listen" and they dismiss her. The dismissal is mentioned in one sentence and does not create a turn—she "knew better" and continues unchanged. The action is summary-only and does not redefine options or escalate pressure. Swappable with "she wrote it down" or "she told a friend."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>A secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters is signaled in beat two (day three discovery), its mechanics described (faint markings visible at certain angles, forming a map to "thin places"), and it enables the fragment-assembly project. It appears in two distinct beats (discovery, months-long use) and its method (light angle, pattern reading) is specific. However, it does not constrain a choice—the map is decoded and used without cost, error, or competing option. Missing closure participation; the scaffold is not present in or shaping the final moon scene.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mountain scenic pullout is named in setup and serves as the recurring location for Elara's vigil and final playing. It supplies the construction site nearby and the mist-shrouded peaks backdrop. However, it does not pressure choices—altitude, weather, visibility, access do not alter her tactics. Postcard description ("mist-shrouded peaks that seemed to dissolve") without micro-constraint. Functional backdrop, swappable with "roadside park" or "overlook."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>After the hitchhiker vanishes establishes the temporal frame in paragraph one (setup) and is echoed in the phrase "after the hitchhiker vanishes became not speculation but reality." The timeframe enables the mystery investigation (days, then months) and appears in the ending through the past-event reference. It shapes two beats (immediate aftermath, long accumulation) but does not tighten decisions—Elara has unlimited time, no deadline, no competing urgency. Present in closure frame but does not impose cost there.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>To sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never" is stated verbatim in narration mid-story as Elara's motivation and echoed in the final line ("sculpting possibility from what seemed like never"). It appears in setup (implied by her refusal to dismiss the event) and closure (final playing "had purpose"), touching two beats. However, it is told rather than dramatized—no scene shows her choosing this path over safety or rest with visible cost. Desire is declared, not conflicted. Thematic label more than lived motive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Luminous disbelief is named twice ("left her in a state of luminous disbelief," "Through the luminous disbelief that still gripped her") and describes Elara's reaction to the vanishing and the final shimmering. The tone is asserted rather than embodied through sentence rhythm or image; it does not modulate under pressure—curiosity and wonder remain static across months. Present in setup and closure beats but functions as a mood label. Does not charge the final image; the ending explains rather than enacts wonder.</comment>
