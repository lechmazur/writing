<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tomas exhibits agency through constructed device and blood-curse manipulation, and his "nearly-living" state generates internal tension. His competence ("offhandedly exact manner") is dramatized through assembly work. However, interiority leans toward label-heavy constructions ("morning sickness had never quite left," "curse-birthed paradox") rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. The final choice to gather the device and return lacks visible cost that forecloses a path—he simply continues the pattern.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Tomas), where (orchard/cliffs), and what (curse/mechanical birds) within the first paragraph. The piece follows a causal arc: assemble device → activate with blood gift → guide traveler out. Closure reads as continuation rather than decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost; Tomas returns to the orchard with dimmed light described as "approval," but no option is foreclosed and no price visible on the page beyond "first frost kisses touched Tomas's fingertips," which reads atmospheric rather than consequential. Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure, but the ending deflates into summary ("another night, another life saved") rather than landing a charged image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, frost line, and orchard light are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography remains mostly clear (labyrinth mouth, cliffs, orchard). The nut's tactile presence ("warm against palm") and the device's blue-light path constrain Tomas's method and guide the traveler, charging the final third. Loose gravel and frost accrue pressure. Minor slip: "晶体者 forming delicate daggers" includes untranslated Chinese that breaks immersion and suggests a generation artifact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the traveler before frost and birds kill them—is signaled early and sustained. The blueprint assembly, bird misdirection, and blue-thread guidance create one meaningful tightening that narrows options. Agency is present but not tested by competing goods or escalating tradeoffs; Tomas executes his plan without adaptation or visible cost. The traveler's survival feels inevitable rather than earned through sacrifice or renunciation, and the orchard's "approval" deflates tension instead of charging consequences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of burden, cycles of rescue, and cursed inheritance emerges through image (orchard light, nut, blueprint marked "Failed Experiments"). The final paragraph's "gracelessly, beautifully" and "another night" gesture toward thematic resonance but stop short of reweighting prior material with cost. "What remained of his humanity had written the blueprint in first place" is closer to overt thesis than earned subtext. The nut's function and Tomas's blood-gift offer symbolic depth, yet closure favors continuation over reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Tomas. Voice carries texture through orchard-dust roughness, "nearly-living" physicality, and matter-of-fact despair. Diction occasionally slips into elevated register ("curse-birthed paradox," "luminous path") that tilts slightly above the established grit. The traveler's dialogue "follow the blue thread" fits urgency. Chinese text artifact "清晰的" and "晶体者" intrude without translation, suggesting generation noise. Overall voice is controlled and purposeful with minor register drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm and information density is generally high. However, scaffold phrases recur: "He had found it," "He heard movement," "When the traveler emerged"; template cadence across multiple beats. "Morning sickness had never quite left his system after inheriting" reads as unclear metaphor or biology error (pregnancy? nausea from curse?). The untranslated Chinese fragments "清晰的" and "晶体者" are clear text artifacts that obscure clarity. Some strong images ("frost kisses touched Tomas's fingertips") but loops and filter stacks ("He concentrated, leaving impressions") dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise—cursed orchard, mechanical sentinels, blood-gift guidance—synthesizes familiar dark-fantasy elements with the fresh detail of a blueprint from "Failed Experiments" and impressions that confuse sensors. The "offhandedly exact" trait and "graceless beauty" tone offer specific angles. However, the traveler-rescue frame is conventional and the ending loops rather than transforms. The nut and blueprint feel integrated but not irreplaceable; similar mystical objects could serve the same function. Risk-taking in world-building is present but not bold enough to fully escape template territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tomas as reluctant caretaker frames the story, drives assembly and activation, and his blood-curse method creates the rescue. He appears in setup, middle assembly, activation, and ending. His choices narrow options (assemble despite danger, activate despite cost to self) and the final return to the orchard closes the arc. However, the choice to return lacks visible tradeoff—he gathers the device and turns back without foreclosing an alternative path. Strong causal role but modest cost connection keeps this below 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nut appears in setup ("small nut waited," "found it beneath the oldest tree"), middle assembly (clicks into center, blueprint specifies it), activation (pulses blue light, guides path), and ending ("nut warm against palm"). Its etched symbols and impossibility ("impossibly light," "rejected the orchard's curse while suffering its influence") are specific. Removing it would break the device logic. Three distinct beats plus closure presence, high specificity, and causal pressure place this solidly in the essential range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The forgotten blueprint appears in setup (discovered in cabin, marked "Failed Experiments"), shapes assembly tactics in the middle ("blueprint required precision," "intricate instructions," "as the blueprint had decreed"), and closes with meta-reflection ("his humanity had written the blueprint in first place"). It enables the device and constrains method. However, late reveal that Tomas wrote it himself blurs the "forgotten" quality and reads as retroactive twist rather than integrated cost. Present across three beats but swappability and late twist lower integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Offhandedly exact" is labeled once ("an offhandedly exact manner that bordered on casual mastery") during assembly and illustrated through "practiced ease" arranging components. It does not constrain a choice or create visible cost—Tomas succeeds without tradeoff tied to this trait. The clumsy foot slip ("somehow steadied his hands") gestures at the "graceless" half of tone but does not demonstrate how exactness conflicts with gracelessness in a way that pressures the outcome. Functional but replaceable; label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Assembly spans multiple beats: gathering components, arranging at labyrinth's edge, fitting the nut, activating the device. It directly enables the traveler's escape and cannot be swapped—without assembly, no guidance mechanism exists. The blueprint's instructions and Tomas's blood-gift method are specific to this action. Early signal, causal pressure across middle beats, and closure linkage (device warm in hand, returned to orchard) make this essential. Minor deduction: the assembly itself succeeds without complication or adaptation, reducing felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Leaving impressions without touching" is introduced late (second half: "leaving impressions on the air itself") and explained as "his gift a curse-birthed paradox." It appears in one extended beat where Tomas triggers sensors and confuses bird pursuit, enabling the traveler's escape. The method is specific and irreplaceable for the ending turn. However, late setup (missing first-third signal), single-beat use, and exposition-heavy introduction ("patterns of guidance materializing without touching") limit integration. Functional with closure linkage but no middle development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cliffside labyrinth with mechanical birds appears in setup (birds claim wanderers, labyrinth entrance), pressures middle action (birds shriek, detect motion, three collide), and participates in closure (traveler emerges, Tomas turns back past cliffs). The birds' razor wings, metallic cries, and sensor logic constrain Tomas's method and force the impression-guidance tactic. Spatial choreography (labyrinth mouth, abyss below, orchard beyond) alters movement. Environment is irreplaceable and drives multiple beats with cost connection (birds as mortal threat).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Frost deadline appears in setup ("frost line was beginning to creep down"), middle escalation ("rapidly dropping temperature," "frost line had descended further"), and ending ("first frost kisses touched Tomas's fingertips"). It tightens urgency and marks closure timing. However, the traveler's escape occurs before frost fully arrives, so the clock does not force a visible tradeoff or failure. Present across three beats with some pressure, but consequence is muted—Tomas completes the task with time to spare. Lyric reprise charges the final image but cost is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation to guide lost travelers is signaled early ("curse would soon send another traveler spiraling"), dramatized in middle action (calls into labyrinth, weaves blue light, confuses birds), and fulfilled at closure (traveler emerges alive, Tomas nods them to safety). Desire is consistent and drives assembly and activation. Minor friction: motivation is told more than conflicted—Tomas experiences burden and reluctance but not competing wants that test his commitment. The final return to the orchard reads as weary duty without a dramatized cost that foreclosed an alternative path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Graceless beauty" is invoked explicitly twice ("stumbled backward, graceless in retreat but creating beauty," "another life saved gracelessly, beautifully") and illustrated through clumsy foot slip that steadies hands and the luminous path emerging from stumbling retreat. Tone modulates across the piece—Tomas's roughness and the orchard's ominous glow cohere. However, the final paragraph's direct statement of the tone phrase feels like thesis rather than embodied effect. Tone is present and mostly coherent but leans on label rather than letting image charge the concept. Lyric reprise with modest pressure keeps this in the functional-but-stated band.</comment>
