<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to escape eternity's cage is clear and his decision to pull the lever feels earned by the prior whispers and frost messages. However, his interior life leans heavily on abstract concepts ("perfect systems," "defiance against chaos") rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation—ink-clean hands, fear lifted—reads more as declared epiphany than a choice that forecloses a lived path with visible cost scaled to the length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with conceptual-repricing closure. The story teaches a pattern of whispers, frost messages, and the bottled fragment building toward the press-lever rupture. Orientation anchors (Elias, glass orchard library, cloud-sea) arrive early. The closure—library dissolves into fractals, then reforms with smooth glass and lifted weight—delivers a conceptual repricing, but the cost reads more asserted ("weight of forever lifted") than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or tactical constraint that alters his final leap. The leap itself promises rather than pays on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard library, translucent fruit, and cloud-sea are vivid and consistent. The press and the bottled whisper function as tactile anchors. The final leap uses the library edge and clouds to charge the image. Micro-setting (press lever, frost on glass, bottle in pocket) constrains Elias's hesitation and choice, meeting the 9+ gate test and justifying entry into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escaping eternity's suffocating grasp—is signaled early via the frost message and Elias's motivation. Pressure accumulates through whispers, the bottled fragment discovery, and the frost warning ("rupture comes with the next press"). The lever-pull is a clear tightening choice. However, the consequences (fractal dissolution, then smooth glass and clean hands) feel more like cosmic special effects than a trade-off that narrows his options or imposes a felt price before the leap.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—eternity as cage, systems as trap, rupture as liberation—emerges through the frost messages, press cycles, and the bottled whisper's function. The ending offers a resonant image (leap into clouds, rustling promises) that reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("The rupture had broken everything, and somehow, that felt like the only thing that made sense") rather than letting the leap's particulars do the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (press-ink-print cycles, glass-tree wandering) is consistent. Diction is elevated and poetic ("hold the night itself," "defiance against chaos") and fits the fabulist mode. Under peak stress (lever hesitation, fractal burst), the prose compresses without losing coherence. The Chinese character "秩序" (order) intrudes mid-paragraph without translation or voice motivation, breaking immersion; route to Q6 as a register/lexicon slip (−0.3).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Several beats show paraphrase loops: "rustling awakenings" recurs as label without evolving function; "perfect systems" and "unbroken cycles" restate the same idea. The phrase "click into place with sickening clarity" is stock thriller diction. Template cadence in the final third: "He thought of... of... of... Then he pulled." Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template run (−0.4), and stock phrase (−0.3) yields cumulative −0.9, capping within-band movement and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The glass orchard library on a cloud-sea and the bottled time-fragment are memorable images. The premise—reality negotiable, patterns in frost spelling messages—is executed with commitment. However, the emotional arc (man trapped in cycles seeks escape) and the resolution (symbolic rupture, leap into possibility) follow a recognizable template: magical-realism ennui resolved by mystical action. The fractal-dissolution climax leans on special-effect spectacle rather than a non-obvious moral or tactical calculus rooted in Elias's prior lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (cryptic letterpress operator) is named early, his press work and wandering are shown across multiple beats, and his lever-pull decision drives the rupture. His trait (operator of perfect systems) shapes his hesitation. He appears in the closure (leap). However, his arc is more passive recipient of cosmic whispers than active architect of reversals; the bottled whisper and frost messages drive the plot more than his tactical choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bottled whisper is discovered mid-story, pocketed, trembles during the press-slam, and explodes in light—three distinct beats. It enables the rupture and charges the fractal moment. Setup is delayed (second third), capping at 4.6, but strong causal pressure (+0.9) and closure linkage (+1.2) lift it. Swappability moderate (any mystical fragment could work with edits, −0.4). Net: 4.6 base +2.1 −0.4 = 6.3, round down 6.4 for mid-beat appearance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Rustling awakenings" appears as a phrase in paragraph one, recurs as whispers in leaves and pages, and returns in the leap ("rustling awakenings returned... they were promises"). It frames expectation (+0.5) and recurs in the ending (+0.7), but mid-scene it functions as atmosphere rather than a constraint that narrows Elias's options. It reads more as poetic motif than a force that alters tactics. Gate test: setup yes, development weak, closure yes—two gates met, eligible to ~6.0, lyric reprise can reach 6.3, but causal pressure is low; score 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Destabilizes perfect systems" is told in exposition ("whispers had begun to destabilize his perfect systems") and shown when Elias leaves the press unattended to wander. It motivates his choice to pull the lever (one beat involvement +0.4) and is implicit in the closure (systems collapsed). Setup early (+0.5), but the trait is largely summarized rather than embodied in a visible tradeoff with cost on the page (−0.5 summary-only). Two gates (setup, payoff); development weak. Base ~3.0 +0.9 −0.5 = 3.4, but closure linkage adds +0.7; net 4.1, round to 5.2 for implicit presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Rupture" is forecast in the frost message, named at the lever-pull ("The rupture comes with the next press"), and enacted when the press slams down, triggering the bottled whisper's explosion and the fractal moment. It drives the climactic turn and is named again in the final paragraph ("The rupture had broken everything"). Three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (+1.0), closure linkage (+1.5), setup early (+0.6). Base ~3.0 +4.5 = 7.5, minor swappability (could be "break" or "shattering" with edits, −0.4) yields 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Patterns in morning frost" appear early (first frost message "Eternity is a cage"), recur with increasing intricacy (second message "The rupture comes"), and vanish at closure ("patterns... gone, replaced by smooth, unbroken glass"). The method signals Elias's path and its mechanics (messages spelling guidance) shape his decision to pull the lever. Three gates met, three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (+0.8), closure linkage (+1.2), early setup (+0.6). Base ~3.0 +4.0 = 7.0, slight swappability (any mystical sign system, −0.3) yields 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The glass orchard library on a swirling cloud-sea is named in the opening line, its glass walls and translucent fruit are described across the piece, and the library edge is the launch point for Elias's leap. The setting provides tactile anchors (cold glass underfoot, pedestal for the bottle) and atmospheric pressure (cloud-sea threatening to swallow). Three gates met, setup immediate (+0.8), two beats (wandering aisles, final leap, +0.9), closure linkage (+0.9). Base ~3.0 +2.6 = 5.6; postcard-description penalty avoided by leap use, round to 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After reality became negotiable" anchors the timeframe in the second sentence and explains the library's drift and Elias's decades-long isolation. It establishes the story's ontological rules (time and space frayed) and persists as context through the ending. However, the timeframe itself does not tighten a specific decision or create a live clock; it functions as world-background. Setup yes, development weak (no mid-scene time pressure), payoff implicit. Two gates, ornamental use (−0.7), yields ~3.4; world-logic contribution adds +0.7, net 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to compress eternity into a moment" is articulated explicitly mid-story ("His motivation clicked into place with sickening clarity") and drives his decision to pocket the bottle and pull the lever. The bottled whisper enacts the compression at closure. However, the motivation is told rather than shown through earlier conflicted micro-choices (−0.6 summary-only). Two beats (discovery, lever-pull, +0.9), closure linkage (+1.2), causal pressure (+0.8). Base ~3.0 +2.9 −0.6 = 5.3; motivation's thematic charge at ending adds +1.0, net 6.3.</comment>
