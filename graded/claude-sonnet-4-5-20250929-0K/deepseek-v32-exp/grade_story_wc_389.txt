<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is almost entirely summarized through elevated abstract labels ("tuning fork for truths," "gritty whimsy") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her descent and speech ignite change, but we never see her wrestle with a concrete dilemma on the page—she observes, interprets, and acts without visible cost or foreclosed options. The prophet and factions remain offstage voices; no secondary character applies immediate pressure in scene. Motivation is declared poetic but never tested by a choice that reveals competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece summarizes years of monitoring, then compresses "descent," "council," and "final hours" into told sequences without dramatized beats. No single on-page reversal narrows options; Elara's broadcast interpretation and decree are recounted, not shown, so causality remains outline-like. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (she finds her place between ancient and new), but the cost is asserted ("no longer lonely but not quite belonging") rather than legible in a concrete image or forfeited choice. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (observatory, radio, unclear stakes) with no payoff, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The observatory, cobalt portico, and rain-slick glass create vivid atmosphere, and the descent through storm is tactile. However, spatial choreography below the observatory is vague—crowds, councils, and the "makeshift cobalt canopy" float without anchoring who stands where or how distances shape action. The portico's blue hue is described repeatedly but never constrains a choice or charges the closure image with mechanical consequence, keeping it shy of the 9+ gate despite strong sensory work early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uniting factions under the prophet—is signaled, but all pressure (variant allegiance, betrayal, council debate) is summarized rather than dramatized. No on-page reversal forces Elara to trade one option for another; the broadcast interpretation and final decree happen offstage, so escalation reads as told intensifiers ("critical," "final hours") without causal tightening. Agency is assertion, not decision with visible cost, and the lens defaults to Causal but lacks because/therefore linkage at key turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of bridging ancient knowledge and new hope emerges through the observatory/radio motif and Elara's role as guide, and the final image of the distant portico offers a lyric callback. However, the climactic "lyrically prophetic decree" and "reconciliation across the airwaves" are summarized in elevated register ("threads of impossible hope," "ancient shadows") without concrete action or image, so the ending feels stated rather than earned. The non-literal question is present but not answered through a charged particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent elevated lyric register ("tuning fork for truths," "cerulean ghosts," "symphony of thunder and revelation"), but the narrator's perceptual signature is generic across all beats—no character-specific bias shapes what Elara notices under pressure. Dialogue appears briefly ("The prophet rises not from a crown, but from a crackle") but reads as thematic epigram rather than goal-driven speech. Distance is stable, but voice lacks specificity; diction in crisis moments ("gritty whimsy," "lyrically prophetic") asserts rather than embodies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "variant allegiance" recurs without functional change, "lyrically prophetic" appears in multiple forms (speech, decree, voice), and adjacent sentences restate ("her purpose / a gritty whimsy"; "ancient shadows / histories buried in radio waves"). Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She spoke of… She interpreted… She recalled…"), and stock metaphors ("tuning fork," "tapestry of rebellion") cluster in peak beats without fresh vehicle. Heavy scaffold (−1.2 in Q7) disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The observatory-above-clouds frame and fragmented-radio conceit offer initial freshness, but the prophet-rise plot and lone-visionary-descends-to-guide arc follow template beats without a non-obvious turn. "Variant allegiance" and "ancient shadows" remain abstract counters; no specific lived detail or moral calculus transforms the familiar structure. The ending's reconciliation-across-airwaves reads as thematic wish rather than a synthesis earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara (lonely visionary) is present throughout and her choice to descend is stated, but the decision itself is summarized ("She knew then she must descend") without on-page deliberation or visible cost. Her interpretations and decree are recounted, not dramatized, so no key turn traces directly to an embodied choice. Present and functional but replaceable with "determined scholar" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico is described early (setup), used as stage/shield, and echoed in the final paragraph, satisfying two gates. However, it is never handled or mechanically engaged—Elara steps through it once, and the "makeshift cobalt canopy" homage is decorative. The object's blue hue recurs but does not constrain a choice or reweight meaning with causal pressure; it remains atmospheric furniture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Variant allegiance is named three times ("plagued the fledgling movement," "tested their bond," "merging variant allegiances") but always summarized. It never forces an on-page tactical choice or trade-off; the decree dissolves barriers offstage. The concept frames the conflict abstractly but does not shape a dramatized beat, so it reads as thematic label rather than stake-driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Lyrically prophetic" appears as descriptor (speech, decree, voice) but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. The trait is asserted in narrative summary without showing how poetic diction creates friction, persuades, or limits options. Present as label, not as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The action "unfold" recurs (plan unfolds, action unfolds, rise unfolds, work unfolds, statement unfolds), establishing a motif of gradual revelation. The council broadcast interpretation is one key turn tied to unfolding, satisfying setup and middle gates. However, the final "work… just beginning to unfold" is a lyric echo without causal weight at closure; the verb could be replaced by "develop" or "emerge" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies are signaled early (setup), used across multiple beats (monitoring, broadcast interpretation at council, final echo), and return in the ending image, satisfying all three gates. The method enables Elara's insights and the council turn, applying causal pressure in at least two beats. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how she interprets "forgotten song" lyrics into actionable intel is summarized, not shown, so swappability with "coded messages" or similar reduces irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is established early and provides vivid atmosphere (setup). Elara's descent is a structural beat, and the final glimpse of the observatory charges the ending image (payoff), satisfying two gates. However, the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics—she leaves it, and the portico becomes symbolic rather than mechanical. Micro-setting use (body, tool) is absent, so the score remains mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the rise of a prophet" is stated and spans "years" of monitoring plus "months" tracking and "final hours," providing rough temporal scaffolding (setup). However, the clock is never tracked beat-to-beat; "one day," "during a critical council," and "final hours" are vague markers that do not tighten decisions or create urgency. No live deadline alters tactics, so time remains backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated early and drives Elara's descent and her use of radio knowledge (setup, middle). The final image of dawn and the observatory echo the desire (payoff), satisfying two gates. However, the motivation is never dramatized through conflicted choice—no on-page friction between wanting to guide and a competing cost. Told and functional but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The tone "gritty whimsy" is named twice in narrator commentary but not embodied in syntax or imagery. The prose maintains a single elevated lyric register throughout; no modulation between storm-hardened practicality and playful inflection occurs under pressure. The descriptor is asserted rather than enacted, so tone reads as uniform poeticism without the specified contrast. Present as label, not as charged variation.</comment>
