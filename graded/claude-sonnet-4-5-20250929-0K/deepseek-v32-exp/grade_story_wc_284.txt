<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear but interiority leans heavily on stock spy-thriller phrasing ("burned spy," "prudently daring") and poetic abstractions ("where unused courage waits") rather than embodied contradiction. The partnership with Anya adds a relationship under pressure, but her arc from "wary" to "courage fully awakened" reads as summary rather than dramatized struggle. Wound and sacrifice at the end provide cost, but the emotional progression feels mechanically staged rather than grounded in micro-choices that reveal competing values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (Zephyr Bluff, mist, spy context). The piece follows a causal lens: Elias decodes snow patterns → reaches Anya → broadcasts evidence → pays the price. Closure lands on the page with Elias wounded but smiling, mission accomplished, which qualifies as Decisive Change with visible cost. However, the escalation is linear rather than deepening through reversals; enemy agents arrive conveniently late, and the transmission completes without meaningful friction or tactical adaptation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff and mist provide consistent atmosphere and selective sensory detail (coiling mist, silver hush, thin cold air). The snow codes and bluff's "unique atmosphere" for transmission constrain Elias's approach and enable the climax, satisfying the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is clear across descent and cabin. Minor deduction: "peculiar formation of ice and rock" and the transmitter setup remain generic; the setting supports but does not deeply personalize the action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: expose the conspiracy and restore trust. One meaningful tightening occurs when enemy agents close in, forcing the broadcast under fire. Agency is present in Elias's choice to proceed and Anya's decision to guard. Cost is visible (Elias wounded). However, escalation feels thin—opposition materializes late without earlier friction, and the plan unfolds largely as conceived with minimal adaptation under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme of redemption and restoring broken trust emerges through particulars (pillbox, snow codes, Anya's rekindled courage). The ending image of Anya cradling the pillbox and Elias's smile offers resonance. Deductions for overt thematic statement: "he had fixed what was broken" and "the world felt whole again" are direct assertions rather than image-driven inference. "Where unused courage waits" recurs as a poetic refrain but edges toward label rather than earned embodiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent with a spy-thriller register, though it occasionally drifts into elevated poetics ("coiling like forgotten secrets," "silver hush") that feel imposed rather than character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("I come alone," "I vouchsafe this drive to you"). Perceptual signature is generic; Elias's way of noticing does not reveal distinct bias or idiom beyond the mission focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear with varied sentence openings and paragraph rhythm. Multiple artifacts lower momentum: "The burned spy felt the world's tilt toward spring" (passive filter stack), "prudently daring" (label without embodiment), and paraphrase loops ("fixing what was broken" / "fix what was broken" / "fixed what was broken" across three beats). Stock metaphors ("mist coiling like forgotten secrets," "silver hush") and template cadence in action beats ("He opened… His motivation sharpened… He began…") reduce density. Proximity to closure (final paragraph moralizing) triggers high-band disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Core premise—burned spy seeks redemption via coded intel drop—follows a familiar espionage template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Snow codes and mist setting add atmospheric texture but do not fundamentally alter the familiar arc. "Vouchsafe" and "pillbox" offer period flavor, yet the emotional beats (wary ally → trust restored, lone mission → sacrifice) hit predictable marks. The piece executes competently within genre but does not synthesize a fresh angle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias appears early, drives the descent and broadcast plan, makes the choice to proceed under fire, and pays the cost (wounded). His decisions create key turns: seeking Anya, activating the transmitter, accepting the wound. Swappable with "disgraced operative" or similar without fundamental change; "burned spy" functions more as label than irreplaceable trait. Present across three gates and closure, but specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Pillbox introduced early (paragraph 3), opened mid-story to reveal encrypted drive, and reappears in the final image when Anya cradles it as "symbol of their restored faith." Two distinct beats (opening, final symbol). However, it could be replaced by any small keepsake container (locket, case) without altering logic. Closure reprise is thematic rather than causally active; the drive, not the pillbox itself, carries the mission-critical data.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fixing what's broken" frames Elias's motivation early and recurs at closure ("he had fixed what was broken"). It shapes stakes (restore trust, expose conspiracy) and the broadcast plan addresses it directly. Present across all three gates. Deduction: the concept is articulated more than dramatized—trust is declared restored rather than shown through a micro-choice that foreclose another path. Cost is present (wound) but the "fix" itself reads as summary.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" appears once as a label in paragraph 6 ("guided his steps; he moved with caution, but each breath was a risk") and implicitly informs the plan (stealth approach, broadcast under fire). No on-page moment where caution visibly costs him an opportunity or daring forces a visible sacrifice. The trait is told rather than tested in a choice with tradeoff. Swappable with "careful" or "bold" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears twice: paragraph 22 (Elias offers the drive to Anya) and paragraph 14 (interior vow). The act of entrusting evidence to Anya is central to the partnership turn and enables the broadcast. Present at setup (vow), middle (offer), and implicit at closure (transmission completes the vouchsafing). Replacing with "give" or "entrust" would not break logic; the archaism adds flavor but the action itself is standard intel transfer.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Snow codes introduced early (paragraph 7), guide descent (paragraph 16), and are revisited at the transmitter setup (paragraph 31). Mechanics: patterns laid by a contact, read by Elias, contain meeting coordinates. The method enables two beats (navigation, broadcast positioning) and shapes tactics. Specificity is moderate; replacing with "radio signal" or "map coordinates" would require minor edits but not break causality. Cost connection is indirect; the codes are pathway, not obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff introduced in opening line, provides mist cover throughout, and its "unique atmosphere" enables the broadcast at closure. Setting pressures choices: descent navigation, cabin approach, transmitter positioning. Micro-setting test satisfied (mist as shield, bluff's atmosphere as transmission resource). Present across all three gates and causally active at closure. Deduction: the bluff could be replaced by any high ridge with atmospheric interference; specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Tilt toward spring" appears in paragraphs 2, 18, and 33 as atmospheric backdrop and thematic accent (renewal, hope). Time does not tighten decisions—no live clock constrains the broadcast or enemy approach. The phrase is ornamental rather than tactical; removing it would not alter pacing or stakes. Present at setup and closure (lyric reprise) but no middle development where seasonal pressure affects a choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Where unused courage waits" frames Elias's quest (paragraph 5) and returns at closure (paragraph 36, "they had found it"). The motivation drives his descent and partnership with Anya, whose "unused courage" awakens (paragraph 30). Present across three gates and shapes the emotional arc. Deduction: the phrase is poetic abstraction rather than concrete desire tested against competing needs; "courage" is declared awakened rather than shown through a micro-choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Silver hush" appears in paragraphs 9, 20, and implicitly at closure (mist clearing). Tone is consistent—muted, contemplative, atmospherically charged—and modulates slightly under pressure (shot rings out, mist clears). The tone supports the bluff setting and charges the final image (sacrifice in stillness). However, "silver hush" itself is a static descriptor; replacing with "quiet" or "stillness" would not alter the effect. Present at setup and closure; middle development is implicit rather than reweighted.</comment>
