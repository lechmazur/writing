<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's "involuntarily truthful nature" is asserted but never tested with cost—she speaks freely to empty air and willing ears, no dilemma forces her candor into conflict. Her motivation "to preserve wonder" remains a label recycled across paragraphs without embodied contradiction or a micro-choice that forecloses a path. Kael appears functional but flat, existing to receive exposition. The ending choice—spray water, recite riddle—feels mechanically solved rather than earned by prior struggle or competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. The closure unit—lights restore, Elara smiles at preserved wonder—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt, but cost is invisible: no relationship altered, no opportunity lost, no stance crystallized with felt price. The riddle's mechanics (condensation triggers reboot) are told in a single exposition exchange, collapsing causality into convenient summary. Drive lens reads Causal by intent, yet the problem-solve bypasses escalation—water spray fixes the city-wide failure instantly, no tightening or deepening pressure evident on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower and drone beehive provide vivid sci-fi anchors, and "nectar-dusk" offers consistent tonal color. The summit climb and water-spray action involve the setting physically, constraining the repair attempt to the tower's rods. However, the lacquer box and matchbox function as portable props without altering spatial choreography or offering location-based obstacles. The setting charges the final image modestly (tower as sentinel), meeting the lower edge of integration but not shaping a decisive tactic or closure cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore power to preserve wonder—is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or narrowed option. The single reversal (riddle understood → water applied → lights on) occurs through exposition and instant mechanical success, no visible cost or agency test. Kael's arrival and cooperation are friction-free; no competing pressures, lost resource, or moral calculus complicate the solve. The ending declares wonder preserved without demonstrating what was risked or renounced to achieve it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Preserve wonder in routine" is stated repeatedly but never dramatized through a choice that sacrifices convenience or safety for mystery. The riddle-solve delivers thematic repetition ("wonder remained, woven into the fabric of the night") rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The lacquer box's "secret shared, its magic lingering" gestures at mystery without cost or ambiguity—no counter-reading emerges, no complexity earned. The final paragraphs loop the same abstraction, trading scene pressure for summary assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—"compelled by her attribute," "her truthfulness sharpening her insight"—is told rather than shown through selective attention or voice-specific diction. Dialogue is minimal and functional but carries little subtext; Kael's "The bee drones are dead" and Elara's reply feel expository rather than goal-driven. Syntactic variety is present, but recurring stems ("She opened," "She closed," "She walked") and templated paragraph openings ("The drone beehive," "The lacquer box," "The nectar-dusk") flatten rhythm in the final third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the final third: "wonder remained" / "wonder that saved us" / "preserve the wonder" / "guard wonder like a precious flame" recycle the same abstraction across six paragraphs. Template cadence runs—"She opened… She closed… She walked… She had…"—flatten propulsion. The riddle exchange summarizes key causality ("condensation… sensors got wet") rather than dramatizing discovery. Figurative language ("canvas for wonder," "lullaby of restored harmony") stacks without coherent vehicle. Clarity holds, but density and momentum erode under synonym churn and scaffold repetition in peak and closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The lightning-collection tower and drone-beehive infrastructure offer fresh sci-fi texture, and "involuntarily truthful toll keeper" promises a constraint-based turn. Yet the execution defaults to a fetch-quest template: find riddle, decode clue, apply solution, restore status quo. The water-spray reboot mechanic arrives via exposition without prior foreshadowing or cost, reading as a late rule introduction. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis; the emotional arc (preserve wonder) could transfer to any restoration plot with minor edits. Nectar-dusk color and lacquer-box motif add atmosphere but do not transform familiar material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and delivers key exposition (reading the riddle aloud, instructing Kael to spray water), but her candor never creates a turn or cost—her involuntary truthfulness is not tested by a conflicting interest or secret. She observes, facilitates, and narrates theme but makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development weak; swappable with a generic cooperative protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lacquer box appears in three beats: Elara opens it to reveal the matchbox, carries it during the climb, and closes it at the end. Each mention involves physical handling, meeting the two-beat threshold. However, its function is purely container—removing it would require only minor edits (riddle on loose paper). The final "soft click, a promise kept" attempts charged reprise but the box's unique properties (mother-of-pearl inlay) never constrain a choice or enable a tactic. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; causal pressure absent; mid-band ceiling applies.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drone beehive failure is the inciting incident, frames the blackout stakes, and the repair (water-triggered reboot) directly resolves the plot. Present in opening exposition, Kael's report, the riddle decode, and the summit action—four beats. Shapes both problem and solution, meeting setup, development, and payoff gates with clear causal pressure. However, the mechanics (wet sensors disrupted navigation) are explained in one exchange rather than discovered through trial, and the fix is instant with no visible cost or tactical constraint beyond "climb and spray." Strong integration shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Involuntarily truthful" is asserted in the opening ("her involuntarily truthful nature making her whisper facts") and restated twice ("unable to lie," "her truthfulness sharpening her insight") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. No scene forces her to choose between honesty and safety, loyalty, or convenience. The trait exists as a label without friction or consequence. Setup gate met (first paragraph); middle development and payoff gates missed. Functional mention, no causal work; replaceable with "observant" or "honest" with zero structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Reveal" appears in three forms: Elara reads the riddle aloud (inciting the decode), hands Kael the matchbox (enabling his insight), and the text declares "The revelation felt urgent" and "testament to revelation born from honesty." The riddle-sharing enables the key turn (understanding condensation triggers reboot), meeting setup and development gates. However, the action itself—speaking or handing over—is mechanically simple; the story hinges on the riddle's content, not the act of revealing. One causal beat; closure participation via thematic echo but not decisive image. Mid-band: shapes a turn but swappable with "discover" or "solve" with minor phrase edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The matchbox containing the riddle is opened, read aloud, handed to Kael, interpreted, and later placed back in the lacquer box—five touches across setup, middle, and ending. Its cryptic content ("When the tower weeps…") is the key that unlocks the repair mechanic, providing clear causal pressure. However, the riddle is decoded in a single exposition exchange with no trial-and-error or cost; the matchbox itself (as container/object) could be replaced by a folded note with zero structural change. All three gates met; causal role in one major beat; specificity weak (cardboard worn soft, but this detail doesn't matter). Mid-band: functional and present but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower is the central location, appears in the title-like opening phrase, houses Elara's post, and is climbed for the repair action. At the summit, the collection rods are sprayed to simulate rain, directly enacting the solution—setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The tower's vertical structure (climb required) and specific equipment (rods that collect lightning and weep condensation) shape the repair tactic. However, spatial choreography is loose (no obstacles during climb, no resource scarcity tied to tower layout), and the ending's "silent sentinel" reprise is atmospheric rather than causally charged. Two beats with clear causal work; closure participation modest; essential but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"After the city-wide blackout" anchors the inciting condition and frames urgency throughout. The repair restores lights, creating a clear before/after. However, elapsed time is never tracked—no clock tightens decisions, no stamina cost, no deadline pressure. The blackout is situation rather than ticking constraint; removing "after" and writing "during an ongoing blackout" would not alter any choice or tactic. Setup and payoff gates met (bookend blackout → lights on); middle development weak (time doesn't narrow options). Functional frame, no escalation grip; mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To preserve wonder in routine" is stated six times across the text, anchoring Elara's motive from the opening ("She had always sought to preserve wonder") through the ending ("guard wonder like a precious flame"). However, no on-page choice forces her to trade wonder against safety, efficiency, or another want. The repair itself is frictionless—water spray, lights restore—with no moment where preserving mystery costs convenience or risks failure. Setup and thematic closure participation met; middle friction absent. Told desire with no embodied conflict; label-only trends low despite heavy repetition. Functional but not dramatized; swappable with "restore hope" or "protect beauty" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Nectar-dusk" appears nine times, coloring the sky ("nectar-dusk hues of amber and violet," "nectar-dusk glow," "nectar-dusk faded to night," "nectar-dusk sky") and anchoring the opening fragility ("like a dream at nectar-dusk—a sweet, fading light"). Tone is cohesive, bittersweet-to-hopeful, and the phrase charges the final star-twinkling image modestly. However, the tone remains static across beats—no modulation under pressure, no tonal shift that marks the turn from blackout to restoration. Setup and payoff gates met; middle modulation absent. Consistent atmospheric layer that supports ending but does not deepen with escalation. Mid-band: coherent but not dynamic.</comment>
