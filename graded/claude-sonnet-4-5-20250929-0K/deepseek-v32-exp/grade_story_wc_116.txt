<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper remains an abstraction throughout—"they" observe and witness but never make a choice that forecloses an option with visible cost. Interiority consists of philosophical labels ("grips reality loosely," "witnessing change without judgment") rather than embodied contradiction or struggle. The journey to the refuge and return involves no decision or renunciation that alters their state; the keeper begins and ends in the same stance. No micro-choices under pressure appear on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece lacks an on-page closure unit with felt cost. The keeper walks to the refuge, sits, reflects, and returns unchanged; no decisive change, renunciation with foreclosed path, or conceptual repricing occurs. Orientation is delayed—who/where/when remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The drive lens is ambiguous (lyric-accumulative or situational?), never clarifying by closure, which caps Q2 at 7.2 and all others at 8.0 per cross-caps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and atmospheric (moss, obsidian walls, subterranean river) but remain decorative; the overgrown library and refuge do not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the origami swan as micro-setting object appears multiple times, but it functions as a portal device without pressing the keeper's options. The environment charges mood but does not drive a beat or the final image with cost, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled or tested. The keeper seeks "regenerative silence," reaches it without obstacle, and returns—no tightening, deepening, or reversal occurs. No choice narrows options; no cost is paid; no agency (decision, renunciation, endurance with foreclosed path) appears on the page. Pressure remains flat from beginning to end, violating the escalation requirement under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of decay-as-transformation and witnessing-without-judgment is asserted repeatedly in philosophical summary ("crumbling peace," "beautiful, endless fall") rather than emerging from concrete action. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "In this way, the chronicle keeper endured, a witness to the beautiful, endless fall"—a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure (−0.6). No epiphany is earned through struggle; the keeper's stance is declared, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("yawned open," "palpable stillness," "symphony of quiet endings"), but perceptual signature remains generic—any contemplative observer could narrate these images. POV is stable third-limited, yet interiority consists of thematic labels rather than character-particular thought. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition are present, but the piece does not teach a clear lyric pattern by the first quarter that pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "witness change without judgment" / "witnessing change without judgment" / "to witness change without judgment"; "regenerative silence" appears five times in identical phrasing; "grips reality loosely" / "gripping reality loosely" / "to grip reality loosely." Template cadence runs ("The keeper [verb]…") appear across multiple beats. Figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching ("river of its own," "symphony of quiet endings," "beautiful, endless fall"). Applying artifact penalties: paraphrase loops (−0.6), template cadence (−0.5), register drift into philosophical abstraction (−0.4), total deduction ≈−1.5, and artifacts touch the final third, capping all categories at 8.8 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—contemplative keeper visits refuge for renewal—follows a familiar meditative-journey template without transformation. Specific images (origami swan, obsidian refuge) are present but ornamental; the emotional arc and plot function identically if replaced with generic portals and sanctuaries. No fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis appears; the piece reads as a mood exercise rather than a story with stakes. The turn or reweighting required for originality is absent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper is present throughout but makes no choice that creates a turn or alters tactics. Observation without decision dominates; the keeper's actions (walking, unfolding the swan, sitting, returning) are procedural, not causal. Late first appearance of agency constraint and no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge appears in setup (first third via motivation), is reached and used in the middle (sitting by the river), and returns in the final image ("The obsidian refuge waited, always"). It constrains one beat (the sitting/reflection sequence) but does not shape a choice with cost. Two beats touched; closure participation via final mention; no causal pressure or irreplaceability (any sanctuary could serve the same function). Caps at ~6.0 under two-gate guidance; slight positive for closure mention but no cost tied to it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is named repeatedly and serves as thematic backdrop but does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics. It is claimed as the keeper's goal and achieved without obstacle, making it ornamental. No cost or choice tied to the concept; swappable with "peace," "stillness," or "renewal."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is mentioned three times as a label but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. It describes the keeper's philosophical stance without on-page friction or tradeoff. Pure ornamental use; no beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Burrow" appears in setup ("must burrow deep"), drives the journey beat ("burrowed into the fold"), and recurs in the final third ("They burrowed not away from the world"). It shapes one turn (entering the fold) but is easily swappable with "descend" or "pass through." Two beats touched; no irreplaceable causal role or cost. Functional but replaceable, mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The origami swan is signaled early, used twice (entering and sealing the pathway), and held in the keeper's palm at closure. Its mechanics matter (folding/unfolding) and it gates access to the refuge, shaping two beats. However, any enchanted object could serve the same function; specificity does not create irreplaceability. Two beats, closure participation, but swappable, capping near 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The overgrown library is present in the opening and closing frames and described vividly, but it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. Postcard description dominates; the keeper moves through it without the setting altering tactics. One beat (framing) involvement; no causal role. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" appears as a poetic phrase in the opening, middle, and final third, but time remains vague and untracks. No live clock tightens decisions; the keeper's vigil spans unspecified eons without urgency. Ornamental; time does not shape tactics or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"To witness change without judgment" is stated as the keeper's motivation in setup and repeated verbatim at closure, but it is never dramatized through conflicted choice. The keeper's desire faces no friction or cost on the page. Told-only; no beat involvement where want conflicts with obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Crumbling peace" is coherent and recurs through imagery (moss, decay, obsidian stillness), modulating slightly as the keeper reflects. Tone charges the final image ("Peace crumbled, and in the crumbs, new silence grew"), but the mood remains static rather than escalating under pressure. One meaningful reprise at closure; no dynamic shift tied to stakes. Mid-band for coherence and closure participation without tonal escalation.</comment>
