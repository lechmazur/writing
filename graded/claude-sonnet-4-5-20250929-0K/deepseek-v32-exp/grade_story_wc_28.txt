<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated but rarely tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The retrocognitive trap functions largely as told backstory rather than embodied constraint that forces micro-choices under pressure. The renaming feels declared rather than earned through visible cost; the "aberrant mercy" that loosens her visions arrives without dramatized struggle or forfeiture. Internal states are often summarized in elevated register ("profound, weary protection") rather than shown through embodied perception and contradictory action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation by ~120 words and follows a single continuous scene. The closure—Elara renaming herself and feeling the retrocognitive trap loosen—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: the visions "did not vanish, but their hold loosened" without showing what she sacrificed or how her options narrowed. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (retrocognitive visions → tessera warmth → name whispered → trap cracks), but the tightening lacks a visible price that forecloses a path on the page. The phrase "aberrant mercy" names the effect without making the conceptual or felt cost legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ancient plaza, shattered sky, and mosaic fragments anchor the scene early and create atmospheric pressure. The minaret mosaic tessera returns with reweighted meaning at closure (grows warm, prompts renaming), and the chipped patterns guide Elara's tactile discovery, meeting the Q3 9+ test. The "warm coldness" is repeated throughout and modulates slightly at the end ("balance she could embrace"), but sensory selection remains static rather than varying with urgency. Spatial choreography is clear; the setting constrains choice minimally beyond providing the tessera and stepping stone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—breaking free from retrocognitive imprisonment—is signaled early but lacks a live on-page test with visible trade-offs. Elara's agency is limited: she kneels, traces patterns, and whispers a new name without encountering resistance or paying a dramatized price. The "aberrant mercy" that loosens the visions arrives as coincidence rather than protagonist-driven escalation. One tightening (realizing the patterns form a map of states of being) changes knowledge but does not narrow options or force a choice between competing goods. The ending reconfigures her stance, but the cost—what she gives up or risks—is not made legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of empathy armored by steel emerges from the premise but is stated rather than dramatized through scene pressure. The renaming and the phrase "aberrant mercy" function as thematic labels without grounding in specific, non-obvious particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "empathy felt not like a weakness, but like the strongest steel of all" and "her heart armored yet open, a living paradox" deliver the thesis in prompt-like language, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The minaret mosaic tessera recurs with reweighted meaning, but the chipped patterns remain ornamental—they guide her thought without constraining her choice or charging the closure with felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction elevates at emotional peaks ("profound, weary protection," "living paradox") in ways that read more as authorial commentary than character-particular perception under stress. The perceptual signature is present but generic: "the cool clay on her fingertips, a stark contrast to the present's warm coldness" uses stock sensory contrasts. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew," "she realized") cluster in the middle third without voice motivation. Psychic distance narrows appropriately at the renaming beat, and the final image maintains coherent stance. No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "The visions did not vanish, but their hold loosened, becoming echoes rather than shackles" restates the same idea twice without adding pressure. Template cadence runs in the final paragraph: "The warm coldness… persisted… To cradle empathy… Elara—now Aeliana—walked… each step…" with repetitive "the" + noun openings. Figurative language is dense but mixed: "hooks of past moments" and "prisons of sensation" overlap metaphorically; "cradling empathy in arms of steel" is repeated across multiple beats without evolution. Stock phrases ("beneath a shattered sky," "the hollow air") and elevated register ("aberrant mercy," "living paradox") appear in peak beats without POV grounding. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate the retrocognitive trap and empathy-armor motif without new detail. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops −0.3, template cadence −0.4, stock metaphor strings −0.3, total baseline −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—retrocognitively trapped warrior seeks release through renaming—is functional but derivative of fantasy/SF tropes without fresh transformation. The "gentle radical" and "warm coldness" labels gesture at paradox without grounding it in specific, non-obvious choices. The renaming as liberation follows a familiar template; the "aberrant mercy" that releases her is convenient rather than earned through prior particulars. Emotional truth is present but abstract: "empathy could be armored, not abandoned" states the theme without embodying it in a scene-specific dilemma. The mosaic tessera and chipped patterns offer sensory specificity but do not transform the core arc in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara/"gentle radical" is present throughout and her final decision to rename herself alters her internal stance. However, the choice arrives without visible cost or friction: she whispers the new name and the trap loosens via "aberrant mercy" rather than through her own struggle. She is more observer than decision-maker across the middle beats; the retrocognitive visions and the tessera guide her rather than forcing her to choose between competing goods. The character is functional but replaceable—remove "gentle radical" and substitute "haunted survivor" with minor edits. Early signal +0.3, two beats (kneeling, renaming) +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, minus swappability −0.6, minus ornamental interiority −0.5, minus late-middle development −0.3, minus summary renaming −0.4. Gate check: setup present, middle development weak (she traces patterns without cost), payoff present but not causally driven. Eligible up to ~6.0 on two gates; strong causal pressure absent. Net: 3.0 + 1.9 − 1.8 = 3.1, round down 3.1 → cap at two-gate ceiling ~6.0, actual 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The minaret mosaic tessera appears early (first third), is handled in two beats (kneeling discovery, warming at renaming), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure. Its presence charges the final image and signals beauty that "refused to be erased," providing a tangible link to pre-fire faith. However, the tessera does not constrain a choice or impose cost—it enables rather than complicates. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (cobalt and gold fragment) +0.5, minus no causal pressure −0.8, minus no cost −0.4. Gate check: all three gates present. Net: 3.0 + 3.2 − 1.2 = 5.0, lyric reprise adds +0.8 for reweighted meaning, total 5.8, plus strong closure linkage lifts to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is introduced late (final third) as a label for the universe's unexpected leniency. It names the effect of the retrocognitive trap loosening but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page—it arrives as a coincidence that solves the problem rather than a contested outcome. The concept is thematic summary without prior causality. Late first appearance (final third) −1.0, ornamental label −0.8, resolves problem it did not create −1.3 (dominant limiter, cap 3.0). Net: 3.0 − 1.3 = 1.7, plus label-only −0.8 within band brings to 0.9, but lyric resonance at closure adds +0.4 for conceptual charge despite lack of prior grounding, final 1.3. Adjusting for two-gate presence (setup absent, middle absent, payoff present as thematic claim) and late introduction cap at 3.0: final 3.2 via marginal closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is introduced early and described across multiple beats (visions of artisans, "prisons of sensation and sound"). It constrains Elara's present state and motivates her quest for release. However, the trait functions mostly as told backstory; we see one vision mid-scene (artisans placing tesserae) but no on-page moment where the trap forces her to abandon a tactic or pay a visible cost. The renaming loosens the trap without showing what she risks or trades. Early signal +0.6, one beat (artisan vision) +0.4, closure linkage (trap "shudders and cracks") +1.0, minus summary-only constraint −0.6, minus no visible cost −0.5. Gate check: setup present, middle development marginal (one vision), payoff present. Net: 3.0 + 2.0 − 1.1 = 3.9, round down 3.9, but three-gate presence lifts eligibility, final 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The action "rename" is signaled mid-story ("she must rename herself") and executed at the climax ("Whispering the new name to the hollow air, 'Aeliana'"). It defines the story's major turn: her identity shift is the mechanism of release from retrocognitive imprisonment. Removing this action would collapse the closure unit. However, the renaming lacks visible cost—she whispers and the trap cracks via "aberrant mercy" rather than through struggle or forfeiture. Early signal (mid-story, ~40%) +0.5, one distinct beat (whispering) +0.4, causal pressure (redefines options) +1.0, closure linkage (shapes ending) +1.4, specificity (the act of naming) +0.6, minus no visible cost −0.6. Gate check: setup mid-story, development weak, payoff strong. Net: 3.0 + 3.9 − 0.6 = 6.3, plus strong closure linkage and irreplaceability lift to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone" is introduced early (second paragraph) and guides Elara's tactile discovery mid-scene. The method is purposeful: tracing the grooves reveals a "map of states of being" that leads her to the insight she must rename herself. The patterns constrain her path (intuitive dialogue with ancient art) and charge the moment of realization. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no on-page detail of what specific groove or fracture corresponds to which insight. Early signal +0.7, one beat (tracing) +0.4, causal pressure (shapes attempt) +0.8, closure linkage (prompts renaming) +1.0, specificity (chipped grooves) +0.4, minus abstract mechanics −0.5. Gate check: all three gates present. Net: 3.0 + 3.3 − 0.5 = 5.8, round down 5.8, lyric reprise (stepping stone → final image) adds +0.5 for reweighted meaning, final 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" anchors the scene early and provides atmospheric pressure. The plaza offers the mosaic stepping stone and tessera, which are essential to the plot. The "warm coldness" of the environment is repeated and modulates slightly at closure. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—it supplies resources but does not force Elara to abandon a tactic or navigate obstacles. The shattered sky is ornamental; its presence does not alter her options. Early signal +0.7, one beat (kneeling in plaza) +0.4, closure linkage (final image in plaza) +0.9, minus postcard description (shattered sky as backdrop) −0.7, minus no constraint on choice −0.6. Gate check: all three gates present. Net: 3.0 + 2.0 − 1.3 = 3.7, lyric reprise (plaza anchor → "walked slowly from the plaza") adds +0.5, micro-setting (mosaic stepping stone) adds +0.8 for charged specificity, final 5.0. Adjusting for atmospheric contribution and object-as-micro-setting, final 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the great fire" establishes the timeframe early and shapes the world state (scorched stones, ash-heat). The fire is a past event that motivates Elara's quest but does not impose a live on-page deadline or tighten her decisions. Time remains static throughout the single continuous scene—no clock pressure or urgency that alters her tactics. Early signal +0.6, one beat (retrocognitive vision of fire) +0.4, minus vague/untracked present time −0.7, minus no live deadline −0.8. Gate check: setup present, middle development absent (no time pressure), payoff marginal (fire echoes at end). Two-gate eligibility caps near ~6.0, but weak development and static time lower score. Net: 3.0 + 1.0 − 1.5 = 2.5, plus thematic charge at closure +0.4, final 2.9. Adjusting for world-state framing and post-event timeframe contribution, final 4.6 under cap for missing middle development gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated early and repeated across beats. It frames Elara's mission and is invoked at closure ("to make it safe"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no on-page moment where Elara must choose between protecting empathy and another value or pay a visible cost to uphold it. The "gentle radical" label points to the desire but we do not see friction between her want and the cost of defending empathy. Early signal +0.7, two beats (opening, closing) +0.9, closure linkage (final image) +1.0, minus told-only −0.8, minus no friction/cost −0.7. Gate check: all three gates present. Net: 3.0 + 2.6 − 1.5 = 4.1, lyric reprise adds +0.5, thematic charge adds +0.4, final 5.0. Adjusting for strong thematic presence and closure linkage despite lack of dramatized friction, final 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is introduced early (first paragraph: "a peculiar blend of lingering ash-heat and the chilling void") and repeated at mid-scene and closure. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly: initially it evokes devastation, then at the end it becomes "a balance she could embrace." The oxymoron charges the final image and reflects Elara's internal shift. However, tone remains static across the middle beats without variation by pressure—no sentence-level modulation that tightens or breathes with scene urgency. Early signal +0.7, three beats (opening, mid-scene, closing) +1.4, closure linkage (charges final image) +1.2, specificity (ash-heat + void) +0.5, minus static mood in middle −0.6. Gate check: all three gates present. Net: 3.0 + 3.8 − 0.6 = 5.2, strong closure charge and lyric coherence add +0.6, final 5.8. Adjusting for atmospheric consistency and reweighted meaning at closure, final 6.1.</comment>
