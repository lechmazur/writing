<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's core motivation—to document small gestures—is declared but rarely tested in scene; her walking patterns and survivor guilt remain told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The "benevolently ruthless" trait is label-only; no on-page choice shows her discarding a narrative or destroying an illusion with visible cost. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra") rather than embodied, character-particular thought. The final "forgive" pattern and emotional release read as summary rather than earned transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—words spelled by footsteps and echoing gallery acoustics accumulate toward a final pattern ("peace"). Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and what the interregnum entails remain vague past the ~120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (healing via pattern completion), but the cost is asserted ("heart lighter") rather than shown; no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift marks the before/after. The pawn-less chessboard and walking motifs recur but never constrain a choice or narrow options. Linkage is thematic accumulation without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is vivid and functional: echoes carry her spelled words and amplify the mantra, constraining her method. The pawn-less chessboard appears twice and charges the final image by shifting from "lack" to "potential," meeting the micro-setting gate. Sensory detail is selective (marble floor, curved walls, "smooth wood"), though the interregnum itself remains abstract—no street-level grounding or social texture. Spatial choreography is clear. The environment shapes her ritual but does not force a tactical choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—documenting small gestures before they fade—is signaled early but never tested by a live obstacle or competing pressure. Elara's walking patterns progress from "remember" to "listen" to "forgive" to "hope" to "peace," a lyric sequence without reversal or tightening; each step is additive, not a narrowing of options. The nomadic penumbra and chessboard remain symbolic rather than sources of conflict. No cost is legible on the page: her "task complete" and "heart lighter" are declared outcomes, not dramatized forfeitures or renunciations. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight; here it simply layers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—preservation of small gestures amid upheaval—emerges from the walking ritual and chessboard metaphor. The final image (pawn-less board as "clean slate") reweights lack as potential, a conceptual move that fits the premise. However, the piece leans heavily on prompt labels ("luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra," "benevolently ruthless") rather than grounding insight in concrete particulars. The stranger sharing bread is the sole specific gesture; others remain abstract. The ending offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing, though the mantra ("forgive," "hope," "peace") edges toward sermonizing in tone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable, but the prose voice converges with the prompt's vocabulary ("luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra," "benevolently ruthless") rather than filtering through Elara's particular idiom. Diction remains elevated and essay-like throughout, even under emotional pressure ("to unbind her own trauma" reads as clinical summary). No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic: Elara notices symbols and themes rather than idiosyncratic sensory detail. The walking patterns are purposeful but the narrative texture around them is uniform and abstract, lacking the specificity that would distinguish her voice from authorial commentary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "She + verb" and "The [noun] + verb" stems repeat across nearly every paragraph without variation. Paraphrase loops appear ("to unbind the stories trapped in silence" / "She had unbound the stories"), and synonym churn cycles through "spelled," "tracing," "pattern" without adding pressure. Figurative language ("luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra") recurs in most beats without reweighting, creating density without propulsion. The final third stacks abstract claims ("embracing this luminous absence," "woven into the very fabric," "promise of a history written in gestures") that summarize rather than advance. Apply patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.2 for template cadence + loops + figurative muddle across closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The walking-that-spells-words method and whispering-gallery acoustics offer a fresh premise, and the pawn-less chessboard as "clean slate" provides a non-obvious image. However, the story leans on prompt vocabulary as conceptual shorthand rather than transforming it through lived detail: "crisis actor who was a real crisis survivor," "benevolently ruthless," "nomadic penumbra" function as labels. The emotional arc (trauma → healing via ritual) follows a template resolution. The stranger's bread is the sole specific gesture; others remain abstracted. Risk-taking is modest: the structure is linear accumulation without bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Crisis actor / real crisis survivor is introduced early and frames Elara's dual role, but her choices do not pivot on this duality. The plague memory informs her motivation but does not create a turn or cost on the page. She observes and documents rather than making decisions that alter tactics. Present in setup and referenced in closure, but no middle development where the trait constrains action. Two gates met (setup, closure mention); lacks causal pressure. Swappable with "trauma survivor" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pawn-less chessboard appears twice: once as symbol of "society in transition" and later reweighted as "clean slate" for new beginnings. It is handled (she runs a finger along the edge) and its absence shifts meaning at closure. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it remains metaphorical. Three gates met (setup, development presence, closure participation), but role is thematic rather than causal. The exact missing pawns matter to the image, lifting irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Nomadic penumbra" is introduced early and recurs in five beats, described as a shifting shadow that "absorbs light" and "pulses with memories." It accompanies Elara but never constrains or enables an action; it is a visual motif that decorates rather than drives. Setup present, closure presence (it "faded into the light"), but no middle choice where it alters tactics. Label-only use across beats. Could be removed without changing plot or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is declared twice: once as character summary and once as motivation ("discarding grand narratives to focus on the minute"). No on-page action demonstrates this trait in conflict—she does not destroy an illusion, discard a narrative, or make a ruthless choice with visible cost. The attribute is told, not shown. Setup present, but no development or closure participation. Swappable with "determined" or "focused."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears three times: unbinding stories trapped in silence, unbinding the past from forgetfulness, and unbinding her own trauma by spelling "forgive." It frames the arc and participates in closure, but the mechanics remain abstract—no physical or tactical constraint shows what "unbinding" entails beyond walking and reflection. Setup and closure gates met; middle use is thematic repetition. Could be replaced with "release" or "free" without major structural change. The final "she had unbound the stories" claims success without showing the decisive act.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Walking that spells words is introduced early, used across five beats ("remember," "listen," "forgive," "hope," "peace"), and the gallery's acoustics echo each word to create a mantra effect. The method shapes every attempt and charges the closure. However, the mechanics are consistent without complication—no moment where the pattern fails or must adapt under pressure. All three gates met; beat involvement high; causal pressure moderate (the method enables ritual but does not narrow options). Specificity and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is anchored early, its acoustics enable Elara's walking-word method, and the space frames the entire ritual. The curved walls amplify her steps into echoes, a functional constraint that defines her tactic. It reappears in closure ("the gallery fell silent"). All three gates met; the setting supplies a resource (acoustic amplification) and charges the final image. However, it does not force a choice under pressure or alter her plan. Micro-setting use is strong; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The interregnum is mentioned in the opening and closing, establishing a between-time when "authority had dissolved" and "small gestures could either fade or shine." It provides thematic context but does not create a ticking clock or force a time-constrained decision. Elara's ritual unfolds without temporal pressure. Setup and closure gates met; no middle development where the timeframe tightens tactics. Swappable with "post-crisis period" or "transition" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to become historian of small gestures is declared early, drives her walking ritual, and frames closure ("history written in gestures, not grand deeds"). It appears in six beats and shapes her focus (ignoring grand narratives, documenting the stranger's bread). However, it is never conflicted—no moment where this want clashes with a competing need or cost. Setup, development (repeated focus), and closure participation all present. Friction between want and cost is absent; the desire is pursued without obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" is named four times and establishes a paradoxical tone: loss that illuminates, emptiness that glows. The pawn-less board and fading penumbra reinforce this tone at closure. However, the tone remains static—no modulation under pressure; the mood is consistently meditative and abstract from start to finish. Setup and closure gates met; no middle intensification. The phrase charges the final image but could be replaced with "pregnant emptiness" or similar without changing emotional arc. Coherence without dynamic shift trends mid-band.</comment>
