<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and character-particular—"feral nostalgia had me in its jaws, shaking me like a rag doll" embodies rather than labels. The jealousy of past selves is grounded in specific images (thirty-year-old planting a tree, knowing the marriage will crumble), creating genuine internal contradiction. However, the final turn to "quiet…soar, inside my chest" feels somewhat asserted rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose options; the cost of chronicling is articulated but the renunciation or stance crystallization remains diffuse. Motivation is present and intensifies, but the ending resolves tension through summary reflection rather than a decisive micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (lucid dream chronicler), where (mountain ranger cabin), and when (after seeing own grave) by ~15% of text. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (grave, soaring, past selves, scroll), and the final act—filling the scroll with symbols and accepting the grave as "just another part of the story"—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where chronicling the chaos forecloses panic with felt relief ("the weight had lifted, just a little"). The cost is legible: endurance of grim knowledge and acceptance of imperfect narrative. One meaningful deepening occurs when the dream-soaring returns him to the cabin and he commits to marking the scroll despite disorientation. Minor slip: the causal link between "filling the scroll" and emotional shift could be tighter; we see the act but the mechanics of relief feel slightly summarized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cabin is anchored early with specific details (rough-hewn table, charred stick, dusty supplies, maps on walls) and micro-setting (birch bark scroll, fireplace) constrains the chronicling choice. The dream-geography (mountains, forests, sun-dappled clearing with grave) is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the POV's "jaded wonder." Sensory detail is selective and voice-driven. However, the cabin itself does not evolve or constrain a second choice; once the scroll is filled, the space recedes. The final image invokes the scroll but not the cabin's physicality, so setting pressure is front-loaded rather than sustained through closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: distill chaos into narrative to regain agency over disorienting visions. Internal conflict (jealousy of past selves, feral nostalgia) and external pressure (the dream of the grave) interweave. One meaningful tightening occurs when the dream pulls him back under and he soars, seeing the grave again, then forcibly returns to mark the scroll. The act of chronicling—"one mark after another"—narrows options from paralysis to imperfect narrative with visible cost (hand aching, "ragged" result). The escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. Minor gap: the turn from soaring back to the cabin is abrupt; the decision to "land" and "pin this down" is stated but the on-page cost of forcing himself back feels slightly thin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from images and events: chronicling as alchemy, jealousy as fuel, narrative as containment of chaos. The birch bark scroll recurs with reweighted meaning—first blank and waiting, finally "a testament to a man who had seen his end and lived to tell it." "Feral nostalgia" and "jaded wonder" function as motifs that constrain choices and charge the closure. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: the grave remains but becomes "just another part of the story," a quiet reconfiguration. Subtext operates through image (overlapping circles, broken chain) rather than exposition. The conceptual cost—living with grim foreknowledge—is undeniable. One slip: "pathetic alchemy" and "base fear" edge toward self-commentary that could trust the dramatization more.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and voice is distinct: "awe carved hollow by exhaustion," "getting jealous of past selves," "stupid, unearned confidence." Diction and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity—short, punchy beats during the soaring, longer reflective sentences at the scroll. Psychic distance is controlled; all knowledge stays character-bound. Free indirect style is clean. Under peak stress (the soaring sequence), compression is purposeful and texture remains consistent. Minor issue: some figurative language ("feral nostalgia…shaking me like a rag doll") is vivid but a few adjacent metaphors (deck of cards in a hurricane, broken teeth against bruised sky) feel slightly stacked without breathing room, edging toward density that could obscure rather than sharpen.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines do two jobs (advance plot and deepen interiority). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Grammar and punctuation are clean. However, several scaffold patterns emerge: "I [verb]" sentence stems in the opening third (six instances in close succession), and "The [noun] [verb]" constructions recur (cabin walls leaned in, air shifted, wind a cold slap). Figurative language clusters in the middle third without clear pattern-teaching, creating minor density drag. The final paragraph is propulsive and clear. Apply baseline artifact deduction for template cadence in the opening and mid-section runs; escalate slightly because the pattern touches multiple beats but not the closure image itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid-dream chronicling, chronological confusion, and feral nostalgia is specific and non-obvious; the birch bark scroll and mountain cabin anchor it in concrete particulars. The emotional truth—jealousy of one's own ignorant past—feels authentic and avoids generic templates. The soaring as a "necessary perspective" rather than escape is a fresh inflection. However, the core frame (artist alone in isolated cabin processing trauma through creation) is widely used; the story transforms it through lived detail and moral calculus but does not fully escape the template's gravitational pull. Risk-taking is present (non-linear memory, dream within waking) but legible and controlled. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lucid dream chronicler is established early (first paragraph) and the protagonist's choice to chronicle—marking the scroll with symbols—creates the final turn from paralysis to imperfect narrative. The role constrains the tactic (using charred stick and scroll, not fleeing or ignoring the dream). Present in closure: the chronicling act directly shapes the ending's relief and acceptance. Causal pressure is moderate; the role enables the resolution but the mechanics of lucid-dream chronicling as a skill are not tested or complicated on the page. Cost is felt (hand aching, "ragged" result). Swappability: another creative role (painter, poet) could substitute with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll appears in paragraph four ("lay unrolled on the rough-hewn table"), is handled in the middle beat (narrator picks up charred stick), and is marked/filled near closure, then referenced in the final paragraph as "testament." It evolves from blank/waiting to pulsing with "faint, inner light" to filled with symbols, altering the narrator's state from paralyzed to relieved. The scroll's physical properties (birch bark, able to hold charred marks) matter. Present in closure image: "I looked at the birch bark, now a testament…" charges the ending. Causal work: the act of filling it forecloses panic. Cost is tied to it (hand aching, imperfect result). Strong integration; one point shy of indispensable because the specific material (birch bark vs. paper) does not further constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Feral nostalgia is introduced early (paragraph six) and returns as "a character in the tale" the narrator tries to tame, then again near closure as settled "like a familiar coat." It shapes the dominant stake (the narrator is "in its jaws") and the emotional fuel ("bitter energy that drove the pen"). However, its mechanics—how untamed longing for a confused past actually constrains on-page choices—remain somewhat abstract. The concept is articulated and thematically charged but does not narrow a tactical option or create a visible trade-off. Present in closure vicinity but not causally active in the final image. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but lacks mid-scene causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Chronologically confused is established early (paragraph eight: "memories were chronologically confused, a deck of cards thrown into a hurricane") and dramatized through specific images (twenty-year-old by river, forty-year-old at funeral, out of order). It enables the non-linear chronicling tactic: "I let the scroll be non-linear, a map of my disorientation." The trait constrains the narrator's ability to impose order and forces acceptance of ragged narrative. Cost is visible (imperfect chronicle, ongoing disorientation). Present in closure: the scroll's non-linearity and the narrator's acceptance that the grave is "just another part of the story" both trace to this trait. Causal pressure is moderate; the trait shapes tactics but does not force a second on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Soar/soaring is introduced at the story's midpoint ("I began to soar"), drives the middle turn (violent uplift above mountains, seeing past selves and the grave from new perspective), and is reprised in closure ("a different kind of soar, a quiet one, inside my chest"). The action enables the "necessary perspective" that lets the narrator see the "whole messy tapestry" and then choose to chronicle. The physical soaring and the metaphorical final soar are causally linked. Cost is present (the return is abrupt, and the quiet soar is earned through struggle). However, the action arrives late (past the 40% mark) and the final reprise is metaphorical rather than a second physical instance, lowering direct causal participation at closure. Strong thematic charge but swappability is moderate (another perspective-granting action could serve).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Getting jealous of past selves is signaled early (paragraph ten: "getting jealous of past selves") and dramatized in the soaring sequence (seeing thirty-year-old planting tree, "hot spike of jealousy"). It is named as fuel: "the bitter energy that drove the pen." The method shapes the chronicling attempt—jealousy provides motivation and content. Present in closure vicinity: the narrator chronicles "the feeling" and uses jealousy as narrative material. However, the mechanics of how jealousy as a method differs from other emotional fuels are not tested; it could be swapped for anger or grief with minor edits. The method is thematically resonant but does not constrain a second on-page choice or create a visible trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mountain ranger cabin is established in the opening line and anchors the frame (rough-hewn table, fireplace, maps, dusty supplies). It provides the scroll and charred stick, enabling the chronicling tactic. The cabin "walls…seemed to lean in, listening" at a key beat, and the narrator returns to it after soaring. However, the cabin does not pressure a second choice or constrain the resolution; once the scroll is filled, the space is static. Present in closure only as setting ("The cabin was still silent") without causal charge. The cabin is functional but replaceable—another isolated workspace would serve equally. Early setup and one beat involvement, but lacks closure participation and specificity that would make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>After seeing your own grave is established in the opening (paragraph two: "My own grave, freshly dug in a dream last night") and recurs in the soaring sequence ("I saw the grave again—my grave, neat and tidy in a sun-dappled clearing") and at closure ("The grave was still there, in my mind, but it was just another part of the story now"). The timeframe creates urgency (knowing the plot twist before finishing the book) and shapes the chronicling choice. Cost is conceptual: living with grim foreknowledge. However, the timeframe does not impose a ticking clock or force tactical adjustments; it is a state rather than a deadline. Present across beats and in closure with clear reweighting, but the mechanics of "after" versus "during" or "before" do not materially constrain a choice. Strong thematic charge, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>To distill chaos into narrative is stated explicitly (paragraph five: "My motivation was clear") and dramatized through the protagonist's choice to mark the scroll, the struggle to "force the fragments into a line," and the final act of chronicling. The motivation drives the dominant stake and is tested when the dream pulls him back under; he forcibly returns and commits to chronicling despite disorientation. Cost is visible (hand aching, imperfect result, "ragged" narrative). Present in closure: the scroll filled, chaos distilled "for now," and the narrator's acceptance of imperfection all trace to this motivation. Friction between want (order, mastery) and cost (imperfection, ongoing disorientation) is on the page. Strong causal integration; one point shy of indispensable because the motivation is somewhat told rather than discovered through a complicating choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Jaded wonder is introduced early (paragraph nineteen: "jaded wonder I lived with now: awe carved hollow by exhaustion") and recurs near closure (paragraph forty-one: "The jaded wonder settled over me like a familiar coat; I was amazed I could still feel wonder at all"). Tone is coherent: weary, specific, embodied. It modulates with pressure—wonder sharpens during the soaring ("awe carved hollow") and softens into acceptance at the end ("amazed I could still feel wonder"). The tone charges the final image by framing the narrator's simultaneous exhaustion and relief. However, tone itself does not constrain a choice or narrow options; it colors the experience but does not create causal pressure. Strong thematic resonance and purposeful modulation, but lacks the tactical constraint or cost linkage that would make it indispensable.</comment>
