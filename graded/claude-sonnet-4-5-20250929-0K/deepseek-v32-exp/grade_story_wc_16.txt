<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore trust is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses; her actions follow a smooth, calculated path without genuine struggle. The "carefully reckless" trait appears as a label rather than embodied tension—her plan proceeds methodically without visible cost or misstep. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart pounding," "cautious exuberance") and the final reunion dissolves conflict too easily. Kaelen's arrival feels convenient rather than earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal lens: each promise triggers a glyph response, building toward revelation. However, the escalation is mechanical rather than motivated—no genuine obstacle tests Elara's method, and Kaelen's arrival at the exact moment of completion reads as coincidental resolution rather than earned convergence. The closure (trust restored) occurs on the page but the cost is abstract; we don't see what Elara risked or lost in the process. Orientation is clean early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The archive is anchored with sensory detail (towering shelves, flickering candle, oak desk) and the glass ink well functions as a tool that constrains Elara's method. However, the space itself doesn't pressure her choices—she works uninterrupted in a sanctuary that remains static. The final beat where "the archive seemed to breathe" and "the door creaked open" provides minimal environmental participation in the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore trust before dawn) is signaled early, but no meaningful opposition tests it. Elara's carefully reckless plan proceeds without genuine friction; each promise succeeds on cue with no failed attempt or trade-off. The "silence" and "misunderstanding" remain abstract—no scene dramatizes the conflict that caused the rift. Kaelen's entrance resolves everything without Elara making a difficult choice or paying a visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "symphonies of truth" concept is stated repeatedly but remains abstract; it doesn't emerge from concrete action. The final paragraph delivers explicit thematic summary ("Trust, restored through interconnected promises, now bound them anew in the symphonies of truth") rather than letting image carry meaning. The story tells us truths are interconnected without dramatizing what that costs or reveals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable and the narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register appropriate to an arcane linguist. However, the prose relies on repetitive sentence stems ("She began to write," "She remembered," "Her third promise") and stock interiority. Kaelen's single line of dialogue feels functional rather than character-specific. The perceptual signature is generic scholarly rather than distinctly Elara's.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades the middle section with repeated "She wrote/began/remembered" stems and paraphrase loops (promises are described, then their effect is re-stated). Stock metaphors ("towering shelves," "tangled web," "heart pounding") appear in high-pressure beats without fresh specificity. The glass ink well "pulsed rhythmically, as if in tune with her heartbeat" mixes vehicle and tenor awkwardly. Clarity remains intact but information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—magical ink that responds to truth, promises that decode prophecy—assembles genre conventions without transformation. The carefully reckless linguist solving an ancient puzzle before dawn follows a familiar template. The "symphonies of truth" concept remains abstract decoration rather than a specific, earned synthesis. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; Kaelen's arrival is convenient rather than causally linked to Elara's work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decisions (writing each promise) drive the beats, but the choices themselves feel formulaic rather than difficult. She appears in setup, development, and ending, but her arc (calculated plan → success) lacks genuine friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass ink well appears in at least three beats (intro, first promise, fourth promise, overflow at climax). It enables Elara's method and its glowing/pulsing provides feedback. The overflowing light at closure charges the final image. Could be replaced with another magical implement but its specific properties (ethereal ink, truth-reactive) shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Symphonies of truth is invoked repeatedly as theme but doesn't constrain choices on the page. It's explained as "all truths are interconnected" but this idea doesn't alter what Elara does or risk. Present in setup (via exposition), touched in middle reflection, and restated at closure, but remains ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Carefully reckless is stated twice ("carefully reckless abandon," "carefully reckless nature") but not dramatized through visible trade-off. The text tells us she's "risking everything by invoking ancient magics" yet her plan proceeds smoothly without misstep. Label-only mention without on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Unsnarl appears as both verb and concept (untangling misunderstandings, promises that "unsnarl the deepest tangles"). It frames the task in setup and development but could be replaced with "resolve" or "decode" without structural change. The action is more metaphorical than physical—no scene shows active untangling with friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interconnected promises is signaled in the first paragraph, drives the middle beats (each vow building on the last), and is restated at closure ("Trust, restored through interconnected promises"). The mechanics matter: each promise triggers a glyph and strengthens the chain. The method is integral to escalation and ending, though it proceeds without opposition.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The extinct language archive frames the opening and provides the scroll/tools Elara uses. It's present in setup and ending but doesn't constrain her choices—she works uninterrupted. The space is described but doesn't evolve or pressure tactics. Functional setting that could be swapped for another scholarly sanctuary.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Before paths diverge is mentioned in the opening (departure at dawn) and closing (paths would not diverge after all) but the deadline isn't tracked or felt. No scene shows time pressure altering Elara's choices. The timeframe bookends the story but doesn't tighten tactics in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Restore trust after silence is the stated motivation, present from the opening and resolved at closure. However, the friction (what broke trust, what Elara fears losing) is told in backstory rather than dramatized. The desire drives action but lacks embodied cost until the very end.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Cautious exuberance appears twice as a label ("cautious exuberance filled her," "heart pounding with cautious exuberance") but the prose doesn't embody the blend—most beats read as calm exposition. The tone is more earnest scholarly than charged with mixed hope and fear. Static mood rather than modulation under pressure.</comment>
