<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared early ("eternally encore-seeking") but remains static throughout; her choices (raising the coin, singing) feel procedural rather than rooted in contradictory impulses. The synesthetic gift is label-only—"tasting colors of dusk as tart citrus"—without constraining a single on-page decision or creating embodied friction. The final fulfillment ("a spirit fulfilled") arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path; she simply performs successfully and fades, rendering the arc more wishful than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (layering echoes, building harmony). Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words (theater, hedge maze, orchard, Elara). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration—"timelines snap into place," "a gentle acceptance"—but the cost is asserted rather than made palpable; no specific sacrifice or foreclosed option appears on the page. The coin's "work done" and Elara's smile tell us resolution without showing what she gave up or what path closed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mystic orchard is vivid (silver apples, greasepaint scent, trees forming proscenium) and sensory detail is selective. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it passively responds to Elara's performance. The tarot coin charges the final image but does not function as micro-setting that narrows options. Spatial choreography is clear; the garden's transformation supports atmosphere without applying pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (recapture applause, transform eternity). The performance builds through layered echoes and the "brink of despair" moment, offering one tightening. Yet Elara faces no meaningful opposition or cost at the peak—she "pressed on," succeeded, and the garden "responded" cooperatively. The resolution is handed to her by external magic (coin, echoes solidifying) rather than earned through a trade-off or agency-driven choice that forecloses an alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of longing, memory, and redemption emerges through image (stage lights, greasepaint, final bow). The tarot coin (Fool/World) and fractured timeline carry symbolic weight, but the ending states its thesis overtly: "not as a ghost seeking an encore, but as a spirit fulfilled." The final paragraph moralizes ("gentle acceptance," "peace") instead of letting the image resonate. No counter-reading or ambiguity lingers; the resolution is tidy and sentimental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; distance is consistent. Diction occasionally elevates beyond her established voice ("weeping violets and hopeful yellows," "cascade of emotion") in a way that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. No dialogue appears. The synesthetic gift offers a perceptual signature on paper ("gold of a trumpet blast brushing her skin") but the prose does not consistently filter perception through that lens—most description reads conventionally visual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Density is moderate; many lines do double duty (e.g., "silver apples, their scent evoking greasepaint"). Paraphrase loops appear: "her motivation was pure and desperate" / "to lure possibility from the brink of despair" / "transform her stagnant eternity into something new" restates the same content across three sentences. Template cadence runs in the final third: "She began to sing... The fractured timeline resisted... She intertwined the moments... Each echo strengthened... The garden itself responded." Stock metaphors ("thread of silver light," "cascade of emotion") cluster in peak beats without fresh specificity. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise (stage ghost using synesthesia and tarot to mend fractured time via performance echoes) is high-concept but executed through familiar beats: longing ghost seeks closure, performs one final show, achieves peace. The "brink of despair" / "lure possibility" framing and the Fool/World coin are symbolic conveniences that resolve without friction. No unexpected turn or emotional specificity personalizes the arc; the transformation test fails—swap names and setting, the emotional journey remains generic redemption-through-art.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her encore-seeking desire frames the story. She makes procedural choices (clutching coin, casting it, singing) but these do not create key turns—the echoes and timeline repair happen to her rather than through contested decisions. Her ghosthood and stage background motivate the setup but do not constrain middle choices or alter tactics. Present by 10%, involved in every beat, shapes the ending image; yet the causal pressure is low because her choices do not narrow options or face meaningful resistance. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but swappability (any artistic ghost) −0.6, ornamental agency −0.7. ~5.7 → round 4.2 after applying late-beat passivity friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tarot coin appears early (~15%), is handled in two beats (clutched, cast into air), and returns at closure ("fell silent, its work done"). It enables the echo-production mechanism and charges the final image. However, its specific properties (Fool/World imagery) are decorative—any magical focus could substitute. The coin does not impose a visible cost or constrain a choice; it simply works when used. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but swappability −0.7, ornamental use −0.5. Result ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Fractured timeline is introduced early and described vividly ("past and present bled together, moments splintering like shattered glass"). It provides the problem Elara must solve and the final resolution ("timelines snap into place"). Yet the fracture does not constrain her method or alter her tactics on the page—she simply produces echoes and the timeline repairs itself. The concept is thematic backdrop rather than active pressure. Setup +0.5, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability (any temporal distortion) −0.6, ornamental role −0.8. ~4.9 → round 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Synesthesia is introduced early ("tasting colors of dusk as tart citrus, hearing leaves as whispered sonatas") and described in the middle beats ("gold of a trumpet blast brushing her skin," "weeping violets and hopeful yellows"). It colors the narration but does not enable or constrain a single action with cost—Elara's choices (sing, cast coin) would work identically without it. The trait is label-only texture. Setup +0.5, ornamental use across beats −0.9, no causal pressure −1.0. ~3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Intertwine" appears explicitly in the middle ("intertwine the frayed threads," "She intertwined the moments") and is the method by which Elara stitches the timeline. It drives the peak beat (layering echoes of her performances) and the resolution. However, the action is abstract—what "intertwining" entails mechanically is unclear, and it could be replaced with "weave" or "merge" without structural change. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity moderate +0.4, but swappability −0.6. ~6.9 → adjust to 6.3 for abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Producing echoes" is signaled early ("by producing echoes of her greatest performances") and executed in the climax ("echoes bloomed around her: the ghostly orchestra tuning, the rustle of program notes"). The method shapes the attempt and the resolution (echoes multiply, solidify, coalesce). However, the mechanics are vague—how does she produce them? The coin is cast, she sings, echoes appear. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but vague mechanics −0.7, swappability with "conjure" −0.5. ~6.3 → round 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The mystic orchard within the hedge maze is introduced early and described richly (moonlit fruits, silver apples, trees bending to form proscenium). It provides atmosphere and responds to Elara's performance but does not constrain her choices or supply a resource that alters outcome—she could perform anywhere. The setting is postcard backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Setup +0.6, closure linkage (garden "sighs in approval") +0.8, but ornamental role −1.0, swappability −0.6. ~5.4 → round 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the business closes" appears in the opening and "faded into the dawn" at the end, bookending the night. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics—no clock pressure is felt, and the duration is elastic. Time is vague and untracked. Setup +0.3, closure mention +0.4, but no causal pressure −1.2, vague tracking −0.8. ~2.7 → round 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To lure possibility from the brink of despair" is stated early ("her motivation was pure and desperate") and the "brink of despair" appears in the climax ("felt the brink of despair yawn before her, a cold void"). The desire drives the setup and frames the ending ("a chance to rewrite her ending"). Yet the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—Elara never hesitates or trades one want against another. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but told-only friction −1.4. ~5.8 → round 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Nostalgia is signaled early ("the air hummed with rising nostalgia") and modulates through the arc: "sweet, aching pull toward the vibrant past," "nostalgia crested, not as loss, but as a gentle acceptance." The tone is coherent and charges the final image ("a rising tide of peace"). It shifts from longing to acceptance, fitting the Accumulative lens. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, modulation under pressure +0.8, but single-note mid-range delivery −0.5. ~7.4 → adjust to 6.7 for tidy resolution that flattens ambiguity.</comment>
