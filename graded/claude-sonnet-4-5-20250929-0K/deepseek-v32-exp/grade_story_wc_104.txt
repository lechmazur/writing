<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara exists purely as label-only motivation ("chained liberator," "patiently strategic") with no contradictory impulses or embodied interiority. The guard appears without prior establishment, serves as a prop to be tripped, then vanishes without reaction. The chains "loosen" symbolically at the end with no earned causality—no dramatic event motivates their release, only thematic convenience. Micro-choices are absent; Elara's actions read as plot mechanics rather than decisions under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are delayed: carnival location and Elara's imprisonment history are established, but the wall's collapse trigger arrives abruptly without prior setup (−0.4). The arrow-to-piano-keys mechanism is introduced and resolved within two paragraphs, offering no meaningful escalation or narrowing of options. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the chain-loosening image, but the cost is symbolic rather than felt on the page—no decision forecloses a path, no visible price is paid. The lens reads Causal in execution but relies on convenience (guard lunges, Elara trips him, vault opens) rather than because/therefore pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The carnival setting is vividly described ("faded banners fluttering like ghosts," "dusty shelves and broken toys") but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The piano bench matters briefly for the decoding beat, qualifying as micro-setting. The dry soil appears only at the end to receive seeds, without prior establishment as obstacle or resource. Spatial choreography is loose: the guard's position and Elara's chains never materially hinder movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—planting resilience—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page cost tests Elara's commitment until the final planting, which proceeds without friction. The guard's lunge is deflected instantly via chain-trip with no escalation or tactical adjustment. The arrow-piano sequence unfolds as a puzzle solved on first attempt, offering no reversal or deepening. Pressure is declared ("shadows shifted," "air grew thick") but not dramatized through narrowing options or forced trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated throughout: "plant resilience," "testament to unwavering hope," "sower of hope," "monument to cleverness." The final paragraph moralizes directly: "when the wall came down, it took with it the old fears" (−0.7). Symbolic objects (chains, arrow, seeds) are deployed for thematic resonance without narrative cost. The piece gestures toward liberation and rebirth but resolves into a tidy redemption with no ambiguity or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "her mind racing through possibilities," "her heart pounded, but her hands were steady" read as template interiority. The phrase "staggering grace" recurs six times across the text, becoming scaffold rather than voice-specific descriptor. Diction occasionally elevates ("imbuing the earth," "living tapestry") without anchoring in Elara's lexicon or stress state. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "Her motivation was clear: to plant resilience" / "Elara's motivation had been simple: to plant resilience" (−0.4). Template cadence dominates the final third: "She walked away… She had impeded… Each seed carried… Elara watched… The arrow's mystery…" (−0.6). Stock metaphors cluster: "ghosts," "testament to hope," "living tapestry," "monument to cleverness." Filter-verb stacks flatten immediacy: "she felt the chains loosen," "seemed to cheer." Cumulative artifact debt reaches the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 threshold and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—decoding a puzzle to access hidden seeds—fits a familiar quest template without transformation. The arrow-piano mechanism is introduced and solved within two paragraphs, offering no fresh synthesis or non-obvious turn. The carnival setting and chained-liberator frame read as assembled prompt elements rather than a singular vision. Emotional specificity is absent; the ending's hope-amid-desolation motif resolves into generic uplift. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes two decisions: aligning the arrow and tripping the guard. Neither choice involves visible trade-off or narrows options—both succeed on first attempt. The chain-loosening at the end is symbolic rather than earned by her agency. Late-appearance penalty does not apply (present from the start), but the character's choices do not create meaningful turns (setup + payoff present, middle development weak).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The arrow appears early (buried near ticket booth), is used in the piano-bench decoding beat, and is mentioned in the final third as "its purpose fulfilled." It serves a functional role in unlocking the vault but could be swapped for any cryptic map or key without altering story logic. No cost is tied to the arrow's use; it solves the puzzle cleanly on first attempt. Setup + development + payoff present, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The seed vault is named early, drives the decoding sequence, and supplies the seeds for planting. However, the vault itself is passive: Elara opens it without obstacle, retrieves seeds without cost, and plants them without friction. The concept shapes the goal but not the tactics or trade-offs under pressure. Setup + payoff present; middle development is static description.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Patiently strategic" is a label mentioned twice ("patience honed over years," "patiently strategic wait finally over") without dramatizing a trade-off. Elara's actions proceed smoothly with no moment where patience costs her speed or where strategy requires sacrifice. The trait does not constrain or enable a visible choice. Ornamental use throughout.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The guard attempts to impede Elara by advancing and lunging; Elara uses her chains to trip him. The impeding action is present in two beats (guard emerges, guard lunges) and affects tactics briefly. However, the impediment is resolved instantly without escalation or cost, and could be swapped for any obstacle (locked door, collapsing floor) with minor edits. Setup + development present; closure participation weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piano-bench decoding is signaled when Elara approaches the bench, executed when she aligns the arrow with keys, and resolved when the compartment clicks open. The method matters structurally but is solved on first attempt with no false starts or cost. The mechanics are summarized ("each key corresponded to a symbol") rather than dramatized. Setup + development + payoff present; causal pressure and specificity are thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The carnival setting is established early and houses the piano bench and vault. The prize redemption center's interior "maze of dusty shelves" is mentioned but does not constrain Elara's movement or choices. The setting provides atmosphere and props but does not pressure tactics or supply resources that alter outcome. Setup + weak development + weak payoff; micro-setting (piano bench) offers one functional beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The wall's collapse is mentioned as a signal ("the moment was near; when the wall came down") and occurs mid-story ("a crash echoed as part of the distant wall collapsed") and at the end ("the rest of the wall crumbled"). The timeframe tightens Elara's decision to act but does not impose a live countdown or force tactical adjustments. The phrase "when the wall comes down" recurs thematically but does not function as a clock. Setup + development + payoff present; pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to plant resilience is declared early ("Her motivation was clear"), drives the vault retrieval, and is fulfilled in the planting scene. The desire is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction. No cost tests her commitment—seeds are obtained and planted smoothly. Setup + development + payoff present; dramatized conflict is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Staggering grace" appears six times as a descriptor for Elara's movement and the planting act. The phrase is consistent but static, lacking modulation with pressure—it describes elegance during both low-stakes observation and high-stakes confrontation identically. The tone does not charge the final image with new meaning; it repeats unchanged. Present throughout but ornamental, trending toward label rather than tonal shift.</comment>
