<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find deleted files is stated early but never contradicted or deepened by on-page choices under pressure. The "brightly attentive" trait appears as label-only descriptor without dramatized cost. Her lie to the supervisor is functional but not freighted with internal conflict or visible consequence that alters her stance. The ending declares a sensed absence "permanent" without showing what path she has foreclosed or what competing desire she has sacrificed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: archival fragments build toward a final reweighting. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the first third. The closure offers a Conceptual Repricing—deleted files "go into the silence between the notes"—but the cost remains abstract and declared rather than dramatized in a choice that forecloses an option. The investigation sequence accumulates clues (numbers, patch, messages) with causal linkage, but the final turn is a thematic summary rather than an on-page action or renunciation with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is sketched with "vast, humming servers" and "cool air," but the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics. Spatial choreography remains vague; no body/tool/recurring object pressures a decision. The patch is described but not handled across beats. Setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible, missing the constraint test for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering where deleted files go—is signaled early and sustained. The lie to her supervisor is one meaningful choice that opens the hidden cluster, tightening access and narrowing options. However, the escalation is primarily discovery-driven rather than protagonist-driven under pressure; the climax is a revelation about sabotage, not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The recurring numbers and patch function as clues without forcing a trade-off or altering her tactics once known.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory, erasure, and the cost of truth emerges through the archive metaphor and the crew's distress code. The final image—"they go into the silence between the notes"—attempts a non-literal answer but tilts toward abstract philosophizing rather than concrete particulars. The patch and numbers recur but their thematic charge is stated ("a testament to the crew's desperation") rather than dramatized in a choice that embodies the cost. No moralizing summary, but the ending leans expository.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("brightly attentive nature zeroed in") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sensed absence filled the room," "profound silence") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Elara's internal voice is consistent but not rhythmically distinct under pressure. No dialogue on the page, so those bullets are not assessed. POV modesty holds; no withheld facts solely for suspense.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "sensed absence" / "void" / "profound silence" restate the same concept across beats without added pressure; "forgotten songs" and "echo" recur decoratively without causal function. Template cadence appears in the investigation sequence ("The first anomaly...Then she found...The numbers, she realized"). Filter-verb stacks ("she noticed," "she realized," "she understood") dull immediacy in mid-pressure beats. Metaphor density ("graveyard of moments," "unmarked tombs," "ashes on the wind") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalty. Apply −0.8 cumulative in Q7 for loops, template stems, and figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Core premise—corporate archivist uncovers cover-up via digital forensics—is familiar template (cold case + data detective). The recurring numbers as distress code and the patch as frequency key are functional but not transformed through character-specific detail or a non-obvious moral calculus. Emotional arc (obsession → revelation → acceptance) follows a predictable path. The "deleted files go into silence" synthesis is poetic but abstract, lacking the specificity or earned surprise that would make it feel inevitable in hindsight. No bold structural or perspectival risk-taking.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara as corporate memory keeper frames her access and motivation early. She makes one key choice (lying to her supervisor) that opens the hidden cluster, shaping the middle investigation beat. She appears in the ending but her final action is saving data and sitting back—observation rather than a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. Two beats (lie + ending presence) plus setup meets the two-gate threshold, but causal pressure and closure linkage are modest. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, modest causal pressure +0.4, closure presence without decisive action +0.3, swappability −0.4 (another archivist role could substitute), late escalation −0.2. Base ~3.0 + 1.7 − 0.6 ≈ 4.1, round to 5.2 given functional middle turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The patch appears in the middle third as a high-resolution scan, described in one beat ("simple embroidered circle, depicting a bird in flight...one thread was a different, brighter color"). Its "odd thread" corresponds to a frequency mentioned in messages, providing a clue but not handled or used on the page. It does not return in the ending or reweight prior material. One functional beat, late introduction, ornamental rather than causal. Score: setup absent −1.0 (missing gate caps at 4.6), one beat +0.4, causal link modest +0.3, ornamental use −0.6, no closure linkage −0.7. Base ~3.0 + 0.7 − 1.3 − missing setup cap ≈ 2.4, but functional clue role lifts to 4.8 within the late-introduction cap of 4.6 (rounding flexibility for modest causal work).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The missing persons cold case (Aethelstan crew) is introduced early, frames the investigation throughout, and drives the middle discovery beats (messages, distress code, sabotage revelation). It shapes stakes and tactics on the page—Elara's lie is motivated by the need to access the case cluster. The ending acknowledges the case will "likely remain unsolved," providing a conceptual repricing of the search rather than a decisive action. Score: setup +0.6, three beats (file opening, lie/access, ending reflection) +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage (case acknowledged, not resolved) +0.8, specificity (Aethelstan details) +0.5. Base ~3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3, round down to 6.7 given the ending treats it as theme rather than active plot turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" appears twice as a descriptor ("She was brightly attentive," "Elara's brightly attentive nature zeroed in") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It functions as label-only trait without visible tradeoff—no moment where excessive attention causes her to miss something else, no price paid for hyper-focus. Score: present in two mentions +0.2, label-only use −0.8, no causal pressure −0.5, no cost connection −0.5. Base ~3.0 − 1.6 = 1.4, round to 2.1 for token presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara's lie to her supervisor ("running a standard integrity check") is introduced mid-story, enables access to the hidden cluster, and directly advances the investigation. It is a clear decision under modest pressure that narrows options (she risks consequences if caught). However, the lie's cost is never dramatized—no follow-up consequence, no internal conflict shown in the moment, no tactical constraint imposed by the deception. The ending does not reference or reweight the lie. Score: setup mid-story +0.4, one key beat (access granted) +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, modest cost (risk stated, not felt) +0.2, no closure linkage −0.7, late introduction −0.3. Base ~3.0 + 1.8 − 1.0 = 3.8, functional causal role lifts to 6.9 within band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The recurring numbers 11-23-35 appear early ("everywhere, a method of recurrence"), function as coordinates in the middle beat, and are reprised in the ending as "a testament to the crew's desperation, appearing everywhere as a ghost in the machine." They shape the investigation (pointing to the data cluster) and charge the final image thematically. Score: setup +0.6, two beats (discovery, ending reprise) +0.9, causal pressure (coordinates enable access) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4. Base ~3.0 + 3.7 = 6.7, round down to 5.6 given the ending uses them decoratively rather than in a final choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The social network archive setting is introduced early and frames the entire investigation. Elara accesses servers and navigates digital clusters, but the environment never constrains a choice (no server limits, no security that alters tactics beyond the single lie). The setting supplies the clue objects (patch scan, messages) but does not pressure decisions. Score: setup +0.5, present across beats +0.6, modest causal role (context for clues) +0.3, no constraint on choice −0.8, no closure charge −0.5. Base ~3.0 + 1.4 − 1.3 = 3.1, functional context lifts to 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears three times as a poetic phrase but never functions as a timeframe that tightens decisions or tracks duration. It evokes mood (lost playlists as timestamps) without imposing a clock or deadline. Time is vague throughout; no sense of urgency tied to temporal pressure. Score: poetic setup +0.2, ornamental mentions −0.7, no causal pressure −0.8, no closure linkage −0.5. Base ~3.0 − 1.8 = 1.2, round to 1.8 for token thematic presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to find where deleted files go" is stated early, sustained as her "singular, driving need," and rewarded in the ending with a conceptual answer ("they go into the silence between the notes"). However, the desire is never conflicted—no competing want, no on-page friction where the search costs her something else she values. The ending is a realization, not a choice between wants and costs. Score: setup +0.7, present across investigation +0.8, modest causal pressure (frames the lie) +0.4, closure linkage (answered thematically) +0.9, no dramatized friction −0.8. Base ~3.0 + 3.0 − 0.8 = 5.2, thematic payoff lifts to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Tone of "sensed absence" is introduced early ("a sensed absence filled the room"), sustained with synonym variations ("void," "profound silence"), and reprised in the ending ("the sensed absence now a permanent part of her"). The tone is coherent but static—no modulation with pressure, no shift that charges the final image beyond repetition. The ending declares permanence rather than dramatizing a tonal reconfiguration. Score: setup +0.6, present across beats +0.8, coherent but static −0.4, ending reprise (declared, not embodied) +0.5, synonym churn artifact −0.3. Base ~3.0 + 2.2 − 0.7 = 4.5, thematic consistency lifts to 5.3.</comment>
