<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The keeper's interiority is poetic but abstract—"loaded emptiness" and "teach suffocating to breathe" read as theme labels rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choices under pressure; the encounter unfolds passively with the keeper observing resonance and then inviting the visitor. The closing "practiced breathing together" offers no visible cost or foreclosed path; the keeper's isolation expands without friction, undercutting the stakes of his severance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who the keeper is, where exactly he stands, and when this occurs remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure—two people breathing together—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (expansion of sanctuary) but the cost is asserted rather than shown; no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (poetic density), but the final image does not reweight prior material with felt cost, only declares hope without dramatizing the price of re-connection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary and starlight anchor atmosphere effectively. The doorknocker ring is a concrete object that charges one beat (the chime), and the charcoal dust is mentioned at the invitation. However, none of these constrain a choice or alter tactics; they remain backdrop. The gate for 9+ (environment/object constrains choice or charges final image) is not met, capping the score below 9.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining solitude versus allowing connection—is signaled but never tested with on-page cost. The keeper's "allowing" is passive observation; no tightening forecloses an option. The visitor's arrival is described as "encroachment" but the keeper immediately "understood" and "demonstrated," bypassing conflict. Coincidence (resonance of scars) enables the resolution without protagonist agency driving a turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of breathing/suffocation emerges from repeated motifs and the final image. However, the closing line ("learned one, that even the most carefully burned bridge can smolder with hope") states the moral outright, undermining earned resonance. "Linking through scars" and "teach suffocating to breathe" are prompt labels echoed rather than reweighted through specific events. The piece gestures toward complexity but settles into tidy affirmation without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable. Diction is poetic and consistent ("loaded emptiness," "fading threshold"), though elevated register occasionally drifts from embodied perception into abstract philosophizing. The keeper's perceptual signature leans heavily on metaphor; under the lyric allowance, this is acceptable. No dialogue appears; the one line of speech ("You have come through the scars") fits voice. Filter verbs ("recognized," "understood," "sensed") stack in the middle without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but purposeful in establishing tone; "loaded emptiness," "fading thresholds," and "burns bridges carefully" recur without mixed metaphors. Template cadence appears: multiple sentences open with "He + past verb" or "The + noun," creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops are minimal. The final paragraph's "not just taught a lesson; he had learned one" is scaffolding that could be cut. Information density is moderate; several beats restate theme without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The premise—solitary keeper teaching breath to the suffocating through scar-linked connection—offers a fresh metaphorical frame. However, execution relies on stock spiritual-healing tropes: the hermit sanctuary, the visitor who arrives through mystical resonance, the mutual recognition. The doorknocker ring and ashen ground are vivid but not irreplaceable. No bold risk; the piece plays safely within lyric accumulation without surprise or earned reversal.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The keeper is present throughout and his decision to "allow the encroachment" and "demonstrate breathing" anchor the final scene. However, these are passive observations rather than choices that narrow options. He does not face a trade-off or visible cost; his solitude expands rather than contracts. Present in setup, middle gesture, and ending, but replaceable with any contemplative hermit archetype. Mid-low integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring appears early (setup), chimes once under mystical pressure (middle beat), and is acknowledged as "no longer needed" at closure (payoff). It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the keeper does not strike it, and the visitor's resonance activates it off-page. Lyric reprise with thematic charge, but not causally active. Two-gate participation with resonance lifts it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Fading threshold" is named repeatedly and the sanctuary's boundary "wavered" under the visitor's approach, but it never forces a tactical choice. The keeper crosses no actual threshold; the metaphor decorates rather than drives. Present as motif across beats, but swappable with any boundary imagery. Functional atmospheric element without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Burns bridges carefully" is stated early and echoed at closure ("burning bridges carefully could leave paths of ash"), but the keeper's past severances are told rather than shown constraining present action. No on-page moment where this trait forces a visible trade-off. The metaphor is memorable but ornamental; label-only trait with thematic claim.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Encroach" names the visitor's approach and frames the keeper's response ("allow the encroachment"). It appears in setup and middle, shaping the keeper's stance, but the resolution (shared breathing) does not hinge on overcoming encroachment—it embraces it without cost. The action is present but does not redefine options at closure. Mid-band causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is named early, repeated at the visitor's arrival, and declared as the connection method. However, the mechanics are mystical resonance, not dramatized action. No on-page demonstration of how scars link; the method is asserted rather than shown shaping attempts. Present across beats but summary-only, capping it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight is established early, mentioned at mid-beat ("charcoal-dusted ground"), and returned in the final paragraph ("under the canopy of stars, in the ashen haven"). It provides vivid atmosphere and the invitation to "sit in the charcoal dust" is a spatial choice, though not one that alters outcome. Micro-setting role with lyric closure reprise; modest causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After cutting off all contact" is stated in the opening and acknowledged once ("not after his meticulous severances"), but no present clock or urgency stems from it. The timeframe sets backstory context without pressuring present decisions. Static setup without middle or closure development; ornamental context.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To teach suffocating to breathe" is named as the keeper's motivation early, repeated at key beats, and enacted in the final scene ("practiced breathing together"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. No friction between the goal and cost on the page; the keeper achieves it without struggle. Present across structure but lacks visible trade-off, capping it near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" is named early, woven through diction ("void so full of absence," "hollows," "silence"), and charged in the penultimate line ("loaded emptiness filled with...breathing"). Tone coheres across beats and modulates subtly as the visitor solidifies. The final image reweights the motif with modest resonance. Solid accumulative role with lyric payoff, though the charge is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>
