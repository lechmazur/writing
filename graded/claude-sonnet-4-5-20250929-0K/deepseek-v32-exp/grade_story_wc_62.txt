<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "discover the shape of collective grief" remains abstract throughout; her grandfather's spectral presence guides without meaningful resistance or contradiction. The "fiercely meditative" attribute appears as label-only descriptor rather than constraining choices under pressure. The final realization that "grief's shape was fluid, connective, and beautiful" reads as delivered insight rather than earned through embodied struggle, and no visible cost accompanies her discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who and where anchor by ~120 words, but "when" remains vague (recent village losses, "days," dusk recurring). The accumulative/textural lens is inferred from the butterfly-ribbon-poetry pattern, but no meaningful tightening occurs—Elara moves through the greenhouse observing parallels without facing a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. The ending offers conceptual repricing ("grief was not a void but a network") but the cost is asserted, not dramatized: no visible sacrifice, renunciation, or transformed relationship appears on the page. The phrase "her task as a carver now infused with deeper meaning" summarizes change rather than showing it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk provides vivid anchor (fractured glass, ivy, ferns, dusty bench) and recurs as a spatial frame. The woven ribbon roll and butterflies function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image through reprise. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elara moves freely without access, proximity, or material limits altering her tactics. Sensory detail is selective but skews visual; the "thundering calm" operates as metaphor rather than lived atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover the shape of collective grief"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete obstacle or dilemma. Elara encounters no resistance: the ghost cooperates, the ribbons map cleanly, and the butterflies affirm her thesis without complication. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; the accumulative patterning (ribbons, poems, butterflies) layers without pressure. The ending declares transformation ("her hands, once carving stone, now felt capable of mending spirits") but no on-page choice, renunciation, or visible price accompanies it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of grief as connective rather than void emerges from the ribbon-butterfly-poetry triptych and avoids overt moralizing in most beats. The final lines, however, resort to thesis statement: "grief, like poetry, connects us all" and "grief was not an end but a transformation, woven into life's fabric." The thematic question is posed but not tested—no competing interpretation or ambiguity pressures the protagonist's conclusion. The spectral mentorship motif remains ornamental, as the grandfather validates rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and focalizes through Elara's perception. Perceptual signature is present (carver's attention to patterns, poetry fragments) but not character-specific under pressure—diction remains neutral editorial ("fiercely meditative," "thundering calm") rather than embodied through her idiom. No dialogue appears; the grandfather's gestures and breeze-responses avoid voice differentiation challenges. Psychic distance flattens at the ending into summary mode ("She knew grief was not an end..."), reducing immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The ancient greenhouse, with its crumbling structure and resilient flora, became a cathedral..." restates the opening's ivy-veiled frame; "grief's shape was fluid, connective, and beautiful, like the intertwined ribbons or the airborne dance" recycles the same thesis across adjacent lines. Runs of "She [verb]" stems (noted, realized, rolled, walked, smiled, knew) flatten momentum. Stock metaphor "thundering calm" appears five times without evolving. Clarity remains intact, but information density is low—many sentences restate rather than advance. Deduction: −0.8 for loops and template stems in Q7; no closure-beat artifact observed, so cap not triggered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise—spectral mentor guides grieving artisan through symbolic landscape—follows a familiar template (journey of understanding with benevolent ghost). The triptych of ribbons, butterflies, and poems offers a fresh synthesis, but the execution remains safe: no turn subverts the affirming arc, no moral calculus tests competing goods. The grandfather's endorsement and Elara's tidy realization avoid risk. Transformation test: swap greenhouse for garden, carver for painter, and the emotional arc persists unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her choices lack causal weight: she enters, observes, unrolls the ribbon, retraces steps, recites poetry, and sits—all passive or receptive actions. Setup clear, middle beats involve her noticing parallels, ending shows her declaring readiness to return to work. No on-page decision narrows options or forecloses a path with visible cost. Functional but swappable with any reflective protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The woven ribbon roll appears in three beats: discovered on the bench, unrolled as a map mid-story, and held on her lap at the ending. It serves as a mnemonic device linking carved stones to butterfly paths and is directly referenced in the closure image. However, its mechanics remain static—no choice hinges on its presence, and removing it would require only minor rewrites to the mapping metaphor. Scores for setup, two-beat involvement, and closure linkage, but lacks causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship is signaled early (grandfather's ghost appears among ferns) and returns at the ending (dissolves into light). The concept frames the structure but does not shape a tactical choice—the grandfather points, nods, and affirms without imposing friction or withholding guidance. His presence enables no action Elara could not perform alone; the ghost functions as thematic ornament rather than causal force. Setup and closure participation met; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" appears as a label in the opening and is echoed once mid-story ("In her fiercely meditative state, she whispered lines..."). No on-page action demonstrates the trait's constraint or cost—Elara's movements remain unhurried and uncontested. The attribute could be replaced with "focused" or "deliberate" without altering any beat. Ornamental use; no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Retrace" appears in the setup (quest to retrace paths of the departed), drives the middle beat (she retraces movements through the greenhouse following spectral gestures), and is summarized at closure (retraced not just steps but emotions). The action structures the accumulative patterning and ties ribbons to butterfly routes. However, the retracing is observational—no turn depends on completing or halting this action. Setup, two-beat involvement, and closure mention present; causal pressure limited.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The family custom of trading poems at dinner is established in backstory (shared with grandfather in life), demonstrated mid-story (she whispers lines adhering to the custom), and invoked at the ending (she walks home ready to share a poem, continuing the custom). The method connects present to past and charges the final gesture. However, the poem-trading does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it functions as thematic resonance rather than plot mechanism. Setup and closure participation met; middle beat is contemplative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk anchors all action, recurs across beats (glass panels, ferns, bench, flora), and is named in the penultimate closure beat ("The greenhouse stood silent at dusk, a witness to her journey"). The setting provides spatial frame and symbolic charge (crumbling structure, resilient flora) that mirrors theme. However, the environment does not pressure a choice—Elara's access is unimpeded, no resource or hazard alters her tactics. Setup, multi-beat presence, and closure linkage strong; causal constraint absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The butterfly migration timeframe is established early (across the butterfly migration), marked at the middle ("Over days, as the migration peaked"), and closed at the ending ("The butterfly migration ended"). The timeframe structures the accumulative arc and the monarchs' flight parallels human grief journeys. However, the clock does not tighten decisions—Elara has unlimited time to observe and reflect. Setup and closure participation clear; middle tracking present but pressure absent. Lyric reprise reweights the stake moderately.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation to discover the shape of collective grief is stated in the opening, pursued through observation of ribbons and butterflies, and declared achieved at closure ("She had discovered that grief's shape was fluid, connective, and beautiful"). The quest frames all action and receives closure affirmation. However, the desire faces no dramatized friction—no competing interpretation, no cost of discovery, no moment where continuing the search requires sacrifice. Setup, multi-beat involvement, and closure participation met; conflict and cost absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" appears five times: opening (air hummed with a thundering calm), mid-story recitation beat, penultimate line (thundering calm settled in her soul), and final gesture (thundering calm was now a part of her). The oxymoron attempts to charge atmosphere but remains static—no modulation under pressure, no shift from storm to stillness or vice versa. The tone is asserted rather than enacted through rhythm or syntax. Setup and closure participation present; development and coherence weak.</comment>
