<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her "credibly curious" trait drives the bell choice, but her interior life remains thin—we see decisions without the embodied contradiction or struggle that would make them costly. The villagers' calm recognition feels convenient rather than earned through prior dramatization. The choice to use the bell lacks visible internal conflict or a moment where competing impulses act simultaneously; it reads as a pre-decided plan executed smoothly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors late (~150 words before "windblown sanctuary" and "storm siren tester" coalesce clearly); apply −0.3 for delayed spatial/role clarity. The switch from siren to bell constitutes a Decisive Change, and the villagers' preparation shows cost, but the closure moment itself—"After the glue dried, everything held together"—leans toward summary rather than a charged final image. The causal chain (microclimate data → bell pull →村 preparation) holds, but the ending diffuses into reflective recap rather than landing a single resonant beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary and cathedral bell rope anchor setting and recur at closure, satisfying the micro-setting test. Sensory detail is present (wind, pressure drop, bell chime) and the bell's sound carries tactical weight. However, much description remains postcard-level—"above the clouds," "stone parapets"—without filtering through Elara's professional or personal priorities under pressure. The sanctuary's spatial layout (where sensors sit, how the bell rope relates to the siren lever) never becomes tactile enough to constrain her movements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (warn the valley safely) is signaled early. The tightening occurs when pressure drops and Elara chooses the bell over the siren, which narrows options. However, the cost reads as logistical (villagers prepare calmly) rather than visceral or relational; there's no moment where the choice risks failure or forces a trade-off between competing goods. The storm "broke, but the valley was prepared" deflates rather than escalates, and we never see a credible loss or adaptation that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—listening over noise, trust in subtlety—emerges from action and the bell's resonance. The ending avoids overt moralizing, but lines like "true warning lay not in volume, but in clarity and trust" and "driven by a credibly curious heart" edge toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak. The bell's return charges the concept, yet the final third loops through thematic restatements ("tracking," "zero hour," "after the glue dried") without deepening the question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, and Elara's perceptual filter (microclimate focus, listening priority) remains consistent. However, diction drifts into prompt-echo phrasing—"credibly curious," "solstice hush," "zero hour"—recycled across paragraphs without fresh syntax. The narrative voice is clear but not character-particular; elevated constructions like "to favor listening over noise" sit oddly beside concrete actions. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance stays steady, but the prose reads more like controlled exposition than lived perception under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Severe template-cadence and paraphrase-loop issues. The phrase "after the glue dried" appears three times (early setup, mid-story, final paragraph), and "zero hour" recurs six times with minimal variation. Runs of "Her [noun] was [adjective]" and "She [verbed]" across adjacent sentences create drumbeat rhythm. Lines 12–14 loop the siren/bell contrast without advancing pressure. "Credibly curious" (lines 3, 24, 38) and "solstice hush" (lines 2, 25, 35) read as ornamental tags. Baseline −1.2 for pervasive loops and template cadence; −0.3 additional for prompt-phrase repetition touching closure ("After the glue dried, everything held together"). Disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The premise—storm warning via bell instead of siren—offers a fresh angle on a familiar "old ways vs. new methods" template. Elara's microclimate tracking and the bell's melodic signal provide specific details, but the emotional arc (humble tester proves her quiet innovation works) follows a predictable path with no surprising turn or earned failure. The villagers' instant recognition and calm preparation feels too smooth; a misreading or partial failure would have sharpened originality. The synthesis is competent but not inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's choice to pull the bell rope (middle beat) and her decision to trust microclimate data (setup and ending) are on-page actions that shape two key turns. Setup present early; development at the bell-pull beat; payoff in villagers' response and her post-storm reflection. However, her "humble" trait is label-only—aside from the descriptor, her actions read as confident expertise. The character drives closure but lacks sufficient cost or internal friction to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bell rope is introduced early (coiled, frayed, recently repaired), used decisively at the climax (Elara pulls it), and its aftermath ("hung still") bookends the ending. Three beats: setup (repair with adhesive), action (the pull), closure reprise (testament to innovation). Causal pressure: the glue must dry before use, and the rope's success validates her method. Irreplaceable: removing the bell eliminates the story's central contrast with the siren. Cost linkage is implied (trust in the repair) but not deeply felt on the page, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Zero hour is named six times and frames the climax: "that critical moment when a storm would unleash its fury" (line 10), "was fast approaching" (line 10), "The switch... had occurred at the perfect zero hour" (line 27). It tightens the decision window (Elara must act before the storm hits) and recurs in the ending ("The zero hour would come again"). However, the concept remains thematic shorthand rather than a lived constraint—no on-page countdown or visible consequence if she misses the window. Functional but not irreplaceable; "critical moment" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" is introduced in line 3 ("She was credibly curious, always questioning the old ways") and repeated twice more (lines 24, 38) but functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains action. Her curiosity leads to microclimate tracking and the bell method, but we never see her question a choice mid-scene or pay a visible cost for deviating from protocol. The attribute is present in setup and thematic recap but does not drive a beat with friction or tradeoff. Ornamental use; late closure echo does not restore causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The switch action occurs at the story's pivot: "She approached the bell rope... Her hand hovered over the main control switch... Instead of pulling it, she decided to switch her plan" (lines 14–16). This redefines options (bell vs. siren) and enables the climax. Setup present (protocol demands siren test), development (the hover and decision), and payoff (villagers respond to bell). However, "switch" also appears as a noun (the siren lever) and a verb (change plan), blurring specificity. Removing this exact action would collapse the turn, but the double usage and smooth execution (no visible cost at the moment of switch) prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tracking microclimate variations is introduced early (line 4: "delicate instruments scattered across the stone parapets") and used at the decision point (line 9: "She monitored her sensors, noting a sudden drop in pressure and a shift in wind patterns"; line 16: "trusting her microclimate data entirely"). It enables her choice and is reprised in line 26 ("Tracking microclimate variations had allowed her to predict the storm with precision"). Three beats: setup, climactic trust, thematic recap. However, the mechanics remain vague—what instruments? how does she read them?—and the method is told rather than shown in action. Functional but replaceable with "weather monitoring" and minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary is named in the opening and closing lines, providing frame. It houses the bell rope and siren, anchoring the choice. The setting's altitude ("above the clouds") isolates Elara and justifies the warning role, but it does not constrain her movements or supply a resource under pressure. The "stone parapets" and spatial layout remain abstract; we never see her navigate the space or use its features tactically. Postcard description with thematic bookends; present in setup and closure but does not shape middle beats or alter tactics. Lyric reprise pushes score into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the glue dries" is introduced early (line 6: "waiting for the right moment after the glue dried"), recurs at the decision (line 14: "its sturdy length now secure after the glue had set firm"), and appears in the final paragraph (line 28, line 40: "After the glue dried, everything held together"). The timeframe tightens the decision—she cannot use the rope until it's ready—but the drying is completed off-page before the climax, so it does not create live urgency. Three beats (setup, confirmation, thematic recap) but no on-page countdown or cost if she pulls too early. Functional constraint resolved before peak pressure; repetition in closure adds resonance but not causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to favor listening over noise" is articulated in line 7 and drives her bell choice (line 16: "trusting her microclimate data entirely" instead of the siren's "deafening wail"). It recurs in the ending (line 24: "knowing she had favored listening over noise"). Setup, middle choice, and closure reprise present. However, the desire is told more than dramatized—no moment where she viscerally wrestles with the safety of silence vs. the certainty of loud alarm. The villagers' calm response suggests no friction or cost, so the motivation feels validated rather than tested. Functional but lacks embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Solstice hush is named in line 2 ("Her days were spent in the solstice hush, a profound quiet") and returns in lines 25 and 35 ("the solstice hush deepening," "The solstice hush enveloped her"). The tone of quiet, meditative observation coheres through the piece and modulates subtly when the storm approaches (line 8: "the air felt different, charged with a tension"). The bell's "gentle sound" and the villagers' "calm purpose" reinforce the tone. However, the hush remains a descriptive label rather than an embodied atmosphere that constrains choice or charges the final image with undeniable pressure. Coherent and reprised but not indispensable; "quiet sanctuary" could substitute.</comment>
