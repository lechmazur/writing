<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's professional interiority is present but largely label-driven ("hazy precision," "rapidly adapting") without embodied contradiction under pressure. His discovery of the patch produces a declarative emotional jolt ("sent a jolt through him") rather than layered, contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to leave is framed as mission clarity rather than a renunciation with visible cost that forecloses a path. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, tucking the patch) but remain observational rather than stakes-altering decisions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (investigator, container labyrinth, post-disaster survey) land by ~15% and the single-POV continuous scene holds. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through wind data, wreckage observation, and the patch discovery toward a final image of prevention brewing. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the patch becomes "a heavy token," the silence "full of unspoken warnings"—but the cost remains abstract ("vigilance required") rather than a specific foreclosed path or tactical sacrifice on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (patch discovery reweights the survey from data to human toll), satisfying the length's requirement, but the final image asserts thematic harvest without demonstrating what Elias has relinquished or altered in his stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly established ("rust-streaked walls forming a metallic canyon," "metallic sighs") and shapes spatial choreography throughout (narrow gaps, vortices, clearing with scarred metal). The anemometer and wind currents constrain Elias's survey path and enable reconstruction of the crash's final seconds. The setting participates actively in the closure: the patch is "half-buried in grime," the debris patterns tell a story, and the labyrinth's wind dynamics drive the thematic answer. Strong sensory selection and POV filter (investigator's eye for causality) push this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—documenting wind patterns to cultivate foresight—is signaled early and coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs when the patch discovery personalizes the abstract data ("a tangible piece of the puzzle"), narrowing Elias's focus from systemic failure to individual loss. However, escalation remains cognitive rather than forcing a trade-off: Elias "adapted rapidly," "recalibrated," "envisioned" without facing a live tactical or ethical choice that forecloses an option. The wind shift forces a postural adjustment but no decision with cost. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens but does not crystallize into a choice that alters his stance on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of foresight versus convergence emerges through concrete particulars: wind vortices, the flight engineer's patch, the "gap between seeing and understanding." The closing image ("storm of prevention… brewing," patch as "heavy token") attempts Conceptual Repricing by reweighting the silent field into a lesson, but the final lines tip toward thematic summary ("testament to the need for foresight") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The patch's symbolic shift from relic to vigilance emblem is earned, yet the prose states the moral rather than letting the image hold it. Mid-band fit for accumulative design with slight drift into explicit claim at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping; psychic distance is stable and close. Perceptual signature is investigator-filtered ("methodical survey," "invisible maps of turbulence") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("smothering the usual port city clamor," "epicenter of the town's sudden silence") that reads slightly above the immediate sensory frame. No dialogue present; internal voice is consistent but leans on repeated participial constructions ("Pushing deeper," "Holding the patch," "He envisioned"). Compression under stress is acceptable, but the prose rhythm does not modulate sharply with pressure—cadence remains uniform across discovery and resolution beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally sound, but template cadence runs appear: "He [verb]" openers repeat across multiple sentences ("He stood," "He moved," "He focused," "He knelt," "He rose," "He continued," "He reached," "He pictured," "He saw," "He finished," "He walked"). Paraphrase loops touch the closure: "no longer empty but full of unspoken warnings" restates earlier material without fresh pressure. Stock metaphors ("thick blanket smothering," "metallic canyon," "seeds of insight") accumulate in high-pressure beats without transformation. Apply template-cadence penalty (−0.5) and stock-phrase penalty (−0.3) in Q7; total artifact load −0.8, bringing the base down from ~6.9 to 6.1. Information density is moderate; some beats do double duty (patch discovery advances both plot and theme), but scaffolding remains ("This documentation was crucial").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The accident-investigator frame and container-labyrinth setting offer specific anchors, but the premise—investigator reconstructs disaster to prevent future tragedy—follows a recognizable template without sharp transformation. The "hazy precision" tone and "singular convergence" concept are named rather than enacted through surprising particulars. The patch discovery and wind-pattern reconstruction feel competent but predictable; no turn or image offers a non-obvious synthesis. Emotional truth is present (professional rigor meeting human loss) but the arc resolves into a familiar lesson-learned endpoint. Mid-band for solid execution of familiar material without bold risk or ingenuity that redefines expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Accident investigator is established early and frames every beat (survey, anemometer use, patch discovery, reconstruction). However, Elias's choices remain observational and cognitive—he documents, processes, envisions—without a decisive action that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The final departure is framed as mission clarity rather than a choice under competing pressures. Functional integration across beats but no causal turn driven by his agency; swappable with "forensic analyst" or similar role without structural change. Mid-band for presence and coherence, capped by lack of decision pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Flight engineer's patch appears at ~50% (discovery beat), is handled physically (Elias brushes dirt, tucks it in his pocket), and returns in the closure paragraph with reweighted meaning ("no longer just a relic; it was a symbol of the vigilance required," "heavy token"). Three-gate test satisfied: setup (discovery), development (personalizes the data), payoff (charges final image). However, the patch does not constrain a choice or narrow options—it reframes Elias's understanding but does not force a tactical or ethical decision. Strong lyric reprise and closure linkage push it above 6.0; lack of causal pressure caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Singular convergence is named early ("His current task was a methodical survey… dissect this quiet catastrophe") and returns thematically ("the weight of singular convergence, that precise instant where every flaw and force had aligned"). The concept shapes Elias's investigative stance (looking for the moment all factors aligned) but remains abstract—it does not constrain a choice or narrow options on the page. The reconstruction beat envisions the convergence ("minor oversight, amplified by the port's unique wind dynamics") but this occurs in reflection, not as a tactical pressure. Functional thematic presence; mid-band for shaping stakes conceptually without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Rapidly adapting appears as a label in the opening third ("His mind was rapidly adapting, processing the scant data") and again at the wind-shift beat ("Elias adapted rapidly, shifting his stance to maintain balance"). The trait is demonstrated (postural adjustment, hypothesis recalibration) but does not impose a visible cost or tradeoff—adaptation is portrayed as frictionless competence. No moment where rapid adaptation forecloses a slower, more thorough option or causes a misstep. Functional presence without causal pressure or cost; capped below 5.0 for label-only use with no dramatic friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Survey is signaled early ("His current task was a methodical survey"), occupies multiple beats (wind readings, anemometer use, debris examination, reconstruction), and drives the closure (survey completion → "report would be a testament"). The action is irreplaceable: removing "survey" would require rewriting the investigative frame and the documentation-to-prevention arc. However, survey itself is method rather than turn-creator—no single survey moment forces a reversal or decision. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; causal role is enabling rather than decisively narrowing. High 7s for essential scaffolding that shapes but does not turn the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Documenting wind patterns is introduced early (anemometer, "invisible maps of turbulence") and recurs across beats: initial readings, vortex tracing, reconstruction of the plane's final approach. The method enables Elias's insight ("Here, the wind patterns he had documented would have converged with brutal force") and directly informs the closure (report as harvest of documentation). Mechanics matter—anemometer readings provide the data that shape his understanding. All three gates satisfied; causal role is enabling rather than constraining (wind data does not force a tactical choice but supplies the answer). High 6s for strong beat involvement and payoff without on-page cost tied to the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Towering labyrinth of shipping containers in a port city is established immediately and actively shapes the entire investigation: spatial choreography (narrow gaps, vortices), the crash site's location deep in the maze, and the wind dynamics that caused the disaster. The labyrinth constrains Elias's path ("pushing deeper," navigating corridors) and supplies the causal variable (container arrangement → wind convergence). The setting participates in closure: "the labyrinth seemed to breathe," debris scattered in the clearing, wind patterns converging. Irreplaceable—no other setting would produce these wind effects or this investigative challenge. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage push this into high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>After the town goes silent is established early ("the disaster that had stilled the entire town," "the town's sudden silence") and frames the atmosphere throughout. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics—Elias's survey proceeds without a clock or urgency constraint tied to "after." The silence functions as backdrop and thematic texture (eerie absence, unspoken warnings) rather than a temporal pressure. Present and coherent but swappable with "during evacuation" or "before cleanup crews arrive" without altering the investigative arc. Functional atmosphere; capped below 4.0 for lack of tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>To cultivate foresight in action is stated early ("his purpose here was to cultivate foresight in action") and returns in the closure ("testament to the need for foresight in every action," "storm of prevention"). The motivation frames Elias's survey and reconstruction but remains aspirational rather than conflicted—no moment where foresight competes with another want (speed, closure for families, personal safety). The desire is told and demonstrated through diligent work, but lacks on-page friction or cost. Functional motivational frame; mid-5s for shaping stakes without dramatized conflict or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Hazy precision is named early and recurs in diction: "hazy precision, each step deliberate yet clouded," "The hazy precision of his work sharpened into a clear, dreadful image." The tone is coherent—investigative rigor under atmospheric uncertainty—and modulates (shifts from clouded to sharp at the reconstruction beat). The oxymoron charges the final image: precise data extraction from obscured disaster. Tone supports the core concept (singular convergence emerging from fog) and holds through turns without static repetition. Lyric reprise and closure linkage; strong thematic fit. Mid-6s for coherent modulation and purposeful tension without deeply constraining a choice.</comment>
