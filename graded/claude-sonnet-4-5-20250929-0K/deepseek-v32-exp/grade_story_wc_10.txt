<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to translate silence into music is clear and consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract statements ("desperate need," "sole compass") rather than embodied contradiction. The heat-mapping method provides concrete action, yet the capsizing trauma remains told rather than lived—"She pressed the cool metal of the fork to her forehead, recalling the boat's violent tilt" summarizes memory without showing how it complicates present choice. The final stance ("she had found her peace") arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path; we see completion but not sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara moves through the conservatory, layering heat-mapped emotions until the final tapestry reweights her grief into "harmonious" visual music. However, the closure unit lacks visible cost—she steps back and views the completed work, feeling peace, but no option is foreclosed and no tactical price paid. The "rectify" repetitions gesture toward atonement, yet the text never dramatizes what she renounces or risks to achieve this transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vividly rendered with "frost-etched flora," "crystalline workbench," and "frozen breath," and the unshaken marvels anchor the setting's thematic weight. The conservatory supplies both sanctuary and stage, and the glass itself becomes the canvas for heat-mapping. The tuning fork case and grand piano with cut strings serve as micro-setting elements that constrain Elara's method, elevating the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and remains coherent. Elara's process unfolds as a series of emotional mappings (scarlet fear, azure sorrow, emerald hope) that accumulate toward the final tapestry. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a density increase or pattern break that reweights cost, and here the mappings feel iterative rather than tightening. No tactical trade-off or foreclosed option makes the final peace feel earned; the conservatory "felt less like a prison and more like a stage" is declared, not demonstrated through a choice that alters her situation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—silence as canvas, not void—emerges organically from Elara's heat-mapping and the unshaken marvels. The final image of the conservatory holding "a silent music for the ages" offers resonance, and the piece avoids overt moralizing in most beats. However, the closing paragraph risks thematic echo: "Silence, once a curse, had become her instrument, and she its composer" articulates the thesis too directly, and the phrase "eternally unshaken" repeats the motif without fresh reconfiguration. The piece gestures toward profundity but states more than it implies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, and Elara's perceptual filter—"her hands traced frozen petals," "she saw the vibration as a ripple of gold"—anchors the narration. However, several passages slip into elevated exposition: "This visualization was her only way to hear the echoes of what once was" and "Her journey was not about noise, but about understanding silence's depth" read as narrator summary rather than character thought. Psychic distance wobbles between close embodiment and declarative overview, weakening voice coherence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prose carries vivid images ("scarlet for fear, azure for sorrow, emerald for hope") and maintains clarity, but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple sentences begin with "She [verb]" across the middle third ("She pressed," "She adjusted," "She moved," "She repeated"), flattening rhythm. Phrases like "to rectify the emptiness" and "to purify it into something harmonious" recur without added pressure, and "unshaken marvels" appears six times, often as mere label. These artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in this category and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—heat-mapping emotions in a post-noise world—offers a fresh conceptual angle, and the conservatory setting provides specificity. However, the emotional arc follows a template recovery path (trauma → creative transformation → peace) without a non-obvious turn. The "unshaken marvels" motif and the tuning fork case feel purposeful but not irreplaceable; swapping heat-mapping for another visual translation method would not fundamentally alter character or stakes. The piece synthesizes familiar elements (silence, grief, art as healing) without a bold inflection that reweights prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The capsizing trauma is present by the fourth paragraph and recurs in reflection, but Elara's survival status does not constrain present choices. She remembers "the cold water claiming voices," yet this memory informs theme more than tactics—she does not face a live decision shaped by her survivor status. The element appears in setup and payoff (closure references her peace as "the capsize survivor"), meeting two gates, but lacks middle development where survivor guilt or responsibility would narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The tuning fork case appears early ("her most prized possession"), is opened and used in the middle ("She lifted a fork, feeling its potential vibrate in her soul"), and closes with "a soft click, a gesture of completion." It signals her method and bookends the sequence. However, the case itself does not constrain choice—any container would serve the same function. The forks enable the heat-mapping visualization, but their precision as "relics from a lost era" remains ornamental. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met; causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" (the frost-thriving plants) recur frequently and anchor the conservatory's thematic resonance, but they function as witnesses and metaphor rather than shaping Elara's tactics. The plants "stood as unyielding notes in her grand composition" and "taught her that some wonders need no sound to awe," yet these insights do not narrow her options or alter her method. The concept appears in setup, middle description, and closure, meeting all three gates, but its role remains thematic rather than causal, capping it in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is described as "silently expressive in the way her hands traced frozen petals" and later "Her silently expressive gestures—a bowed head, a steady gaze—conveyed more than words." The attribute is present and illustrated, but it does not constrain or enable a specific choice with cost. In a world where noise is impossible, everyone is necessarily silent; the trait does not distinguish her tactics or force a trade-off. Setup and middle mention are present, but the attribute does not shape closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rectify" appears six times, anchoring Elara's motivation to repair her past failure and transform grief. "She aimed to rectify the emptiness," "to rectify her past failure to save others," "repeated the action, each strike rectifying a fragment of her broken spirit," and "She had rectified her pain not by erasing it, but by harmonizing it." The action drives her method and frames closure. However, the text never dramatizes what specific act of rectification occurs—what she renounces or what cost she pays—so the verb remains thematic rather than decisive. All three gates are met, and it shapes the ending, lifting it into the 6–7 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Heat-mapping is introduced early ("she had devised a method, heat-mapping emotions onto the conservatory's glass"), explained with mechanics ("specialized dyes that responded to body warmth"), and executed across multiple beats (scarlet/azure/emerald, "ripple of gold," violet gratitude, final tapestry). The method constrains her approach—she cannot produce audible sound, so she translates emotion visually—and the closure image depends on the accumulated heat-map. All three gates are met, the method drives at least two beats, and it is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory provides sanctuary, houses the unshaken marvels, and supplies the glass surface for heat-mapping. It is present from the opening, described in vivid detail, and the final image ("The winterglass conservatory held her masterpiece") ties closure to the setting. The conservatory's "frozen breath" and "frost on the glass" enable Elara's method. However, the setting does not pressure her choices—she could perform the same emotional mapping elsewhere. All three gates are met, and it contributes to closure, but it does not narrow options or impose a visible tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the Great Quietening, when noise became impossible" is established early and shapes the world's rules. It forces Elara to find non-audible music, making the heat-mapping method necessary. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions within this scene—no clock pressures her, and the post-Quietening world is static backdrop rather than escalating condition. Setup is clear, the rule affects her method (middle development), but it does not charge the closure beat beyond thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to translate silence into music" is stated early ("her sole compass") and drives every beat: opening the tuning fork case, striking the fork, heat-mapping emotions, viewing the final tapestry. The motivation is coherent and present at closure ("she had found her peace in the unhearable melody"). However, it is told more than dramatized—no moment shows her choosing this goal over a competing want or paying a visible cost to pursue it. The friction between her grief and her creative method is present but not embodied in a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>
