<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The Oracle's "mild obsession" to draw a map is declared but never tested against a competing desire or cost. Her meditation and focus are described at length, but no on-page choice reveals internal contradiction or forces a trade-off. The ending grants fulfillment without visible sacrifice; she simply completes her task and descends with "profound peace," leaving motivation static and the final moment unearned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed; who/where/when anchors arrive piecemeal across the first ~150 words, causing drift (−0.4). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs: the Oracle begins meditating, continues meditating, and finishes without reversal or reweighted cost. The closure claims success—"her work complete"—but the booklet's glow and the map's existence are asserted, not dramatized as a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible price. No cost proof sentence is legible at the ending beat (−0.6).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort, single star, and "ambered hush" anchor atmosphere effectively. The booklet is handled twice (placed, pages glow), meeting micro-setting criteria. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; the Oracle's meditation succeeds without spatial friction, leaving setting ornamental at closure and capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>One stake is signaled early: draw the map. Pressure never escalates; the Oracle proceeds unimpeded from opening meditation to completion. No on-page reversal, tightening choice, or visible cost alters tactics. The star dims "slightly" and later "shone brighter," but these ambient shifts do not narrow options or force trade-offs, leaving escalation absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—mapping silence to guide lost souls—emerges from image and action without moralizing. The "marbled hush" and "summarizing silence" recur purposefully. Yet the ending delivers a tidy resolution with no cost or ambiguity; the Oracle achieves her goal and feels "profound peace," closing thematic tension without a non-literal reweighting or friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable, and the perceptual signature—"ambered hush," "marbled hush"—is distinct. Register is consistent and controlled. However, the piece leans heavily on tell-mode summary ("she intended," "her motivation was clear") rather than showing micro-choices under pressure, flattening immediacy in peak beats and preventing higher elevation.</comment>

<quarter>7</quarter><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "silence that enveloped her" / "summarizing silence" / "silence of forgotten memories" cycle without added pressure. Template cadence appears in runs: "She recalled… She began… She saw… She felt… She continued…" across seven consecutive paragraphs (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("pebble-shore," "ambered hush," "marbled hush") repeat label-only without evolving meaning (−0.4). Figurative density in the final third—"cloak," "echo," "testament"—stacks without pattern payoff (−0.3). Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the cap and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—Oracle maps silence via meditation and a mystical booklet—follows a familiar template: spiritual quest fulfilled through introspection. Transformation test fails: swap "pebble-shore" and "gold leaf booklet" with generic equivalents and the emotional arc remains unchanged (−0.6). No fresh inflection or risk distinguishes this from stock fantasy fulfillment arcs, leaving originality ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character present throughout but makes no key choice. She decides to meditate, then completes the task; observation and execution occur without friction or turn. Late fulfillment (closure) is described, not dramatized as a decision altering tactics. Swappable protagonist; any oracle could enact the same arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Booklet handled twice (placed, pages glow), meeting minimal beat involvement. It reappears at closure when "filled with intricate, glowing lines," reweighting its emptiness. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress; the Oracle succeeds regardless. Setup and closure gates met, but causal pressure and cost are absent, capping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Ambered hush" recurs as atmospheric label across six paragraphs but never narrows options or changes tactics. It functions as tone marker, not stake shaper. Present early and at closure, but ornamental; removing it would not alter the Oracle's task or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Mildly obsessed" appears once as a label ("She was mildly obsessed with a singular purpose") and again near the end ("her mild obsession drove her to ignore the chill"). No on-page action constrained or enabled by the trait; no visible tradeoff or cost. Told-only, swappable with "focused" or "determined."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Retell" appears in five beats but remains abstract: "to retell the story of the cosmos," "she began to retell the tale," "she retold the silence." The action is narrated, not dramatized. Removing "retell" and substituting "capture" or "record" would require only minor edits; the method does not uniquely define the Oracle's approach or reshape the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Summarizing silence" is named early and repeated four times, but its mechanics are never shown. The Oracle "attuned herself to the stillness" and "interpreted" quiet, yet we see no distinct technique or cost. The method is a thematic phrase, not a dramatized process that shapes attempts or alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Ridge fort is named early and recurs at closure ("storm-tossed ridge fort stood silent witness"). It provides atmosphere—wind, battlement—but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. Postcard description without causal work; swappable with any remote elevation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"When only one star remains" opens the piece and the star pulses, dims, then "shone brighter" at closure, creating a lyric bracket. Yet time is not tracked as a live constraint; the Oracle works at her own pace with no clock tightening decisions. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"To draw a map of an endless night" is stated early as motivation and fulfilled at closure. However, the desire is told—"Her motivation was clear and unwavering"—rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No friction between want and cost; the Oracle simply achieves her goal, leaving the motivation uncontested and the outcome frictionless.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Marbled hush" recurs five times, anchoring tone coherently. The phrase modulates slightly ("ambered hush," "palpable calm") to reflect the meditation's progress. It charges the final image when the hush "lingered, a testament." Present early and late, purposeful, but does not sharpen a turn or constrain pressure, leaving it shy of higher integration.</comment>
