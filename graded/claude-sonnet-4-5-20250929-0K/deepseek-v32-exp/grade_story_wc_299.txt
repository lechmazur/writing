<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is clear and the confidently uncertain trait is shown through appraisal expertise versus internal doubt. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("echo valley longing," "hollow quiet") rather than embodied contradiction. The closing choice to combine roadie knowledge with appraisal work emerges quickly after Mara's prompt rather than through sustained internal wrestling. The speaker grille cloth functions more as symbolic talisman than a constraint that forces visible tradeoffs in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear (quarry office trailer, post-failure). The drive lens reads Causal-leaning Hybrid: Leo's failure → isolation → Mara's visit → insight → new direction. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (abandoning insulation, embracing hybrid identity), but the turn from deflection to purpose arrives in a single conversation without intermediate friction or a visible price paid on the page. The framed grille cloth ending gestures toward Charged Poise but the cost remains asserted ("he found peace") rather than dramatized through a foreclosed option or tactical sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer is anchored early and the grille cloth scrap provides tactile detail. Sensory selection is limited: no dust on Leo's hands, no trailer creaks, no quarry sounds outside. The space remains static postcard rather than constraining choice—Leo could have this conversation anywhere. The cloth's texture is mentioned but does not alter his grip or his next move in a way that charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: discover purpose after public failure. One tightening occurs when Mara's empathy threatens Leo's emotional walls, forcing him to either deflect or open. Leo's choice to combine past and present is protagonist-driven, but the path from deflection to synthesis unfolds in rapid summary ("He spent the next days researching") rather than a second on-page beat that narrows options with visible cost. The professional failure consequence remains abstract; no client walks away, no quarry contract threatened.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—how to live after applause ends—emerges from the grille cloth motif and Leo's hybrid identity. The final framing of the cloth offers a visual answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, phrases like "echo valley longing" and "wrest meaning from the chaos" occasionally tip into prompt-label language. The ending's wisdom ("he found peace") is asserted rather than shown through a specific image of cost or renunciation that makes the transformation undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited. Leo's perceptual signature (appraiser's eye, roadie nostalgia) comes through in the grille-cloth recitation. Dialogue with Mara feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext (her empathy versus his deflection). However, phrases like "confidently uncertain," "echo valley longing," and "insulating emotionally with facts" feel like narrator glosses rather than Leo's organic thought idiom. Under peak pressure (Mara's challenge), diction remains steady rather than compressing or fragmenting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence openings. Minor loops: "He was insulating again, hiding behind technicalities" directly after showing the deflection in dialogue; "After the applause" repeats as a thematic anchor without adding new pressure. Stock metaphors: "hollow quiet," "shield," "anchor," "spiraling thoughts." The phrase "wrest control" and "wrest this new purpose" feel like template echoes of the required action verb rather than organic idiom. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he looked") cluster in the middle third but do not obscure causality. Information density is moderate; some beats (the research montage) summarize rather than dramatize.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ex-roadie/appraiser hybrid is a specific synthesis and the music-memorabilia niche offers a fresh angle. However, the emotional arc (public failure → isolation → epiphany → renewal) follows a familiar template without transforming it through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The grille cloth as key metaphor is apt but not surprising. Mara's intervention and Leo's insight arrive on schedule rather than through a risky structural or perspectival choice that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo (ex-roadie turned appraiser) is present throughout and his dual expertise drives the closing decision to appraise music memorabilia. His choices (clutching the cloth, deflecting with facts, then embracing the hybrid path) create the key turn. Setup clear, middle choice (deflection vs. opening), closure participation (new niche decision). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; cost is conceptual (abandoning pure insulation) but legible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The speaker grille cloth appears in three beats: opening tactile moment, mid-scene deflection prop, and closing framed symbol. It returns with reweighted meaning (from relic to key). However, its physical properties (weave, texture) do not constrain Leo's grip or alter his next move in a way that raises stakes. The cloth functions more as thematic anchor than causal lever. Setup, development (held during Mara's visit), and closure presence all met; closure linkage moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the applause" is signaled early ("After the applause, there was only this hollow quiet") and recurs in the final third ("After the applause, he was crafting his own quiet encore"). It shapes the dominant stake (life after peak performance) and the concept constrains Leo's emotional state. However, it functions primarily as thematic frame rather than altering on-page tactics or forcing a visible trade-off. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but does not narrow options in a middle beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is labeled early ("He was confidently uncertain, a state he'd mastered") and illustrated (appraises clocks with authority, wavers about self-worth). It enables his deflection with Mara (confidence surfaces "like a reflex"). However, the trait is never tested under peak pressure—no moment where overconfidence costs him or where uncertainty prevents a needed assertive move. Present and functional but does not constrain a key choice with visible cost. Setup yes, middle illustration yes, closure participation weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears three times: "wrest meaning from the chaos," "wrest control of this conversation," "wrest this new purpose from the ashes." The action is tied to Leo's active effort to reclaim agency. However, the verb is used more as thematic tag than dramatized struggle—no on-page moment where Leo physically or tactically wrests an object, conversation, or decision away from opposition with immediate consequence. Swappable with "reclaim" or "forge" with minor edits. Setup, middle, and closure mentions but causally thin.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Insulating emotionally with facts" is shown twice: Leo recites grille-cloth history to shield himself, then deflects Mara's empathy with ceramic-glaze technicalities. The method shapes his tactics in the middle beat and the resolution explicitly rejects it ("No more insulating with facts to avoid feeling"). Setup, development (used during Mara encounter), and closure participation (renunciation) all present. The cost of the method (isolation) is conceptual and legible. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer is anchored early and provides spatial container. It transforms symbolically from "place of isolation" to "workshop for renewal" but does not constrain Leo's choices—the conversation with Mara and Leo's epiphany could occur in any private space. No environmental detail (narrow doorway, locked file, missing tool) alters tactics. Setup yes, middle presence yes, closure participation weak (symbolic only). Postcard description rather than pressure lever.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After failing publicly" is the inciting event (yesterday's vase misidentification) and frames Leo's present isolation. Time pressure is mild: no looming second appraisal, no quarry lease deadline. The "next days" research montage is summarized without temporal tightening. Setup clear, middle presence (Mara references "the appraisal"), but no live clock that forces Leo to decide now rather than later. Timeframe sets context but does not escalate tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To discover purpose after loss" is the dominant stake, signaled early ("His motivation now was to discover purpose after that loss") and dramatized through Leo's clutching the cloth, deflecting Mara, and finally choosing the music-memorabilia niche. The desire conflicts with his insulating habit. Setup, middle friction (Mara challenges his deflection), and closure participation (new purpose declared and acted on) all present. Cost is conceptual (abandoning insulation) and legible. Strong integration but the turn is more declared than earned through incremental tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Echo valley longing" is labeled early and recurs as thematic tag. Tone reads as wistful melancholy with occasional uplift. However, the phrase feels like prompt artifact rather than organic idiom, and tone remains relatively uniform across beats—no sharp modulation when Mara breaches his walls or when insight strikes. The ending's tone ("quiet encore," "peace") shifts to resolve but the charge is asserted rather than built through rhythmic or imagistic tension. Coherent but static; does not deepen pressure at closure.</comment>
