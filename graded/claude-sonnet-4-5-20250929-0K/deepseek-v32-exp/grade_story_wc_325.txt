<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to honor the unremembered is stated but never tested by an on-page conflict between competing goods. Her claustrophobia is mentioned three times yet never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it simply evaporates when convenient. The ghostly researchers materialize as reward rather than complication, and her "healing" is asserted in the final paragraph without embodied cost or visible forfeit. Interior voice relies on abstract labels ("swell of peace," "purpose clear") instead of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story strings together exploration beats without because/therefore linkage: Elara moves deeper, finds cables, places the codex, sees ghosts, leaves. The tidal-change deadline is declared urgent but never tightens a choice or forces a trade-off; she simply "emerges just as the currents reversed." The codex hologram reveals safe paths, yet phase transitions remain abstract; no on-page moment shows her selecting one route over another with visible cost. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the "healing" and "tribute" are told rather than made legible through a decisive image or forfeited option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The undersea facility and phase-transition corridors supply vivid sensory detail (walls that "ripple like water," cracked cables sparking). Spatial choreography is mostly coherent across the descent and return. However, the environment never constrains a live choice: Elara follows the codex's golden light without navigating between paths or working around obstacles. The "crashing hush" phrase recurs but remains a tonal flourish rather than a sensory anchor that shapes perception or urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—return the codex before the tidal window closes—is signaled early but never tested. No on-page reversal narrows options; the hologram reveals safe paths and Elara retraces them without misstep or cost. The ghostly researchers appear as closure reward rather than complication. Agency is absent: the codex guides her, the facility "calms," and the currents reverse on schedule. The final "accomplishment" is asserted without a visible price paid or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of standing by the unremembered emerges from the premise but is stated rather than dramatized: "she had stood by them" and "healed a part of her own past" are declarations in the final paragraphs. The phase-transition conceit gestures toward personal transformation ("not just of matter, but of her own spirit") but the parallel is announced rather than enacted. The codex's gold fleck recurs across beats yet never reweights meaning or imposes cost; it remains a convenience device. One credit: the quiet ending resists overt moralizing until the penultimate lines, which lapse into thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable distance and filters description through Elara's present experience (claustrophobia, duty, relief). Diction remains consistent within her implied register. However, interiority leans on abstract phrases ("swell of peace," "purpose clear") and the final paragraphs shift into summary mode ("She knew that some things are meant to be forgotten..."), diluting the established narrative texture. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance widens at closure when embodied perception gives way to reflective telling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; no mechanical template runs. Clarity is adequate and spatial choreography tracks across moves. Deductions: paraphrase loops in the final third ("The unremembered were no longer alone; she had stood by them" followed by "honored the unremembered" and "cherished in her memory") create synonym churn (−0.4). The phrase "crashing hush" is recycled without reweighting (−0.2). Stock metaphor in closure beat: "eternal dance" of tides (−0.3). Cumulative line-level debt: −0.9, lowering from mid-6s to 5.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The undersea-facility premise and phase-transition mechanics offer a fresh frame, but execution defaults to template beats: lone explorer, magical codex, convenient hologram, grateful ghosts. The tidal-deadline and claustrophobia hooks are set up but never leveraged for an earned turn. The final image—boat on waves, warm memory—reads as stock closure. Transformation test fails: swap the codex for any guide artifact and the arc is unchanged. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis that grows from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (squeeze into tunnel, place codex, hurry back) advance the sequence. However, none of these choices creates a turn or alters tactics; she follows the codex's guidance without friction. Claustrophobia is mentioned but does not constrain action. The character drives motion but not meaningful pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The codex appears in multiple beats: carried in the pack, placed on the panel to project a hologram, set on the pedestal at closure. Its gold fleck guides Elara and aligns with invisible patterns in the final chamber. However, it functions as a convenience device; she never chooses between routes or pays a cost tied to its use. Present across setup, development, and payoff, but causal pressure is minimal. Two-gate participation plus modest beat involvement yields mid-5s; lack of cost or irreplaceable mechanics caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Undersea cables snake across floors, spark, and once pulsed with data; the facility studied phase transitions. These details enrich setting but do not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The cables are described, not handled or navigated around. Present in setup and touched in the middle, but absent from closure and without causal pressure. Functional background element, replaceable with any derelict infrastructure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The gold fleck tracks invisible things: it glows in the dark, points toward the control panel, projects the hologram of safe paths, and aligns with invisible patterns at closure. This attribute enables progression across three beats. However, Elara does not face a trade-off or cost tied to its use; it simply works as needed. Present in setup, development, and payoff, with beat involvement, but no visible constraint or price. Mid-5s for functional enabling without cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Return" structures the goal and frames the closure: Elara descends to return the codex, places it on the pedestal, and completes the mission. The return motivates all major moves and the ending image acknowledges the accomplishment. However, the return is never at risk; no choice forces her to weigh return against another value. Present in setup (vowed motivation), development (placing the codex), and payoff (pedestal, mission complete), with causal linkage across beats. Lack of visible cost or contested trade-off prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Phase transitions are described in several beats: matter shifts from solid to mist, walls ripple like water, researchers flicker through states. The method is signaled early and recurs. However, Elara does not navigate between phases through choice or technique; the codex reveals safe paths and she follows them. Mechanics are ornamental rather than tactical. Present in setup and middle, touching closure via the researchers' shifting forms, but no cost or constraint tied to the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility is the sole location, anchoring all action. It supplies obstacles (narrow tunnel, gaseous barriers, cracked cables) and the central chamber for closure. The facility is described across multiple beats and its history (phase-transition research, vanished researchers) motivates Elara's mission. However, the environment does not pressure a choice; Elara navigates it without forced trade-offs or route selection. Present in setup, development, and payoff, with beat involvement, but minimal causal constraint. Mid-5s for essential framing without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Tidal changes are declared as a narrow window that will "seal her in forever" if missed, establishing urgency. Elara emerges "just as the currents reversed," confirming the timeframe at closure. However, the deadline never tightens a choice or forces her to abandon a task; she completes every step and exits on schedule. Present in setup (declared constraint) and payoff (met on time), but absent from development and without visible cost or altered tactics. Functional declared stake, but untracked and untested.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>To stand by the unremembered motivates Elara's descent and is referenced across beats (old files, researchers' smiling forms, "she had stood by them"). The motivation frames the mission and is affirmed at closure. However, it is never conflicted or tested; no on-page moment forces her to weigh this duty against another value or cost. Told-only motivation present in setup, middle, and payoff, but dramatized friction is absent. Functional but replaceable with any altruistic rescue premise.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Crashing hush" appears in three beats: fills corridors, deepens during exploration, gives way to "respectful quiet," and lingers as tribute in the final paragraph. The phrase establishes a paradoxical quiet-as-noise tone. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure; it remains a static descriptor rather than shifting to charge the closure image. Present across the arc with purposeful recurrence, but lacking dynamic range or closure intensification. Mid-4s for coherent but unvaried tonal layer.</comment>
