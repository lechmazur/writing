<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation (self-forgiveness) is signaled early and drives the journey, but his interior life relies heavily on abstraction ("tempest of regret," "anxious guilt") rather than embodied contradiction. The final acceptance arrives through puzzle-solving rather than a genuine fork in values with visible cost. Productive fidgeting is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or creates friction. The arc reads as contemplative processing rather than a character under pressure making a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The story follows a causal lens: Elian decodes the tapestry, applies the solution to the labyrinth, and achieves internal release. However, the closure effect—"he forgave himself and chose to move forward"—is asserted rather than demonstrated through a concrete choice or image that reweights prior material. The cost (exile, shame) is backstory; no on-page forfeiture or alteration of present options occurs. The ending tells us redemption happened rather than showing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is vividly evoked ("woven hush," suspended leaves) and the platinum labyrinth is handled twice (first as a reminder, then as a puzzle). The tapestry's frayed threads supply a method and sensory anchor. However, the environment does not constrain Elian's choices—no clock pressure, no denied path, no resource scarcity. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a force that shapes tactics or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is clear and sustained. Elian's decoding of the tapestry and labyrinth solution constitute one meaningful tightening, but the escalation is intellectual work rather than a pressure that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The labyrinth clicks into place without risk of failure or visible cost; the "lull of distant thunder" warning never materializes into urgency. No on-page reversal or forfeiture alters tactics. The resolution is delivered by understanding rather than agency under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of humility, patience, and self-forgiveness emerges from the chess backstory and labyrinth metaphor. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "He had winnowed away the chaff of his self-pity, leaving only the grain of hard-won wisdom." This direct articulation replaces scene pressure. The platinum labyrinth and tapestry are symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest thematic closure rather than recurring objects that accumulate pressure. The ending tells us Elian "forgave himself" instead of offering a resonant image that reweights the question without a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elian; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent ("fierce repose," "woven hush") and rhythmically controlled, though some phrases trend toward elevated register ("absolution," "tempest of regret"). The prose occasionally drifts into abstraction ("sharp, constant ache," "calm certainty replacing anxious guilt") that tells emotion rather than embodying it. Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular; another reflective protagonist could carry similar interiority. No dialogue to judge. Minor filter-verb reliance ("his mind already working") in a high-pressure beat slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is clear, but several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "The woven hush of the village allowed no distraction" / "The woven hush now felt like a blanket of peace"; "His fingers, accustomed to the weight of ivory pieces, now fidgeted productively" / "his productive fidgeting resumed" / "His fingers, fidgeting, plucked." Elevated abstractions ("strategic blindness," "tempest of regret") recur without fresh embodiment. The final paragraph summarizes the arc ("he forgave himself," "his redemption") rather than trusting image. Apply paraphrase-loop −0.2, template-cadence −0.4, and summary closure −0.3 for a combined −0.9 in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The exiled-tutor-seeking-redemption premise is familiar; the time-frozen village and puzzle-as-metaphor structure are recognizable genre elements. The story does not transform these through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The chess backstory and labyrinth solution map one-to-one onto the theme without surprising synthesis. The ending's "forgave himself and chose to move forward" is emotionally generic. No bold structural risk or fresh inflection distinguishes the execution from similar reflective-arc templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and his goal (self-forgiveness) frames the journey. He decodes the tapestry and solves the labyrinth—two distinct beats. However, his "choices" are intellectual work (interpreting threads) rather than decisions that alter tactics or foreclose paths. The ending tells us he forgave himself rather than showing a choice with cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but swappable with any reflective seeker. Causal role +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure mention +0.7, but passivity and summary resolution cap mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth is introduced early (setup), handled in the tapestry-decoding beat (middle), and aligned/solved in the climax (ending). It glows at closure, signaling release. However, it does not constrain Elian's choices—no failed attempts, no trade-off, no mechanical specificity that matters. The labyrinth is a symbolic lock that clicks open when the code is found, not an irreplaceable object whose properties shape tactics. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but ornamental resolution and swappability with any puzzle −0.8 and −0.6. Rounds to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Woven hush" appears as atmospheric description ("woven hush of the village," "woven hush now felt like a blanket of peace") but does not constrain Elian's actions or alter his options. It is an image of the time-frozen state, not a stake or tactic. Present in setup and ending (lyric reprise +0.5), but ornamental use −0.8. Caps at 4.6 for missing middle development; resolves to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" is mentioned three times but never enables or constrains a choice with cost. The trait is asserted ("his fingers, accustomed to the weight of ivory pieces, now fidgeted productively") and restated without dramatization. No visible tradeoff or friction. Label-only −0.6, ornamental use −0.8, swappable −0.6. Caps at 4.6 for missing middle causal role; resolves to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Winnow" is used twice: once as method ("to winnow truth from tangled memories," "to winnow the essential sequence of moves") and once as thematic metaphor in the ending ("winnowed away the chaff of his self-pity"). The action shapes the middle beat (decoding) and reappears with reweighted meaning at closure. However, easily swappable with "decode" or "extract" without structural change. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, lyric reprise +0.5, but swappability −0.7. Resolves to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("by decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border"), shapes the middle beat (Elian kneels, scans the border, plucks a loose thread, discovers the silver-and-gold sequence), and delivers the code that solves the labyrinth at closure. The mechanics matter: the specific pattern of threads provides the instruction. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6. No major frictions. Resolves to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is described vividly and recurs across beats, but it does not pressure Elian's choices—no denied path, no resource scarcity, no ticking clock. The "woven hush" allows focus but does not constrain tactics. The setting is atmospheric backdrop. Early signal +0.5, multiple beats +0.9, closure mention +0.4, but ornamental use −0.8 and no causal pressure. Caps at 4.6 for missing middle constraint; resolves to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" appears in the opening and is mentioned twice more ("The lull of distant thunder persisted," "The lull of distant thunder broke"), but the time constraint never tightens decisions. The "warning that the lull would soon end" prompts "working quickly," but no urgency or failure-risk materializes. Present but does not shape tactics. Early signal +0.5, ornamental use −0.8, no causal pressure. Caps at 4.6 for missing middle development; resolves to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("to forgive himself for past mistakes") and drives the entire arc. Elian's interior conflict (shame, regret, need for absolution) is told repeatedly and the ending declares the motivation fulfilled. However, the desire is not dramatized through a choice between competing goods with visible cost. The forgiveness is achieved through puzzle-solving rather than a fork that forecloses a path. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, but summary-only resolution −0.7 and no on-page friction between want and cost −0.5. Resolves to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is introduced early ("His repose was fierce, a calm exterior belying the tempest of regret within") and recurs at closure ("in a state of fierce repose"). The tone is coherent and modulates appropriately (intense focus, then release). However, the phrase is a label rather than an effect generated by diction and rhythm. The closure reprise reweights the phrase (external and internal now aligned) but the shift is told. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.0, lyric reprise +0.5, but label-only −0.6 and told shift −0.4. Resolves to 5.1.</comment>
