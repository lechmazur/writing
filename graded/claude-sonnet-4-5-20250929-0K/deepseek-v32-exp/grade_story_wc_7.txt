<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared repeatedly but never tested by meaningful contradiction or internal conflict. Her "synaptic plasticity" operates as label-only exposition—she rewires memories via tell, not dramatized struggle. The widow's bitter soup memory is mentioned as needing to be "pruned from her spirit," yet no on-page choice forces her to sacrifice or endure cost tied to that lingering sadness. Actions align mechanically with stated goals; no flawed impulse complicates her arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layers of metaphor (greenhouse, seed, pruning) accumulate toward the sprouting climax. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. However, the closure moment—seed sprouts, Elara smiles—delivers no visible cost or foreclosed path; the "gentle rebellion" succeeds without friction, and the narrative simply affirms her intent. The alignment wanes but leaves "lasting glow," a soft reset rather than a reconfiguration with price. No meaningful tightening narrows options; each beat restates her purpose without complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is described repeatedly (skeletal iron, broken panes, creaking framework) but functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraint. Elara clears fertile soil and prunes vines without spatial friction—no blocked path, no scarce resource, no physical limit that alters her tactics. The celestial alignment provides ambient light but does not pressure timing or choice. Micro-setting exception not met: no body state, tool, or recurring object meaningfully restricts action or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"create something beautiful from ruins"—is signaled early but never tightened. No reversal or complication challenges Elara; the seed cooperates, the alignment arrives on cue, the plant sprouts exactly as hoped. The pruning of dead vines and the planting proceed without setback, trade-off, or cost. Pressure remains static: the story restates her mission across twenty-nine sentences without escalation or a choice that forecloses an alternate path. The ending delivers success without earned agency or visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of renewal and gentle rebellion is stated overtly in nearly every paragraph ("gentle rebellion," "prune away the dead," "weave beauty from decay") rather than emerging from image and choice. The knowledge fruit seed functions as symbolic convenience—its memory-vision arrives to validate Elara's mission without complication. The final image (young plant where decay reigned) offers no non-literal answer or reweighted question; it confirms the premise without friction. Thematic echo pervades: "synaptic plasticity" and "gentle rebellion" recur as prompt-like labels rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout. However, perceptual signature is generic: "her informally wise nature," "her hands, skilled from years in the kitchen" read as narrator summary rather than Elara's particular lens. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("sacred dialogue between earth and sky," "profound sense of connection") that clashes with a chef's embodied expertise. Synaptic plasticity explanations intrude as textbook filter rather than lived perception. Internal voice lacks idiosyncrasy; could describe any contemplative gardener.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe template-cadence and paraphrase-loop issues: "She knew that to prune…" / "She recalled…" / "She began to prune…" / "She pruned another…" / "She knew that by pruning…" creates repetitive syntactic scaffolding. Synonym churn on "gentle rebellion" (five mentions), "synaptic plasticity" (four mentions), and "create beauty from ruins" (three near-duplicates). Filter-verb stacks: "She could almost taste," "She knew," "She felt," "She aimed." Stock metaphors: "weave beauty from decay," "pages of a forgotten book." Information density is low—many sentences restate her mission without advancing situation. Final third pervaded by these artifacts; disallow 9+ globally and apply −1.4 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise (memory-tasting chef plants magical seed during celestial event) assembles genre furniture without fresh synthesis. The "gentle rebellion" framing and synaptic plasticity mechanism are told rather than transformed through specific choice or world logic. Emotional arc follows template: contemplative opener, unobstructed action, affirming close. The greenhouse, alignment, and knowledge fruit could swap for similar fantasy elements with minimal rewrite. No risk-taking or non-obvious inflection; the piece plays median-safe throughout.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara's memory-tasting ability is mentioned (widow's soup, seed's ancient gardens) but never drives a turn or choice. She tastes a vision from the seed that "inspires her to continue," yet she was already committed; no option narrows. The trait remains ornamental flavor rather than causal lever. Present in setup and ending, but no middle development where the ability constrains or enables action under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The seed appears in setup (paragraph 3), is planted mid-story (paragraph 10), pulses with energy (paragraph 16), sprouts (paragraph 22), and stands as testament in the ending (paragraph 28). It participates in three beats and shapes the closure image. However, it resolves the problem (create beauty) that it did not complicate—no friction or cost tied specifically to this seed versus any plant. Swappable with "rare heirloom seedling" with minor edits; the knowledge-memory property is told, not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Gentle rebellion" is stated five times as thematic label but never operationalized as choice or tactic. The concept does not constrain action—Elara faces no authority to defy, no conventional path to forsake with cost. It functions as mood descriptor rather than stake-shaping force. Present as motif but absent as pressure; score mid-band for functional consistency without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Informally wise" appears twice as summary label (paragraphs 4, 18) but enables no on-page decision. The trait is asserted ("honed by years of listening to ingredients") without demonstrating how unorthodox knowledge constrains or enables her planting method versus formal training. No visible tradeoff; could be removed without altering action. Ornamental presence only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pruning appears in four beats: stated intent (paragraph 6), first vine-cut (paragraph 14), second branch-cut (paragraph 22), and retrospective summary (paragraph 28). The action is tied to internal renewal metaphor and physically enacted. However, the pruning does not create a turn—nothing goes wrong, no choice between competing goods. It supports theme and closure image but could swap for "watering" or "weeding" without breaking structure. Strong lyric reprise with thematic weight, but causal pressure is limited; score solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Synaptic plasticity is explained three times as mechanism (paragraphs 7, 11, 19, 26) but remains tell-only neuroscience label. The text never shows *how* the process operates or why it matters to her planting method. It does not shape an attempt, complicate a choice, or provide a constraint. Late recap (paragraph 26) after the sprouting offers no functional payoff. Present as exposition, absent as causal method; score low for ornamental recurrence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse is described extensively (rusted, skeletal, broken panes, creaking) and present in setup, middle, and ending. However, it supplies no spatial constraint—Elara clears soil and works unimpeded. The structure's decay mirrors theme but does not pressure tactics or alter outcome. Functional backdrop with thematic resonance but replaceable with "abandoned garden" or "derelict conservatory" without structural change; score functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The celestial alignment is introduced early (paragraph 1), intensifies (paragraph 8), reaches peak (paragraph 16), and wanes (paragraph 27). However, it imposes no time pressure—Elara proceeds at her own pace with no urgency or trade-off. The alignment provides atmospheric light and "energy" but does not tighten decisions. Present across the arc but functionally passive; score low-functional for consistent framing without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara's desire to create beauty from ruins is stated repeatedly (paragraphs 2, 13, 25, 28, 30) and drives her planting action. The motivation is consistent and shapes her goal throughout. However, it is never conflicted—no competing want, no cost of pursuing it, no moment where creating beauty requires sacrifice. The motivation aligns with all actions but lacks friction; score mid-band for clear presence and thematic tie without dramatized tension.</comment>
