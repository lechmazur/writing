<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's unique walk-identification trait is introduced but used only twice (Kael, dockworkers) without meaningful cost or contradiction. Her motivation—proving whispers travel farther—is declared but not meaningfully tested by a choice that forecloses an option; Kael follows her without her facing doubt or paying a visible price. Internal contradiction is absent; she remains uniformly calm and correct. Embodied emotion is sparse; her smile and whisper are performed gestures rather than physiological states under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid—Elara demonstrates her philosophy through encounters. Orientation anchors by line ~60 (who/where/storm). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "she had changed one loud world, one soft step at a time" crystallizes her stance with visible demonstration (dockworkers soothed, Kael convinced). Cost is conceptual—her night's labor and risk—but felt rather than decisive. One meaningful deepening (Kael's shift from suspicion to awe) occurs, sufficient for this length under the Situational lens, though the final paragraph tells the thematic payoff rather than showing a decisive forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly rendered early ("steel canyon," storm-lit walls) and the geomagnetic storm scrambles digital guidance, forcing Elara to use her paper map—a micro-setting constraint that shapes the opening choice. The hidden relay niche is spatially coherent. Sensory detail (emerald pulses, charged air) supports atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain the ending; Elara's success is a demonstration of philosophy rather than a spatial problem solved by setting features, limiting the final-image charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving that whispers work better than shouts. Pressure is coherent under the Situational lens—Kael's challenge and the lost dockworkers test Elara's method. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael's suspicion shifts to curiosity after the coin exchange. However, Elara never faces a credible loss or trade-off; she succeeds without visible cost (no stamina drain, no failure that alters tactics, no moment where shouting would have been easier). The resolution is demonstration rather than earned choice under duress, capping escalation impact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—soft influence over loud command—is clear and supported by the coin metaphor (balance), the hidden relay, and the dockworker rescue. However, the final paragraph ("she had proven that whispers, indeed, travel farther than shouts") is explicit thematic summary rather than a resonant image. The key with no lock as metaphor is told ("It's a metaphor… for finding openings") instead of earned through specifics. Subtext is thin; gesture and silence rarely carry meaning that Elara doesn't then articulate. The ending states rather than reweights.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single POV (Elara's limited third) is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: she notices walks, reads body language, values quiet. Diction is controlled but occasionally slips into elevated register ("testament to her creed," "calculated spontaneity of her path") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Dialogue is functional but lacks sharp subtext; Kael and Elara speak their intentions plainly. Psychic distance is consistent. The prose modulates rhythm with storm atmosphere effectively, though peak beats lack compression or urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are mostly distinct. Minor loops: "her movements deliberate yet fluid" / "calculated spontaneity" echo the same idea across beats. Stock phrasing appears: "Instead of arguing, Elara smiled" (boilerplate beat opener), "his eyes widened," "understanding dawning." The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing closure: "she had proven" tells outcome instead of showing cost. One paraphrase loop: "Her motivation was simple yet profound" restates the whisper-vs.-shout premise immediately after establishing it. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (storm scrambles tech, forcing map use) but others scaffold without advancing (e.g., "Intrigued, Kael fell into step"). No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, limiting deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The labyrinth-maintenance-worker premise combined with walk-identification and the whisper-vs.-shout philosophy offers a specific synthesis. However, the core emotional arc—skeptical authority figure convinced by quiet demonstration—is familiar and unfolds predictably without reversal. The "key with no apparent lock" is overtly explained as metaphor, reducing ingenuity. Risk is present in the storm setting and hidden relay, but Elara's success is frictionless; no earned cost or surprise reweights the material. The zodiac coin and geomagnetic storm add texture but remain ornamental to the central proof.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara (labyrinth maintenance worker) is present throughout and her occupation motivates the hidden relay and map expertise. She makes two key choices: engaging Kael with the coin and guiding the dockworkers. Her role is causally tied to the setting (she knows the maze) and shapes the middle and ending beats. However, her decisions do not narrow options or impose visible cost; she succeeds without trade-off. Present in setup, middle, and closure; drives two beats; but lacks irreplaceability (a guide or security insider could substitute with minor edits). Band: essential across beats but swappable, ~7.0 neighborhood minus −0.2 for limited cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The zodiac coin (Libra) appears twice: Elara hands it to Kael (calms him), then returns it with symbolic explanation ("balance and measured action"). It signals her philosophy and shifts Kael's stance. However, the coin is described rather than causally necessary; a badge, talisman, or verbal persuasion could substitute. It does not constrain a choice or charge the ending image (the final line references the map, not the coin). Present in setup and middle; returns with thematic weight; but lacks specific mechanical necessity. Band: shapes one turn with symbolic reprise, ~5.5 neighborhood minus −0.4 for ornamental second mention and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Folded maps appear in the opening (Elara unfolds paper map when tech fails) and closing (she folds it as a "quiet conclusion"). The map enables her navigation but is not central to any turn; the hidden relay and walk-identification do more causal work. The concept is thematic (analog vs. digital, whispers vs. shouts) but does not alter tactics in a pivotal beat. Present in setup and closure lyric reprise; mentioned once in middle ("her folded map a trusted companion") but not used. Band: lyric reprise without mid-scene pressure, ~4.5 neighborhood minus −0.3 for summary-only middle mention.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's walk-identification trait is introduced early, used twice on-page (recognizes Kael's "jerky, impatient gait" before seeing him; identifies dockworkers' "panicked walks"), and enables her to act preemptively both times. The trait is specific and irreplaceable; no other skill would provide that advance knowledge. It shapes two beats and contributes to the ending's demonstration of her expertise. However, no visible cost or trade-off is attached (no moment where the skill misleads or exhausts her). Present in setup, middle (twice), and closure; drives two beats; high specificity. Band: ~7.4 minus −0.2 for lack of cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Challenge occurs when Kael demands inspection; Elara responds with the coin and invitation ("Follow me, and I'll show you how a whisper can navigate"). This turns Kael from antagonist to student and sets up the relay demonstration. The challenge is central to the middle escalation. However, the action is verbal and non-conflictual; Elara faces no refusal or resistance. A different inciting move (Kael asking for help, a mutual problem) could substitute with moderate edits. Present in setup and middle; drives one major turn; moderate irreplaceability. Band: shapes one key turn, ~7.0 neighborhood minus −0.1 for replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The ornate key appears once in the middle: Elara retrieves it, explains it as metaphor, then uses it to trace a seam and open the hidden panel. The key is functional in one beat but is told to be symbolic rather than shown. A lock-pick, tool, or knowledge of the seam could replace it. It does not return or constrain later choices. Introduced in middle; used once with explanation; moderate swappability. Band: functional but replaceable, ~4.2 minus −0.4 for label-only metaphor ("It's a metaphor… for finding openings").</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is introduced in line 1 and frames every beat: storm scrambles guidance (forces paper map), Elara navigates the maze, hidden panel between containers, dockworkers lost in the labyrinth. The setting constrains movement and enables Elara's expertise. The storm's charged air carries her whisper to the dockworkers—direct causal link to theme. The setting is irreplaceable; no other locale provides the vertical steel canyons, the maze pressure, or the atmospheric interference. Present in setup, middle (multiple beats), and closure; high causal pressure and irreplaceability. Band: ~8.0 neighborhood minus −0.4 for the ending summarizing success rather than showing a final spatial constraint overcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm is introduced in line 1 ("emerald pulses"), scrambles digital systems (inciting constraint), paints the maze with disorienting hues, and allows the communications relay to function despite interference. The storm "began to wane" as the night concludes, providing temporal closure. However, no live countdown or escalating storm threat narrows Elara's tactics; the storm is atmospheric backdrop rather than ticking clock. Present in setup, middle (disorientation, relay function), and closure (waning); shapes initial constraint and ending mood. Band: shapes one constraint and closure mood, ~6.6 minus −0.2 for lack of escalating time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts") is declared early and dramatized three times: coin calms Kael, whispered relay message bypasses jammers, whispered directions soothe dockworkers. However, the motivation is never tested by friction; Elara does not face a moment where shouting would be easier or where her whisper fails. The desire drives action but lacks visible cost or internal conflict. Present in setup; drives three beats; but no trade-off or renunciation. Band: shapes multiple beats without cost, ~6.0 minus −0.3 for told-only framing ("Her motivation was simple yet profound").</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Calculated spontaneity is declared in line 8 ("each step was both planned and instinctual") and echoed in "deliberate yet fluid" and the ending's "calculated spontaneity of her path." The tone is asserted rather than modulated through syntax or rhythm; Elara's narration remains uniformly calm and controlled without shifts under pressure. The phrase recurs but does not charge the final image with new meaning. Present as label in setup and closure; no on-page tonal shift to embody the duality. Band: thematic label without embodied modulation, ~5.0 minus −0.1 for static mood.</comment>
