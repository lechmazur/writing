<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to uncover truth is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her choices in the vision feel guided by plot convenience (the diary conveniently unlocks as she completes the cipher) rather than earned struggle. The woman-from-mist functions as an exposition device rather than applying genuine pressure. Interiority relies on abstract phrases like "profound sense of reverence" and "strange peace" instead of embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The retrocognitive vision provides the dominant frame, but causality is weak: Elara arranges debris and the diary simply unlocks without meaningful resistance or cost that forecloses options. The closure—sitting quietly with resolved findings—lacks a decisive change or visible price; her "resolve to share" is declared intention, not on-page action with stakes. The vision dissolves automatically rather than through protagonist agency. Orientation is delayed (zeppelin library context arrives late, lagoon mechanics unclear until midpoint).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and beach debris create vivid sensory anchors ("grains of sand between her toes," "surface so still it seemed like black glass"). The floating library zeppelin is mentioned but remains postcard description without constraining choices. Spatial choreography within the vision is coherent, though the transition back to the library feels abrupt and ungrounded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decrypting the diary to reveal hidden civil-rights history—is clear, but escalation is minimal. Elara faces no genuine opposition; the cipher solves itself as she arranges objects, and the vision releases her on schedule. The "controversy it might cause" is mentioned but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; the path from discovery to resolution is frictionless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tension between sanitized history and painful truth emerges through dialogue and the diary's content. However, the theme is stated directly ("some truths are too painful to bear, but they must be borne nonetheless") rather than earned through scene pressure. The final paragraph's thematic summary—"cost of silence and the price of truth"—replaces resonant image with explicit moralizing. The searing-reverie motif recurs but without reweighting prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but psychic distance is inconsistent: "She thought about the parley" and "She often wondered" drift into summary that flattens immediacy. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the scene's urgency ("retrocognitively," "resonance of long-held secrets"). The woman's dialogue feels expository rather than goal-driven. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "understood") cluster in reflective passages without voice-motivated purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: the diary is "encrypted" and "its lock intricate and unyielding" restate the same obstacle; "searing reverie" appears three times without evolving meaning. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "She [verb]." Stock phrases include "weight of history," "hidden beneath the towering dunes," "raw and unvarnished." The final six paragraphs loop thematically, restating Elara's burden and mission without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The retrocognitive-vision-as-cipher-key is a workable genre synthesis, but the floating zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon feel like checklist ornaments rather than organic necessities. The beach-debris cipher evokes standard puzzle-box mechanics without fresh complication. Emotional beats—"profound sense of reverence," "strange peace"—rely on generic templates. The story could function unchanged with a standard archive and straightforward decryption, suggesting shallow transformation of familiar elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as archivist frames the stakes, but her decisions are reactive rather than generative. She arranges debris as instructed, receives exposition from the woman, and resolves to share findings off-page. No key turn depends on a choice that costs her something or alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears in the vision as the meeting site and its surface "shimmers" to show scenes. It anchors two beats (arrival, revelation) and the final image references the landscape from above. However, its physical properties (obsidian surface, beneath dunes) do not constrain Elara's actions or charge the closure; it functions as atmospheric backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary drives the plot: Elara touches it, enters the vision, deciphers it via beach-debris cipher, and the decrypted text becomes her mission. It shapes three beats (discovery, vision quest, resolution). Its unlock mechanism, however, feels automatic—Elara completes the cipher and "the diary's pages began to glow"—rather than requiring a costly choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Being "retrocognitively trapped" is mentioned twice but never constrains a choice. Elara experiences the vision passively; she cannot leave until the cipher is complete, but this creates no visible cost or tactical dilemma. The trap releases her automatically. The attribute is functional but replaceable with any vision-triggering mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The parley with the woman occurs in one beat where Elara asks why the truth was hidden and receives explanation. It does not create a turn or alter options; the woman provides exposition and gestures to the cipher. The conversation could be replaced by a note or inscription without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Arranging beach debris as cipher-keys appears in two beats: Elara gathers and arranges objects, and later continues arranging to complete the cipher. The method is signaled and its mechanics matter to the plot. However, the specific properties of driftwood, shells, and sea glass are not used; generic objects would serve equally well. The method feels like a puzzle mechanic rather than a transformation of material properties.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The floating zeppelin library is mentioned in the opening and closing but does not constrain choices or supply resources. Elara's work occurs in the vision, not aboard the zeppelin. The hum provides ambient backdrop, but the zeppelin's floating nature, collection, or spatial layout do not affect tactics. It is setting-as-label.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the letters are found" anchors the story's start, and the vision unfolds in a continuous sequence. However, no deadline or clock tightens decisions; Elara completes the cipher at her own pace, the vision dissolves when finished, and her post-vision reflections are untimed. Time is present but does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's desire to uncover the "full story, not the sanitized version" is stated and her final resolve to "let the truth speak" frames the arc. The motivation shapes two beats (her declaration in the parley, her resolution to publish). Friction between ideals and cost is mentioned ("controversy it might cause") but not dramatized as an on-page choice with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Searing reverie" is named three times and the prose attempts elevated diction ("resonance of long-held secrets," "weight of history"). The tone is solemn and reflective but remains static; it does not modulate with pressure or deepen at the closure. The final paragraphs summarize rather than crystallize, flattening the intended reverie into explanation.</comment>
