<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (preserving navigation methods) is stated but never tested against a competing desire or meaningful friction. Her internal state is described in broad emotional labels—"whirlpool of doubt," "agonized"—without embodied sensation or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The piece summarizes her "rationally rebellious" stance and her arguments but does not dramatize a micro-choice under pressure where cost is visible. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she ends as she began, scraping sediment with the same resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece anchors who and where by line 2, satisfying the orientation test. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page; Elara's final action (uncovering a brass plate) is another beat in an ongoing task without visible cost or altered options. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural (layered archaeological work, recurring cog imagery), but the ending does not reweight prior material or deliver felt pressure—it simply restates her resolve. The closure unit is missing; the story loops rather than closes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sunken sewer system and sedimentary layers are vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (damp stone, grime, faint glow from a crack). The chronometer cog is handled twice (in her pocket, held up to light) and the brass plate discovery provides a concrete final image. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or meaningfully alter tactics; it serves as backdrop rather than crucible. The body and tools (trowel, scraps of metal) appear but do not shape the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving ancient navigation methods—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. No on-page reversal, meaningful choice, or visible cost occurs; Elara continues her work methodically without opposition or internal friction that narrows options. The "competing narratives" appear only as reported memory, not as live pressure that forces a trade-off. Agency is absent at closure; she simply uncovers another artifact and reaffirms her prior stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme (preservation vs. forgetting, reason vs. superstition) is explicitly stated rather than emergent: "Her rational rebellion was not born of anger but of a deep-seated need to anchor the future in proven, empirical truths." The chronometer cog recurs but does not shift meaning; it remains a static symbol. The ending does not offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question—it restates the premise without complication or cost. Subtext is minimal; the piece tells its themes directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, and the perceptual filter is consistent (archaeological focus, rationalist framing). However, diction is uniform and elevated throughout, lacking modulation under pressure or a character-specific rhythmic signature. Key phrases—"whirlpool of doubt," "abrasive calm," "grinding pressure"—feel like external description rather than lived interior texture. No dialogue appears. The voice is competent but generic, lacking the specificity that would distinguish Elara's thought-patterns from a standard narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the piece. Lines 4, 13, 20, and 26 all restate Elara's agonizing without adding pressure. Repetitive sentence stems dominate: "She agonized…," "The cog…," "Her rational rebellion…," "Competing narratives…" appear multiple times with minimal variation. Stock metaphors ("whirlpool of doubt," "anchor the future") dull the prose. The loops and scaffold obscure momentum and flatten the closure beat (lines 26–27 repeat the setup from line 18 without advancement). Apply cumulative artifact penalty: −1.7 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The premise—philosopher in post-plague sewers preserving lost knowledge—is derivative of familiar post-apocalyptic templates without fresh inflection. The chronometer cog, sedimentary layers, and competing narratives are present but do not synthesize into a non-obvious whole; they read as assembled rather than inevitable. Emotional specificity is absent; Elara's struggle is told in generic terms ("agonized," "whirlpool") that could apply to any preservationist. The ending reaffirms the opening without transformation. Apply derivative premise adjustment: −0.8 in Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout and her occupation (self-styled philosopher) frames the voice, but she makes no decision that alters tactics or options. Her choices—descending deeper, scraping sediment, holding the cog—are repetitive actions without cost or consequence. The "wannabe philosopher" label is mentioned once (line 1) but does not constrain behavior or generate friction. Present and functional but replaceable with "archivist" or "scholar" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chronometer cog is signaled early (line 5), handled in her pocket (line 11), and held up to light (line 17). It recurs with thematic weight ("geometric perfection," "key," "humanity's ability to measure") but does not enable or constrain a choice. Its meaning remains static across beats; no reweighting occurs at closure. Two-beat involvement with thematic charge earns mid-band, but lack of causal pressure or closure linkage prevents higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Competing narratives (divine punishment vs. natural cycle) are introduced (line 7) and revisited (line 16), shaping Elara's intellectual stance. However, they remain abstract background rather than live pressure that alters her tactics or forces a trade-off on the page. She dismantles one claim in reported memory, not in dramatized conflict. Present across beats but does not change options; swappable with "rival ideologies" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Rationally rebellious" is labeled (line 6) and restated (lines 12, 22) but never dramatized through a choice with visible cost. Elara's "cold logic" and "abrasive calm" are described attributes, not constraints that force a trade-off. The trait could be removed and her actions (scraping sediment, voicing critiques) would remain unchanged. Present but ornamental; no on-page demonstration of the trait enabling or foreclosing an option.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Agonize" appears five times (lines 4, 13, 20, 26) but functions as emotional summary rather than a shaping action. No major turn traces to her agonizing; it is a repeated state without causal consequence. The word choice itself could be swapped for "worry" or "fret" with minimal edits. Functional label but replaceable; does not drive escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Through sedimentary layers" is signaled early (line 9), mechanics described (scraping with trowel, line 10), and the method shapes her attempts across multiple beats (lines 10, 15, 19, 25). The final discovery (brass plate with tidal equations, line 25) arises directly from this method. However, the method does not constrain or complicate her work—it proceeds mechanically without friction. Present across setup, development, and payoff with causal involvement, earning solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The sunken city ruins frame the story (lines 1, 23) and the sewer system provides concrete spatial anchors (damp stone, sedimentary walls, crack overhead). The setting supplies resources (nautical charts, brass plate) but does not pressure Elara's choices or alter her tactics. Spatial choreography is clear and the environment is vividly rendered, but it remains backdrop rather than crucible. Present across beats with one causal contribution (finding artifacts) but no constraint or complication.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"After the plague ends" anchors the premise (line 1, restated line 27) but imposes no time pressure or urgency. The plague is past; no ticking clock constrains Elara's work. The timeframe could be "during the plague" or "ten years after" with no change to her actions or stakes. Present as background context but does not tighten decisions or tactics. Missing closure participation; introduced late (line 27 callback) without functional weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve ancient methods is stated (line 3), drives her daily work (lines 4, 18), and anchors the final resolve (line 27). However, it is never dramatized through a choice where competing desires create friction or cost. Elara's want (preserve) and fear (loss) align without contradiction; no micro-choice tests her commitment. Present across setup and development with thematic charge but lacks the conflict that would elevate it into high bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Abrasive calm" is labeled (lines 8, 14, 25) and the prose maintains steady, declarative tone throughout. However, tone does not modulate with pressure—Elara's voice remains uniform whether reflecting on narratives or uncovering artifacts. The final image (line 26: "quieting the agony for a moment") slightly shifts register but does not charge the closure or reconfigure prior material. Present and coherent but static; lacks the tonal escalation or repricing that would reach higher bands.</comment>
