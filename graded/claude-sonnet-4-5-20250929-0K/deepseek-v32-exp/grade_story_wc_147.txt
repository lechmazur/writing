<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to capture the gathered hush is declared but never tested by a competing want or fear; he executes a linear plan under time pressure without internal contradiction. The "override instinct" moment ("His every instinct screamed at him to rush...But he knew success depended on his ability to override instinct") is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses acting simultaneously. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("touching something eternal," "lonesome splendor etched into his soul") rather than character-particular perception. The final self-rescue metaphor arrives as summary wisdom rather than earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure (ticking clock). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first lines; no Orientation Test penalty. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (captured hush + self-rescue realization) present on the page, but cost is conceptual and soft—surfacing with the vial feels like mission success rather than a path foreclosed. The because/therefore chain is clean (dwindling oxygen → careful mechanism work → door opens → hush captured → escape), yet the final paragraph's reflective summary ("he had become his own rescue") tells the reweighting rather than letting the image land it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The underwater temple's "grand architecture," "soft phosphorescence," and vaulted ceiling are vivid and consistent. The locking mechanism (levers, crystalline rods) directly constrains Kaelen's choice to slow down despite oxygen alarm, meeting the Q3 9+ gate test for constraint. However, spatial choreography remains vague—distances, room transitions, and the path back are sketched rather than tracked, and the "dome where the gathered hush coalesced" materializes without prior setup. Sensory detail is weighted heavily visual; no taste of salt water, tactile cold through the glove, or pressure gradient as he swims back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture the hush before air runs out) is clear and coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kaelen must override panic to unsnarl the mechanism, and the oxygen alarm's final chirp narrows the escape window. However, the turn is tactical (slow down, succeed, leave) rather than a trade-off that forecloses another live option; coincidence does not resolve, but agency also does not visibly sacrifice an alternative path. Cost is stated ("his oxygen alarm chirped its final warning") but not felt as a near-miss or injury that alters his surfacing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of solitude, ephemeral beauty, and self-reliance emerges through image (temple as "monument to lonesome splendor") and the distress-signal-as-foil motif. The final line "he had become his own rescue" and the recurring vial offer non-literal resonance. Yet the closing paragraphs ("In the years to come...") shift into summary moralizing that names the theme rather than letting the uncorked vial's whisper embody it. The "gathered hush" functions more as a McGuffin than a thematic question with contradictory pulls.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a heightened, lyric register ("crushing silence," "fractured beams," "ephemeral hush"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Kaelen notices architectural grandeur and memory echoes—but does not degrade under peak stress; diction remains elevated even during the oxygen alarm crisis. No dialogue to test voice distinction. The vial's "memory-touching property" mechanism (phantom priests) reads as convenient exposition rather than dramatized perception. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "lonesome splendor" appears four times, "gathered hush" five times, "distress signal" four times, often in adjacent or near-adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the middle third ("He had to...His every instinct...But he knew...The mechanism was..."). Stock metaphors cluster: "river of quiet," "cold blanket," "whisper of that silence." Register is uniform and elevated, with no sentence-level propulsion variation during the escape. The final seven paragraphs summarize future years rather than closing on image, diluting closure momentum. Apply cumulative artifact penalty (−1.2) and disallow 9+ per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The underwater-temple-treasure-quest frame and ticking-air-supply premise are familiar; transformation through specific detail is limited. The "gathered hush" as capturable silence and the memory-touching vial are fresh inflections, but they do not interact causally—Kaelen uses the vial's memory echo to guide his hands once, then it becomes a passive container. The self-rescue metaphor in the final lines is stated rather than earned through a non-obvious synthesis. Emotional specificity (solitude, beauty, triumph) is present but abstractly named rather than rooted in micro-particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kaelen is present throughout and his choices (slow down, unsnarl, capture, surface) drive all beats. However, "sender of a distress signal" is a backstory label mentioned four times but never integrated into a present choice or cost—no moment where he decides to abandon hope of rescue or where the signal's failure alters his tactics. The attribute is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears in setup (clutched), development (guides hands via memory echo, beat 1; uncorked to capture hush, beat 2), and closure (secure in pocket, uncorked in future). It constrains the capture method (only tool that can contain the hush) and charges the ending image. Cost is soft—no risk of breaking it or trade-off to use it. The vial's dual function (memory-toucher and container) feels additive rather than causally necessary for the unsnarl step.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" is the dominant stake and shapes all tactics: Kaelen must reach it, must slow down to access it, must capture it before air runs out. It appears in setup, middle (deepening quiet as he works), and closure (captured, later uncorked). However, it remains abstractly described ("palpable quiet," "shimmering stillness") without concrete properties that constrain how he interacts with it—no resistance, no risk of dispersal if he moves too fast. The concept is central but not irreplaceable; "rare silence" or "temple's breath" would function identically.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The vial "touched memories, making them vivid and tangible" enables one on-page action: Kaelen sees phantom priests and their movements guide his hands through the mechanism. This is functional but brief and non-costly—no price for invoking the memory, no risk of being lost in it. The attribute does not recur or shape the capture beat (the hush flows into the vial passively). Setup and development present; closure absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" appears twice and defines the central turn: Kaelen must untangle the frozen mechanism to open the sanctum. The action is specific, occupies two beats (focus/twist, gear shift/door open), and is causally necessary—without it, no hush access. However, the unsnarl itself is summarized in two lines ("With a gentle twist, he began to unsnarl the blockage, feeling the gears grate and then shift") without granular resistance or a false move that costs time. Swapping "unsnarl" for "unlock" or "free" would require only minor edits; the verb's specificity is modest.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Override instinct" is signaled early ("His every instinct screamed at him to rush...But he knew success depended on his ability to override instinct") and revisited at the hush capture ("He overrode the instinct to flee"). It shapes one key choice (slow down vs. panic) and the ending nod ("overridden instinct to unsnarl the impossible"). However, the method is asserted in narrator summary rather than dramatized through a micro-choice sequence where impulse and control war on the page. Cost is implicit (used air) but not felt as a near-failure or physiological toll.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater temple is present throughout, supplies the locking mechanism (constrains the unsnarl beat), provides the "dome where the gathered hush coalesced" (enables capture), and anchors tone. It appears in setup, development (mechanism, phosphorescence), and closure (swims back through halls, memory of temple stays with him). However, the temple's layout and specific features (vaulted ceiling, grand halls, inner sanctum, dome) are named but not causally distinct—distances, door positions, and return path are vague. The setting is atmospheric but partly interchangeable with any ancient ruin.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"As time runs short" is the ticking-clock frame: dwindling oxygen is mentioned in setup, the tank's warning light blinks crimson during the unsnarl, and the final alarm chirps at capture. Time pressure tightens the unsnarl choice (slow vs. rush) and forces immediate departure. The clock is live and tracked across three beats. However, elapsed time is unspecified—no sense of how many minutes remain or how long each step takes—so urgency is declared more than felt as a countdown.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" (capture the gathered hush) is Kaelen's stated motivation, present in setup, drives all middle beats (reach sanctum, capture hush), and is fulfilled at closure. The desire is singular and consistent. However, it is never tested by a competing want (survival vs. mission) or internal doubt; Kaelen executes the plan without friction between ephemeral beauty and mortal cost. The motivation is functional and central but not dramatized as a conflicted choice with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is named four times and threaded through description (fractured light, decaying majesty, monument to solitude). Tone is consistent and modulates slightly—grand and melancholy in setup, pressured and focused during the mechanism beat, reflective and triumphant at closure. However, the phrase itself is repeated near-identically without evolving meaning, and the final paragraphs shift into summary that tells the tone ("lonesome splendor...would stay with him") rather than charging the image. The tone is coherent but static, not reweighted by the ending.</comment>
