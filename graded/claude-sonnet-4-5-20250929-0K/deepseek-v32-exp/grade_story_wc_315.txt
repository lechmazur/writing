<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's solitary vigilance is established early, but her "attentively inventive" trait functions mostly as label rather than embodied contradiction. The muscle-memory action sequences tell rather than show internal conflict; we're assured she's anxious but her fingers move with "confidence her mind struggled to feel"—a neat summary that flattens the contradiction instead of letting competing impulses collide in real time. The parachute buckle receives symbolic weight ("a testament to resourcefulness") but her choice to tighten it carries no visible cost or foreclosed alternative. The final discovery validates her but doesn't dramatize a meaningful change or renunciation with on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (isolated post, nocturnal arbor above clouds, post-static moment) arrive early enough. The inferred lens is Causal: incoming anomalous data → protocol revision → hybrid analysis → celestial-event discovery. However, the stakes remain abstract—"preserve trust" is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma where trust could actually be lost. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (chaos to coherent pattern, terror to hope), but the cost is conceptual only ("the burden now a mantle she wore with pride") without a visible forfeiture or tactical trade-off that narrows her future options. One tightening occurs (frayed cables, incoming anomalies force protocol overhaul), meeting the 600–800 word sufficiency bar, but the ending reweights her emotional stance more than her material situation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor is vividly sketched (woven metal, living vines, bioluminescent plants, star-dusted canopy) and the parachute buckle is handled twice (securing cables, glinting in starlight). However, the arbor functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; it doesn't constrain her choices—she could perform the same analysis anywhere with a console. The buckle's cold metal touch and the buffeting winds gesture toward environmental pressure, but the winds don't force a tactical adaptation and the arbor's verticality or isolation never limit her options. The setting charges the final image ("watchtower of hope") conceptually but doesn't shape the middle decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve trust by correctly interpreting anomalous data—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs: frayed cables + incoming anomalies force her to "revise her entire analysis protocol" and create a "hybrid analysis, something never tried before." That move is protagonist-driven and narrows her options (desperation and ingenuity under immense pressure). However, the escalation is largely cognitive and recounted; we don't witness a failed first attempt or a visible trade-off (e.g., sacrificing thoroughness for speed, risking a false alarm). The resolution (celestial event, not danger) lands, but the cost is emotional relief rather than a material price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The watcher's burden as theme is repeatedly named ("watcher's burden," "mantle she wore with pride") rather than emerging from concrete actions. The parachute buckle shifts from "fallibility" reminder to "strength in revision and recovery," but this repricing is asserted in the narration rather than demonstrated through a choice that tests the claim. The soundless echo recurs and the final image ("canvas for her resolve") gestures toward thematic resonance, but the piece leans on prompt-aligned labels ("attentively inventive," "preserve trust") and the ending articulates the theme ("validate her vigilance and maintain the trust") instead of letting the discovery reweight prior material without editorial gloss. No final image offers a non-literal answer; the closing lines explain the transformation directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with clean focalization through Elara's perceptual lens. Diction remains consistent (technical, solitary, purpose-driven) and psychic distance modulates appropriately. However, several beats lean on filter verbs and scaffold constructions: "she knew she had to," "her sole motivation was to," "felt heavier than ever," "threatened to cloud her judgment." The prose occasionally drifts into explanatory summary ("a way to access training and experience when anxiety threatened") that tells interiority rather than showing embodied thought. No dialogue is present; internal voice is clear but sometimes over-articulated for crisis conditions. Perceptual signature (bioluminescent plants, star-dusted canopy) is selective but doesn't degrade under peak stress as one might expect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple template-cadence runs and paraphrase loops: "The watcher's burden was not merely to see, but to comprehend…" echoes "The watcher's burden was no longer a void…"; "This was the moment after…" / "This discovery would…" / "This object was more than…" / "The parachute buckle, glinting…" / "Through muscle memory…" repeat near-identical stems across adjacent paragraphs. Filter-verb stacks ("she knew she had to," "knew she had," "felt heavier," "struggled to feel") cluster in high-pressure beats. Stock phrases recur: "her heart pounding," "muscle memory," "hands moving with confidence her mind struggled to feel." Several sentences restate: "remembering through muscle memory, her fingers danced" is functionally repeated two paragraphs later as "Remembering through muscle memory, she input the new parameters." Informational density is moderate; some beats compress action efficiently, but scaffold persists. Apply −1.0 for template cadence and loops, −0.4 for filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—lone analyst above the clouds interpreting celestial signals—draws from established SF watchkeeper templates without a transformative angle. The parachute buckle repurposing is a modest inventive detail, but the emotional arc (anxiety → validation → pride) follows a predictable trajectory. The "hybrid analysis, something never tried before" is asserted but not dramatized with specific on-page mechanics that would distinguish it. The nocturnal arbor's bioluminescent plants and the "soundless echo" metaphor add texture but don't reconfigure the familiar vigilance-and-discovery structure. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the closure rewards competence without complicating it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role is clearly established. She makes one key decision—to revise her analysis protocol and create a hybrid method—but that choice is recounted in summary rather than shown through a dramatized attempt with visible obstacles. Most of her activity is observation and internal reflection; the decision to tighten the parachute buckle is a steadying gesture, not a turn. The final transmission is a result of her work, but again summarized. Present in setup, involved in middle (protocol revision), and referenced at closure (transmits findings), she clears two gates but the middle beat lacks on-page causal pressure with felt cost. Apply late-middle signal (−0.3), summary-only use (−0.5), swappability (another analyst could perform the same steps, −0.4).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The parachute buckle appears early (first third: "critically secured by a robust parachute buckle"), is handled mid-story ("She tightened the parachute buckle, a small, physical action that steadied her nerves"), and returns at closure ("The parachute buckle, glinting in the starlight, was no longer a reminder of fallibility, but of the strength found in revision and recovery"). Three distinct beats, early signal, and a symbolic reprise that reweights meaning. However, the buckle's role is primarily emotional anchor; it secures cables but we never see a moment where loosening or losing it would alter her options. The "cold metal touch" and "held fast" gestures are descriptive; no visible trade-off or tactical constraint tied to this exact object. Apply early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (symbolic reprise) +1.0, but subtract swappability (another fastener could serve, −0.6) and ornamental closure use (glinting mention, −0.4).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The watcher's burden is named five times and frames her role: "imposed the watcher's burden, a solemn duty to observe, interpret, and protect," "the watcher's burden was not merely to see, but to comprehend," "the watcher's burden now a mantle she wore with pride." However, it functions as thematic label rather than a constraint that alters her tactics on the page. We're told she feels the burden "heavier than ever" but no on-page scene tests what she would sacrifice to uphold it (e.g., a choice between thoroughness and speed, or between reporting uncertainty vs. false confidence). Present in setup, invoked throughout, but does not shape a middle decision with visible cost. Apply early signal +0.4, but subtract label-only trait (−0.5), swappability (another analyst's duty would read the same, −0.5), and no middle-beat causal pressure (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Attentively inventive" is declared early ("She was attentively inventive, a necessity born from solitude and limited resources") and referenced at closure ("her attentively inventive efforts under duress"). The repurposed parachute buckle is cited as evidence of inventiveness, and the "hybrid analysis, something never tried before" is the on-page application. However, the trait is largely told; we don't see her improvise a solution step-by-step with visible trade-offs (e.g., sacrificing accuracy for speed, or combining incompatible methods with a known risk). Present in setup, invoked in middle, closure callback, clearing two gates. Apply early signal +0.4, one beat involvement (hybrid analysis) +0.4, closure mention +0.3, but subtract label-only (−0.5), summary-only use (−0.5), and swappability (another analyst's resourcefulness would suffice, −0.4).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Revise" appears explicitly three times and drives the central turn: "she knew she had to revise her entire analysis protocol," "she began to attentively revise the filtering algorithms," "She reviewed the revised data." The revised protocol leads directly to the discovery (celestial event, not danger). Early signal (first third pressure), middle beat (algorithm revision), closure linkage (revised findings transmitted). However, the revision is recounted in summary; we don't see the before/after contrast on the console or a failed first draft that forces the second attempt. Present across all three gates. Apply early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (revision → discovery) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, but subtract summary-only (−0.6) and swappability (another analyst could "revise" similarly, −0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Muscle memory is named twice: "Remembering through muscle memory, her fingers danced across the console, executing complex command sequences her conscious mind had long since delegated to instinct" and "Remembering through muscle memory, she input the new parameters, her hands moving with a confidence her mind struggled to feel." The method is present in the middle beat (executing commands, inputting parameters) and contributes to her ability to work under pressure. However, it's told rather than shown—we don't see a specific sequence where trained reflex overrides conscious doubt or where the method's limitation (e.g., outdated muscle memory for a novel task) creates friction. Present by midpoint, involved in one beat (or two repetitions of the same beat), mentioned but not dramatized. Apply one beat +0.4, but subtract late first appearance (second third, −0.3), label-only/summary (−0.5), and swappability (another analyst's training would function the same, −0.5).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor is described early ("delicate structure of woven metal and living vines perched eternally above the clouds") and receives rich atmospheric detail (bioluminescent plants, star-dusted canopy, buffeting winds). It frames the ending image ("felt less like a prison and more like a watchtower of hope"). However, the arbor's specific properties (verticality, isolation, vine construction) never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters her tactics. The buffeting winds are mentioned but don't force her to adapt; she could perform the same analysis in a ground-based lab. Present in setup, described throughout, closure callback (watchtower image). Apply early signal +0.5, closure linkage (symbolic reprise) +0.7, but subtract ornamental use (−0.8), swappability (another isolated station would serve, −0.6), and no middle-beat causal pressure (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the radio static cleared" is named in the opening ("The recent cacophony of radio static had just ceased") and twice more ("This was the moment after the static cleared," "After the radio static cleared, the clarity had been terrifying"). It establishes the immediate now and the shift from chaos to silence. The "incoming data streams showing anomalous patterns" implies urgency, but no on-page clock tightens her moves (e.g., a countdown to transmission window, degrading data, or physical exhaustion). The timeframe sets the emotional tone (post-crisis clarity) but doesn't constrain tactics or force a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Present in setup, invoked mid-story, closure callback. Apply early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.5, but subtract no middle tightening (−0.5), swappability (another post-event window would read the same, −0.5), and ornamental use (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To preserve trust under pressure" is stated early ("her sole motivation was to preserve the trust placed in her by a world unaware") and echoed at closure ("To preserve trust under pressure, she began to attentively revise… This discovery would validate her vigilance and maintain the trust"). The motivation drives her protocol revision and final transmission. However, trust is never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma—no moment where she must choose between honest uncertainty (risking trust) and premature conclusion (maintaining confidence). The motivation is declared and fulfilled but not dramatized with friction. Present in setup, middle (revision to preserve trust), closure (trust maintained). Apply early signal +0.5, causal pressure (revision motivated by trust) +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, but subtract told-only/no friction (−0.7) and swappability (another analyst's duty would serve, −0.5).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Soundless echo" appears four times: "a vacuum of silence that carried the tone of a soundless echo, a resonance felt rather than heard," "The soundless echo of the dead air seemed to amplify her solitude," "The soundless echo was no longer a void but a canvas for her resolve," and the closing beats reference the void and clarity. The phrase establishes tone (eerie, isolating silence) and modulates slightly (void → canvas). However, the tone remains largely static—melancholy vigilance throughout—and the final shift (terror → hope) is asserted rather than charged through image or rhythm. The phrase is more motif than tonal controller; it recurs but doesn't drive a tonal escalation that heightens pressure. Present in setup, invoked mid-story, closure reprise. Apply early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, but subtract static mood (−0.5), label-only/ornamental (−0.5), and swappability (another post-static silence phrase would serve, −0.4).</comment>
