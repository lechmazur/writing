<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared (promise to mentor, desire to help others) but never tested by contradictory impulses in scene. The interiority relies heavily on abstract labels—"shared burdens," "midnight solace," "healing with words"—rather than embodied, character-particular perception. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost; the "understanding dawned" moment arrives without dramatic struggle or trade-off. Emotional progression is smooth and therapeutic rather than contradictory or irrational under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who and where are anchored early; when remains vague (multiple nights collapse into "tonight" and "that night" without clear progression). The piece presents as accumulative/textural but lacks a meaningful tightening or cadence shift—beats loop through similar discovery-and-transcription moves without narrowing options. The closure unit ("dawn of this new understanding") asserts resonance but offers no visible, felt, or conceptual cost on the page; the Cost Proof Test fails because no sentence shows what Elara forfeits or forecloses. Orientation penalty (−0.4) and cost-legibility failure combine to prevent mid-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observatory and variable stars are named and visualized, but spatial choreography remains generic—telescope, desk, parchment appear without constraining choice or altering tactics. Mira in Cetus is specific, yet the mechanics of observation never pressure a decision. The daylily-pressed telegram is a recurring image but does not constrain action or charge the final moment beyond symbolic mention. Sensory detail is limited to visual assertion; no smell, temperature, or tactile texture grounds the setting under urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early (decode inscriptions to help others), but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options. The variable-star method is described, not tested against failure or cost. "When understanding dawned" is asserted twice without dramatizing what Elara risked or lost to achieve it. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency; the discoveries arrive through passive witness and summary transcription. No visible price paid after any turn alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("shared burdens," "healing with words," empathy encoded in stars) is stated repeatedly rather than emergent from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "we are all bound by the stars and by our care for one another" and "no burden is truly borne alone." The daylily telegram recurs but only as symbolic reminder, not as a constraint or reweighted image. Thematic echo in the ending (−0.6) and summary-thesis phrasing prevent earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak—Elara's noticing reads generic ("warmth spread through her," "fatigue and doubt") rather than character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cadence of chants," "barometers for ancient healers") that sits above immediate scene pressure. No dialogue appears. Prose rhythm is uniform; syntactic variety is limited, with many sentences opening "She [verb]" or "The [noun]." Filter verbs cluster without voice motivation ("she felt," "she saw," "she realized").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "shared burdens" appears seven times, "healing with words" / "healed with words" five times, "variable stars" eight times, often in adjacent lines without added pressure or detail. Template cadence runs through the piece ("She felt," "She realized," "She witnessed," "She knew") across dozens of sentences. Stock metaphors ("warmth spread," "words flowing like a balm") and therapy-speak ("mending her insecurities," "ease the suffering") cluster in peak beats. Combined artifact penalty (−1.7) and disallowance of 9+ globally per the artifact cap rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (ancient star-mapping for emotional healing) is conceptually interesting but executed through summary rather than specific discovery under pressure. The lucid-dream mechanism and variable-star decoding are asserted, not dramatized with unique procedural or sensory detail. Emotional beats follow template arc (promise → quest → understanding → sharing wisdom) without transformation. The piece could be rewritten with different proper nouns (different stars, different inscriptions) and the emotional logic would remain unchanged. No bold structural or perspectival risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Present throughout but Elara observes and transcribes rather than making choices that alter tactics or stakes. The chronicler role is label-only; no decision creates a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Daylily-pressed telegram appears in three beats (desk, pulse with memory, final hand-hold) but remains static symbol. Its "final message" is quoted once and never reweighted or used to constrain choice. Lyric reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"Shared burdens" is named seven times as theme but does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics. It echoes as abstraction rather than driving a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Heals with words" describes the mentor and the protagonist's final sharing but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Label-only trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Witness" recurs in lucid dreams and the final line, shaping two beats. Could be replaced with "observe" or "experience" without structural loss. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Variable stars are introduced early, mentioned across multiple beats (Mira observation, rhythm matching, final confirmation), and shape the decoding method. However, the mechanics are summarized rather than tested; removing "variable" and substituting another celestial pattern would require only minor edits. One key turn (understanding linkage) but swappability limits higher score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Celestial mapping observatory is named and anchors location but does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The telescope is adjusted once without consequence. Postcard presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"When understanding dawns" appears twice and the final scene is at dawn, but time does not tighten decisions or tactics. No live clock; the timeframe is metaphorical marker rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Motivation to decode inscriptions is stated early and recurs, shaping the quest. However, it is told ("her motivation was rooted") rather than dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between want and cost. One structural role without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" is named three times and the piece maintains a reflective, quiet register. Tone is stable but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image beyond static mood label.</comment>
