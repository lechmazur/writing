<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's wistfully pragmatic nature is presented but not contradictory in scene; her interior states lean toward label-driven reflection ("protected vulnerability," "instilling light") rather than embodied tension. The micro-choices—untying the boat, angling the mirror—lack visible cost or meaningful foreclosure. The rosebud discovery at the end offers symbolic renewal but feels externally bestowed rather than earned through conflicted agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: nightly ritual performed, bud discovered. Orientation anchors by ~120 words. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the bud's promise, but no felt cost or option-foreclosure lands on the page—the cycle simply continues as stated. The "invitation to begin again" is asserted rather than dramatized with pressure, and the final image recycles the mirror motif without reweighting prior stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Harbor setting is evocatively rendered with selective sensory detail (sea damp, moss, silver surface). The mirror and boat constrain Elara's nightly method, and the cliffs supply the target for her ritual. However, the environment does not alter her tactics or charge the closure beyond atmospheric backdrop; the bud's appearance is independent of spatial pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sustaining hope through reflection ritual—is signaled early but remains static. No on-page tightening or reversal occurs; Elara rows out, performs the mirror act, rows back, finds the bud. The discovery of the bud is coincidental rather than earned by protagonist choice, and no visible price or trade-off narrows her options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of light in darkness emerges through consistent imagery (mirror, moonlight, hidden corners) and the lockmaster's gauge as a metaphor for unlocking potential. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly ("light could always be found and reflected"), and the rosebud functions as symbolic convenience rather than a non-literal answer grown from prior particulars. The wistfully pragmatic trait is told more than shown in choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the voice carries a lyric, meditative texture consistent with Elara's reflective stance. Perceptual signature leans toward poetic generality ("quivering hush," "luminous peace") rather than character-particular noticing. No dialogue present. Psychic distance remains steady, and filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") are voice-motivated, though they slightly dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm and selective sensory detail. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("quivering hush" recurs without added pressure; "instill" is repeated across beats without evolving meaning). Stock metaphors ("fragile cloak," "canvas for her quiet efforts") and elevated diction ("enduring purpose") drift from the POV's grounded ritual. Template cadence in expository interiority ("She was wistfully pragmatic... Her motivation... Tonight, she would...") slightly flattens momentum. Artifacts stay minor and do not obscure closure, but density could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The fire-escape gardener and moonlit mirror ritual offer specific, grounded detail. However, the premise—solitary character performs symbolic nightly ritual and finds renewal—follows a familiar arc without transformation. The lockmaster's gauge is introduced as metaphor but not integrated into a choice that reweights the ritual. Emotional specificity remains abstract ("protected vulnerability," "wistfully pragmatic") rather than earned through non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, but her choices (untie boat, row, angle mirror, climb back) do not create key turns or alter tactics. Observation and ritual performance dominate; no decision forecloses a path with cost. Setup and development present; closure participation is passive (bud appears independently).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The bitting gauge tooth appears in three beats (pocket retrieval, held in palm, placed on windowsill) but functions as static symbol and memory token. It does not constrain or enable a choice, and its presence in the final beat is ornamental rather than causally active or reweighted.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Quivering hush" appears four times as atmospheric descriptor. It does not shape stakes, narrow options, or change Elara's ritual. Present in setup and closure beats but only as mood label, not as concept that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is stated early and echoed twice ("her wistfully pragmatic nature acknowledging," "wistfully pragmatic spirit ready"). The trait is told rather than dramatized in a choice with visible cost. No on-page action tests the tension between wistful longing and pragmatic acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Instill" drives the ritual (instill purpose, instill order, instill hope, instill beauty) and frames Elara's motivation across beats. It shapes her repeated action but does not redefine options or force a trade-off. Present in setup, middle, and closure; functions as thematic verb but not as decisive turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rowing with oars appears in four beats (heard initially, then rowed twice, echoed in final thought). The rhythm grounds her meditation and physical grounding, supplying the method for her nightly ritual. It constrains the how of her reflection practice and charges the ending image, though it does not narrow options with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Harbor by moonlight is established early, used for the mirror ritual (cliffs, pools), and returns in the final line. It supplies the canvas for Elara's work but does not pressure her choices or alter tactics; she performs the same ritual each night. Postcard description slightly outweighs functional pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rosebush's final petal drop frames the opening and the bud's appearance closes the cycle. Timeframe establishes the ritual's occasion and symbolic arc (end → renewal). It does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock; Elara's actions unfold without urgency. Present in setup and closure with thematic reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Reflect light into dark corners" is stated as Elara's motivation and enacted literally via the mirror. It drives the ritual's purpose across beats but is not dramatized in conflict or choice with visible cost. Present in setup, middle, and closure; functions as thematic mission statement more than contested desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is named twice and modulates slightly (exposure to vastness yet safe in routine; seed protected by shell). Tone remains static and lyric throughout; no intensification under pressure. Present in setup and closure as mood claim, not as charged tonal shift that escalates stakes.</comment>
