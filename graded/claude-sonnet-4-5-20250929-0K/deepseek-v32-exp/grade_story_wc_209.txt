<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent, but her "quietly driven" attribute remains largely asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final understanding feels delivered rather than earned through on-page struggle; she observes patterns and connects dots without meaningful internal conflict or cost that forecloses other paths. Interiority leans toward summary ("She reckoned with the silence of her own heart") and therapeutic framing ("umbral tenderness") rather than embodied, character-particular thought. The children scene at the end offers no complication—they simply receive her wisdom without challenging her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates images (postcards, cathedral glass, night flowers) toward a thematic realization. Orientation anchors arrive early (Elara, pavilion, autumn). However, closure operates as conceptual repricing without felt cost—Elara simply "understood" and walks home with "heart light." The cathedral discovery (hidden glass reveals night flowers) functions as information delivery rather than a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. No visible price is paid; the "reckoning" remains abstract, and the final image ("her mural stood as testament") asserts meaning rather than charging prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The amber pavilion, cathedral, and garden are vividly rendered with sensory detail (frost, stained glass patterns, autumn leaves). Setting provides atmospheric specificity and the cathedral window's mechanics matter to the discovery. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics—she moves freely between locations, and no spatial or resource limitation complicates her quest. The pavilion functions as backdrop rather than crucible; the children wander in without spatial resistance, and the mural's creation encounters no material obstacle tied to the setting itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding nocturnal blooming) is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or cost. Elara's journey is one of accumulation—she collects clues (postcards, cathedral visit, grandmother's notes) without setbacks, failed attempts, or trade-offs. The cathedral revelation arrives as convenient confirmation rather than a turn that narrows options. No reversal or tightening occurs; each step simply adds to her understanding without risk or loss. The children's arrival at the end provides validation rather than complication, and Elara's "quiet completeness" lacks the felt price required for high-band entry under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (beauty unveiling in darkness, truth in layers) emerges organically from images and the grandmother's guidance. The night-blooming flowers and hidden glass work as concrete motifs that avoid overt moralizing through most of the piece. However, the final beats slip into direct thematic statement: "some truths only reveal themselves when we learn to see in the shadows" and "finding light in the unseen" verge on articulated thesis. The cathedral window's layered-truth metaphor is purposeful but borders on symbolic convenience—introduced late to harvest thematic points. The ending's "testament to beauty that thrives in silence and darkness" edges toward sermonizing rather than letting the image resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice maintains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and Elara's perceptual filter (artist's eye for color, light, layered imagery). Diction is controlled and lyrical, with purposeful compression in phrases like "dawning hush" and "umbral tenderness." However, some constructions drift toward elevated register that feels external to Elara's interior texture ("reckoned with the silence of her own heart," "profound umbral tenderness"). The children's dialogue is brief and functional. No head-hopping, and narrative stance remains coherent, but the prose occasionally prioritizes poetic effect over character-particular thought, especially in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but several text-pattern issues accumulate. Paraphrase loops appear: "reckoned with the silence" / "reckoning with light itself" / "Elara reckoned that her journey"; "dawning hush" appears three times with minimal reweighting. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens multiple consecutive sentences in several paragraphs. Stock metaphors cluster: "sharp as a blade," "heart light," "whispered secrets." Filter-verb stack in the cathedral scene ("began to see," "felt a surge," "noticed") dulls immediacy. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the closure image, reducing propulsion. Artifacts do not obscure causality but create cumulative drag (baseline −0.8 for loops/templates, −0.3 for stock phrases = −1.1 total).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—artist discovers ancestral secret about night-blooming flowers through cathedral glass—follows a familiar template: creative protagonist on aesthetic/spiritual quest inherits symbolic clues, visits sacred space, achieves epiphany, teaches wisdom to children. The grandmother-as-mentor-via-postcards and hidden-layers-of-glass motifs are well-worn. Elara's journey lacks friction or transformation that would distinguish it from dozens of similar "artist seeks beauty's hidden truth" narratives. The specificity of night flowers and etched glass provides texture but does not fundamentally transform the template. No bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus; the resolution is predictable and safely uplifting without edge or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her artist identity frames perception (color blending, mural work), but her choices are largely observational—she decides to visit the cathedral, sorts postcards, paints. These actions do not create reversals or alter stakes; they accumulate information. Her final "decision" to share with the children is reactive rather than transformative. The trait is consistent but does not drive on-page turns with cost. Functional but easily replaceable with another observer role. Cap 3.8 (swappable).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Postcards appear early (first third), return mid-story (sorting in pavilion), and are handled again late ("in her pocket," "spread on a wooden bench"). They carry grandmother's notes that guide Elara's quest and one postcard shows the cathedral itself, directly enabling the discovery. However, their meaning does not shift—they remain clues throughout. Two distinct beats (initial mention, pavilion sorting) plus closure linkage (she packs them feeling complete) meet the gate model. Causal work is present but incremental; the postcards enable rather than constrain. +0.9 (two beats) +0.5 (causal enable) +0.4 (setup) = ~5.8, rounded down to 5.6 for lack of reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" appears three times as atmospheric descriptor ("dawning hush fell," "dawning hush returned," "dawning hush enveloped") but does not shape tactics or alter options. It evokes mood—peaceful silence before revelation—yet remains ornamental. The concept does not constrain Elara's choices or create stakes; it is thematic echo only. Present but does not affect story logic. Ornamental mention −0.5 = 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is stated early ("quietly driven, her focus sharp") and mentioned again ("quiet drive fueling her onward," "quiet completeness"). The trait describes Elara's persistence but never constrains an action or forces a visible trade-off. She works steadily without internal conflict between drive and rest, caution, or other impulses. Label-only use without on-page cost. Cap 4.6 (missing middle development/cost), label-only −0.3 = 4.2 rounded down.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Reckoned" (or "reckoning") appears four times across the story: "reckoned with the silence," "decided to visit," "reckoning with light itself," "Elara reckoned that her journey." The action describes reflection/evaluation but does not create a major turn. Elara's choices (visiting the cathedral, painting the mural) flow from accumulation rather than from a decisive reckoning moment. The verb is present and consistent but easily swappable with "realized" or "understood." Functional, two beats, but mid-band at best for swappability. Cap 3.8 (swappable) lifted slightly by repetition across beats to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cathedral's "hidden layers of etched glass" is signaled mid-story (Elara decides to visit based on grandmother's postcard), its mechanics matter on the page (alignment with sun reveals night-flower images), and the discovery directly shapes her understanding and mural design. The method appears after the first third (late signal −0.3), but it drives the key revelation beat and is causally essential to closure. Setup ~40% mark, development (cathedral scene), payoff (mural incorporates the revealed images). +0.9 (two beats) +0.8 (causal pressure) +0.7 (closure link) −0.3 (late) = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The amber pavilion is introduced early, provides Elara's workspace across multiple beats (sorting postcards, painting mural, receiving children), and frames the opening and closing. It filters autumn light and hums "with approval," offering atmospheric continuity. However, it does not constrain choices—Elara moves freely to the cathedral and back without spatial friction, and the pavilion's properties (amber panels, forgotten garden) do not alter tactics or create obstacles. Present across beats but postcard-level description without pressure. +0.4 (setup) +0.9 (two beats) = ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across the melting of winter's last snow" is stated as the quest's origin and mentioned twice more ("last of winter's snow fully melted into spring," "melting of winter's last snow had given way to a spring"). The timeframe is poetic but vague—no live clock pressures Elara's decisions, and the seasonal transition does not tighten choices. Time passes without urgency or cost. Lyric reprise (early seed → final image) without middle development. Cap 4.6 (missing middle), lyric reprise allows ~5.5–6.3 but vague tracking lowers to 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation (understanding nocturnal blooming) is stated early, frames Elara's actions (visiting the cathedral, painting), and is resolved in the ending ("finally understood why flowers bloom at night"). The desire drives two major beats (cathedral discovery, mural completion) and connects to closure. However, it is told more than dramatized—Elara's quest faces no friction between this want and competing costs (time, resources, doubt). No internal conflict or trade-off tests the motivation. +0.4 (setup) +0.9 (two beats) +0.7 (closure) −0.4 (summary-only) = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" is named twice ("surge of umbral tenderness," "umbral tenderness now a part of her soul") and the tone—gentle darkness, warmth for hidden things—is sustained through dusk imagery, night flowers, and soft closure. Tone modulates slightly (sharper focus in the cathedral, softer in the ending) and charges the final image of Elara walking home under stars. However, the descriptor is somewhat static; emotional pressure does not significantly shift its texture. Lyric reprise with closure charge but limited modulation. +0.4 (setup) +0.7 (closure) = ~5.7.</comment>
