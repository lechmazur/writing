<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to negotiate with her ghost is declared but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The interiority relies on abstraction ("chronologically confused mind," "eroded ambitions") rather than embodied sensation or contradictory wants acting simultaneously. The final gesture—leaving the camera wheel—reads as symbolic closure without visible cost that forecloses a live option. Agency is present but the inner life remains labeled rather than enacted in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (scavenger at lagoon edge, post-carousel halt) arrive early. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: fragments of overheard stories build density until the ghost encounter triggers a shift in acceptance. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance replaces pursuit), but the cost—what Elara actually forfeits by leaving the wheel—remains conceptual and asserted ("ambitions transformed") rather than felt on the page. The "because/therefore" linkage from collected fragments to final peace is weak; the ghost grants resolution without prior dramatized resistance or trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon, cloud-ground texture, and disposable camera wheel supply vivid sensory anchors. The setting presses Elara's wading choice and the island destination, but spatial choreography (how far she wades, how the mist thickens, where the ghost stands) remains vague at key beats. The camera wheel's glow at closure charges the final image, narrowly meeting the 9+ gate test for object-as-setting, but the lagoon's "kinetic energy" is declared more than it constrains tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—making peace with her ghost—is signaled early, but pressure remains static rather than escalating. The ghost encounter unfolds without resistance, negotiation mechanics, or a moment where Elara's choice narrows live options. The disposable camera wheel's glow and the resulting image-tapestry feel granted rather than earned by protagonist agency. One meaningful tightening (wading to the island) occurs, but no visible price alters her later tactics or forecloses a path with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of acceptance versus regret emerges through the lagoon's fragments and the ghost mirror, avoiding overt thesis statements until the final lines ("no longer eroded, but transformed"). The camera wheel shifts from relic to offering, supplying one charged reprise. However, the closing moralizing—"time was not a line but a river," "fractured stillness...complete"—tips into label-speak that replaces scene pressure. The resonance is present but blunted by the explain-everything final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable, with Elara's perceptual signature (collecting fragments, regret-colored observations) consistent throughout. Diction modulates between concrete ("boots sinking," "water cool and thick") and abstract ("chronologically confused," "eroded ambitions"), creating mild register drift at pressure points. The whispered fragments ("He sought the center but found only circles") supply distinct textural beats. Psychic distance tightens during the ghost encounter, but the final summary paragraph ("she understood that time was not a line") shifts into distant narratorial explanation rather than staying in Elara's present perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Information density is high through the opening and middle beats, weaving lagoon imagery with Elara's interiority. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "Her ambitions...were now eroded" / "eroded ambitions she carried"; "fractured stillness" recurs four times without evolving meaning. The final paragraph stacks summary ("no longer just a scavenger," "no longer eroded, but transformed," "no longer fractured, but complete") in template cadence, triggering the −0.6 scaffold penalty. Figurative language (carousel, lagoon, ghost) is consistent but the closure beat is dulled by repetitive "no longer" constructions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon above clouds and the ghost-as-younger-self mirror offer fresh visual premises, but the emotional arc (pursuit → acceptance via symbolic object) follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail. The collected-fragments method is summarized rather than shown shaping tactics. The ending's "time is a river" insight and the glow-wheel resolution feel convenient rather than inevitable. Risk-taking in setting and imagery does not extend to character choice or moral calculus; the middle-ground safety of "acceptance heals regret" without visible trade-off lowers originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the choice to wade to the island and leave the camera wheel. However, these decisions do not create key turns; the ghost grants resolution passively. Observation and declared motivation dominate over on-page agency that alters tactics or narrows options. Setup and payoff gates are met, but middle development shows her collecting fragments in summary rather than dramatized choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The disposable camera wheel appears in Elara's hand early, is twisted mid-story (hearing a faint click), and returns at closure where it glows and projects images. Three beats with evolving function meet the repetition test. The glow mechanic arrives late without prior setup, reducing causal pressure, but the wheel's symbolic shift from "useless relic" to "final offering" charges the ending image. Swappability is moderate; another broken artifact could serve similar thematic work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Eroded ambitions frame Elara's interiority from the opening and recur in the ghost's mirrored state. The concept shapes her motivation (pursuit of lagoon secrets now reduced to seeking peace) and the final transformation ("no longer eroded, but transformed"). It does not constrain a specific on-page choice with visible cost; the shift from erosion to transformation is asserted rather than demonstrated through tactical trade-offs. Setup, development (her reflection on past ambition), and payoff (the final "transformed" claim) are all present, allowing mid-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Chronologically confused is declared early ("her chronologically confused mind") and revisited ("chronologically confusion lifted"). It does not enable or constrain a specific on-page action; Elara's choices proceed without visible friction from temporal disorientation. The trait remains label-only without demonstrating how it alters her perception, mistakes, or tactics. Setup and payoff gates are met via mentions, but middle development is absent, capping the score under the missing-development gate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Regret saturates Elara's interiority from the carousel decision through the ghost encounter and is named in the climax ("Regret melted into acceptance"). It drives her motivation to negotiate and frames the emotional arc. However, the major turn (acceptance) is granted by the ghost's presence and the camera wheel's glow rather than traced to a specific act of regret that narrows options. The concept is present across all three gates and shapes two beats (her reflection, the ghost meeting), justifying mid-6s, but swappability is moderate—"guilt" or "sorrow" could serve similar work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories is declared as Elara's method and illustrated with whispered phrases mid-story ("He sought the center..."). The method does not shape her approach to the ghost encounter or alter her tactics when it fails or succeeds. It appears in setup (declared) and development (examples given) but is absent from the closure beat, where the camera wheel and images replace the fragments. The mechanics matter thematically but not causally, and the element could be replaced with another form of memory-gathering.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is anchored early, supplies vivid sensory texture (churning water, cloud-ground, mist), and pressures Elara's wading choice. The lagoon's kinetic energy is declared but does not constrain tactics; she moves through it without visible cost or resource scarcity. The small island destination and the calming waters at closure provide spatial beats, meeting setup, development, and payoff gates. However, the setting could be replaced with another liminal/mystical space without breaking story logic, indicating moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>After the carousel halts frames the story's inciting past event and supplies the "endless pursuit" timeframe. The halted state does not tighten present decisions or create a clock; Elara's wading and ghost encounter proceed without temporal pressure. The carousel is mentioned again at closure ("would never spin again") but does not shape the ending's stakes. Setup gate is met, but development and payoff gates are missing, and the timeframe remains static background rather than a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>To negotiate with one's own ghost is declared early and drives Elara's approach to the island. The ghost encounter dramatizes the desire through her whispered opening ("I came to negotiate"), but the negotiation itself is elided—the ghost extends a hand, the wheel glows, acceptance follows. Friction between want and cost is asserted ("accepting fragments without order") rather than shown through competing impulses or a trade-off that forecloses a path. Setup, development (the approach), and payoff (the encounter) are present, but the motivation's mechanics remain vague, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Fractured stillness is named early ("fractured stillness, as if the world were holding its breath") and recurs at closure ("stillness was no longer fractured, but complete"). The tone modulates from the churning lagoon to the thickened mist to the calmed waters, coherently supporting the arc from fragmentation to wholeness. However, the tone remains largely static across beats—contemplative and elegiac throughout—without a sharp pressure shift at the climax. The final reprise reweights the opening claim but does so through direct statement rather than charged image, reducing its resonance.</comment>
