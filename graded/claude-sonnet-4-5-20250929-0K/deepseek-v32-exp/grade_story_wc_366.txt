<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's reticence is shown through concrete behavior ("more comfortable with the sea's whispers"), and his observant nature enables key choices. The motivation to "bottle the feeling of safety" remains somewhat abstract despite the final gesture of leaving a note. Interior work is strongest when he handles the sea glass and builds the cairn; the confrontation with the "haunting presence" feels told rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. Cora's presence enriches backstory but remains off-page, limiting relationship pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Elian, predawn fog, Claw Island lighthouse) arrive promptly. The closure—relighting the lamp and leaving a note—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the beam's defiant glow holds the haunting at bay with visible cost in his labor and confrontation). Causality is clean through the letter discovery, cairn building, and lamp relighting sequence. Cost is legible in the physical work and the "luminescent ache" that remains part of the light's beauty, though the haunting's retreat feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lantern room's "profound stillness" and "luminescent ache" create a charged micro-setting. The sea glass, spiral stairs, and Fresnel lens are vivid and purposeful. The cairn-building on the shore grounds the abstract "protect" imperative in tactile action. The "spectral cold" intensifying as he works below creates spatial pressure that links setting to conflict. Sensory hierarchy (cold, stillness, the lap of water) is POV-filtered and advances atmosphere without catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring the light to protect the channel—is signaled early and tightens through the cairn construction and lamp relighting. The haunting provides atmospheric resistance but lacks on-page agency; Elian's escalation is mostly internal and procedural (gathering stones, relighting the wick). One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the haunting is "a manifestation of old fears" and places the sea glass as "a small anchor for hope," but the final victory (the presence "calmed") arrives without a trade-off that forecloses another option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—vigilance, shared duty, light as bulwark against despair—emerges through the letter chain, cairn language, and the persistent glow. The sea glass as "tangible promise" and the letters as "chain not of fear, but of shared vigilance" avoid overt moralizing. The closing image (sea glass gleaming with internal light, beam sweeping the waves) reweights prior material without stating a thesis. The "luminescent ache" as both sorrow and beauty deepens resonance, though "bottled the feeling of safety...in the persistent, defiant glow" edges toward theme summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable and apt. Diction ("warmly observant," "luminescent ache," "spectral cold") is consistent and voice-specific, if occasionally elevated. Perceptual signature (noticing the sea glass, reading the letters, understanding cairn semiotics) reflects Elian's quiet expertise. No dialogue on the page. Filter verbs ("He noticed," "He understood," "He felt") appear frequently and dull immediacy at key moments. Psychic distance widens during explanation ("the haunting was a manifestation...") where embodied perception would sharpen pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Several lines do double duty (e.g., "The lantern room at the summit was said to be haunted, not by ghosts of men, but by the lingering echoes of drowned sailors' hopes" layers atmosphere and stakes). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; "luminescent ache" and "spectral cold" recur purposefully. Minor paraphrase loops: "climbed the spiral stairs" / "creaked open onto a profound stillness" repeats setup without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the final third ("He placed it...Then, he began...") and filter-verb stacks ("He noticed...He knew...He understood...He felt") reduce propulsion in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse-keeper premise is familiar, but the anonymous letter chain and cairn semiotics add specificity. The reticent supply skipper vs. the off-page former keeper (Cora) is a fresh angle, though Elian's solitary task limits friction. The haunting as "manifestation of old fears" drawn to the light's warmth is a purposeful inversion of typical ghost logic. Risk-taking is modest; the resolution (lamp relit, presence calmed) follows expected beats without a non-obvious turn. Emotional truth in the "persistent, defiant glow" anchors universals, but the synthesis feels competent rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elian (reticent supply skipper) is present throughout, climbs the tower, reads the letter, builds the cairn, and relights the lamp—all key turns trace to his choices. His reticence shapes his solitary problem-solving and silent addition to the letter chain. Setup early, development through cairn and lamp, payoff in the final note and standing watch. Causal pressure is clear, though his interior passivity (observing, understanding) in the haunting confrontation slightly reduces irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sea glass appears early ("small, smooth piece...blue hue soft and milky"), is picked up and felt warm ("holding the memory of sunlight"), placed at the lamp's base as "small anchor for hope," and catches the sun's ray in the final line ("gleaming with a soft, internal light"). Setup, development (physical handling with reweighted meaning), and payoff (closure image) are present. Causal role is modest—it symbolizes rather than constrains—but the reprise charges the ending. Swappability: another talisman could serve.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Anonymous letter chain is discovered early, provides Cora's backstory and the "protect" plea, and Elian adds his own note to the chain before leaving—directly shaping his motivation and final action. Setup, development (the plea drives his cairn and lamp work), and payoff (his addition closes the loop) are present. Specificity: the chain as "shared vigilance" is thematically and causally active. Irreplaceability is high; removing it would collapse his link to Cora and the continuity of duty.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is labeled early ("Elian was warmly observant, his quiet nature allowing him to perceive the subtle textures") and enables noticing the sea glass and interpreting the letters. It does not constrain a choice with visible cost—observation supports but does not force the cairn or lamp decisions. Development is present (perception guides action) but the trait remains descriptive rather than a source of friction or trade-off. Swappability: a similar perceptive trait would function equivalently.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Protect" appears in Cora's plea ("you must protect the channel"), drives the cairn construction (guidance for safe passage), and the lamp relighting (beam cutting through gloom to safeguard ships). Setup, development (cairn as protective message, lamp as protective light), and payoff (final beam sweep) are present. Major turns trace to this action; the cairn's shape and lamp's restoration are irreplaceable expressions of the protect imperative. Cost: physical labor and confrontation with the haunting are tied to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stone-stacking as semaphore is introduced early ("Cora's earlier letters had described a way of stacking stones as messages"), Elian builds a cairn "indicating a safe passage through the eastern shoals" in the middle, and the method reappears implicitly in the final vigilance theme. Setup and development are present; payoff is thematic rather than plot-decisive. Specificity: cairn language is unique, but the mechanics (shape, height) are summarized rather than dramatized. Swappability: another signal method would alter texture but not structure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Haunted lantern room is the story's spatial anchor: door creaks open, "profound stillness," "luminescent ache" in the air, "spectral cold" intensifies as Elian works below, and he returns to face the darkened lens. Setup, development (oppressive cold as resistance), and payoff (lamp blazes, haunting recedes) are present. The room pressures Elian's choices (re-lighting the lamp confronts the cold) and the Fresnel lens is integral. Irreplaceability: the haunted setting is the story's core constraint and stakes generator.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the lamp flickers out" is established early ("an hour ago") and the urgency is implicit. Elapsed time during cairn building and lamp relighting is untracked; the predawn fog and "coming dawn" frame the work but do not tighten decisions. Setup is present, development is atmospheric, payoff arrives with sunrise. The clock does not visibly narrow options—Elian works methodically without racing against imminent disaster. Functional but replaceable; a tighter time pressure would sharpen escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation "to bottle the feeling of safety that a steady beam provided" is stated early and drives the lamp relighting and note-leaving. It is dramatized through the cairn (guidance), the sea glass placement (anchor for hope), and the final beam (defiant glow). Setup, development, and payoff are present. Friction: the haunting resists, but Elian's desire is not visibly conflicted—he does not weigh the cost of confronting the cold against retreat. The phrase "bottled the feeling...in the persistent, defiant glow" summarizes rather than embodies the achievement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone "luminescent ache" is introduced early ("the air hummed with a luminescent ache"), recurs ("The luminescent ache remained"), and charges the final image ("gleaming with a soft, internal light"). Coherent through turns: sorrow for lost light, warmth of restored beam. Modulates with pressure (spectral cold vs. swelling glow). The phrase is specific and irreplaceable, shaping both atmosphere and theme. Payoff: the ache becomes "part of the light's beauty, a testament to what it held at bay." The tone's dual quality (ache and luminescence) is the story's emotional signature.</comment>
