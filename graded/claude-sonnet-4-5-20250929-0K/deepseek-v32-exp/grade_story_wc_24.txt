<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The shepherd's motivation to understand time's substance is stated but never tested against a conflicting want or cost. His "insight" that clocks measure resistance arrives as assertion in the final third without prior dramatized friction. Interior voice relies on therapy-speak abstractions ("sharp edges of doubt," "desire to carve permanence from flux") rather than embodied contradiction. The mantle clock key shifts from control tool to metaphor without an on-page micro-choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly, but no causal escalation occurs—the shepherd performs a ritual, counts, observes, then declares an epiphany. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing ("clocks measure the human desire to carve permanence from flux"), yet the conceptual cost remains abstract; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the before/after legible. The piece reads as accumulative/textural in method but never tightens or deepens pressure, violating its own lens at closure. Applying the Cost proof test: no sentence in the ending demonstrates a visible, felt, or social price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fjord, granite outcrop, and hydraulic clocks establish vivid sensory anchors filtered through the shepherd's professional attention. Water channels and gear teeth receive concrete detail that reflects his expertise. However, the horizon measurement station functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental feature narrows a choice or charges the final image. The mantle clock key is handled twice but does not alter tactics or close an option, keeping Q3 below the 7.0 gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's substance—is declared early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or competing pressure appears; the shepherd's counting ritual proceeds without obstacle or trade-off. The epiphany arrives as internal summary rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Coincidence does not resolve because there is no conflict to resolve; the piece offers philosophical musing without agency or cost, preventing entry to even mid-band pressure standards.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (the human impulse to measure and control time) emerges from the clocks and ritual rather than authorial intrusion. The final image offers a quiet answer to the shepherd's question. However, the ending paragraph moralizes directly ("clocks measure the human desire to carve permanence from flux," "some measurements are illusions, and truth lies in the quiet"), replacing scene pressure with thesis statement. The thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph triggers the stated −0.5 to −0.8 deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries elevated register ("eminently peculiar," "palpable presence," "resistance—the friction of existence against the infinite") that reads more authorial than shepherd-particular under peak attention. The perceptual signature—water, gears, light—is consistent but lacks idiosyncratic coloring that would distinguish this mind from any contemplative observer. Free indirect style is clean, and purposeful compression in the counting ritual is legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "after blowing the whistle" opens three paragraphs; "eminently peculiar" appears thrice in identical phrasing; "razor edges" and "counting backwards" recur as template stems without cumulative pressure. Figurative density in the final third ("razor edges of doubt," "friction of existence against the infinite," "fluid reality") stacks metaphors without coherent vehicle, triggering the overwriting and register-drift penalties. Information density is low—many lines restate the shepherd's quest rather than advancing it. The artifacts touch closure, applying the stated cap on high-band entries.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—a solitary figure contemplating time at a water-clock station—offers atmospheric potential but executes as a meditation without narrative surprise. The "insight" that clocks measure human resistance rather than time itself is a familiar philosophical pivot. Specific details (hydraulic clocks, fjord, mantle key) anchor the world, yet the arc could transplant to any contemplative occupation without structural change, failing the transformation test. No risk-taking heightens stakes; the piece retreats into abstraction rather than embodying its question through choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The shepherd performs the daily calibration ritual and observes his instruments, but no decision alters tactics or outcome. His "realization" is internal summary, not a choice that changes the situation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mantle clock key appears in three beats: fitting it into the primary regulator, feeling its weight as a symbol, and inserting it into an auxiliary device. It returns in the penultimate paragraph with reweighted meaning ("no longer a tool of control, but a key to a deeper reality"). Setup and closure participation are present; middle use adjusts flow but does not narrow options, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Razor edges" recurs across five paragraphs as metaphor and literal gear-tooth description. It anchors thematic texture (sharpness dividing existence, boundaries we draw) but never constrains an on-page action or alters a choice. The concept operates as theme claim rather than causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Eminently peculiar" appears three times as descriptor ("ritual that felt eminently peculiar," "It was eminently peculiar," "This insight was eminently peculiar") without enabling or constraining a single action. Label-only use with no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Squint" appears in four beats, each time as the shepherd narrows his eyes to observe light or gears. The action conveys attention but does not drive a turn; it could be replaced with "peer," "examine," or "focus" with minimal structural edits. Swappability and ornamental use keep it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Counting backwards" is signaled early ("method he employed was through counting backwards from one thousand"), appears in three beats as the shepherd syncs his rhythm with the machines, and recurs in the resolution ("He ceased counting backwards"). The mechanics matter (mental exercise to synch rhythm), and the cessation marks acceptance. Setup, development, and closure participation are present, but the method does not narrow options or create visible cost, landing in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The horizon measurement station is introduced early with concrete detail (granite outcrop, water-driven timepieces, sun-arc tracking instruments) and returns in the final paragraph. However, it functions as atmospheric container rather than tactical constraint—no feature of the station alters the shepherd's choices or shapes the ending beyond framing. Present across beats but replaceable with any contemplative outpost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After blowing the whistle" opens the story and recurs in three later paragraphs as a temporal anchor marking the end of a cycle. The timeframe frames the quest but does not tighten decisions—no live clock or deadline alters tactics. The phrase functions as thematic marker rather than pressure device, keeping it in the functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand what clocks really measure" is stated early, drives the shepherd's attention throughout, and finds resolution in the final realization. However, it is never dramatized against a conflicting want or cost; the quest proceeds without friction, and the "answer" arrives as internal summary rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Present across all three gates but lacks visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Fjord quiet" opens the piece and recurs in four beats ("deepening into a palpable presence," "whisper in the fjord quiet," "stood in the fjord quiet, at peace"), modulating from profound stillness to charged silence to resolution. The tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image, but the modulation is subtle rather than dramatic. Early signal, coherent pressure, and closure participation place it in the "shapes one key turn" band.</comment>
