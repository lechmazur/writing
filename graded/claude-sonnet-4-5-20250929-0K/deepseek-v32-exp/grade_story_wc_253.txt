<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's blank-faced compliance and secret carving of sorrow symbols establish moral ambiguity, but her interiority consists almost entirely of narrated performance rather than embodied contradiction. The reporting of neighbors is mentioned once without dramatized weight or visible cost in a choice moment. Emotional states are labeled ("emotional void," "dense grief") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The whittling and narration feel like static ritual rather than micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (farmhouse, turbines, Happiness Mandate) arrive early, but the piece offers no meaningful tightening or reversal—Elara begins whittling and narrating, continues whittling and narrating, and ends whittling and narrating with the bouquet still on the table. The turbines' shadows "swallowing the farmhouse" in the penultimate paragraph gestures toward Conceptual Repricing, but no on-page cost or decisive change is legible; the final lines reiterate the opening stasis without reweighting options or meaning. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or pattern break charges the closure image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The farmhouse, turbines, and dried bouquet are introduced early and recur with sensory specificity (whittling blade, brittle petals, turbine hum). The bouquet functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charged with memory, qualifying it as a constraining object. However, spatial choreography remains vague—Elara's position relative to table, turbines, and landscape is never clarified—and the "remade hush" operates more as thematic claim than tactile environmental pressure that alters a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivating lightness in grief—is signaled early, but no on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Elara's actions (whittling, narrating, holding the bouquet) loop without escalation or trade-off. The Happiness Mandate and risk of melancholy infractions are mentioned but never tested in scene. Reporting neighbors to protect herself is told in summary without a dramatized choice moment or visible cost that forecloses a path. The piece ends exactly where it began, with no narrowed options or felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars (turbine shadows as bars, dried flowers as "skeleton of color") and resists neat resolution, sustaining moral ambiguity without false balance. However, thematic statements are over-articulated throughout: "cultivating lightness felt like betrayal, a moral grayness," "morally ambiguous heart," "remade hush was everywhere" repeat the thesis rather than trusting image and action. The final paragraph explicitly restates the theme ("figure of moral ambiguity in a world that had outlawed sorrow") instead of letting the bouquet and turbines carry resonance non-literally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elara's dramatic narrations ("The blade kisses the grain") provide a distinct perceptual signature. However, the narrator's elevated diction in non-narrated passages ("perpetual, placid mask," "emotional void yawned wide") drifts into literary register that clashes with the character's blank affect and context. Sentence stems recur mechanically: "She [verb], her [noun]" and "The [noun] [verb]" appear in runs of three or more without rhythmic variation. Free indirect style blurs when narratorial commentary ("This was her method") intrudes without clear voice-motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "blank-faced performer" / "blank face" appears four times; "morally ambiguous" / "moral grayness" / "moral ambiguity" recurs five times; "remade hush" is stated three times identically. Adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "her expression a permanent, placid mask" followed two paragraphs later by "her blank face a shield" and later "Elara's blank face remained unchanged." Template cadence runs through the piece: "She [verb]. She [verb]. She [verb]." Figurative language in nearly every sentence ("skeleton of color," "map of loss," "chasm where grief had been remade") without pattern-teaching or payoff creates density without propulsion. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("figure of moral ambiguity"), triggering −1.7 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The combination of Happiness Mandate dystopia, blank-faced performer, and whittling as ritual offers a specific synthesis, and the dried bouquet as relic from a forbidden funeral adds texture. However, the core premise (mandatory happiness / secret grief) closely follows widely used dystopian templates without transformation through non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that makes the choice feel urgent. Elara's dramatic narrations are mentioned but never shown in a beat where their mechanics matter to a turn. The turbines function as atmospheric symbol rather than participatory world element.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her compliance/secret carving establishes the blank-faced performer trait, but no on-page choice creates a key turn. Setup ✓, Development (her whittling and narration continue without altering tactics) ✗, Payoff (she remains static in the final image) ✗. Two-gate presence caps at ~6.0; swappability (a "numb artisan" or "hollow actor" would function identically) and lack of causal pressure lower the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dried flower bouquet appears in four distinct beats: introduced on the table, picked up and narrated ("skeleton of color"), whispered to ("desiccated but still holding a form"), and held as anchor in the penultimate paragraph, then cited in the final paragraph as "silent co-performer." Setup ✓, Development (handled twice with sensory detail; its fragility contrasts with numb fingers) ✓, Payoff (referenced in closure image) ✓. All three gates met. Its role as memory anchor and its brittle state create specificity, but it does not narrow options or impose cost—Elara's actions remain unchanged whether she holds it or not. Strong lyric reprise with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "remade hush" is named three times identically and described as "not peaceful," "suppressed nature," and "silenced birds and stifled sobs." Setup ✓ (introduced early as premise), Development (mentioned again mid-story) ✗ (no on-page choice shaped by the hush), Payoff (final paragraph states "she simply existed in the remade hush") ✓. Two gates. The concept functions as thematic claim rather than a constraint or tactic-shaping rule; removing it would not break story logic. Late-appearing label (first explicit mention ~15% in) and ornamental use lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Moral ambiguity is labeled five times ("morally ambiguous," "moral grayness," "moral ambiguity") and exemplified by Elara's reporting neighbors, but that action is summarized in a single sentence without dramatized choice, visible cost, or tradeoff. Setup ✓ (compliance/secret carving establishes it early), Development (the neighbor-reporting mention) counts as one beat but is not enacted on the page, Payoff (final paragraph restates "figure of moral ambiguity") ✓. Two-to-three gates depending on whether summary counts. Label-only at key moments and lack of visible cost cap the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Whittling is introduced in the second sentence, recurs in four beats (morning ritual, "blade kisses the grain," "each curl of wood," "set down the whittling knife"), and is cited in the final paragraph ("one whittled shaving at a time"). Setup ✓, Development (two distinct narrated beats; the action embodies her method of "cultivating lightness") ✓, Payoff (closure image references whittled shavings as measure of her effort) ✓. All three gates. The action is specific and irreplaceable in its tactile ritual quality, but it does not create a reversal or narrow options—she could knit, carve, or polish stones with identical effect. Strong presence across beats with moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dramatic narration is introduced immediately ("she would whittle... her voice a flat monotone: 'The blade kisses the grain'") and demonstrated in three distinct beats with quoted speech ("Behold, the preserved beauty," "They are like me, desiccated," "Each curl of wood is a small release," "The bouquet is a map of loss"). Setup ✓, Development (the method is enacted on the page, shaping her means of imbuing significance) ✓, Payoff (final image calls the bouquet "silent co-performer in her endless, narrated play") ✓. All three gates. The method is specific, shown rather than told, and its mechanics (flat monotone, poetic diction) are consistent. It does not impose cost or narrow options, but it charges the closure image and is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The farmhouse and turbines are introduced in the opening sentence, turbine shadows recur in five beats ("rotating shadows," "sweeping shadows that fell across her like bars," "groaned outside," "shadows lengthened, swallowing the farmhouse"), and the setting anchors the final image. Setup ✓, Development (shadows as "bars" provide a visual constraint and the turbines' hum is a persistent sensory detail) ✓, Payoff (turbines "continue their turning, a perpetual motion that overshadowed every attempt at true feeling") ✓. All three gates. The turbines function as atmosphere and symbolic overshadowing but do not alter Elara's tactics or supply a resource that affects outcome. Moderate specificity and closure linkage without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The Happiness Mandate is introduced as backstory context ("after the Happiness Mandate," "required to demonstrate perpetual contentment") and mentioned twice more in summary. Setup ✓ (premise established early), Development (the mandate is named but does not shape a middle choice) ✗, Payoff (no reference in the ending) ✗. One gate. The timeframe is static rather than a tightening clock; no urgency or decision is altered by temporal pressure. Swappable with "after the regime" or "since the decree" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to cultivate lightness in the dense grief" is stated explicitly in the sixth sentence and recurs in narration ("hoped it might pare down the weight," "cultivating lightness not for herself," "Each curl of wood is a small release," "cultivating what little lightness she could"). Setup ✓, Development (her whittling and narration are framed as attempts to fulfill this desire) ✓, Payoff (final paragraph references "cultivating what little lightness she could, one whittled shaving at a time") ✓. All three gates. The desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicting choices with visible cost; her actions never face a tradeoff or test that would reveal friction between want and cost. Moderate presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emotional void is established early ("blank-faced," "permanent, placid mask," "numb fingers," "emotional void where sadness once flowed freely") and sustained through flat narration and absence of reactive emotion. Setup ✓, Development (tone remains consistent across beats; "emotional void yawned wide" recurs) ✓, Payoff (final lines state "She did not smile; she did not cry" and close with the void as enduring state) ✓. All three gates. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly (the dramatic narrations provide texture within the void), and it charges the final image by refusing resolution. Strong tonal control without dynamic shift under pressure keeps the score in mid-7s rather than higher.</comment>
