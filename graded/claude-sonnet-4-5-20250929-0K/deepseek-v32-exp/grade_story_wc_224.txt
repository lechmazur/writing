<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand "home" is present but remains abstract; her choices to use the feather and stone feel more inevitable than conflicted. Internal contradiction is thin—she moves from avoidance to acceptance without dramatized competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "painful remembering" is told rather than embodied through specific sensory breakdown or contradictory pulls during key beats. Emotional progression reads as a smooth upward arc rather than the messy, contradictory layering expected under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to acceptance), but the cost is asserted rather than felt—"painful remembering softened into acceptance" summarizes rather than dramatizes the forfeiture or trade-off. The nightly sessions accumulate density, but the final turn lacks a sharp image or action that makes the before/after legible with undeniable pressure. Causality within the accumulative frame holds, yet the ending drifts into thematic summary rather than landing a charged final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore and mercury-glass pools are vivid early, and the stone's obsidian texture is noted. However, setting details become ornamental in the second half—shelves "shifting" and "hidden thunder" operate as metaphor rather than spatial constraint. The feather's texture is mentioned but does not alter a tactic or complicate a choice on the page. Micro-setting (body, tool, object) is present but does not charge the final image in a way that would lift the score into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding home) is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone reveals "home was not a place, but a pattern of connections," but this realization is told rather than tested through a choice with visible cost. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase across "weeks of effort," yet no single on-page reversal or tightening forecloses a live option with felt price. Agency is present (using the feather, seeding visions), but the moves feel low-friction and the final acceptance arrives without dramatized renunciation or endurance that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (home as courage, connection, and inward journey) emerges from image and action rather than sermon, which is strong. The mercury-glass and stone function as recurring motifs that shift meaning by the end. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary: "Elara understood that home was wherever she chose to nurture connection" articulates the thesis rather than letting the image speak. The piece resists tidy morals until the last beats, where the resonance is partly replaced by explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is present (mercury-glass visions, texture focus) but not deeply idiosyncratic. Diction is controlled, though some lines ("home was shaped by courage, not just comfort") drift toward abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Voice is competent and clear, yet lacks the rhythmic or lexical distinctiveness that would elevate into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "substitutes reality" / "substituted realities," "buried talents" / "talents, once buried," "seeded" / "seed" / "seeding" across adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate the second half (e.g., "She [verb]… The [noun] [verb]… Her [noun] [verb]…"). Stock metaphors ("flowers in cracked stone," "threads in the larger tapestry") appear in high-pressure beats without fresh angle. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("essence of her visions," "map of recovery") that clashes with the tactile opening. Applying patterned-artifact pack: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.5, stock metaphor strings −0.4 = baseline −1.5 in Q7. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("shape of her truth"), adding −0.2 for a total of approximately −1.7, which disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Core premise (seer using lost language and feather to reclaim home) combines familiar elements (magical bookstore, ancient artifact, redemptive arc) without a fresh synthesis. The "mercury-glass seer" and "lost language stone" read as high-concept labels rather than lived-in specificity. Emotional arc (avoidance → acceptance) follows a predictable template. The feather and stone do not transform tropes through unique mechanics or non-obvious moral calculus; they function as conveniences that unlock insight without cost-driven friction. No bold structural or perspectival risk evident; the piece plays safely within genre expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara (mercury-glass seer) is present throughout and her choice to use the feather on the stone initiates the reveal. However, her occupation as "seer" is mentioned but not leveraged—scrying through mercury-glass is described as "too agonizing to wield," yet she uses it nightly without on-page cost or complication. The seer identity is ornamental; removing it and keeping "Elara, a woman who retreats into visions" would require only minor edits. She appears in the closure image but passively receives insight rather than making a decisive turn. Early signal +0.4, beat involvement (two: nightly sessions, stone interaction) +0.9, causal pressure (enables visions but does not narrow options) +0.3, closure linkage (present but observational) +0.4. Swappability −0.6, summary-only use of scrying talent −0.5. Base ~4.6, round down to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lost language stone appears early (setup), is used in the middle (she traces and presses the feather to it), and is present in the ending (final question, glyph rearrangement). It drives two beats: the initial glow/revelation and the final image. However, its mechanics are vague—glyphs "flow into her mind" without resistance or cost. The stone could be replaced with another magical artifact (mirror, book, pool) with minimal edits. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (two) +0.9, causal pressure (enables revelation but does not constrain) +0.4, closure linkage (shapes final image) +1.0. Swappability −0.5, cost connection weak −0.3. Base ~7.1, but summary-only mechanics and lack of unique properties lower to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Buried talents (scrying, using mercury-glass) are mentioned repeatedly and labeled as "agonizing to wield" and later "now tools, not burdens." The concept shapes the thematic arc but does not constrain on-page choices—Elara avoids her talents, then uses them, without visible trade-off or friction. The talents are described rather than dramatized in action that alters tactics. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (one: final acceptance) +0.4, causal pressure (weak; theme-only) +0.2, closure linkage (theme summary) +0.4. Label-only trait −0.4, summary-only use −0.5. Base ~5.6, label-artifacts lower to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Substitutes reality nightly" is described in the opening and recurs as "nightly substitution" and "substituted realities faded." The trait is told rather than shown—we do not witness a scene where Elara chooses to enter a vision instead of confronting a present dilemma, nor does the substitution impose a visible cost (exhaustion, disorientation, missed opportunity). It functions as backstory exposition. Early signal +0.4, beat involvement (one: summary) +0.4, causal pressure (none on-page) +0.0, closure linkage (mentioned as fading) +0.3. Summary-only −0.6, label-only −0.4. Base ~4.5, round to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Seed" appears throughout: she "seeded a new beginning," "seeded the essence of her visions," "planting seeds of understanding," "seeding the stone with a final question." The action is central to the plot and recurs across beats. However, the mechanics are vague—how does one "seed" a vision into obsidian?—and the action could be replaced with "channel," "inscribe," or "embed" with minimal loss. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three or more) +1.4, causal pressure (enables progression) +0.6, closure linkage (final question) +1.0. Swappability −0.6, summary-only execution −0.5. Base ~7.5, but vague mechanics and synonym interchangeability lower to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The feather from a "long-extinct bird" is introduced in the middle third, used to activate the stone, and carried in her palm at the end. It appears in three beats: tactile moment, stone activation, and final carry. The feather's "texture" is emphasized but does not constrain a choice or impose cost—it is a convenient tool rather than a limiting method. Introduced after the opening third −0.3, beat involvement (three) +1.4, causal pressure (enables but does not limit) +0.4, closure linkage (present in final image) +0.8, specificity (extinct bird, silk-like texture) +0.4. Swappability (a key, wand, or hand would work) −0.6. Base ~6.4, late intro and ornamental closure use lower to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying a mountain is vividly established in the opening and recurs as metaphor ("endless corridors became a metaphor for her journey inward"). Shelves "shifting" and the mountain "breathing" are noted, but these do not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics—setting remains atmospheric rather than pressuring. The final image places her "at the center" of the bookstore, a symbolic rather than spatial payoff. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (two: opening description, metaphor reprise) +0.9, causal pressure (none; postcard description) +0.1, closure linkage (symbolic center) +0.5. Ornamental use −0.7. Base ~6.2, metaphor-only reprise lowers to 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After remembering becomes painful" frames the opening but does not tighten decisions—time is vague ("each night," "weeks of effort") and does not impose a deadline or clock that alters tactics. The timeframe is expository context rather than a live constraint. Early signal +0.4, beat involvement (backstory frame) +0.4, causal pressure (none) +0.0, closure linkage (softened into acceptance, no urgency) +0.2. Summary-only −0.6, no on-page cost tied to time −0.4. Base ~4.0, round to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To understand the shape of home" is Elara's stated motivation, repeated across the text ("concept that had dissolved," "pattern of connections," "wherever she chose to nurture connection"). The desire is told and thematized rather than dramatized through conflicting choices—Elara pursues the stone without friction between wants and costs. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (two: initial quest, final realization) +0.9, causal pressure (theme-drives plot loosely) +0.3, closure linkage (theme summary) +0.5. Told-only desire −0.6, no visible friction −0.5. Base ~5.8, thematic rather than actional lowers to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Hidden thunder" is mentioned twice: "hidden thunder rumbled in the depths" and "hidden thunder grew louder… as a drumbeat of transformation," then "echoed in her heart" at the end. Tone is consistent (introspective, lyric, steady) but does not modulate with pressure—no sharpening or breathlessness in peak beats. The thunder is metaphorical and does not charge the final image with felt urgency. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two: middle, end) +0.9, closure linkage (metaphor in final lines) +0.5, tone modulation (static) +0.1. Metaphor-only, no felt pressure −0.6, ornamental reprise −0.4. Base ~5.0, round to 4.9.</comment>
