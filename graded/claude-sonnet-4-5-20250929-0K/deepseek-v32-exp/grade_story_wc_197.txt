<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael remains a surface construct—"carefully resourceful" and "quiet archivist" are labels without contradictory impulses acting in scene. His internal experience is externalized through stock phrasing ("surge of coded freedom," "felt desperation creeping in") rather than embodied perception. The climax at the phone booth involves no visible trade-off orforfeited path; he simply records voices and returns empowered. Motivation is declared but never tested by competing goods or unavoidable harms on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—"the city's vast library" and "urban outskirts" remain placeholders past the 120-word threshold without grounding who/where/when concretely, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The drive lens is ambiguous: the puddle-map and auric lagoon suggest situational pressure, but Kael's actions follow a linear fetch-quest with no narrowing of options or live cost at closure. The "final stand" is asserted but not dramatized; ghostly historians deliver revised histories without Kael sacrificing a live alternative or facing a credible obstacle. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The auric lagoon and phone booth appear but do not constrain choice—Kael inserts the key, hears voices, records them, and leaves without spatial friction or resource limit. Sensory detail is generic ("faint gold," "weeping willows," "luminous depths") and filtered through tourism rather than POV urgency. The puddle-map is asserted as guidance but never shown altering a tactic or route on the page. No environment, body, tool, or recurring object demonstrably narrows options or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to hold the line against the tyranny of indifference"—is declared but never tested by a live on-page obstacle or competing pressure. Plans "unravel" off-stage; the puddle-map solves the problem it did not help create, and the phone booth grants access without trade-off. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Kael walks a fetch-quest path from archive to lagoon to city with no credible loss, omission, or moral calculus. Coincidence (puddle reflections, ghostly historians) complicates and resolves without protagonist agency shaping the outcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated ("tyranny of indifference," "coded freedom," "revised histories") rather than emerging from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "it was not force but remembered stories that held the line." Motifs (phone booth key, auric lagoon, puddle map) recur as checklist items without constraining choice or reweighting meaning at closure. No earned insight arises from specific struggle; Kael's movement is linear lecture rather than dramatic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable but voice is generic—corporate diction ("sanitized stories," "coded freedom," "collective memory") replaces character-particular idiom. The phone booth voices "speak, sharing revised histories" without embodied transmission or POV coloring. Filter verbs stack in peak beats ("felt a surge," "knew he had to," "would seek"), dulling immediacy. No perceptual signature distinguishes Kael's way of noticing under pressure from template interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "revised histories" appears eight times, "phone booth key" six, "auric lagoon under starlight" four, "carefully resourceful" three, "tyranny of indifference" four, "coded freedom" three, "plans unravel" three, "hold the line" four, "puddle reflections" three, "reappear" six. Template cadence dominates ("He aimed to," "He pocketed," "He inserted," "He felt," "He withdrew," "He knew"). Mixed metaphors: "whispers of change spread" while "seeds of doubt" are "planted" and "chains of apathy" are "broken." Figurative density without payoff in most sentences of key beats. Stock phrases: "ripple in stagnant waters," "guardian of truth," "testament to resilience." Artifacts touch closure and pervade dialogue-free narration, triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The premise—rebel archivist uses magical key to unlock truth and fight propaganda—follows a widely used resistance-fantasy template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The auric lagoon, ghostly historians, and phone booth key are ornamental rather than integrated constraints. Kael's path is fetch-quest linear; no turn feels inevitable in hindsight. The proximity check flags "hold the line," "coded freedom," and "tyranny of indifference" as near-echoes of activist rhetoric without specific grounding in this world's particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Kael is labeled "underestimated rebel" in the opening line and remains present throughout, but his choices do not create key turns—the puddle-map, phone booth voices, and ghostly historians deliver solutions without his agency narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. He observes, records, and disseminates without on-page decision cost. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The phone booth key is introduced at ~20%, used once (inserting it to hear voices), and mentioned in closure reflection ("would always be his guide") without functional reweighting. Two touches across beats, but no evolving use or cost tied to its handling. Functional but replaceable—any access token would serve the same plot role.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Revised histories appear in the opening (Council's sanitized stories), the phone booth voices share them, and Kael disseminates them in the final third. The concept is told and thematically echoed but does not constrain a live choice or alter tactics on the page—Kael's plan to distribute archives is unchanged by their content. Mentioned across beats but ornamental to decision structure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is a label applied twice (paragraphs 6 and 19) without on-page demonstration of a trade-off, constraint, or visible cost. No action shows Kael husbanding a scarce resource or adapting under pressure. Label-only, no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Reappear" is used six times: ghostly historians reappear from the lagoon, Kael "reappear[s] with new strategies," and "reappear[s] in collective memory." The repetition is ornamental—none of these moments turns plot or forecloses an option. The word's recurrence does not make it causally indispensable; swapping for "return" or "emerge" would leave structure intact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The puddle-map is signaled at ~15% ("noticed a map suggested by puddle reflections"), credited retroactively ("had proven accurate"), and invoked again at dusk in the final third. It solves a navigation problem it did not help create and is not shown shaping a mid-story attempt or tactic. Functional but late-breaking convenience, cap 4.6 for post-40% introduction that resolves without prior causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The auric lagoon appears at ~25%, hosts the phone booth encounter, and is invoked as Kael's "sanctuary" in reflection. It does not constrain choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the phone booth could function anywhere. Postcard description ("faint gold," "luminous depths") without tactical pressure. Present in closure but ornamental, eligible up to mid-band under two-gate allowance (middle and payoff).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"When plans unravel" is stated in the opening and at the lagoon beat, but time is neither tracked nor tightened—Kael's actions span "one dusk," "following days," and repeated dusks without a live clock altering tactics. The unraveling is declared off-stage; no on-page deadline pressures the phone booth decision. Vague and untracked, trends low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To hold the line against the tyranny of indifference" is declared in paragraph 4, restated in paragraph 37, and summarized in the final line. It is told rather than dramatized—no on-page choice shows Kael sacrificing a competing want or paying a cost to sustain this motive. Friction between desire and cost is absent. Told-only across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Coded freedom" appears three times as a label (paragraphs 18, 28, 46) without modulation—tone remains declarative and abstract throughout, neither intensifying under pressure nor charging the final image with a shift in cadence or register. Static mood, trends mid-low.</comment>
