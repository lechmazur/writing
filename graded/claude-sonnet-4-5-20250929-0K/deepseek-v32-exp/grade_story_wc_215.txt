<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The recluse's "tranquilly perceptive" nature is label-only; no internal contradiction or choice-forfeiting moment dramatizes this trait under pressure. His motivation to preserve unspoken words is told rather than tested through competing desires. The opening of the stained glass box and ghost-watching involve passive observation, not decisions that foreclose paths with visible cost. Embodied emotion is minimal—"heart pounding" appears once, then vanishes into declarative calm.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive late: the beekeeping oasis context and ghost visibility timeframe emerge piecemeal across the first third, triggering a −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (ghosts dissolve, oasis revives), but the cost is asserted—"their silence lingered"—rather than shown through a forfeited choice or tactic shift. The drive lens hovers between Accumulative (mood-driven) and Causal (covenant → box → release), but causality remains vague: why does opening an empty box untangle the covenant? The link is thematic decoration, not motivated action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The oasis setting (hives, honey house, scorched wasteland frame) is vivid and integrated into early atmosphere. The stained glass box appears in multiple beats and carries sensory detail (warmth, scent of honey). However, neither environment nor object constrains a tactical choice—the recluse's actions (watching, opening the box) are unimpeded by spatial or material limits. Micro-setting allowance applies, but without choice-constraint the 9+ gate is missed; cap at 8.8 per the quick test, and accumulated minor issues (generic "green embrace," "deep resonant stillness") lower the band to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve unspoken words—is signaled early but never tested by a competing pressure or tactical fork. No on-page reversal: the ghosts' appearance astonishes, but the recluse's response is serene observation followed by a single, unopposed act (opening the box). The covenant "untangles" without protagonist agency driving the shift; the ghosts dissolve as a result of the box's inherent property, not a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. Cost is asserted in summary ("weight of unspoken words," "gratitude and release") rather than shown as a forfeited alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of silence and unspoken covenant emerges through image (phantom hive-tending, empty box, "mute eloquence"), not thesis statements. However, the final paragraph over-articulates: "deeper truth," "enduring story," "understood everything without a single word spoken" border on moralizing summary. The stained glass box recurs with shifted meaning (relic → vessel → testament), a solid thematic echo. Because escalation is weak (Q4 ≤6.9), theme cannot outrun pressure; the cap at 7.2 applies, and the summary-ending lowers the score within band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature ("tranquilly perceptive") is declared but not enacted through selective, biased noticing; the prose describes everything with uniform lyricism regardless of urgency. Diction is elevated and consistent, but filter verbs ("He felt," "He realized," "He knew") stack in the second half, dulling immediacy during peak beats. Template cadence appears: "Through contextual clues…" recurs three times with identical stem structure, triggering a −0.4 penalty in Q7 and contaminating voice faintly here (−0.2 for voice-template overlap per the guidance).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "unspoken words" appears six times; "tangled covenant" four times; "mute eloquence" three times, often in adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence: "Through contextual clues…" recurs identically in paragraphs 7, 19, and 40, a clear run triggering −0.6. The final third contains scaffold phrasing ("The timeframe after ghosts became visible had passed," "He was no longer just astonished; he was part of…"), lowering clarity and flattening the closure image. Combined artifact penalties: −1.2 in Q7, and the final-third touch disallows 9+ globally, capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—ghosts bound by a covenant that a recluse resolves via a ritual object—closely tracks standard fantasy templates (haunted place, magical box, communion with spirits). The oasis/wasteland frame and beekeeping details add texture, but the emotional arc and resolution (passive observation → convenience solution → nature heals) do not transform the template through unexpected causality or moral calculus. The stained glass box's function (open → warmth → ghosts dissolve) reads as magical convenience rather than a choice-driven turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The astonished recluse is present throughout and observes in multiple beats. However, his choices do not create key turns: he watches (passive), finds the box (discovery, not decision), and opens it (single unopposed act). The box's inherent property, not the recluse's agency, resolves the covenant. Swappable: another observer could perform the same function with minor edits. Cap at 3.8 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears in setup (paragraph 11), middle (handling, warmth, scent), and closure (placed on altar, job complete). It constrains one beat: the opening is the pivot, though unopposed. The box's warmth and resonant stillness charge the ending image moderately. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, minus swappability (any ritual object could serve) −0.6 = band ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The tangled covenant is setup (paragraph 8), recurs as motivation (paragraphs 9, 17, 20), and is resolved at closure (paragraph 30: "no longer tangled"). It shapes the dominant stake but does not constrain a middle choice or enable a tactical shift—untangling happens off-page via the box's magic. Three gates present, two beats, but no causal pressure narrowing options: band ~4.8, minus summary-only resolution −0.7 = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Tranquilly perceptive is declared (paragraph 5) and restated (paragraphs 28, 50) but never enables or constrains an on-page action with cost. No moment where calm perception trades off against urgency or forecloses an impulsive alternative. Label-only use; ornamental. Cap at 2.8 for missing development and closure participation, minus label-artifact −0.2 = 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Gaze appears in setup (paragraph 6), middle beats (paragraphs 18, 31, 40), and closure context (paragraph 47: "gaze sweeping"). It is the method of understanding, but easily swappable with "observe," "watch," or "perceive" without altering plot. No specific cost tied to gazing versus another perception mode. Three gates, three beats, early signal, but swappability −0.8, no specific cost −0.4 = band ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Through contextual clues is signaled in paragraph 7 and recurs in paragraphs 19 and 40. It frames the method of learning (ghost paths, phantom hives, bees returning) and appears in the closure paragraph. However, the mechanics never constrain a choice—clues are read passively, not tested against competing interpretations. Three gates, three beats, early signal +0.9, causal pressure weak +0.3, closure linkage +0.7, swappable method −0.6, template cadence artifact −0.3 = ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis is setup immediately (paragraph 1), middle beats involve honey house shade and hive frames, and closure shows renewed hives and flowers. The setting supplies the covenant's anchor and the final transformation image. However, the wasteland/oasis boundary never constrains a tactical choice (the recluse moves freely; no resource scarcity or threat from outside). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (beekeeping detail) +0.5, no choice-constraint per micro-setting test −0.8, descriptive drift ("green embrace") −0.3 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Timeframe (after ghosts become visible) is setup in paragraph 3 and referenced at closure (paragraph 48: "timeframe after ghosts became visible had passed"). It provides context but does not tighten decisions or tactics—no live clock, no urgency that narrows options. The timeframe is ambient background. Two gates (setup, closure mention), one beat, no causal pressure; band ~3.8, plus closure mention +0.5 = 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Motivation (preserve the weight of unspoken words) is setup in paragraph 10, drives middle reflection (paragraphs 20, 28), and is restated at closure (paragraph 45: "weight of unspoken words was preserved"). However, it is never dramatized through a conflicting desire or tactical fork—the recluse's path is unopposed. Three gates, two beats, told-only friction −0.8, no on-page trade-off −0.6 = band ~5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Mute eloquence is setup (paragraph 2: "silence") and recurs thematically (paragraphs 16, 38, 49). The tone of reverent quietude is coherent and modulates slightly (astonishment → tranquil understanding). However, the tone does not charge the final image with specific pressure—closure is told ("mute eloquence of the moment settled") rather than shown through a rhythm shift or image. Three gates, three beats, early signal +0.7, coherence +0.6, closure linkage weak +0.4, static mood −0.4, summary ending −0.2 = ~5.1.</comment>
