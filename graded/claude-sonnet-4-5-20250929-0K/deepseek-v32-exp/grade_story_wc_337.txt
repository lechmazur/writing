<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to ground spirits is declared but remains abstract; her choices (picking at knots, continuing despite danger) lack contradictory impulses or visible internal friction. Kael functions solely as audience surrogate with no pressure of his own. The "lucid unrest" is labeled repeatedly rather than embodied through perception or micro-choices that reveal competing desires under duress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (silence accumulates, then disperses), but the closure lacks visible cost—spirits are "at peace," weight lifts, satisfaction replaces unrest without any foreclosed path or trade-off on the page. The net-unraveling proceeds linearly without reversal or meaningful tightening; each knot releases a spirit in identical fashion. Orientation is clear early, preventing penalty, but the ending offers relief without reweighting prior material or imposing felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and starlight create vivid atmosphere, but the crystalline walls and shifting patterns remain decorative—no choice hinges on spatial constraint or light quality. The fisherman's net is described (coarse, salt-smelling) yet its physical properties don't alter Elara's method or complicate her task. Sensory detail is present and consistent but does not charge the final image or constrain a beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing trapped spirits—is signaled early but escalation is minimal: Elara encounters resistance ("tightening grip," "sharp silence"), continues, and succeeds without trade-off or tactical shift. The needle slips once, Kael flinches, but no live option is foreclosed and no price paid. The "last knot gave way" without cost or complication, making the resolution a release rather than an earned turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Theme of restoration and shared labor emerges through image (prisms, net, needle) but remains stated in the final exchange: "we are all restorers in our own way" is overt moralizing. The interlaced hush and accumulation of silence offer metaphoric texture, yet the ending disperses ambiguity into tidy peace rather than reweighting the premise. No contradictory cost lingers to complicate the thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays stable with no head-hopping; perceptual filter is present (Elara's focus, the air pressing in) but not character-particular—diction could belong to any restorer. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Elara's lines ("Across sharing a secret," "I must confess something") feel slightly stilted but maintain voice. Psychic distance is consistent, though interior texture lacks rhythmic modulation under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "accumulated silence" and "interlaced hush" are restated across multiple paragraphs without advancing pressure. Template cadence surfaces in the net-unraveling sequence ("Each loop she loosened…" / "With every unraveled strand…" / "As the last knot gave way…"). Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to accumulate," "seemed brighter") dull immediacy in key beats. Sentence openings vary adequately elsewhere, but these artifacts touch the closure sequence, preventing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—restoring masks to ground spirits by unraveling a metaphorical net—fits a familiar template of mystical restoration without a fresh angle. The sanctuary, prisms, and starlight are atmospheric but generic; the fisherman's net as "whisper-catcher" is stated rather than discovered through action. Emotional arc and plot function unchanged if setting or object names shift, indicating insufficient transformation of the core concept.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout and her choices (to begin unraveling, to continue despite resistance) drive the sequence, but these are execution of a plan rather than turns that redefine stakes. She is present in the closure beat ("sat back, her task complete") yet the final image centers relief rather than a decision with cost. Two gates met (setup, closure presence); beat involvement is functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The tapestry needle is mentioned in the opening beat (poised over a mask), used to pick at knots in the middle, and stored away at the end—three touches across the arc. However, its unique properties (why a tapestry needle rather than any tool?) are never leveraged; it could be swapped for "slender awl" or "fine pick" without altering tactics. Functional presence without specificity caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" and "woven quietude" are named early and returned to at closure ("The interlaced hush had been undone"), but the concept functions as atmosphere rather than constraint—no choice turns on whether silence is interlaced versus accumulated. It is thematically present but swappable with "binding stillness" or similar abstractions, indicating ornamental rather than causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Accumulates silence" is declared ("the air itself seemed to accumulate silence," "accumulated silence made it hard to breathe") but never enables or constrains an on-page action with visible cost. Elara presses on despite difficulty; no tactic shifts because of accumulation. The attribute is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice or trade-off, and the closure disperses it without price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Exhume" is signaled early ("exhume their essence") and the net-unraveling enacts it across the middle third, with spirits stirring and settling. The closure confirms completion ("echoes of the past were finally laid to rest"). However, the action proceeds without complication—each knot releases a spirit in identical fashion—so while present in all three gates, it lacks the tactical variation or cost that would make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fisherman's net is introduced early, its mechanics (coarse fibers, complex tangles) described, and the unraveling occupies the central sequence through to closure. The method shapes the middle beats (picking at knots, loosening loops) and the final knot's release triggers the ending. Missing a distinct cost or complication tied to the net's unique properties (why this net, these knots?) prevents higher placement, but causal presence across all three gates supports mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary and starlight are established in the opening line, return in the middle ("starlight through the prisms cast shifting patterns"), and frame the closure ("watched the stars through the crystalline ceiling"). The setting supplies mood but no constraint—no choice hinges on light quality, spatial layout, or sanctuary rules. Reprise is purposeful but ornamental, meeting two gates without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Across sharing a secret" appears once in dialogue and is echoed in Kael's final line, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The unraveling proceeds at an untracked pace with no clock pressure. The "secret" itself (that the net catches whispers) is exposition rather than a temporal constraint, making this element decorative rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to ground restless spirits" is declared early, drives the net-unraveling sequence, and is confirmed at closure ("They are at peace now"). Elara's resolve ("her own resolve steeling") surfaces under pressure, though internal friction between competing desires is absent. The motivation shapes two beats (initiating and completing the task) and participates in the ending, meeting all three gates with functional but not deeply conflicted integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is named in the opening third and returned to at closure ("the lucid unrest lifted"), but tone remains static—heightened throughout without modulation. The piece does not shift cadence or diction as pressure rises and resolves; unrest is replaced by calm rather than charged into the final image. Tone is present and consistent but does not reweight the stake, trending functional without closure charge.</comment>
