<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lorian's motivation is clear and sustained, but his interiority remains abstract—"weight of epochs in his eyes" and "diminutive titan" are labels rather than embodied contradictions. The climactic confrontation with Theron reads as a set-piece reversal without prior dramatic friction between them; Lorian's calm declaration feels asserted rather than earned through visible internal struggle. The final choice (activating the rune) is motivated by his goal, but the emotional stakes lack embodied cost—no hesitation, no bodily manifestation of the decision's weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (cycles of seed-planting culminate in activation). Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. The closure unit—Theron's "graceful collapse" triggered by the rune—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; Lorian's stance crystallizes without visible price or narrowing of options. The scholar's discovery functions as an off-page convenience that accelerates the confrontation rather than a dramatized pressure point. One meaningful deepening occurs (the rune activates), satisfying baseline escalation, but the turn feels more like a triggered mechanism than a choice under duress.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The library is vividly evoked ("shelves curved like sleeping dragons") and its timeless isolation frames the action. The iron gall ink pellet and the rune etched into the floor constrain the method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (library, tomes, floor rune), and the setting functions as sanctuary and weapon. Pushes toward 7.0 because the rune's physical presence on the floor enables the climax, though the library itself remains atmospheric rather than dynamically altering tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask the pretender) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Theron confronts Lorian, narrowing options to activation or silence. However, the scholar's discovery is off-page convenience; the climax pivots on a pre-prepared mechanism rather than a protagonist choice under live pressure. The rune's activation feels like pulling a lever rather than a trade-off with visible cost. Escalation is present but accumulative rather than causal, meeting baseline under the inferred lens but lacking the friction and agency typical of higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (truth's patient erosion of deception) emerges through image and action—drift, ink, library silence—without overt statement. The rune of drift as concept is integrated organically, and the final image ("only what was true remained") offers a resonant answer to the premise. However, "graceful collapse" and "weight of authenticity" veer toward abstraction; the ending resolves into a neat thesis ("not force but patience") that edges toward moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, but the confrontation dialogue ("You are but a speck" / "I am a titan in purpose") is on-the-nose and lowers thematic resonance in that beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited, focused on Lorian. Diction is consistent and elevated ("epochs," "constellations paused"), fitting the mythic register. However, the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; phrases like "time itself had grown thin" and "the library breathed with him" read as poetic overlay rather than Lorian's specific way of noticing. The confrontation dialogue is declarative and lacks subtext or indirection ("You are but a speck" / "I am a titan in purpose"). Purposeful compression and patterned elevation are present, but voice under pressure does not shift or degrade—distance remains static throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly legible ("shelves curved like sleeping dragons," "ink blooming like a night flower"), but accumulation in every beat without pattern-teaching lowers momentum—applies −0.5. Mixed metaphor: "weight of epochs in his eyes" (temporal abstraction) sits uneasily with "diminutive titan" (physical paradox) without synthesis. Template cadence runs in the middle third: "His task was to sunder... His method was... His words were not..." (−0.4). Stock phrasing ("weight of authenticity," "graceful collapse") recurs without fresh embodiment. Paraphrase loop: "nothing false can hold against the tide of truth" echoes the closing "only what was true remained" without adding pressure (−0.2). Cumulative artifacts and elevated diction in peak beats (confrontation) dull immediacy, totaling approximately −1.1 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Core premise (patient scholar undermines usurper through hidden messages) is functional but not fresh; the mythic register and fantastical elements (rune, diminutive titan) dress a familiar template. The "graceful collapse" tone and drift concept offer thematic specificity, but execution relies on stock imagery (library, ancient tomes, celestial backdrop) without transformation. The climactic activation reads as a prepared mechanism rather than a risk under pressure. No close echoes of famous scenes, but the arc (lone scholar vs. false king) and resolution (truth prevails through patience) follow a well-worn path. Derivative Premise adjustment: −0.8 within Q8 for template plot without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lorian ("diminutive titan") is signaled early, appears across multiple beats (ink preparation, message placement, confrontation, rune activation), and his final choice (activating the rune) is the story's hinge. However, his choices are not pressure-tested—each move unfolds as planned without friction or cost. The character is essential to the plot's mechanics but does not wrestle with a meaningful tradeoff on the page. Setup (+0.3), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.0), but low causal pressure (−0.6) and no visible cost tied to his specific attributes (−0.4). Band guidance suggests ~5.0–6.9 for shaping one key turn; here the character drives the ending but without dramatized agency under duress, placing him mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Iron gall ink pellet is signaled early (Lorian uncorks the vial, dissolves the pellet, writes with the ink) and returns in the closure beat ("The iron gall ink, durable and dark, ensured his words would outlast..."). Two distinct beats: preparation and thematic reprise. Setup (+0.3), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.7), specificity (ink's durability matters thematically, +0.4). However, the pellet does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it is a tool used as intended without friction. No visible cost tied to the object itself (−0.3). Places solidly in 5.0–6.9 band for shaping beats and ending reprise, upper end due to dual presence and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rune of drift is seeded early ("a concept that spoke of unraveling bonds"), developed mid-story (Lorian "had orchestrated a network of doubt... the rune of drift would cause the usurper's stolen magic to slowly unravel"), and activates the climax ("he activated the rune of drift etched into the floor"). Three beats: discovery/inscription, thematic preparation, climactic activation. Setup (+0.3), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (the rune is the mechanism that narrows Theron's options, +1.0), closure linkage (+1.2), specificity (unraveling via drift is irreplaceable, +0.6). The concept shapes stakes and tactics directly. Total ~7.1, meeting the ≥7.0 threshold for driving two beats and contributing decisively to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" is labeled early ("moved with a regally unpretentious grace") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The trait is mentioned once, purely as description, and does not shape Lorian's choices, dialogue, or the confrontation dynamics. Setup (+0.3), no beat involvement (0), ornamental use (−0.8), swappability (−0.6). Total ~3.0–4.0 band for label-only presence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears twice: "His task was to sunder the chains of deception" (thematic claim) and "his lies sundered by the weight of authenticity" (closure). The action is present at the ending and thematically charged, but the major turn (rune activation) is not physically a sundering—it is a gradual unraveling. The word functions as metaphor rather than enacted choice. Setup (+0.3), closure linkage (+0.9), but swappability is high (−0.7): the story could substitute "break," "dissolve," or "undo" without structural loss. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band ~5.5–6.3; here the thematic charge elevates slightly but does not drive a distinct beat, placing it at ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Method (cryptic messages in library books) is signaled early ("he left cryptic messages in the library's forgotten volumes"), developed across beats (ink preparation, message placement, scholar's discovery), and enables the climax (the scholar finds proof, Theron rushes to the library). Three beats: setup, execution, payoff. Setup (+0.3), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (the messages organize the network of doubt and summon the scholar, +1.0), closure linkage (+0.7). However, the scholar's discovery is off-page summary (−0.6), and the method could be replaced with direct contact or another covert tactic without fundamentally altering the ending (−0.4). Total ~6.4, solid integration across beats but with some swappability and summary debt.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Ancient temple library is signaled early and present throughout; it houses the cryptic messages, the iron gall ink, the rune on the floor, and the final confrontation. Four beats: initial workspace, message-seeding, scholar's discovery, climactic activation. Setup (+0.3), four beats (+1.4), causal pressure (the library's isolation and physical space—floor rune—enable the method and climax, +1.2), closure linkage (+1.0), specificity (temple library "lost in time" is irreplaceable for the tone and method, +0.5). The setting constrains and enables throughout. Total ~6.6, approaching the 7.0 threshold for essential integration; just shy due to some atmospheric padding in the middle that does not alter live tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across the pause of shifting constellations" is mentioned twice as atmospheric framing ("cycles measured across the pause of shifting constellations," "the constellations paused outside") but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Time is vague—years blend into moments—without a live clock or deadline pressure. Setup (+0.3), no beat involvement (0), ornamental use (−0.7), swappability high (−0.6): the story works identically with "over many years" or "in solitude." Total ~3.0–4.0 band for atmospheric presence without causal function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation (unmask the pretender) is signaled early ("to unmask the pretender who now sat upon the Sunken Throne"), sustained across beats (message-planting, scholar's discovery, confrontation), and drives the climax (Lorian activates the rune to expose Theron). Three beats minimum. Setup (+0.3), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (the motivation organizes all tactics, +1.2), closure linkage (+1.0). However, the motivation is told and referenced more than dramatized through friction—Lorian never hesitates or faces a competing desire on the page (−0.5). Total ~6.7, solidly essential but lacking the internal conflict typical of higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Graceful collapse" is seeded early ("a rune of drift, a concept that spoke of unraveling bonds and the gentle pull of decay"), sustained ("not in a crash, but in a graceful collapse"), and charges the final image ("Theron's form wavered, his lies sundered... like sand through fingers"). Three beats: thematic setup, mid-story reinforcement, climactic enactment. Setup (+0.3), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (the tone shapes the story's method—patience, drift—and the resolution's texture, +1.1), closure linkage (+1.3), specificity (the tone is irreplaceable for the story's thesis, +0.7). The tone is coherent through turns and modulates with pressure (calm patience → confrontation → quiet resolution). Total ~7.4, meeting the ≥7.0 threshold for driving beats and charging the final image indispensably.</comment>
