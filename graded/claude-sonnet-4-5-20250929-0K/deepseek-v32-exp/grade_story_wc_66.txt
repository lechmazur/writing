<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "teach dust to tell stories" is clearly established and pursued through transcription work, but her internal contradictions remain largely decorative. The copyist trait influences her pattern-recognition but does not force a meaningful trade-off or moral calculus in the peak beats. Her devotion to decoding broadcasts is told more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure, and the final transformation ("dust began to retain the tales") reads as wish-fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. The story accumulates texture through recurring imagery (dust, mist, glow, ember alcove) but lacks a single meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options with on-page cost. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the alcove as sanctuary, dust glowing with "secret luminosity"), but the transformation is asserted rather than dramatized through a decisive beat that forecloses a prior path. The pirate broadcaster's direct address ("To the listener in the mist") provides a micro turn, yet the stakes never crystallize into a choice that visibly alters Elara's options or imposes a felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ember alcove is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (fading coals, mist, shortwave glow) and recurs across beats. The dust motes swirling into shapes provide a micro-setting detail that charges the final image. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it remains atmospheric rather than pressuring. The alcove functions as sanctuary and symbol but does not test Elara's options in a way that shapes the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reviving stories after the famine—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, the authorities' threat is declared but never dramatized on the page; no reversal or tightening forces Elara to trade off safety against her mission. The pirate broadcast complicates her work by increasing song complexity, but this does not narrow her options or impose a visible cost. The ending asserts flourishing narratives within the alcove without showing a decision, renunciation, or endurance that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—stories as survival, dust as forgotten memory, luminosity as hidden truth—emerges through concrete imagery (radio glow, dust shapes, coded lyrics) rather than statement. The pirate's line "stories are seeds scattered on the wind" approaches thematic echo but is offset by being attributed to the broadcaster rather than Elara. The final image (dust glowing with "secret luminosity") offers a non-literal answer to the central question, but the resolution lacks the sharp cost or ambiguity that would elevate thematic resonance to the high band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with clean focalization. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent (e.g., "thistled calm," "shortwave radio dial"), though some phrasing trends toward elevated lyricism that risks distance from Elara's embodied experience. No dialogue present to evaluate. Perceptual signature is steady but could be more character-specific; the narrative filters world through musicality and precision but does not always reflect the copyist's embodied habits. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with purposeful rhythm, but several loops and scaffolding phrases reduce density: "She realized this was a method" (line 9) and "This confirmed her belief" (line 26) are summary rather than dramatization. Figurative language ("thistled calm," "shortwave radio dial...a device from a brighter past") is purposeful but occasionally tips into decorative territory without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("She learned," "She resolved," "She began") with repetitive sentence stems that dull momentum. Overall information density is solid but not exceptional; minor paraphrase loops and stock transitions reduce propulsion in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—pirate broadcasts using song lyrics to cloak subversive stories, decoded by a copyist during a "story famine"—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar elements. However, the execution leans on stock metaphors (dust as memory, light as truth) without transforming them through lived detail or a non-obvious moral calculus. The alcove sanctuary and "teaching dust to tell stories" risk abstraction; the ending's assertion that "dust began to retain the tales" feels conceptually interesting but emotionally unearned. The piece avoids derivative templates but does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's role as copyist is established early and informs her pattern-recognition skill ("her diligence as a copyist made her adept at uncovering patterns"). However, her choices do not create key turns; she listens, transcribes, and whispers, but these actions do not narrow options or impose a trade-off. The copyist trait is functional but replaceable—another attentive profession (archivist, linguist) could serve the same role with minor edits. Present across beats but not causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The radio dial appears in multiple beats: tuning the dial (inciting moment), "radio's glow her steadfast guide" (middle), "radio's secret glow to illuminate her nights" (near end). Its "secretly luminous" quality is handled and reweighted, serving as both tool and symbol. It constrains her work spatially (she returns to the alcove) and emotionally (the glow as comfort and risk). However, the radio does not force a choice with visible cost at closure; it remains a constant rather than a pivot. Strong integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast is the inciting incident and shapes Elara's tactics throughout: she decodes lyrics, embeds codes in scores, and responds to the broadcaster's direct address. It defines the dominant stake (reviving stories covertly) and recurs across beats. The broadcast's increasing complexity pressures her skill. However, the concept does not force a decisive on-page choice or impose a visible cost at closure; the ending asserts success without showing a trade-off tied to the broadcast. Essential across beats but not fully indispensable at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" is applied to the radio and later to the dust. The trait constrains Elara's behavior (she conceals the radio's glow) and charges the final image (dust "glowing with a faint, secret luminosity of its own"). However, the luminosity does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost; it remains atmospheric and symbolic. Present in setup and closure, functional in one middle beat (concealment from authorities), but replaceable with another covert quality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Cloak" appears as both verb (broadcaster uses song lyrics to cloak messages) and noun metaphor ("The cloak of song lyrics protected the broadcast"). The action shapes the pirate's method and Elara's decoding work. However, Elara's own cloaking—embedding codes in orchestra scores—is mentioned late (line 27) and not dramatized with on-page consequence. The element is functional but does not drive a major turn; easily swappable with "conceal" or "disguise" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method—"elusive song lyrics"—is signaled early (line 7), shapes Elara's work across beats (deciphering puzzles, transcribing coded lyrics), and recurs in the "fallen king" song near the end. The lyrics' elusiveness pressures her skill and protects the broadcast from detection. However, the mechanics remain vague; we are told she decodes but not shown how the lyrics constrain her choices. The method is essential to the premise and present across beats, but its specific mechanics do not alter tactics or closure in a way that makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ember alcove appears in nearly every beat: Elara retreats there nightly, it is warmed by coals and veiled in mist, and it transforms into a sanctuary at closure. The alcove constrains her work spatially (she must return to this hidden place) and charges the final image ("the alcove itself breathed with whispered legends"). The mist provides cover from authorities. However, the setting does not force a choice with visible cost; it remains a static refuge rather than a tactical pressure. Strong integration and closure participation, but not fully indispensable—another hidden space could serve with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The "story famine" is established early as backstory and frames the stakes (narratives "withered into whispers"). It motivates Elara's work and recurs in the final line ("The story famine persisted beyond her alcove"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; no live clock or deadline pressures her moves. The famine is atmospheric context rather than a constraint that shapes the ending. Functional but replaceable with another scarcity premise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to teach dust to tell stories, to give voice to the forgotten"—is stated explicitly (line 10) and pursued across beats (whispering to dust, infusing it with broadcasts). The desire is present in setup, development, and closure. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicted choices; no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost. The dust teaching is asserted rather than tested. Present and consistent but not charged with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" is coined in line 17 and defined as "serenity edged with risk." The tone is coherent across beats—quiet devotion layered with threat of exposure—and modulates subtly as the pirate broadcast grows more complex. The alcove's atmosphere and Elara's measured work embody the tone. However, the tone does not shift decisively at closure to charge the final image; the ending extends the calm rather than breaking or reweighting it. Strong coherence but limited modulation under pressure.</comment>
