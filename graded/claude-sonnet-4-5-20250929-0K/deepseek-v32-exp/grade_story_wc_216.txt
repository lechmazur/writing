<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "understand the texture of time" remains abstract throughout; her interior life is summarized rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The stranger Leo arrives late and resolves the plot through exposition rather than earned discovery. Emotions are labeled ("heart still," "joy") without specific physical anchors, and the ending grants epiphany without visible cost or foreclosed paths—she simply "felt woven into the very fabric of moments" after a conversation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words; we learn "emerald silo" and "after the Great Shift" but remain unclear on concrete who/where/when anchors. The closure unit—Elara's realization that "time's texture was not in its measure, but in its experience"—is told rather than shown through a decisive change or visible cost. The drive lens wavers between accumulative (texture, atmosphere) and causal (the stranger's arrival solves the mystery), never stabilizing. Leo's arrival and the micro-engraved equation resolve the central mystery via exposition, not protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The emerald silo is vivid in color and hum but remains a static backdrop; its labyrinth interior never constrains a choice. The urn fragment is handled twice (discovery, examination with Leo) and its "cool surface" charges one moment, pushing the score just into functional range. Garage sales are mentioned but not staged on the page, weakening the setting's causal role. The "Great Shift" world rule is declared but never shown affecting action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is declared early but never tested by a meaningful tightening or cost. Leo's arrival is coincidental, not driven by Elara's prior choices; his revelation solves the mystery through exposition. The "timeless moment" offers atmospheric pause but no visible trade-off or foreclosed option. Escalation is absent; the story moves from sorting debris to epiphany without intervening pressure or reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is explicitly stated in the final third: "time's texture was not in its measure, but in its experience" and "time passing was not a countdown, but a melody." These assertions replace earned resonance. The urn fragment shifts from death symbol to "continuous journey" via authorial declaration rather than specific scene work. The piece gestures toward complexity (numbers losing meaning, borrowed time) but abstracts rather than dramatizes the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara, and distance is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("verdant, aged metal," "breathless moment," "etching itself into her consciousness") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Leo's dialogue carries plot information but no subtext or distinct idiom. The perceptual signature is generic—"thick with anticipated mysteries" could describe any protagonist in any silo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "anticipated mysteries" recurs five times without variation; "texture of time" appears four times as synonym churn. Template cadence: "She rediscovered... She began... She would write..." in adjacent beats. The ending stacks summary clauses: "They held... The garage sale descriptions evolved... Elara realized..." without scene grounding. Filter-verb stacks in peak beats ("she felt a shift," "she perceived time") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the maximum −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise (timekeeper in post-shift world decodes urn fragment via garage-sale messages) is high-concept but executed through familiar tropes: mysterious stranger, hidden equation, epiphany ending. The "Great Shift" remains a label without specific world logic. The urn-as-key and numbers-changing-meaning feel like writing-prompt elements assembled rather than organically synthesized. No bold risk-taking; the middle-ground hedging avoids consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her choices (sorting debris, writing cryptic tags) do not create turns. Leo's arrival drives the revelation; she observes and receives rather than decides.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The urn fragment appears in two beats (discovery, examination with Leo) and is handled on the page. It charges one moment ("cool surface... timeless attribute") but does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics. Its meaning is declared ("symbolized a continuous journey") rather than reweighted through action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule frames the discovery but its "damage" does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. It serves as a container for the urn fragment and backstory exposition. Mentioned early and at closure, but not causally active in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" appears once as an atmospheric pause ("timeless moment... movement ceased") but does not enable or constrain an action with cost. It is a felt experience, not a trait that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Rediscovered" frames the inciting incident (finding the time capsule and urn fragment) and recurs in the final third ("rediscovered joy"). The action is signaled early and shapes the arc, but could be swapped for "found" or "unearthed" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage-sale descriptions is mentioned in setup and connects Leo to Elara, shaping one key turn. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown; we never witness the embedding or decoding on the page. It resolves a problem (finding Leo) it did not help create.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The emerald silo is present throughout and provides atmosphere ("hum," "green walls," "labyrinth"). It anchors location but does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome. The color recurs in the final third but as decoration, not constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After numbers change meaning" is mentioned in setup and echoed at closure ("numbers lied") but remains abstract. Time does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; no clock or deadline forces moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation to understand time's texture is declared early and resolved in the ending epiphany, but it is never dramatized in a conflicted choice. Elara's methods (sorting, writing tags) do not create friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Anticipated mysteries" is named repeatedly and coheres as a tone marker. It modulates slightly (from "thick with anticipated mysteries" to "no longer fearsome, but welcomed") but remains static mood rather than charging the final image with pressure.</comment>
