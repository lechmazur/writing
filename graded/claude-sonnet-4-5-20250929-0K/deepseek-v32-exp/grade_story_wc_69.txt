<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is well-developed and her journey across unlearning hatred is clear, but her agency in the present scene remains passive—she searches, finds, and demonstrates, without meaningful contradiction or internal struggle in the library-to-rehearsal sequence. The transition to the choir's transformation happens too smoothly; their shift from "hesitant voices" to "braided into a chord" occurs in one paragraph without dramatized resistance or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Emotional progression reads earnest but tidy, with "expectantly resigned" stated rather than embodied in conflicting impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Elara's search for the rosette builds through reflective density toward the rehearsal's charged moment. Orientation anchors cleanly (library, autumn, Elara by ~80 words). However, closure cost is implied rather than concretely legible—"not perfect, but...honest" and "certain that harmony was possible" soften the ending rather than crystallizing a visible price paid or path foreclosed. The rosette's discovery and deployment feel inevitable in hindsight but lack a meaningful turn or tightening that narrows options; the choir's transformation is asserted ("One by one, they began to sing") rather than dramatized with friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The velvet library is vividly rendered with Persian rug, leaded glass, and autumn light slanting through dust motes; the setting grounds Elara's reflection and shapes her search through tactile engagement (fingers over dusty shelf, carved oak chest). The rosette's placement in the chest and its later position on the piano provide spatial coherence. However, the rehearsal hall remains a white room—no sensory detail or spatial choreography beyond "faces a mosaic of apprehension and hope." The library's atmosphere charges the first two-thirds but does not extend into the closure beat, limiting its contribution to the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching the choir to subtract noise and achieve harmony—is clear and signaled early. However, escalation is minimal: Elara finds the rosette without complication, and the choir's transformation happens in summary ("tentatively at first, then with growing confidence") without on-page resistance or a tightening that narrows options. The phrase "old rivalries that echoed in their hesitant voices" remains abstract; no specific friction surfaces during rehearsal. The ending asserts success ("they had found a way") rather than dramatizing the cost of that achievement or the path foreclosed by their choice to commit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara's work: unlearning hatred, subtracting noise to reveal unity, the vanishing arts of empathy. The rosette's swirling patterns as "intertwined voices" and "beauty emerges from diversity" support the concept without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic echo—"across unlearning hatred, they had found a way to braid their voices, and in that act, they preserved something precious"—which restates rather than deepens. The closing image (rosette as "silent witness," autumn night deepening, "longer, quieter song") offers resonance but does not reweight prior material with fresh pressure or cost; it confirms rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in Elara's focalization; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices velvet nap "soft as a forgotten lullaby," dust motes "like tiny spirits of the vanishing arts"—and diction stays literary-lyric throughout. However, register drifts toward abstract philosophical language under pressure ("the vanishing arts of empathy and patience were being revived," "traveled stillness settled over them") where concrete sensory grounding would sharpen the moment. The single line of direct dialogue ("This," she said...) feels generic rather than voice-distinct. Psychic distance is controlled but uniform; no modulation with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence accumulate across the piece: "She was expectantly resigned, a state she had cultivated" / "Her motivation...felt more urgent"; "the traveled stillness of the library seemed to deepen" / "The traveled stillness settled over them"; "Across unlearning hatred, she had learned" / "Across unlearning hatred, they had found." Figurative language clusters heavily ("velvet library," "plush velvet nap," "gilding motes," "honeyed glow," "mosaic of apprehension") without pattern-teaching or payoff; mixed metaphors appear ("vanishing arts whispered from the shelves," "patchwork of ages"). Stock metaphor strings and synonym churn ("stillness," "quiet," "silence") dull momentum. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("traveled stillness," "across unlearning hatred" repeated), triggering the artifact-at-closure deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The core premise—choir teacher using a historical artifact to teach reconciliation—follows a familiar template (mentor finds symbolic object, applies lesson, students transform). The "unlearning hatred" and "braiding diverse voices" framework reads as prompt-derived rather than lived-in; specifics of the town's divisions and the choir's actual conflicts remain abstract. The rosette as teaching tool and the "subtracting noise" method offer a fresh angle, but their mechanics are told rather than demonstrated. Emotional arc and plot would function unchanged with a different artifact and setting; the transformation test suggests insufficient originality. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the execution is competent but safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her goal (find rosette, teach choir) frames all beats. However, her choices are passive: she searches (successful without complication), explains the rosette's meaning, and observes the choir's transformation. No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path; the rehearsal proceeds as she hopes without friction requiring adaptation. Present by setup, involved in two beats (library search, rehearsal), but lacks causal pressure or cost tied to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The zither soundhole rosette appears in three beats: library discovery (handled, "weight...tangible piece"), rehearsal (held up, "carved lines catching the light," explained), and final image (on the piano, "silent witness"). It shapes Elara's teaching method and carries symbolic weight. However, its use is static—description and explanation rather than evolving tactical pressure. The rosette's properties (patterns denoting balance) do not constrain a choice or alter the choir's transformation; it functions as illustration. Strong closure participation but lacks causal necessity; a different symbolic object could serve similarly with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Vanishing arts are present throughout as theme: songbooks, fragile instruments, craftsmanship fading, "empathy and patience were being revived." The concept frames Elara's urgency and the rosette's significance. However, it remains thematic backdrop rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page. No beat demonstrates how the arts' vanishing alters Elara's options or the choir's choices; it enriches atmosphere but does not constrain action. Functional in one key thematic turn (the rosette as "testament to crafts slipping from memory") but replaceable without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is stated in the opening ("a state she had cultivated") and echoed at the end ("expectantly resigned to the ongoing work"). However, it functions as descriptor rather than constraint; no on-page action demonstrates how this trait enables or limits her choices. The attribute is label-only, not embodied in contradictory impulses or visible tradeoffs. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Denote" appears twice: the rosette "could denote a path forward" (library) and "denotes the heart of our work" (rehearsal explanation). The action is present and linked to the rosette's symbolic function, shaping one key beat (the teaching moment). However, it is easily swappable—"signify," "represent," or "symbolize" would serve identically with no structural change. Functional in one beat, but lacks irreplaceability or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"By subtracting noise" is introduced early ("teaching by subtracting noise, stripping away discord"), repeated mid-story ("to teach by subtracting noise"), and explained at the rehearsal ("by subtracting noise—the judgments, the fears, the old stories—they could find the pure sound"). The method frames Elara's approach and the lesson's mechanics. However, its application remains told rather than shown; no beat dramatizes how subtracting noise alters a specific attempt or tactic. The choir's transformation is asserted to follow this method, but the mechanics do not visibly constrain their process. Purposeful early-final reprise that reweights the dominant stake, reaching mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is vividly established (Persian rug, leaded glass, crimson leaves, carved oak chest) and anchors the first two-thirds of the story. Autumn light and the library's "traveled stillness" charge Elara's reflection and discovery. The library returns in the final line ("The library awaited their return, its velvet shadows ready to hold more stories"), creating a purposeful early-final reprise. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it enriches atmosphere but remains backdrop. The rehearsal hall, by contrast, is a white room. Strong atmospheric contribution and lyric reprise, but lacks tactical pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" appears three times as a temporal/thematic frame: opening context ("across unlearning hatred, a slow unraveling"), mid-story reflection ("Across unlearning hatred, she had learned"), and closure ("Across unlearning hatred, they had found a way"). The timeframe establishes Elara's long journey and the choir's ongoing work. However, it remains vague—no specific clock or timeline tightens decisions in the present window. The phrase functions as lyric echo rather than pressure mechanism; time does not alter tactics or narrow options on the page. Present across beats but does not constrain.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to braid diverse voices into harmony" is stated early ("Her motivation...felt more urgent"), dramatized through the choir's work, and fulfilled at closure ("braided into a chord," "they had found a way to braid their voices"). It drives the library search and the rehearsal lesson, shaping two beats. However, friction between wants and costs is minimal; Elara's desire faces no on-page obstacle or internal conflict that forces a tradeoff. The motivation is present and functional but not contested with visible price. Shapes the dominant stake and ending, reaching mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" appears three times: library atmosphere ("traveled stillness, a quiet earned"), deepening during discovery ("the traveled stillness of the library seemed to deepen"), and rehearsal closure ("The traveled stillness settled over them"). The tone is coherent, purposeful, and modulates subtly (earned → deepening → settling), charging the final image with accumulative weight. However, it remains atmospheric rather than tension-modulating under pressure; the tone does not shift with conflict beats or escalation. A strong lyric reprise that reweights atmosphere at the end, placing it in the mid-5s to low-6s band for tonal contribution without dynamic modulation.</comment>
