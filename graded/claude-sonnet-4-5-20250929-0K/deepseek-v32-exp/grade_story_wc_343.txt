<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's "diligently curious" nature is established early and her observation-to-action arc is coherent, but her interior life reads generic—"heart raced," "trembling with excitement"—without contradictory impulses or embodied cost. The captain remains functional but flat, present only to approve her work. The final shoulder-clap gesture attempts camaraderie but lands as a token beat rather than a crucible moment that alters their dynamic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly by the opening. The drive lens reads Causal: Elara decodes symbols → finds coordinates → captain changes course. Closure is a Decisive Change (new air current charted, ship enters it), but the cost is implied rather than felt—no visible trade-off, renunciation, or foreclosed path on the page. The final paragraphs confirm success and "sociable isolation" as theme rather than dramatizing a price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The antique airship is vivid ("brass fittings," "creaking timbers") and the starling murmurations create atmospheric texture. The hopscotch board is a specific micro-setting detail that enables the discovery, meeting the minimal constraint test. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the environment does not pressure Elara's choices—objects and space accommodate her rather than complicate her path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (chart the hidden pathway) is signaled early and drives the sequence. Elara's agency shows in her observation and decoding, but pressure remains static—she encounters no reversals, dead ends, or costs. The luminance and symbols yield answers without resistance; the captain approves immediately. One tightening occurs (symbols → coordinates), but no live option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is stated four times rather than emerging from scene particulars, and the final paragraph moralizes it: "she embraced the sociable isolation that had fueled her journey." The hopscotch and luminance motifs are introduced and used functionally but do not shift meaning at closure—they solve the puzzle rather than reweight the premise. No resonant, non-literal answer to a thematic question appears; instead the ending confirms her achievement without ambiguity or felt complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature is present in her attention to patterns and celestial language. Diction is controlled and period-appropriate ("antique airship," "polyglot's phrasebook"). Dialogue with Captain Finn is functional and advances plot cleanly. However, interiority relies on stock phrases ("heart raced," "hand trembling") and the prose does not modulate rhythm under peak pressure—sentences remain uniform in length and cadence throughout the discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean; no loops or major scaffolding artifacts. Sentence openings show some variety, though many paragraphs begin with "She" or "The." Information density is moderate—several lines restate Elara's curiosity or the "sociable isolation" theme without advancing action. The discovery sequence reads clearly but without propulsive rhythm; the prose does not tighten or breathe in step with escalating pressure. One paraphrase loop: paragraphs restating her isolation ("feeling both grand and lonely," "sociable isolation," "alone in her achievement") without added cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—apprentice decodes aerial map via bird-linked luminance and forgotten hopscotch symbols—is imaginative, but execution leans on familiar adventure-quest beats: protagonist observes mystery, decodes clues via convenient tool, presents findings, captain approves. The "sociable isolation" framing and celestial-navigation angle offer some freshness, yet the emotional arc (lone scholar finds acceptance through discovery) follows a well-trodden template. No bold risk-taking or transformation of tropes; the story plays its premise straight without subversion or surprising moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her observation → decode → report sequence drives all major beats. However, her role is largely reactive (noticing phenomena) rather than decisional under pressure. The one clear decision—to show her notes to the captain—alters the ship's course but carries no visible cost or trade-off. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is observation rather than constrained choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in three beats: clutched in her hand (opener), used to decipher codes (middle), and falls open to navigation myths (late). It enables the key translation and returns with mild thematic resonance. However, the "dog-ear" detail is mentioned once and does not recur or carry specific cost—any marked phrasebook would function identically. Swappable with minor edits; the dog-ear itself is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Stranded luminance" is named, described as a strange phenomenon amid the murmurations, recognized as the key to the mystery, and declared "a map written in the sky." It shapes the dominant stake and enables the discovery. However, its mechanics remain vague—does it appear only during murmurations? Why does it align with the hopscotch symbols? The concept is causally active but not irreplaceable; "glowing sky-map" would serve the same function.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is applied as a label three times and motivates Elara's note-taking and pattern-seeking. It does not visibly constrain a choice or impose cost—diligence enables success without trade-off. The trait could be swapped for "observant" or "methodical" with no structural change. Present and consistent, but label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The action "note" appears in multiple forms: she decides to note observations, writes in her journal, notes coordinates, and shows her notes to the captain. This verb drives the middle sequence and the climactic reveal. The act of recording and presenting findings is causally necessary—without it, the discovery remains private. However, "record" or "document" would function identically; the word itself is not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The hopscotch board is introduced at the midpoint, examined closely, and its symbols mirror the starlings' flight and correspond to phrasebook phrases. The method is specific and its mechanics matter—she decodes the grid to derive coordinates. However, it appears suddenly (not signaled early) and any forgotten inscribed grid (deck carving, faded map fragment) would serve the same role. Setup gate missed; middle and payoff gates met.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The antique airship is described vividly and consistently present, providing the deck space for the hopscotch board and the platform for observing murmurations. It enables the story spatially but does not pressure choices—it accommodates every need. The final paragraph notes "the Zephyr soared into the newly charted current," confirming its presence at closure without charging the image. Functional postcard; no constraint or tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Starling murmurations bracket the story (opening, middle, dispersal at end) and provide the time window for the luminance phenomenon. The timeframe creates a natural deadline and shapes the urgency of observation. However, elapsed time is not tracked on the page, and no moment dramatizes a race against the fading light or departing birds. The murmurations enable rather than tighten; they part "as if in approval" without imposing cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "chart the next great discovery" is stated in paragraph four, drives her to examine the hopscotch board, and is satisfied when the captain changes course. The motivation is clear and consistent. However, it is never conflicted or tested—no competing desire, fear, or price appears. She pursues it successfully without friction between want and cost. Told and fulfilled, but not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is named four times and described: crew chatter nearby while she remains lost in thought, "feeling both grand and lonely," "a bond with the crew yet separate in her purpose," "surrounded by others yet alone in her achievement." The tone is stated rather than modulated through rhythm or image. It does not shift under pressure or charge the final moment; instead it is restated at closure ("she embraced the sociable isolation") as a summary rather than a felt reweighting.</comment>
