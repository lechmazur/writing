<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Alex's motivation (retrieve Mara's memories) is clear and his affectionate skeptic trait appears, but internal contradiction is absent—he moves smoothly from doubt to determined action without simultaneous opposing impulses. The somatic marker method produces embodied sensation ("muscles relaxed or tensed"), yet the interiority often defaults to abstract phrasing ("strange urge," "willowglass hope") rather than character-particular texture. The final choice to show Mara the image carries stakes, but we never see him wrestle with fear of failure or cost during the process; the arc reads as linear accomplishment rather than earned struggle with visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (layered light-painting as memory map). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Alex completes the visual network and prepares to show Mara, reweighting doubt into "delicate promise of connection"—but the cost remains implied rather than dramatized on the page. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early). One meaningful deepening occurs (the light painting crystallizes his method), yet the final image ("fragile yet radiant") asserts hope without showing what Alex forfeits or risks losing if the bridge fails.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The light painting studio's long-exposure setup and LED wand constrain Alex's method, making the environment functional. The muscovite geode sliver refracts light into branching patterns at a key beat, contributing to the final image. Sensory detail is selective (tingling skin, cool shade/warm sun somatic recall, soft inner glow) and filtered through Alex's purpose. The studio transitions from "place of doubt" to one "brimmed with...promise," grounding the thematic shift, and the pedestal placement of the geode charges the visual climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—illuminate pathways to Mara's fading memory—is signaled early. One tightening: Alex moves from retrieving the geode to devising the light-painting sequence, narrowing his method under time pressure ("the pill's effects were subtle...time was short"). The escalation is more methodical than pressured; no on-page failure, miscalculation, or friction tests his approach. Agency at closure is present (he completes the map and prepares to show Mara), but the resolution feels assured rather than costly—no dramatized moment where a pathway resists or the method falters.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of connection through embodied memory emerges from the somatic markers and light trails. The final image (complex network "that felt alive") offers resonance, yet "willowglass hope, fragile yet radiant" announces the thematic note rather than letting the image speak. The geode's "fractally precise layers...mirror...neural networks" is overt symbolic convenience. Alex's shift from skepticism to "determined action" lacks friction; the epiphany that "hidden pathways could be lit" arrives without on-page cost or counter-pressure, trending toward thesis illustration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Alex. Perceptual signature is present (somatic focus, artist's eye), though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("willowglass hope," "delicate promise of connection") that clashes with the concrete body-mapping method. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the light-painting sequence. No dialogue appears. Under peak pressure (the exposure sequence), syntax compresses appropriately, yet the internal voice remains consistent. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt a strange urge") are voice-appropriate but slightly numerous in the opening third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clarity and propulsion are mostly sound, but several lines loop concept without adding pressure: "Through somatic markers, he traced each memory" immediately follows the decision to "use somatic markers," and "fractally precise" recurs as descriptor without evolving function. The phrase "illuminate hidden pathways" appears in both motivation statement and closure, reducing resonance. Template cadence in the middle third: multiple "He [verb]" and "Each [noun]" openers within three paragraphs. The final third avoids major artifacts, limiting damage, but the loops and stems accumulate to −0.6 under the patterned-artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of telepathy pill, light painting, and somatic memory mapping is conceptually specific, yet the emotional arc (skeptic finds affectionate hope through art) follows a familiar redemption-via-creativity template. The geode as neural-network metaphor and the studio-as-bridge premise are present but not transformed—remove "telepathy pill" and substitute any memory-recovery device, and the structure holds unchanged. The piece commits to its premise without retreat, but the safe middle (assured success, no genuine cost) and the overt symbolic convenience (geode refraction at the key beat) prevent a fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Alex (affectionate skeptic) drives setup and execution. His skepticism melts into action, shaping one turn (retrieval to creation). Choices are present but the trait's contradiction (affection vs. doubt) does not constrain a key beat with visible friction. Present in closure preparation but not decisively reweighted there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Muscovite geode sliver appears in three beats: retrieval, pedestal placement during exposure, and final packing. Its refraction creates branching light patterns that inform the visual map, contributing causally to the method. Specificity (layered sheets, soft glow) matters, and it is tied to Mara's gift, adding relational weight. However, it does not constrain a choice under pressure or carry felt cost at closure—it enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Telepathy pill recall sets the premise and time constraint ("an hour ago," "time was short"), framing the stakes. It enables access to shared memories but does not create friction or alter tactics on the page—Alex's method (somatic markers, light painting) would function similarly with any memory-enhancement device. Present in setup and middle exposition; absent from the closure image. Functional but largely swappable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears three times: as descriptor of the geode's layers, as a label for Alex's attention to detail, and to characterize memory's nature. It never constrains an action or imposes cost—label-only use without mechanical consequence. The trait does not enable or block a choice; removing it would leave the plot intact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Devise" anchors the turning point: Alex decides to map memories via somatic markers and translates them into light painting. This choice shapes the entire middle sequence and leads directly to the final image. Present in setup framing ("needed to devise a method") and enacted across multiple beats. The devising itself is methodical rather than tested by failure, but it is indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through somatic markers" is named as the method and demonstrated across several beats: recalling Mara's hand, tracing muscle relaxation/tension, recreating forest sensations. It shapes the light-painting choreography and anchors the bodily specificity. However, the mechanics are asserted more than dramatized—we are told he notes sensations, but the method does not visibly fail or force a tactical pivot. Present in middle and implicit in closure, but cost-free.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Light painting studio supplies the camera, long exposure, LED wand, and dark room necessary for the visual translation. The setup constrains Alex's method (he must move through darkness, timed by exposure) and the environment charges the final image (studio "brimmed with...promise"). Spatial choreography is clear. The setting is integral to execution and closure, though it does not impose friction or cost—it is an enabling constraint rather than a complicating one.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the static shock" anchors the opening and the shock "jarred something loose," priming the turn from skepticism to action. The telepathy pill's one-hour timeline is mentioned ("taken one an hour ago"), creating urgency in principle. However, elapsed time is never tracked on the page and the clock does not tighten decisions—Alex's process unfolds without visible time pressure or a countdown that alters tactics. Setup only; no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden pathways" is stated as motivation early, recurs in the closure framing ("hidden pathways could be lit"), and drives the devising and execution beats. The desire is clear and shapes all major actions. However, it is not dramatized as conflicted—Alex pursues it without friction, doubt, or competing want. The motivation enables the arc but does not create a costly tradeoff or force a renunciation on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope, fragile yet radiant" appears once in the final third, naming the tone rather than embodying it through image and rhythm. The piece opens with tension (static shock, tingling) and moves toward determined creation, but the tonal arc is asserted ("now brimmed with...delicate promise") rather than charged through cadence shift or pressured diction. The label fits the ending but does not modulate with escalation or cost.</comment>
