<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The widow's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her "hauntingly practical" demeanor is asserted repeatedly but never tested by a moment where practicality conflicts with grief in a choice that costs something on the page. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("her heart ached," "tremor in her soul") instead of embodied, character-specific perception. The final "lighter" heart arrives without visible forfeiture or a micro-choice that earned the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece lacks a decisive change or visible cost at closure; the carving is "complete" and her heart "a little lighter" without any on-page trade-off or foreclosed path. Orientation is adequate (who/where/when anchored early). The causal lens is ambiguous—carving unfolds as a series of meditative statements rather than because/therefore linkages, and no reversal or tightening narrows options. The kettle's boil functions as a timer but does not force a choice or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight and loft anchor the scene early with vivid sensory detail ("rust-hued peace," "scent of wet ash"). The ash wood's grain is noted but does not constrain a carving choice. The kettle provides ambient pressure but does not limit tool selection or stroke sequence. Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting charges atmosphere, but it does not alter a tactic or decision on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to "harvest lessons from loss"—is declared but never tested by a reversal or price. The widow carves without error, hesitation, or trade-off; no moment narrows her options or forces her to choose between competing goods. The kettle's whistle is mentioned as a timer but does not trigger a choice or tighten tactics. Pressure remains static, and the resolution (carving finished, heart lighter) arrives without visible cost or agency that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring "here and gone" and "crystallized time" motifs, but the piece leans on overt thematic summary ("harvesting lessons from loss," "courage is found in moving forward") rather than letting the image alone carry weight. The final paragraph explicitly states the reconciliation rather than letting the carving and her gesture embody it. The rust-hued peace and lion imagery offer some resonance, but the ending moralizes instead of reweighting prior particulars through implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and controlled, with a distinct rhythm and elevated diction appropriate to the reflective mode. Psychic distance remains stable. However, the prose repeatedly uses template stems ("She thought," "She remembered," "She had learned") and filter verbs that dull immediacy in what should be high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is minimal; the widow's noticing reads generic rather than character-specific. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the piece: "here and gone" appears six times, "crystallized time" five times, "contain/contained" five times, often restating the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate ("She [verb]" stems across a dozen lines). Stock metaphors ("heart ached," "soul tremor") and the summary-laden final paragraph dull the closure beat. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance. These artifacts cluster throughout and touch the ending, triggering the high-band disqualification and substantial Q7 penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lion-tamer's-widow premise and grief-through-craft frame are recognizable templates. The story transforms them modestly through the rain-beaded loft and rust-hued peace, but the emotional arc (carving as meditation, heart lighter at the end) follows a predictable path. The lion-head carving as symbol rather than literal portrait offers a small inflection. The piece does not take structural or perspectival risks, and the moralizing final paragraph undercuts any ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and focalizer, but makes no key on-page choices; carving proceeds without error, hesitation, or competing impulse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 2), handled across multiple carving beats, and present in the ending image as the finished piece. Its grain is noted, but it does not constrain a single stroke or tool choice; swappable with another wood type. Closure linkage and beat involvement elevate it into mid-band, but lack of causal pressure caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Signaled early and repeated throughout ("here in her heart, gone from her sight," bridging the gap). Functions as thematic claim rather than shaping a tactic or choice. The concept does not alter options on the page; it is asserted, not dramatized through a decision with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The label "hauntingly practical" appears twice and is paraphrased ("practical demeanor," "grief had taught her to be practical"), but no beat shows a trade-off between practicality and another impulse. The trait is told, not dramatized through a constrained action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 7: "aimed to contain the essence") and present in the ending ("contained her grief"). The concept threads through multiple beats (contain wildness, hold memories close). However, the action is abstract and swappable with "capture" or "preserve" without altering story logic. It reweights meaning at closure but does not create a turn or narrow options mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 8: "crystallized time") and repeated five times, including in the final image ("through crystallized time"). Functions as thematic metaphor rather than a mechanical method; the widow does not adjust her carving technique based on this concept. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Anchored in the opening line, provides sensory detail (rain beads, rust-hued light, wet ash scent), and frames the entire scene. The loft offers sanctuary but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the carving. Early setup and closure presence meet two gates; lack of causal pressure limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 3) and mentioned four times, including at closure ("kettle reached a full boil"). Functions as ambient timer but does not tighten a decision; the widow "did not rush her final strokes," undercutting the urgency. Time pressure is declared but not dramatized through a forced choice or tactic shift.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stated explicitly in paragraph 4 ("to harvest lessons from loss") and restated near the end. Drives the overall goal but is not conflicted on the page; no moment shows her torn between holding on and letting go. The motivation is present and frames the action but lacks friction or visible cost in a specific choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 21: "rust-hued peace") and repeated in paragraph 30, where it "settled around her" at closure. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly from melancholy to bittersweet. The rust-hued light charges the final image with warmth. However, tone does not shift under pressure or participate in a turn; it remains stable throughout, limiting the score to mid-band.</comment>
