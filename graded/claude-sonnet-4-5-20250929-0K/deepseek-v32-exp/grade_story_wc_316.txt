<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's ego-death survivor status reads as a static label rather than a lived contradiction; his numbness is asserted repeatedly ("his numbness a fortress") without embodied micro-choices that show competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final "spark" arrives through an external ritual rather than earned internal conflict, and the emotion-flood ("grief, joy, fear, and hope") deploys therapy-speak labels at the pivotal beat instead of specific perception. Rin and the faction representatives remain one-dimensional conveniences—grey-robed Archivists versus green-clad Vitalists—without distinct voice or status friction on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is established (floating dojo, Kael meditates, dawn custody battle), satisfying the early anchor test. The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (merging essences to vivify consciousness), but the mechanism—"using the dojo's ancient rituals"—arrives unearned and unexplained, functioning as a convenient solve rather than a causal extension of prior moves. History's rewriting ceases abruptly without demonstrated cost or tactical constraint traced to Kael's agency. The inferred lens is Causal, yet the key turn (the merge proposal) lacks because/therefore linkage to prior on-page choices; Kael simply announces a solution mid-debate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The floating dojo is anchored early with vivid details (stone surface, mist-shrouded valleys, energy convergence point), and the jar of amber fluid provides tactile presence. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the floating stones and "psychic reverberations" do not constrain Kael's choices or shape the custody debate tactics. The final ritual occurs "at the dojo's heart, where energy lines converged," a phrase that asserts rather than dramatizes spatial influence on the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—overcoming Kael's numbness—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: Kael "felt nothing," then after one proposal and hand-placement, emotions flood in. No on-page reversal narrows his options or forces a trade-off with visible cost before the resolution. The custody battle itself never escalates; both factions "argue" off-page while Kael listens and then unilaterally proposes a merge that both sides accept without dramatized resistance. Agency at closure is asserted (he "focused all his will") rather than demonstrated through a choice that forecloses a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The complementary-opposites theme is stated explicitly by Rin ("light defines shadow") and repeated by Kael in dialogue ("complementary opposite to my own being"), constituting overt thematic articulation rather than emergence from particulars. The brain-in-jar as symbolic duplicate and the merge as solution arrive as philosophical propositions without scene-level friction or ambiguity. The final line—"no longer a thing to be owned, but a part of a renewed existence"—summarizes the theme rather than leaving a resonant, non-literal image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Kael's perceptual bias (numbness as fortress, "slicing through pretense") is asserted but not embodied through selective, character-specific noticing. Dialogue is functional but lacks subtext: Rin's lines ("Your attribute, the one that slices through pretense") and Kael's announcement ("I can slice through the pretense here") read as exposition rather than goal-driven speech. Psychic distance holds, yet the prose at peak beats—"emotions flooded into him: grief, joy, fear, and hope"—deploys a catalog rather than a rhythmic, voice-specific rendering of overwhelm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The prose is grammatically clean and maintains clarity, but suffers from repetitive scaffold phrasing: "Kael felt nothing," "his numbness a fortress," "the brain in the jar" recur without evolving detail. Filter verbs cluster in the final beat ("felt a spark...felt...emotions flooded") where immediacy would sharpen impact. Figurative language is generic ("dam bursting," "light defines shadow") and stock metaphors do not advance scene pressure. The final paragraph compresses three major effects—merging, emotion-flood, history-stabilization—into summary rather than dramatized sequence, flattening momentum at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The ego-death survivor seeking to defeat numbness via a cloned-brain custody battle on a floating dojo during rewriting history assembles multiple high-concept prompts, yet the synthesis feels additive rather than inevitable. The complementary-opposites method and the vivification action are announced by characters rather than discovered through scene friction, and the resolution—merge ritual solves all problems simultaneously—lacks the specificity or moral calculus that would distinguish it from template fantasy solutions. The piece commits to its premise but retreats from its implications: the custody factions dissolve without cost, history stabilizes conveniently, and Kael's numbness lifts in a single beat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kael (ego-death survivor) is present throughout and makes the final proposal to merge, but his choices do not create key on-page turns—he listens, then announces a solution that others accept without resistance. His survivor status functions as backstory label rather than a trait constraining present tactics. Present at setup, middle (listening), and closure (merge), satisfying the gate model, but causal pressure and cost remain thin: swappable with "conflicted mediator" with minor edits. Band ~3–4 functional but replaceable; no strong irreplaceability signal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The brain in a jar (labeled "duplicate") appears at setup (Rin carries it), is described mid-scene (Kael places hands on it), and is present at closure (the brain "stirred"), satisfying all three gates. It drives at least two beats (Rin's presentation, final merge) and is causally linked to Kael's numbness cure. However, its properties remain abstract—"latent vitality" is asserted rather than shown through specific handling—and it could be replaced by another "clone artifact" with modest rewrites. No visible cost tied uniquely to this object; the merge cost is emotional rather than object-specific. Band ~5.0–5.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Clone custody battle frames the setup (two factions arrive, debate at dawn) and generates the middle conflict (Archivists vs. Vitalists argue ownership), satisfying two gates. It shapes the dominant stake—philosophical war over identity—but does not directly constrain Kael's final choice; he sidesteps custody via merge, dissolving the battle rather than resolving it. The concept is signaled early (+0.5) and involves two beats (+0.9), but the closure avoids rather than answers the custody question (−0.5 for resolving a problem it helped create by evasion). Band ~4.5–5.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" is introduced as Rin's label ("Your attribute...will be essential") and Kael repeats it in dialogue ("I can slice through the pretense here"), but no on-page action demonstrates this trait constraining or enabling a choice with visible cost. He perceives "core fear" in the factions' rhetoric, yet this insight does not alter his tactics or narrow options. Present at setup (Rin's statement) and closure (Kael's announcement), missing middle development gate → cap 3.4. Label-only trait (−0.3), swappable with "perceptive mediator" (−0.5). Band ~3.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Vivify is signaled early (Vitalists wish "to be vivified"), discussed mid-scene (Kael realizes vivification means "restoring potential for emotion"), and drives the closure turn (they "vivify a new consciousness together"). Present at all three gates and causally linked to Kael's numbness cure—without vivification, the merge and emotional breakthrough do not occur. The concept shapes two distinct beats (mid-scene realization, final ritual) and the ending stakes (+1.4). However, the mechanics remain vague ("using the dojo's ancient rituals"), reducing irreplaceability slightly. Band ~6.0–6.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Complementary opposites is introduced mid-scene by Rin ("through complementary opposites...light defines shadow") and repeated by Kael at closure ("his numbness and the brain's latent vitality"). The method is explained rather than dramatized: no on-page beat shows Kael attempting to balance opposites with friction or cost before the final merge. First appearance ~40% mark (−0.3 late penalty), present in middle explanation and closure proposal (two gates, cap ~6.0), but the mechanics are told rather than enacted (−0.6 summary-only). Band ~4.0–4.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo is anchored at the opening (stone surface, mist valleys) and returns at closure ("dojo's heart, where energy lines converged"). It provides spatial grounding and slight thematic charge (floating/adrift mirrors Kael's state), but does not constrain choices—the custody debate and merge could occur on stable ground with minor edits. Present at setup and closure (two gates, eligible ~6.0), but middle involvement is weak: Rin "guided them to the dojo's heart" without showing how the location alters tactics. Swappable with "ancient temple" (−0.6). Band ~4.5–5.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>History rewriting itself is established early ("air shimmered as history rewrote itself"), mentioned mid-scene ("already fragile timeline"), and resolved at closure ("History ceased its erratic rewriting"). Present at all three gates, but it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint on choices: no beat shows Kael adapting tactics due to timeline shifts, and the stabilization is convenience rather than earned consequence. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter moves (−0.7). Ornamental use (−0.7). Band ~3.5–4.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Defeat emotional numbness is Kael's stated motivation from the opening ("singular: to defeat the emotional numbness") and drives the closure turn (emotions "breaking the numbness like a dam bursting"). Present at setup, implicit in middle conflict (Rin: "To overcome your numbness, you must engage"), and paid off at ending—all three gates satisfied. The desire shapes two beats (Rin's instruction, final merge) and the ending stakes (+1.4). However, the motivation is told repeatedly rather than dramatized through contradictory on-page micro-choices that reveal friction between cost and want (−0.5). Band ~5.5–6.0.</comment>
