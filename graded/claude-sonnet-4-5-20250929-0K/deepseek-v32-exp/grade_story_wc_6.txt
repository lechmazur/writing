<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared early but remains mostly thematic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The scene with the girl shows compassion but lacks internal conflict—no hesitation, cost, or competing impulse that would test her resolve. The backstory about her arsonist father is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Emotional progression is linear and controlled; the "profound peace" at the end feels awarded rather than earned through visible struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric intent, but no meaningful tightening or cost accumulates on the page. The graft procedure unfolds without complication, reversal, or visible price—Elara performs the work smoothly, the girl cooperates, and the ending delivers thematic closure via assertion ("somewhere, a scar was singing") rather than a felt reconfiguration. Closure requires visible cost; here the final image recycles the opening premise without reweighting it. The Orientation Test is satisfied early, but the lack of pressure or escalation prevents the closure from landing with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, black sand, and volcanic beach are vivid and sensory-specific, establishing a distinct locale. The sand is used twice—mixed into paste and clinging to Elara's hands—giving it slight functional presence. However, the setting does not constrain choice or alter tactics; it remains postcard-beautiful backdrop. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment does not pressure the scene's resolution, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—helping the girl's scars heal—is declared but never tested. No complication arises; the graft succeeds without resistance, pain threshold, or tactical adjustment. The girl flinches once but holds still, offering no meaningful friction. Escalation is absent; the procedure unfolds as a demonstration rather than a choice under pressure. The ending grants resolution without visible cost or trade-off, leaving the conflict inert.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme "scars can sing" is stated multiple times rather than emerging from particulars. The black sand, coin, and clouds recur but remain ornamental symbols rather than images that reweight the premise. The ending's assertion "a scar was singing" and "she found her own redemption" are direct thematic statements that replace scene pressure. The girl's quiet melody offers a moment of earned resonance, lifting the score slightly, but the final paragraph moralizes instead of trusting the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Elara's perception. Diction remains consistent—no register drift or head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic; phrases like "gracefully alert," "kelp-drift peace," and "unyielding compassion" repeat as labels without idiosyncratic coloring. The girl's single line of dialogue is functional but indistinct. Voice is competent and legible but lacks a sharp, character-particular texture that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence-level clarity is adequate, but template cadence and paraphrase loops accumulate throughout. "Her motivation, today and always, was to prove that scars could sing" is restated via "Scars are like stories...they sing" and again in the final line. Runs of identical stems ("The clouds migrated...The girl began...Elara listened...") appear without variation. Stock metaphors—"clouds like gentle brushes," "song of her scars"—blur specificity. The final paragraph stacks summary and abstraction ("kelp-drift calm," "her own redemption"), dulling momentum. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence, plus −0.3 for figurative density without payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—firefighter daughter of an arsonist healing burn scars on a volcanic beach—combines striking elements but executes as a thematic exercise rather than a lived narrative. The core arc (proving scars can sing) is stated rather than transformed through specific choice. The black sand graft, foreign coin as talisman, and lyric pacing offer some freshness, but the emotional template—redemption through compassionate healing—follows a familiar path without inflection or risk. The ending's declarative closure ("somewhere, a scar was singing") retreats to safety rather than sustaining the volcanic specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout but backstory-only; her father's arson is mentioned twice without altering on-page choices. She is a firefighter by profession, but that identity does not constrain or enable the graft scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Black sand appears in three beats: described early, mixed into paste for the graft, and clinging to Elara's hands at the end. It is used functionally in the procedure and carries symbolic weight as "born of volcano and sea," but its specific properties do not constrain the graft's success or charge the closure with cost. The reprise at the end is lyric but does not reweight prior stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" is named twice and demonstrated in the graft scene, but it does not face friction or cost on the page. The concept shapes theme but not tactics or choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" appears in the opening line and once more as "graceful, alert hands" during the graft. The trait is label-only; it does not constrain movement, enable a specific action, or cost Elara anything.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The graft drives the central scene and is prepared, executed, and completed on the page. It is the vehicle for thematic closure. However, the procedure succeeds without complication or visible cost, and the outcome (healing) could be achieved through other means with minor edits. The graft is integral to the setup and middle but does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The coin is introduced early, given symbolic backstory (traveler who died), placed between Elara and the girl during the graft, and then pressed into the girl's palm. It serves as a thematic token but does not shape the graft's mechanics or alter the outcome. Present in three beats but ornamental in each.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is anchored early and returned to throughout; the black sand is sourced from it and mixed with its water. The lagoon provides the healing minerals and frames the scene spatially. However, it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply a resource that alters the graft's success. It is vivid and purposeful but not indispensable to the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Clouds are mentioned in five passages as a recurring image but never function as a ticking clock or time constraint. The migration is atmospheric and symbolic, not a temporal frame that alters tactics or tightens decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that scars can sing" is named early, restated mid-scene, and echoed in the ending. It shapes Elara's overall purpose and frames the thematic arc, but it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. It reads as a thesis rather than a lived friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" is named twice and describes the lagoon's mood. The tone is serene and contemplative throughout, with no modulation under pressure. The girl's flinch and the graft's delicacy do not disrupt the even calm. The tone is coherent but static, and it does not charge the final image with tension or cost.</comment>
