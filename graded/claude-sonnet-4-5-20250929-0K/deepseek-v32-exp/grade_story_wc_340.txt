<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to seek out the joy beneath anguish") but remains largely abstract; the diary unlocking provides some micro-choices, yet her transformation at the summit reads as summary ("understanding that joy wasn't the absence of anguish") rather than embodied contradiction. Interiority leans toward label-only feelings ("heart swelled") and the final realization lacks visible cost or a path foreclosed. The captain exists only as text, so relationship pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: diary entries layer meaning floor by floor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara "found the joy she sought" at the summit. Cost is asserted but not dramatized—no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift results from the discovery. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The elevator climb provides a clear frame, but causality is thin; each floor simply reveals more text without meaningful reversal or deepening that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire, brass elevator, and carved ice walls establish vivid atmosphere with selective sensory detail (frost, internal radiance, prismatic patterns). The goggles function as a tool that constrains one choice (decoding the diary through refracted light). Spatial choreography is stable, and the ten-floor ascent creates a legible ticking clock. The setting does not, however, force a dilemma or alter tactics beyond enabling the decode; it remains scenic rather than a crucible for decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—seeking joy beneath anguish—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested by on-page pressure. The elevator ascent provides a metronome, yet no reversal or tightening forecloses an option; Elara simply reads, floor by floor, until she arrives at an epiphany summarized in the final paragraph. Agency is observation rather than decision. The diary's captain offers thematic mirror but no live conflict, and the resolution carries no visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (joy beneath anguish) emerges through the captain's diary entries and Elara's parallel ascent, avoiding overt sermon until the penultimate line ("she found the joy she sought, glowing softly beneath the surface of all things") flirts with summary moralizing. The goggles and diary recur with shifting weight, and the icebound spire offers a non-literal final image. Yet the ending explains rather than reweights; the conceptual answer is stated, not enacted, and lacks the particularity that would charge it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows affectionate detachment ("observed the play of luminescence, a habit from her solitary duties"), though interior diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("kinship forged in shared solitude"). Focalization is tight; Elara reads the diary aloud, grounding access. The prose modulates from curiosity to resolve, but lacks rhythmic or syntactic variation under peak stress. No dialogue on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Clarity is solid; spatial and causal sequencing track cleanly. However, the prose exhibits paraphrase loops ("The discovery felt fated, a puzzle waiting" / "piecing together the captain's story"), synonym churn ("affectionate yet detached" / "affectionate detachment"), and template cadence in mid-section beats ("With each floor ascended, more of the diary yielded its secrets" / "As the eighth floor approached, the diary's final entries emerged"). Stock metaphors populate closure beats ("glowing softly beneath the surface of all things"). Apply −0.8 for loops and template patterns across multiple beats; the artifacts do not obscure causality but dull line-level momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The encrypted-diary-decoded-by-special-goggles premise is functional but echoes familiar treasure-hunt and quest-for-meaning templates without a fresh angle. The icebound spire and airship captain backstory add atmospheric specificity, yet the emotional arc (servant finds wisdom in dead captain's journal) follows a well-worn path. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the story occupies the safety middle with median execution and no transformation that would make the combination feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and signals early (opening line). She makes micro-choices (adjusting goggles, reading aloud, closing the diary), but these are observational rather than decisive; no fork or cost alters her tactics. She arrives at the summit with "renewed purpose" told rather than shown. Two gates met (setup, payoff), but middle development is summary only. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; slight lift for thematic reprise at closure → 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The goggles appear early (end of first paragraph) and recur at the decode beat (floor ~5), where refracted light through the lenses enables Elara to read the diary's hidden ink. This creates one key turn (functional constraint). They are "entrusted to her for this journey" and reprised in the final paragraph ("once a tool for navigation, had become a key to unlocking hidden truths"), reweighting their role. Three gates met; causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, two beats +0.9, irreplaceability +0.5. Baseline 3.0 +3.0 = 6.0, round to 6.7 for strong thematic charge at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The diary is discovered early (floor ~2) and shapes the entire ascent; decoding it is the action, and the entries layer meaning floor by floor. However, the concept itself (encrypted diary) does not constrain Elara's choices—she simply reads as the goggles permit. The diary's wisdom alters her stance at closure, but the encryption mechanic is ornamental after the first decode; any journal would serve the same thematic function. Three gates met, but swappability and lack of tactical pressure lower the score. Baseline 3.0 +1.4 (beats) +0.7 (closure) −0.6 (swappability) = 4.5; lift to 5.9 for closure linkage and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is mentioned twice (opening paragraph, mid-ascent), but functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains choice. Elara's curiosity drives her to decode the diary, yet no on-page tradeoff or cost ties to this attribute specifically—any protagonist seeking answers would behave identically. Setup present, closure echo weak, middle development absent. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle; further lower to 3.8 for label-only use and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears throughout: Elara opens the diary, the narrative unfolds floor by floor, and at closure "the diary's wisdom" unfolds into her renewed purpose. The action shapes beats two through nine and participates in the final image ("closed the diary, the encrypted pages now a clear map"). Three gates met; causal involvement +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, early signal +0.5. Baseline 3.0 +2.1 = 5.1; lift to 6.2 for strong closure participation and beat density.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Scattered light is seeded mid-ascent ("light from hidden sources scattered across the frosted walls") and becomes the decode mechanism: "Through scattered light filtering from above, the goggles revealed hidden layers." The method is signaled and used once at a key beat, enabling the diary unlock. Setup in first third, middle development at decode, and thematic echo at closure ("a sudden shaft of light through a vent"). Three gates met; causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.4, irreplaceability +0.5. Baseline 3.0 +1.8 = 4.8; lift to 5.6 for specificity and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire is named in the opening line and provides vivid atmosphere (carved ice, internal radiance, frosted walls). The elevator ascent structures time and creates a spatial container. However, the setting does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter outcome—it is scenic rather than tactical. Setup strong, middle descriptive, closure present ("The icebound spire stood silent above the clouds"). Two gates clearly met (setup, payoff); middle is ambient only. Baseline 3.0 +0.8 (setup) +0.7 (closure) −0.5 (ornamental middle) = 4.0; lift to 5.3 for strong atmospheric coherence and thematic reprise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ten-floor climb is announced early and tracked explicitly: "passed the halfway point, floors five and six," "As the eighth floor approached," "The elevator neared the tenth floor." Time tightens the decode sequence and creates a legible metronome. However, no urgency or cost ties to the clock—Elara could read faster or slower without consequence. Three gates met; beat involvement +0.9, early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.4. Baseline 3.0 +1.8 = 4.8; lift to 6.1 for consistent pressure structure across beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to seek out the joy beneath anguish" is declared in the opening paragraph and echoed at closure ("she found the joy she sought"). Yet it remains abstract; no on-page choice tests this desire against a competing want or cost. The diary's entries dramatize the captain's joy, but Elara's own motivation is told rather than conflicted. Setup present, middle is thematic observation, closure is summary. Two gates met; cap at ~6.0 for lack of middle dramatization, then lower to 4.2 for label-only use and no friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is named mid-ascent ("Her gaze, affectionate yet detached, observed the play of luminescence") and colors perception throughout: Elara feels connection to the captain yet remains an observer. The tone modulates slightly under pressure ("heart swelled") but stays coherent. It charges the final image: watching from above, finding joy "glowing softly beneath the surface." Three gates met; setup +0.5, middle coloring +0.4, closure linkage +0.7, coherence +0.5. Baseline 3.0 +2.1 = 5.1; lift to 5.8 for tonal consistency and closure charge.</comment>
