<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The coachman remains a static archetype throughout—his motivation is declared but never tested by internal contradiction or meaningful choice under pressure. The piece tells us he "honored the memory of the fallen" and felt "satisfied," but these are labels rather than embodied states that shift tactically. No micro-choices reveal competing impulses; he completes his task without visible cost or foreclosed paths. The dead-language attribute and bird-call understanding are mentioned repeatedly but never constrain a decision or create friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late (character role and location emerge gradually across the first 6 lines) and the dominant stake—garden reclamation—is stated rather than tested. The piece operates in a summary-accumulative mode: the coachman works, scatters seeds, and departs, but no reversal or deepening narrows his options. The ending offers Earned Stasis (he has completed the task and departs), yet the cost is asserted ("wounds of the earth") rather than felt on the page. The drive lens wobbles between Accumulative (lyric density) and Causal (planting seeds to restore life), never fully committing to either, and closure reads as atmospheric summary rather than a decisive reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The blooming jetty, glowing flowers, and dead reef provide a vivid backdrop, and sensory details (twilight, birds, soil) are filtered through the coachman's purposeful attention. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—he kneels, plants, and leaves without spatial friction. The jetty functions as a stage rather than a crucible. The final image of flowers nodding charges the setting lyrically but does not tie it to a pivotal decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reclaim the battlefield) is signaled early but never encounters opposition or escalation. The coachman's plan proceeds without complication: he speaks, birds respond, he plants seeds, all according to intention. No reversal, tightening, or cost-laden choice appears; coincidence (the birds' guidance) enables rather than complicates. The piece describes a completed ritual rather than a conflict under pressure, and the resolution is predetermined by the opening motivation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through repeated images of renewal and submerged concord, and the ending gestures toward healing ("narrow vastness of light in the dark"). However, the thematic question is stated rather than dramatized: "Fertilize the wounds of the earth, and they would heal" reads as thesis, not earned insight. The coachman's internal arc is absent—he begins and ends with the same conviction. The final phrase "where concord submerged rose again" attempts resonance but lands as summary rather than a non-literal answer grounded in prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The third-person narration maintains stable distance and employs a quasi-archaic register ("gloom-hill," "narrow vastness") that fits the coachman's mythic role. However, the voice becomes mechanical through repeated template openings ("He carried," "He stepped," "He knelt," "He scattered," "He worked") and synonym churn ("submerged concord" appears five times with minimal variation). Perceptual signature is generic—vivid description without character-specific bias. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "He knelt… He began to speak… He crushed… He scattered" across a dozen beats. "Submerged concord" and "narrow vastness" are repeated as incantations without evolving meaning, and phrases like "fertilize the earth" and "after the reef dies" recur without added pressure. Figurative language is dense but static—"thin finger of stone," "battlefield was being erased, blade by blade"—without pattern-teaching or payoff. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same action or theme. Penalize −0.8 for loops and template runs, −0.4 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats, totaling −1.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—a coachman speaking dead languages to restore a battlefield via seeds and bird guidance—combines mythic elements in a fresh frame, and "submerged concord" offers a non-obvious thematic anchor. However, execution leans on stock pastoral imagery (blooming jetty, twilight, birds as messengers) and the emotional arc is absent, reducing the synthesis to atmospheric tableau. The transformation test fails: swap the coachman for any ritualistic figure and the plot holds unchanged. No bold risk elevates stakes; the piece plays it safe within the lyric-fantasy register.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The coachman is present throughout and his actions (speaking, planting, blessing) structure the beats, but he makes no decisions that alter tactics or narrow options. His role is functional—he executes a predetermined plan without friction or cost. Setup and development gates are met, but closure participation is passive (he departs satisfied). Cap at 4.6 for missing closure agency; deduct −0.8 for observation-only beats and −0.6 for swappability (any ritualistic figure could perform these actions). Final score: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The seed pods appear early ("carried a collection"), are handled mid-story (crushed, mixed, scattered), and are declared empty near the end ("collection… was gone, but its purpose was fulfilled"). Three beats present, but the pods do not constrain a choice or bear a visible cost—they are a prop for the ritual. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage (mention only) +0.3. Deduct −0.5 for ornamental use (description without tactical pressure) and −0.4 for swappability (any seed container works). Final score: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Submerged concord" is named five times but functions as thematic echo rather than stake or tactic. It does not shape an on-page choice or alter the coachman's options; instead, it is asserted as an ambient harmony. Setup gate met (introduced early); development and closure gates met only as repeated label, not causal agent. Early signal +0.4, closure mention +0.3. Deduct −0.8 for label-only use across all appearances. Final score: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The coachman's ability to speak dead languages is mentioned repeatedly ("speaks dead languages," "dead-language murmurs," "spoke one last phrase") but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. The trait is atmospheric flavor; the birds respond to his speech, but the mechanism and its limits are never tested. Setup and development gates met; closure participation nominal (a final blessing). Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two distinct uses) +0.9. Deduct −0.8 for label-only trait (no tradeoff or friction) and −0.5 for swappability (generic ritual speech). Final score: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The action "fertilize" appears in motivation, execution (crushing seeds, mixing compost, enriching soil), and reflection ("Fertilize the wounds of the earth"). It structures the plot and is essential to the premise. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables restoration) +0.8, closure linkage (named in final third) +0.7. Deduct −0.5 for summary-only treatment (the work is described, not dramatized with tactical friction). Specificity moderate; the act is integral but does not impose visible cost. Final score: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"By understanding bird calls" is the stated method, signaled early and used twice (birds guide him to soil patches, then sing him away). The mechanics are vague—how does he decode calls?—and the method does not face a test or bear a cost. Setup and development gates met; closure participation weak (birds sing as backdrop). Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two uses) +0.9. Deduct −0.7 for summary-only (told rather than shown in action) and −0.4 for swappability (generic nature-communion). Final score: 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight anchors every scene and supplies the glowing flowers that charge the final image. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The setting is vivid and atmospheric but does not constrain a choice—the coachman's task proceeds without spatial friction. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (flowers in final line) +1.0. Deduct −0.6 for postcard description (no tactical pressure) and −0.4 for moderate swappability (any liminal natural space fits). Final score: 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the reef dies" frames the world-state and is repeated four times, establishing context but not tightening decisions. The timeframe is backdrop rather than clock; no urgency or deadline alters the coachman's tactics. Setup and development gates met (context established, used mid-story); closure participation nominal (repeated as reflection). Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two mentions) +0.9. Deduct −0.8 for vague/untracked time (no tactical pressure) and −0.6 for ornamental use. Final score: 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to let a garden reclaim a battlefield" is stated early, drives the plot (planting seeds), and is named at closure ("his motivation… was unfolding"). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized with internal conflict or cost. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (shapes all actions) +1.0, closure linkage +0.9. Deduct −0.8 for told-only (no friction between want and obstacle) and −0.5 for moderate swappability (generic restoration goal). Final score: 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Narrow vastness" is named six times and functions as tonal anchor—solitary figure against immense forces. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (from "gloom" to "light in the dark") but remains static lyricism without rhythmic shift under pressure. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8. Deduct −0.7 for single static mood (no modulation with escalation) and −0.4 for label repetition without evolving charge. Final score: 4.7.</comment>
