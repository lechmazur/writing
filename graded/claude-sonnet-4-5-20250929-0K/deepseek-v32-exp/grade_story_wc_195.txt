<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Sir Alaric's interiority relies heavily on abstract mystical language ("capture the shape of possibility," "serve the unseen") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. His motivation is declared repeatedly but never tested by a competing want or fear that would force a difficult trade-off. The "murmured allegiance" and "shivering bliss" read as labels rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation ("no longer felt withdrawn") is asserted without prior causality showing what specific cost or renunciation earned the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Alaric is and what the orchard's rules are remain vague past the opening third, though spatial anchors (greenhouse, bench, trees) appear early enough to avoid a full penalty. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through layered mystical imagery, but the closure unit is weak: the orb of possibility materializes without on-page cost or a choice that forecloses a path; the program crumbles conveniently, and Alaric's doubt "unsnaps" via assertion rather than dramatized renunciation. No meaningful escalation tightens options—each beat adds texture but does not narrow tactics or raise stakes. The "capture" succeeds on first attempt with no friction, and the final image reconfigures little beyond restating the premise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (luminescent fruits, silver branches, shimmering air) that reflects the mystical tone. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the greenhouse does not constrain Alaric's choices or supply resources that alter his approach—he moves freely, the program is simply found, and the orchard's "approval" at the end is passive. The spatial choreography is coherent, and the void overhead and endless night anchor the atmosphere, but the environment does not pressure the outcome. The program and orb are handled on the page, which provides some micro-setting function, but neither object's physical properties shape a tactic under stress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing possibility—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Alaric's single attempt succeeds without reversal, friction, or a trade-off; no on-page tightening narrows his options or forces a choice between competing goods. The "snap" he feels is internal and asserted, not earned by prior dramatized pressure. The program and orchard cooperate passively; coincidence (finding the program, the orchard's instant bloom) enables resolution rather than complicating it. No persistent constraint shapes his tactics, and the final success carries no visible price—he gains the orb and a new purpose with no path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring images (forgotten patterns, marionette strings, shifting reality) but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "murmured allegiance echoed...a promise to the unknown" and "embracing the shivering bliss of a world remade" state the thesis rather than embodying it in a non-literal image. The piece leans toward abstraction ("possibilities like fruit," "weave of fate") without grounding insights in specific, costly experience. The orb at the end offers a literal visual of the premise rather than a resonant reweighting that invites reflection. Subtext is thin; gestures and silences do not carry implication, and the final "approval" of the orchard reads as convenient affirmation rather than earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the prose maintains a consistent mystical register. However, diction frequently drifts into abstract, elevated language that feels imposed rather than character-particular: "factually mystical," "murmured allegiance," "shivering bliss" recur as labels without perceptual specificity. Alaric's way of noticing is generic—he observes symbols, traces patterns, and whispers affirmations, but his syntax and rhythm do not degrade or shift under the supposed pressure of transformation. The voice reads as narrated atmosphere rather than filtered through a distinct mind. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear frequently but do not muddy clarity; the larger issue is that the prose does not vary texture or cadence to reflect Alaric's internal state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "murmured allegiance" appears six times, "shivering bliss" four times, "capture the shape of possibility" three times, and "factually mystical" twice, often in identical syntactic slots without added pressure or reweighting. Template cadence runs through the middle: "He [verb], [result]" structures repeat across eight consecutive sentences. Stock metaphors ("flame in the endless night," "door deep within his soul") and elevated diction ("crystallized maybe," "swirling visions of what might be") cluster in peak beats without embodiment. Information density is low—many sentences restate prior content (e.g., the program's purpose is asserted four times). The final paragraph recycles all key phrases, reading as a thematic checklist rather than propulsion. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.4 for loops, template cadence, and stock phrasing that touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—mystical knight in an alchemical orchard—combines familiar fantasy tropes (withdrawn warrior, magical greenhouse, marionette fate imagery) without transformation through specific detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The emotional arc (doubt → bliss) follows a template path with no friction or irony. The program and orb function as convenient mystical props that could be swapped for any artifact-of-power without altering the logic. The final image (glowing orb, approving orchard) is literal wish-fulfillment rather than a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece executes a median fantasy quest-for-enlightenment without fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Alaric is present throughout and his goal (capture possibility) frames the story. However, he makes no key choices—he finds the program, reads it, traces a pattern, and wills the orb into being without opposition or trade-off. His "withdrawn" nature is told in the opening but does not constrain a single on-page action; observation dominates over decision. The final shift ("no longer felt withdrawn") is asserted, not earned by a choice that alters tactics. Present by setup, involved in multiple beats, but swappable with any seeker-protagonist; no specific cost tied to his withdrawal. Band: functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The program appears early (first third), is handled in three beats (found, read/traced, crumbles), and its diagrams "glow" to enable the final act. However, its function is passive—it provides symbolic permission rather than constraining Alaric's approach or forcing a choice. The crumbling at the end is convenient closure rather than a reweighted return with cost. The "forgotten patterns" within it are described but never detailed or tested; Alaric succeeds on first use. Present across setup, development, and payoff; involved in the climax; but the mechanics are vague and easily swappable with any instructional artifact. Specific properties (marionette strings, diagrams) are mentioned but do not narrow options. Band: shapes one key turn but remains somewhat replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The phrase "murmured allegiance" appears six times but functions only as atmospheric repetition. Alaric whispers "I serve the unseen" once and the phrase recurs in narration, but no stakes or tactics depend on allegiance—he acts alone with no entity to pledge to, no conflicting loyalty, and no cost for breaking faith. The concept is label-only, never dramatized as a choice or constraint. Present in multiple beats but purely ornamental; removing it would change nothing. Band: present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" appears twice as a descriptor for the light and the orb but does not constrain or enable any action. The trait is a stylistic label without mechanical consequence—nothing in the story turns on the difference between "mystical" and "factually mystical." No cost, no tactic shaped by this attribute. Band: present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unsnap" is used three times: Alaric unsnaps his vambrace (a literal mechanical act), then "felt a snap" internally, then "unsnapped the last of his doubts" metaphorically. The vambrace removal enables direct touch of the program (one functional beat), but the internal "unsnap" is asserted rather than causal—no prior pressure makes the snap necessary, and the final metaphorical use is summary. Present in setup and climax, but the key turn (internal release) is told, not shown, and easily swappable with any synonym for "release" or "break free." Band: functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through forgotten patterns" appears in the opening and twice more as a method descriptor. The program contains patterns (marionette strings), and Alaric traces one to achieve his goal, but the mechanics are never detailed—what makes a pattern "forgotten," how he learns to read them, or what risk attends their use is not shown. The method is signaled early but remains abstract; it does not shape failed attempts or force a trade-off. Present in setup and payoff, involved in the climax, but the process is vague and swappable with "ancient ritual" or "arcane knowledge." Band: functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse is anchored early with vivid detail (glass panes, void overhead, luminescent fruits, silver branches) and remains the sole location throughout. The "endless night" and "shifting reality" create atmosphere but do not pressure Alaric's choices—he moves freely, the orchard provides resources (program, fruits) without friction, and the environment cooperates (trees bloom, air hums approval). Spatial choreography is coherent. The setting is essential to tone and present in all three gates, but it does not constrain tactics or force a difficult choice; the orchard is backdrop and enabler rather than obstacle. The fruits as "crystallized maybe or never-was" are described but not used as resources that alter outcome. Band: shapes tone and is present across beats, but does not meaningfully pressure the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"As reality shifts" appears in the opening and is invoked three more times ("reality shifted," "shifting reality") but time remains untracked and pressure-free. No clock tightens Alaric's decisions; the sequence feels like a single uninterrupted attempt with no duration or urgency. The "shifts" are atmospheric description, not mechanical constraint—nothing accelerates, no window closes, no cost accrues from delay. Present but ornamental; removing the timeframe phrase would not alter the plot. Band: present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Alaric's goal—"to capture the shape of possibility"—is stated four times and frames the story. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted: no competing want (safety, rest, return to court) tests his commitment, and no cost (exhaustion, risk of madness, loss of something tangible) accompanies pursuit. He succeeds on first attempt with no friction. The motivation is present in setup, middle, and payoff, but it functions as a plot label rather than a lived desire with friction between want and cost. Band: functional but told-only, not dramatized through trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Shivering bliss" appears four times, always as a label for Alaric's final emotional state. The tone in the opening and middle is mystical and contemplative, not blissful; the "shivering" coldness is mentioned once early (the program feels cold) but not developed as a tonal throughline. At the climax, "shivering bliss" is asserted three times in quick succession without embodied sensation or modulation—it reads as a mood overlay rather than a coherent tonal charge. The tone does not modulate with pressure (no shift from doubt to cost to release); instead it shifts abruptly from neutral to declared bliss. Present in the final image but static and asserted. Band: functional but label-only, not modulated or charged through turns.</comment>
