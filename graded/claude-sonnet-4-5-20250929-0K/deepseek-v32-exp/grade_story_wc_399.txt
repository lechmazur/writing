<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to preserve wisdom is declared but never tested against a competing desire or cost. His "strangely honest" trait appears as a label repeated six times without constraining a single choice or creating friction. The mask removal near the end gestures at interiority but lands as tableau rather than earned shift. No contradiction between impulse and action; he simply executes his stated goal without obstacle or price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a quest (preserve echoes) that proceeds through a sequence of contemplative actions—sensing, conjuring, consecrating—without reversal, complication, or cost. The kinetic parapet rises and settles on cue; seekers arrive in summary. No decision narrows options or changes knowledge under pressure; the protagonist's work succeeds exactly as intended. The ending summarizes legacy rather than landing a closure image with felt cost, reading as thematic assertion rather than Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion, dunes, and kinetic parapet are named and described but remain abstract backdrops. "Warm stone" is the sole tactile anchor; no spatial choreography tracks Kael's movement or proximity. The parapet's emergence and positioning are told rather than shown through sensory detail or obstacle. Atmosphere is asserted ("whisperfield calm") rather than built from perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving echoes—is signaled early but faces no opposition, resource limit, or ticking clock. Kael senses, envisions, speaks, and succeeds; the parapet cooperates, the clearing solidifies, seekers validate. No reversal, trade-off, or moment where success is uncertain. The ending reports outcomes rather than dramatizing a tightening that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of preservation and stewardship emerges clearly from the premise but is stated rather than tested. "Strangely honest" and "echo of wisdom" repeat as labels without embodied contradiction or cost. The final paragraphs summarize the theme ("truth is the foundation of preservation") instead of offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. No friction between preservation and loss dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited perspective remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but elevated and abstract ("whisperfield calm," "kinetic parapet," "peripheral awareness") without grounding in Kael's personal idiom or perceptual bias. Sentence stems repeat: "Through peripheral awareness" appears five times, "The [noun] [past tense verb]" patterns dominate. No dialogue; no embodied thought under pressure. Voice reads as narrated outline rather than inhabited consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "Through peripheral awareness, he…" recurs five times; "The [noun] [verb]" opens a dozen lines. Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third ("continued," "ensured," "remained," "became"). Stock metaphors ("living truths," "fabric of the consecrated clearings") appear without fresh grounding. The piece summarizes rather than shows pivotal acts (conjuring, consecration). Repetitive stems and synonym churn ("echo of wisdom" x9, "whisperfield calm" x4, "strangely honest" x3) dull momentum. Artifacts touch closure, triggering the Q7 cap and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The fantasy quest to preserve mystical wisdom follows a familiar template without transformation. Kael succeeds without friction; no character limitation, world constraint, or moral calculus complicates his task. The mystical terminology (line walker, whisperfield, kinetic parapet) decorates rather than generates fresh Stakes or closure. The ending delivers expected validation rather than a non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Kael, the half-masked line walker, is named early and performs actions (sensing, conjuring, consecrating) but makes no choice that narrows options or costs him a competing goal. He removes his mask briefly in a static gesture. Present across beats but passive executor of an unopposed plan.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet is introduced early (paragraph 5), rises mid-story, and settles at the end, appearing in three beats. However, it cooperates without resistance; Kael does not manipulate it or trade anything to harness it. It enhances rather than constrains. Functional but largely ornamental, swappable with any responsive magical structure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Conjured clearings are named early and recur (paragraphs 7, 11, 17, 24, 30, 34). Kael envisions and consecrates one; seekers later find it. The concept frames the goal but does not shape a tactical choice or create friction. Present but replaceable with "sanctuary" or "sacred space" without altering logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" appears six times as a label (paragraphs 3, 9, 16, 27, 36) but never constrains an action or forces a trade-off. It is asserted as parallel to the prophet's honesty, not dramatized. Ornamental attribute with no causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Consecration is named in the title and performed mid-story (paragraphs 10, 15, 16, 30). Kael speaks words of dedication and infuses the space with purpose, but the act succeeds without cost or complication. Present in two beats but swappable with "bless" or "sanctify." Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through peripheral awareness" appears in seven paragraphs (4, 8, 12, 19, 25, 29, 35), framing Kael's sensing and monitoring. The method is signaled early but remains abstract; no scene shows what peripheral awareness enables that direct attention would not. Present across beats but mechanically inserted, not shaping a tactic or revealing a limitation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion is named in the opening line and recurs in nine paragraphs. It houses the action and holds the preserved echoes, serving as the spatial anchor and final symbol. However, it does not constrain movement or supply a resource that alters a choice. Present at setup, middle, and closure, but largely a static container.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the prophet arrived" is named in the opening and closing lines (paragraphs 1, 32) and referenced twice more (9, 23). The timeframe sets context but does not tighten decisions; no urgency or countdown. The prophet's departure is not tracked. Static backdrop rather than pressure device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation "to preserve the echo of wisdom" is stated early (paragraph 3) and drives the sequence of actions. However, it is never tested against a competing want or obstacle. He pursues it without friction, and the ending confirms success. Told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Whisperfield calm" appears in the opening line and recurs in six paragraphs (1, 14, 19, 26, 27, 36). The tone is asserted and remains static; no modulation with pressure or tightening at closure. The phrase charges the final image by repetition but does not shift meaning. Present at setup and closure; coherent but unvaried.</comment>
