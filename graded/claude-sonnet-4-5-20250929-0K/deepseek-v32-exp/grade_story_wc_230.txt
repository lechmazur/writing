<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (psychological safety from involuntary truth) is clear and her foraging profession is established, but her interior life remains largely declarative rather than embodied. The ritual sequence shows deliberate choice under risk, earning the piece's lone meaningful micro-choice. Internal contradiction is absent; her rationality remains unchallenged by impulse or fear in dramatized form. The final stance—calm after occlusion—reads as achieved without visible struggle in the ending beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates world detail and backstory toward a ritual closure; the glass-eye charging and ritual constitute an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the occlusion creates a new barrier, forecloses involuntary speech, and the cost—unknown but stated—is felt). Orientation is clear by paragraph one. The causality is thin: Elara waits, performs, succeeds without complication or reversal. No meaningful escalation tightens options; the storm peak arrival feels convenient rather than motivated by her agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hanging orchard, ravine, and storm are vividly rendered and return at closure to anchor her "hard-won tranquility." The glass eye's physical presence (cold, heavy, charged, then dull) tracks clearly across beats. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the lightning is awaited passively and arrives on cue. Sensory detail (truffle scent, storm lashing) is present but not POV-prioritized under stress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (mute the compulsion) is signaled early. The piece offers no on-page reversal or complication; Elara calculates risk, waits, performs, succeeds. The ritual's success is declared rather than tested. Agency is present in the decision to charge and use the eye, but no live option is foreclosed with visible cost at the ending—she simply gains control. The unknown cost is mentioned but not dramatized or felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme (fractured grace, refuge built from discredited knowledge) emerges through image and action rather than statement. The final image—orchard, truffle, calm—reconfigures prior storm imagery with quiet resonance. However, "fractured grace" is repeated as a label three times, and the closing lines drift toward thematic summary ("she had found a way to live truthfully, on her own terms") rather than letting the image hold the weight. The piece resists false equivalence but edges toward affirming the lone rational actor without complication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is present but generic (rational, logical). Diction remains within Elara's register but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—syntax is uniform across calm and high-stakes beats. Filter verbs ("felt," "looked") appear frequently without voice motivation. The ritual beat uses elevated diction ("searing bolt," "surge of power," "blessed barrier") that reads slightly elevated but not jarring. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "involuntarily truthful" / "compulsion to speak only truth" / "involuntary words"; "smuggled" appears three times in identical construction; "fractured" recurs five times across "fractured state," "fractured grace" (twice), "fractured the world," "fractured grace" again. Template cadence in the final third: "The antique glass eye..." / "Elara, the rational..." / "The hanging orchard..." sentences stack identical subject-verb openings. Synonym churn: "occlude" / "occlusion" / "occlude" across three paragraphs. These artifacts cluster in the closure third, triggering the Q7 artifact cap and global 9+ disqualification. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate world premise rather than advance scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The empathy-virus premise and glass-eye ritual combine world-building tropes (post-plague refuge, magical object, lone forager) without a fresh synthesis. The involuntary-truth compulsion is an interesting constraint but remains largely told rather than tested in scene—no moment where her honesty creates friction or cost on the page. The orchard and ravine are vivid but static. The ending recapitulates the premise (she's safe now) without reweighting prior material through a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout; her profession (truffle foraging) frames the opening and closing but does not constrain a key choice. Her rationality is stated repeatedly but not tested by impulse or error. The ritual decision is the lone choice, shaped more by desperation than foraging expertise. Present in closure (she plans "her next foraging route") but the mention is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glass eye appears in at least four beats: smuggled past borders, placed on table, charged in copper cradle, pressed to forehead, then dull and inert at closure. It drives the ritual turn and is causally necessary—without it, no occlusion occurs. However, its mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized (the charging and ritual happen in two sentences), and the cost it exacts remains vague ("unknown"). Strong setup, clear payoff, but the middle beats are told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The smuggled-relic concept is present (glass eye smuggled across quarantine borders) and motivates the high-stakes gambit. It shapes one key turn (the decision to use it) but does not constrain tactics or choices in earlier beats—Elara already possesses it when the story opens. Swappable with "stolen" or "inherited" without deep structural change. Mentioned in closure but only as backstory summary.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness is established as Elara's affliction and motivates her search for occlusion, but it is never demonstrated on the page—no scene shows her unable to lie or her honesty creating friction. It remains label-only across all beats. The ritual's success mutes the compulsion, but we never see the "before" cost dramatized, so the "after" relief lacks contrast. Present in motivation, absent in action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Occlude" is the story's central action: her goal is to occlude the viral compulsion, and the glass-eye ritual achieves it. The word and concept appear in at least four beats, frame the dominant stake, and the ending hinges on occlusion's success. However, the ritual itself is summarized in two lines ("pressed it to her forehead while reciting words...a wave of static silence"), so the how and struggle are elided. Essential to closure, but the execution is told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Discredited textbooks are established early (Elara "cross-referencing fragmented chapters," "decaying text," "discredited pages") and provide the ritual's method. They shape her approach and reappear at closure ("discredited textbooks lay open...testament to abandoned ideas"). However, the mechanics are vague—no specific passage or instruction is dramatized, so the method feels generic. Present across three zones but lacks causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The hanging orchard and ravine anchor every beat: opening, middle (hut within the orchard), ritual (cliff face above), and closure (orchard standing resilient). The storms batter continuously, creating atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—the lightning Elara needs simply arrives when she waits. The orchard functions more as symbol (resilience, refuge) than tactical pressure. Vivid but passive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The empathy-virus timeframe is established (post-plague, quarantine borders, humanity rewired) and motivates Elara's isolation. It provides world context but does not create a ticking clock or tighten a choice—the storms are ongoing, not imminent. The "after" is static backdrop rather than dynamic pressure. Mentioned at opening and closure but does not shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Psychological safety is Elara's stated goal (paragraph one: "sought to cultivate psychological safety...a sanctuary where thought and feeling could exist") and the ending declares its partial achievement ("felt a semblance of safety take root"). It drives her isolation and ritual gambit. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized—no scene shows her testing or compromising safety. Present across setup, middle rationale, and closure claim, but the friction between desire and cost is summarized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Fractured grace" is named three times and anchors the tone: broken peace, resilience amid ruin, beauty in compromise. The prose modulates between storm-battered urgency and quiet reflection, and the ending image (orchard roots holding fast) embodies the phrase. However, the label is repeated rather than embodied through rhythm or image alone, and the final third's stacked declarations flatten the tone's charge. Present and coherent but relies on repetition rather than tonal control.</comment>
