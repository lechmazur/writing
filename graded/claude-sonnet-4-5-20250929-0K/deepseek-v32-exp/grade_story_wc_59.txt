<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The prince's motivation is declared early but never tested by a meaningful internal contradiction or choice under pressure. His "bedraggled appearance" and "trembling resolve" are asserted labels without embodied hesitation or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final moment—watching the ghostly bird emerge—reads as passive witnessing rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority consists largely of abstract hypothesizing ("flawed genesis," "pure organic beauty") rather than character-particular perception or conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. The piece establishes a causal chain—discover egg, theorize its potential, assemble device, activate—but the escalation is mechanical: each step succeeds without meaningful reversal or cost that narrows options. The closure unit presents a Decisive Change (bird emerges, sings, reawakens beauty), yet the cost remains abstract ("could not last forever") rather than a specific forfeiture or trade-off legible on the page. The inferred lens is Causal, but linkage is thin; success feels predetermined rather than earned through prior struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The suspended palace anchored to stalactites is vivid and recurs across beats (opening, quaking reverie, final sigh), lending spatial coherence. Sensory detail—dripping stalactites, whir of engines, hiss of steam—grounds the mechanical world. However, the setting remains largely decorative: the palace sways and groans atmospherically but does not constrain the prince's assembly work or alter his tactics. The moss and dew from stalactites are incorporated into the device, a functional touch that lifts the score modestly, but the ending's environmental detail (stalactites "gleaming with moisture") does not charge the closure choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reawaken beauty—is signaled early and remains consistent, but pressure never tightens meaningfully. The assembly proceeds without obstacle, failed attempt, or trade-off; each connection is "a test of his faith" in summary only, never dramatized as a live dilemma. The egg cracks and the bird emerges as a linear success, with no on-page reversal or agency-driven choice that forecloses an alternative path. The stated cost ("bitterly sweet," "could not last forever") is conceptual rather than a visible price paid in the moment. Under a Causal lens, escalation is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—beauty versus sterility, flawed genesis allowing change—emerges from recurring images (egg, stalactites, mechanical world) rather than overt statement, a positive. The egg's dual symbolism (hope and irreversible loss) and the ghostly, impermanent bird hint at complexity. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly ("he found that beauty could be reborn," "a world that was now a little less mechanical"), replacing earned resonance with a tidy summary. The "flawed genesis" concept is invoked repeatedly but functions as an abstraction rather than a lived tension that the prince navigates through specific choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the flawed genesis," "quaking reverie") that sits uneasily alongside concrete action. Perceptual signature is weak: the prince's noticing lacks character-specific bias, reading more like neutral narration. No dialogue is present, so subtext and voice distinction are not tested. The prose modulates appropriately at the climax (shorter sentences, increased urgency), but the recurring phrases ("bitterly sweet," "hypothesizing about everything") feel like template anchors rather than organic voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym chains weaken line-level craft: "His motivation was simple yet immense" → "a lonely crusade"; "The egg felt bitterly sweet" recurs without added pressure; "hypothesizing about everything" appears four times with slight variations. Template cadence is pervasive: "He hypothesized that…," "He knew he must…," "He began to…" across adjacent lines. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") stack in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. Figurative language is generic ("spark of pure, organic beauty," "cut through the mechanical noise"). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("The prince, no longer bedraggled but radiant"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—lone inventor seeking to revive lost beauty in a mechanical world—is a recognizable template (steampunk aesthetic, extinct species as MacGuffin, symbolic rebirth). The suspended palace and stalactite anchors offer a fresh spatial detail, but the emotional arc and conflict structure follow a predictable path without transformation. The ghostly, impermanent bird is a stronger choice than full restoration, hinting at earned ambiguity, yet the final paragraph retreats into affirmation ("succeeded in his quest," "reawakened a spark") that flattens complexity. No single turn or synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight; the story assembles familiar parts without a non-obvious angle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The bedraggled prince is introduced immediately and remains on-page throughout, satisfying setup and development. His decisions—hypothesize, assemble, activate—advance the plot, but none narrow options or involve visible trade-offs; he executes a linear plan without complication. At closure, he watches the bird emerge rather than making a final choice that reconfigures stakes. Swappable with "determined inventor" or similar archetype; his specific trait (bedraggled) is mentioned twice but does not constrain action. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The extinct bird's egg appears in the opening ("cradled… in his calloused hands"), is incorporated into the assembly mid-story, and cracks at closure, delivering the ghostly bird—three distinct beats. It drives causality: the prince's entire quest hinges on the egg's "latent potential." However, the egg's properties remain abstract ("spark of pure, organic beauty") rather than specific constraints that alter tactics. Closure linkage is strong, but the egg could be swapped for another relic without fundamental story change. Two gates plus closure participation, with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "flawed genesis" concept is named mid-story and repeated three times as thematic commentary ("creation was inherently imperfect," "nothing was ever complete or perfect"). It does not shape on-page tactics, constrain choices, or alter the assembly process; it functions as philosophical abstraction rather than dramatized principle. Absent at closure. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Bitterly sweet" is attributed to the egg twice and to the bird's beauty once, always as a summary label rather than an embodied tradeoff. No on-page action demonstrates a choice between competing goods or a visible cost tied to sweetness and bitterness. The attribute is told, not shown. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Assemble" is signaled early ("he must assemble a device"), occupies the middle third with concrete steps (connecting wires, incorporating organic elements), and culminates in activation at closure. The assembly is the central action that enables the ending; removing it would collapse the plot. However, the process is linear and obstacle-free; no failed assembly or mid-course correction adds pressure. Two beats plus closure participation, strong causal linkage, but limited cost. Essential across beats but not indispensable due to lack of complication.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Hypothesizing about everything" is introduced early and recurs three times, framing the prince's approach. It leads him to the "flawed genesis" concept and the decision to incorporate organic elements, shaping one choice. However, the method itself is never dramatized—no on-page scene of hypothesis-testing, failed theory, or epistemic friction. The phrase functions as a character label rather than a tactical constraint. Functional in one beat but replaceable with "research" or "study."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The suspended palace anchored to stalactites is introduced immediately, recurs in atmospheric beats (quaking, groaning, swaying, sighing), and supplies organic elements (moss, dew) for the device—satisfying setup, development, and closure presence. Spatial detail is vivid. However, the setting does not constrain choices or pressure tactics; the prince's work proceeds identically whether the palace quakes or remains still. The stalactites' contribution (moss/dew) is a single functional touch. Present across beats with one causal role; not essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Through the discovery" as a timeframe is vague and untracked. The story moves from possession of the egg to activation without clock pressure, intermediate deadlines, or time-driven escalation. "Years" of prior work are summarized but do not constrain present action. The assembly is described as "painfully slow," yet no ticking constraint shapes tactics. Time is present as background duration but does not tighten decisions. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To reawaken beauty in a mechanical world" is stated early as the prince's motivation and recurs explicitly ("his motivation," "his quest"). It drives the entire action sequence (assemble device, activate egg). However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction between desire and cost on the page. The ending affirms success ("motivation fulfilled") without testing commitment against a competing need. One dominant stake across all beats and closure, but told more than shown through choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" is named once mid-story and echoed in the palace's physical quaking (opening, intensification, settling at closure). Tone is consistent—dreamlike, melancholic, hopeful—and modulates appropriately (anticipation and fear build, peace settles). The phrase itself is abstract and does not constrain perception or rhythm in a character-specific way. The tone supports the ending's bittersweet resonance without sharpening it. Present across structure with closure participation, but could be swapped for "trembling meditation" or similar without impact. Functional but replaceable.</comment>
