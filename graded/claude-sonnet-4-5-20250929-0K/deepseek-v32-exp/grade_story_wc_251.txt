<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("plant forests of second thoughts") but never tested by genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Her choices feel illustrative rather than character-driven—organizing displays, retrieving the chess set—without visible cost or trade-offs. Interiority relies on abstract phrases ("unspoken words," "tapestry of unease") instead of embodied, particular emotion. The ending grants success without dramatizing struggle or renunciation, leaving her arc static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The orientation is vague through the opening third: "cobalt library," "perpetual mist," and "hush where past meets prophecy" remain atmospheric labels without clear spatial or temporal grounding (−0.4 per Orientation Test). The story presents a sequence of actions (pacing, retrieving, organizing, watching) linked by "and then" rather than "because/therefore," failing causal escalation. Closure claims success ("forests of second thoughts grew deep") but this outcome is told, not shown with on-page cost or a decisive change. No legible closure unit (DC/RR/CR) lands; the final paragraph summarizes aftermath rather than crystallizing a moment with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "cobalt library" and "magnetic grotto" are vivid in description but function as postcard backdrops rather than constraining choice. Spatial choreography is clean (library aisles, side door, stone path, grotto, window) and the lodestone properties are mentioned, but the setting never pressures a tactic or alters an outcome. The mist and starlight remain decorative. Micro-setting potential (the lodestone king) appears but is not leveraged to charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("awaken doubt, not violence") is declared early but never faces on-page opposition or complication. Elara retrieves the chess set and organizes the displays without friction, reversals, or visible cost. The guard's "posture softening" and people "questioning laws" are told outcomes, not dramatized pressure. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the rebellion succeeds off-page in summary paragraphs. Escalation is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme of planting doubt emerges through repeated images (seeds, forests, second thoughts) but is stated rather than dramatized. "Forests of second thoughts began to sprout" and "legacy was not in winning, but in teaching others how to think" are direct thematic declarations that replace scene pressure. The lodestone and window displays accumulate symbolic weight but do not reweight prior material with cost at closure. Final-paragraph moralizing ("fulfilled not by force, but by gentle persuasion") deflates resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with clean focalization through Elara. However, perceptual signature is generic: "unspoken words," "amplified quiet," and "tapestry of unease" recur as placeholder phrases rather than character-specific idiom. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("repository," "sanctuary," "collective imagination") that doesn't align with a chess coach's practical lens. The brief dialogue ("Remember, this is about awakening doubt, not inciting violence") is functional but flat, lacking subtext or natural rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops pervade: "unspoken words" appears seven times, "amplified quiet" four times, "forests of second thoughts" three times, creating synonym churn without added pressure. Template cadence runs through multiple paragraphs ("She could hear… She moved… She entered… She reached… She held"). Stock metaphors ("protective shroud," "tapestry of unease") and filter-verb stacks ("could hear," "seemed to seep," "began to sprout") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch multiple beats, triggering cumulative deductions (−1.4) and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise—silent rebellion via synchronized window displays—offers a mildly fresh angle, but execution remains abstract and template-driven. The "humble rebellion" and "awakening doubt" frame feels derivative of common workshop prompts without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The chess-coach angle and magnetic grotto add flavor but don't deepen the stakes or alter the predictable arc. Emotional beats follow generic templates (determined volunteers, baffled Council, smiling protagonist) without risk or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as chess coach frames metaphors ("foreseeing moves," "think three moves ahead"), but her choices are illustrative rather than causal. She retrieves, arranges, and watches; none of these acts narrow options or generate cost. The character is functional but swappable with any dedicated organizer. Late-paragraph mentions of teaching children do not reshape the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto appears in two distinct beats (retrieval, final reflection) and its lodestone properties are noted, but the "amplify intentions" mechanic never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The grotto remains a backdrop for retrieval rather than a pressure point. Closure participation is ornamental (mentioned in summary paragraphs) rather than causally active. Early signal and spaced touches raise the score, but swappability and lack of cost limit it to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Humble rebellion" is declared and illustrated through the window displays and the Council's bafflement, appearing across setup, middle, and ending. However, it functions as thematic label rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics—Elara's actions face no opposition or trade-off. The concept is present in all three gates but remains abstract, not generating visible cost or narrowing options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Hears unspoken words" is mentioned repeatedly (children's fears, town's astonishment, hope) but functions as narrative flavor rather than enabling or constraining action. Elara never makes a choice based on what she hears, nor does the ability impose cost or friction. The attribute is label-only, present but ornamental, never driving a beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Cradle" appears twice (the lodestone king in the grotto, then the queen in the final reflection) and is tied to the rebellion's symbolic heart. The action frames ritual and resolve but does not generate a turn or alter options—Elara cradles, feels weight, then proceeds unchanged. The reprise reweights meaning slightly (king to queen suggests progression) but lacks felt cost. Early signal and lyric return place it in mid-band, but swappability and lack of causal pressure prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The synchronized window displays are signaled early ("organizing synchronized window displays across town"), prepared in the middle (arranging lenses, dispersing volunteers), and executed at the climax (windows lighting up, constellation of dissent). The method shapes multiple beats and participates in closure, though the mechanics remain abstract and the outcome is told rather than shown. Early setup, beat involvement, and closure linkage elevate the score, but lack of felt cost and summary execution limit it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The cobalt library is present in setup (opening scene), middle (meeting volunteers), and ending (sanctuary for curious minds). However, it functions as backdrop rather than pressuring choice or supplying resources that alter outcome. The grand window is used for the central display, giving the setting one functional beat, but spatial properties do not constrain tactics. All three gates met, but integration is shallow.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" is invoked twice as atmospheric framing but never functions as a ticking clock or temporal constraint. The story moves through "tonight" to "the next day" to "monthly" without urgency or deadline pressure. Time remains vague and untracked, failing to tighten decisions or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To plant forests of second thoughts" is declared early and repeated across beats ("forests… began to sprout," "grew deep and enduring"). The motivation is told and illustrated but never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—Elara pursues it without friction, doubt, or trade-off. All three gates met (setup, middle, ending) but the desire is abstract rather than tested, placing it in functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" recurs four times and frames the rebellion's paradoxical power, appearing in setup, middle, and ending. However, it functions as poetic label rather than modulating with pressure—the tone remains static and abstract throughout, never charging the final image with felt tension. Present across all gates but ornamental in execution.</comment>
