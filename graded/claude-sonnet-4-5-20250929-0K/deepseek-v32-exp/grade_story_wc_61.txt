<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is signaled early and remains consistent, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract language ("profound unease," "troubling serenity") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to "break the cycle" by encoding the garden into sonar waves arrives without dramatized internal conflict—no competing impulse resists or complicates the decision. Emotions are declared more than inhabited: "profound peace mixed with sorrow" tells rather than enacts the cost of letting the garden fade.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through recurring images (sonar pings, falling petals, the gear) and a pattern of decline is layered across the narrative. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elara encodes the garden's story into sonic echoes, crystallizing a legacy moment where "troubling serenity gave way to hope." Cost is conceptual and felt (the garden fades, an era ends), legible in the final third. Orientation is delayed: "who" is clear early, but "where" (a nebula garden) and "when" (timeframe measured in eons) remain abstract past the 120-word mark, warranting a −0.3 penalty and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (swirling gas, crystallized flora, falling petals of light) and filtered through Elara's sentimental lens. The calculating machine gear and the hidden panel on the floating ark constrain her choices: she must insert the gear to access the stellar-cycle maps, and the sonar data guides her final encoding decision. However, the setting remains largely a backdrop for reflection rather than a live pressure that alters tactics beat-by-beat. The spatial choreography is clean, and the garden's decay charges the final image, pushing the score into mid-6s despite the orientation debt cap from Q2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the garden's light and breaking a generational pattern of decline—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the sonar-mapped fissure and the revelation that each keeper has passed on a weaker garden, but no on-page reversal tests Elara's commitment; she moves from discovery to decision without friction. The climactic choice (encoding the garden into sonar waves) is asserted rather than dramatized through a dilemma or competing option. Cost is conceptual (the garden fades, the cycle may begin again) but remains abstract; no visible tradeoff narrows her tactics or forecloses a live alternative on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: legacy, entropy, and the tension between preservation and transformation. The final image—sonar pings carrying the garden's story into the void, "a gift for futures yet unborn"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, several lines edge toward thematic echo: "troubling serenity—the calm acceptance of an end" and "perpetual whisper in the cosmic dark" feel slightly elevated and authorial. The calculating machine gear and falling petals recur with shifting meaning, but the recurrence is more ornamental than causally charged at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature (cosmic scale, sonar-painted void, sentimentalist's attention to beauty and memory) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("nascent nebulae," "celestial art," "sonic echoes") that reads slightly above the embodied urgency of the moment. Several beats rely on filter verbs and passive constructions ("She realized," "She believed," "Her motivation sharpened") that dull immediacy. The prose has texture, but syntactic patterns repeat (short declarative followed by elaboration) and emotional peaks are asserted rather than enacted through rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose is clear and grammatically clean, but it suffers from template cadence and paraphrase loops. Runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" sentences flatten rhythm across high-pressure beats. Several adjacent lines restate the same idea: "The garden was dying, its light dimming from within" followed immediately by "To share light without using fire meant she could not reignite the fading cores" rehearses the same limitation. Stock phrases ("troubling serenity," "profound peace mixed with sorrow") appear in peak moments without fresh embodiment. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance concept or atmosphere but few do double work, and scaffold lines ("This was the source of the troubling serenity") slow momentum rather than propelling it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—an otherworldly keeper preserving a dying nebula garden through non-combustive means—is evocative but leans on familiar tropes (ancient guardian, cyclical decline, cosmic scale as metaphor). The shift from preservation to dissemination (encoding the garden into sonar waves) offers a modest fresh angle, but the emotional arc and the generational-decline pattern feel well-worn. Specific details (calculating machine gear, sonar pinging as cartography) add texture, yet the story's logic and closure would function unchanged if the setting were a terrestrial archive or a digital repository. No bold structural or perspectival risk distinguishes the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices frame the narrative. She initiates transit, inserts the gear, and decides to encode the garden's story—three on-page decisions. However, the middle decision (inserting the gear) is functional rather than conflicted, and the climactic encoding choice is asserted without dramatized dilemma. The "otherworldly sentimentalist" trait colors perception but does not constrain a tactic or force a tradeoff with visible cost. Setup and closure gates are met; development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The calculating machine gear appears in multiple beats: Elara clutches it, examines its worn teeth, inserts it into the hidden panel, and it spins during the final calculations. It is causally active—unlocking the stellar-cycle maps and aligning with sonar data—and its "brass teeth" and "notch" details root it in the world. However, its meaning does not reweight at closure; it remains a functional tool rather than a charged symbol. All three gates are met with moderate causal pressure, but specificity and cost linkage are thin.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Generational patterns shape the premise and stakes: the garden's decline repeats across millennia, and Elara's realization that "each keeper had passed on a weaker garden" drives her decision to break the cycle. The concept appears early and governs the final action (encoding the pattern for future keepers). It is not merely thematic—it alters Elara's tactics from preservation to dissemination. Setup, development, and closure gates are met, and the concept drives one major turn with moderate cost (the end of an era).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Approximates infinity" is mentioned twice as a reflective label: "The garden's beauty approximated infinity" and "approximating infinity one last time." It describes the garden's scale and the calculating machine's output but does not constrain or enable an on-page action. No cost is tied to the attribute, and removing it would not alter Elara's choices or the closure. Setup and closure gates are met as a thematic accent, but development is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Transit is the primary action: Elara drifts through the garden, initiates movement toward the core, and her "transit became a dissemination" at the climax. The action is continuous and frames all beats, and the shift from physical transit to conceptual dissemination charges the final image. However, the action is not irreplaceable—"journey" or "passage" could substitute with minor edits. Setup, development, and closure gates are met with moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sonar pinging is signaled early ("Her method was sonar pinging") and used in multiple beats: mapping the garden's topography, revealing the fissure, and encoding the garden's story into sonic waves at closure. The method matters—it shapes both discovery and dissemination. However, its mechanics are lightly sketched ("soft clicks that painted the void in echoes"), and the final encoding is asserted rather than dramatized. Setup and closure gates are met; development is functional but thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vivid and present throughout: swirling gas, crystallized flora, falling petals, and the fissure in its core. It supplies the gear's hidden panel and the stellar-cycle maps, both of which enable Elara's choices. The garden's decay is the dominant stake, and its fading light charges the final image. Setup, development, and closure gates are met with strong descriptive texture, but the garden does not impose a live spatial constraint that alters tactics beat-by-beat—it remains more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across the quiet sigh of falling petals" appears as the title phrase and recurs in the final paragraph, bookending the narrative. The timeframe "measured in eons" is abstract and does not tighten decisions; Elara's actions unfold without a ticking clock. The falling petals mark the garden's decline and the end of an era, but they do not pressure Elara's choices in real time. Setup and closure gates are met as a lyric motif, but development (time as constraint) is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"To share light without using fire" is stated early, repeated mid-narrative ("she could not reignite the fading cores"), and drives the climactic encoding decision. The constraint is causal: it rules out violent combustion and forces Elara to transmit essence rather than energy. However, the friction is thin—no competing desire (to reignite despite the prohibition) creates internal conflict. Setup, development, and closure gates are met with moderate cost (accepting the garden's death), but the motivation is more constraint than dramatized want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Troubling serenity is coherent and sustained: the garden's "perfection, knowing it could not last," the "calm acceptance of an end," and the final "profound peace mixed with sorrow." Tone modulates from unease to resignation to hope, reflecting Elara's arc. The oxymoron charges key beats, and the final line ("troubling serenity gave way to hope") reweights it. However, the tone is asserted more than enacted through rhythm and image—many lines tell the mood rather than building it through cadence. Setup and closure gates are met; tonal modulation is present but not deeply embodied.</comment>
