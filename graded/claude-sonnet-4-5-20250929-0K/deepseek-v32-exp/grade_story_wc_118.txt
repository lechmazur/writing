<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian is defined by labels—"odd historian," "sensitively perceptive"—rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation to "collect the stories walls have heard" is declared sacred but never tested by a competing want or cost that would reveal his hierarchy of values. The final "mending the rift in time itself" arrives as assertion rather than earned change, with no visible forfeiture or mistake that foreclosed a path. Interiority remains generic and over-articulate for crisis conditions: "he sensed," "he deduced," "he realized" scaffold every beat without embodied perception or irrational self-deception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Orientation Test passes narrowly—silo library, historian, post-human setting anchored early—but the drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: causal linkage is weak (diary fragments → tapestry code → device activation proceeds by declaration, not because/therefore pressure), and accumulative texture does not deepen or shift cadence to reweight the stake. The closure unit—"he had mended the rift in time itself"—is told rather than shown, with no on-page cost: Elian activates a device, hears stories, and the axis "settles into a new harmony" without visible forfeiture, relational loss, or tactical constraint paid. The "displaced axis" functions as thematic backdrop, not a problem that narrows options or forces a trade-off on the page, leaving no legible before/after in his situation or stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The silo library and fireplace anchor space adequately, and "bronze quiet" recurs to sustain atmosphere. However, the tapestry, diaries, and device remain props described rather than handled with tactile constraint: Elian "traces" the tapestry and "activates" the device without spatial choreography, tool mechanics, or environmental friction that alters his attempts. The ending claims the walls "spoke on" but offers no sensory signature or perceptual shift that charges the final image, leaving setting functional but not deeply integrated with choice or closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to collect the stories walls have heard"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition, scarcity, or a competing good. No on-page reversal tightens options: Elian finds diaries, decodes the tapestry, builds a device, and succeeds sequentially without setback, miscalculation, or visible price. The "displaced axis" is solved off-stage by his invention's activation, with no dramatized cost (stamina, tool failure, moral calculus) that would demonstrate agency under pressure. Escalation reads as summary of discoveries rather than a narrowing tactical bind or deepening stake that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of recovering lost memory and restoring severed consciousness emerges clearly through image and concept. However, key insights—"the tapestry fragment was a map," "the axis displacement had… severed humanity from its capacity to dream"—arrive as direct internal narration rather than through dramatized particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "he had mended the rift in time itself" and "the old ones lived on, etched into the very walls" state the thematic answer rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. The dragons and bronze quiet recur but do not accumulate new pressure or constrain choice, functioning as ornament rather than thematic engine.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and consistent—"bronze quiet," "sensitively perceptive," "profound connection"—but the register is generic literary rather than character-particular, and sentence stems repeat scaffold patterns: "He probed," "He learned," "He understood," "He sat." Elian's perceptual signature is asserted ("sensitively perceptive") but not demonstrated through selective, biased noticing under stress. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction. The prose maintains legibility but lacks the rhythmic modulation and embodied interiority that would distinguish this narrator's mind under pressure from a committee voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The prose suffers from template-cadence runs and paraphrase loops that dull momentum. Repeated sentence stems across multiple lines—"He began to probe," "He read," "He probed deeper," "He learned," "He understood," "He sat"—create a drumbeat rhythm (−0.5). Synonym churn appears in adjacent sentences: "displaced axis" / "axis shift" / "axis displacement" / "axis, once displaced" recur without added nuance (−0.3). Stock phrasing—"pages brittle as autumn leaves," "flickering in the void," "bronze quiet"—replaces concrete, character-specific detail. The final-third repetition of "bronze quiet" and thematic scaffolding ("he had mended the rift") disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—historian recovers lost stories in a post-human silo library using burned diaries and a tapestry code—synthesizes familiar post-apocalyptic and scholar-restorer tropes without a non-obvious inflection. The "displaced axis" cosmology and dragon symbolism read as ornamental rather than irreplaceable drivers of conflict or closure. Emotional beats and narrative turns follow a median arc (discovery → decoding → device → restoration) without bold risk or surprise earned in hindsight. The transformation test fails: swapping "silo library" for "monastery archive" or "dragons" for "stars" would not fundamentally alter the plot or thematic resolution, indicating insufficient specificity to lift the piece above template territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout but his choices do not create key turns. He moves through discovery beats—finding diaries, decoding the tapestry, activating the device—without on-page conflict, error, or tactical shift. Observation and summary dominate; no scene dramatizes a decision that narrows options or alters his approach under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The tapestry appears early (setup gate met) and returns at the ending (payoff gate met), but middle development is thin: it is "traced" once and declared "a map" via internal narration rather than handled across multiple beats with evolving use. The closure unit claims the fragment "glowed softly, its dragons stirring," yet this image is told without causal linkage to Elian's prior actions or a visible cost tied to the object itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The "displaced axis" is mentioned frequently as backstory—skies tearing, stars falling, Earth's tilt changed—but never constrains an on-page choice or shapes Elian's tactics. It functions as thematic label rather than active problem: the ending asserts "the axis… settled into a new harmony" without dramatizing how this shift alters Elian's options, consumes a resource, or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is asserted in the opening line and echoed once ("His sensitively perceptive mind unraveled the code") but never demonstrated through a constrained choice or visible trade-off. No scene shows heightened perception enabling a discovery at the cost of stamina, social friction, or missed alternative, leaving the trait label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Probe" recurs across multiple beats—"probe the library's deepest archive," "probe the fireplace again," "probed deeper, cross-referencing"—and frames the method of discovery (setup and development gates met). The action drives the accumulation of knowledge and appears implicitly in the closure (he "listened" to the device's output, a final probe). However, the verb is easily swappable with "examine" or "search" without structural loss, capping the score in the 5–6 range despite solid beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are discovered early in the fireplace (setup gate met), "pieced together" in the middle beats (development gate met), and held as "sacred texts" in the final image (payoff gate met). They enable the decoding of the tapestry and prime the thematic closure. The method is signaled and its mechanics—charcoal, ash, brittle pages—matter enough to shape attempts, though the diaries themselves do not impose scarcity or error that would elevate causal pressure further.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library anchors location throughout (setup gate met) and is declared "once a missile silo" to add backstory texture. The fireplace within supplies the diaries (development gate met) and the "fireplace's shadow" frames the final image (payoff gate met). However, the setting does not constrain Elian's choices or supply contested resources; it remains a static container for discovery rather than a tactical variable that pressures outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last human dream was dreamt" is established in the opening line (setup gate met) and echoed thematically at closure ("the last human dream had been of this moment"). However, it functions as atmospheric premise rather than live temporal constraint: no ticking clock, seasonal pressure, or deadline tightens Elian's decisions or alters his tactics on the page, leaving the timeframe ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to collect the stories walls have heard" is declared early as "sacred duty" (setup gate met) and restated multiple times, guiding the sequence of probes and culminating in the claim that "he had not just collected stories; he had mended the rift" (payoff gate met). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost: no scene shows Elian sacrificing health, time, or another goal to pursue this collection, leaving friction absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" anchors tone in the opening line, recurs at the midpoint ("In the bronze quiet, his heart beat"), and closes the piece ("In that bronze quiet, he listened"). The phrase modulates subtly—first "empty," then "full of whispered histories"—to charge the final image with a before/after reweighting of the dominant atmosphere. This lyric reprise without mid-scene mechanical use qualifies for the 5.5–6.3 range when the return reweights the stake, and the ending's tonal shift is undeniable despite the lack of causal pressure in other elements.</comment>
