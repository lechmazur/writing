<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly stated ("to translate confusion into clarity") but her interior life remains abstract and label-driven. The phrase "warmly methodical precision" recurs as descriptor rather than constraint; we never see her warm impulse war with methodical habit under pressure. Her arc from confusion to clarity feels declarative—"The fable was no longer one of absence, but of completion"—rather than earned through embodied choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal with accumulative texture: door appears → seal unlocks → rope reconfiguration → void stabilizes. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (absence filled, diplomat completes his signature), and cost is implied in the permanence of the bridged years. However, the cost remains conceptual and distant; we do not see what Elara forfeits or how her present stance shifts. The ending tells us "the complex made clear" rather than showing a before/after in her own options or knowledge. Orientation anchors early (archivist, clock tower, tonight), satisfying the test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The clock tower mechanism room is vivid and specific: "labyrinth of brass and iron," ceremonial rope "coiled near the central pendulum," gears that "groaned in sympathy." The rope's physical presence enables the climactic action (reconfiguring braids), and the pendulum's proximity matters. The setting constrains movement and supplies the ritual tool, lifting this into the 7+ band despite the lack of deeper occupational systems or spatial friction that would test higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: stabilize the void/door. Pressure escalates when Elara untwists the rope and merges the wax seal's intent with the braids, narrowing her path to a single ritual method. The tightening is causal and on-page. However, the protagonist's agency feels curiously assured—she "knew she needed to act" and executes the method without visible struggle, error, or intermediate cost. The resolution lands smoothly but lacks friction; no live option is foreclosed on the page, only the abstract "fable of absence."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of absence/presence and forgotten histories emerges through concrete images: the wax seal, the diplomat's ghost, the fables whispered in her mind. The final image—diplomat finishing his signature, door dissolving—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (Can absence be reversed?). Yet the ending's articulation veers toward summary: "translated the profound confusion into perfect, lasting clarity" restates the theme rather than letting the scene work alone. Subtext is present but not silent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent, slightly elevated register ("warmly methodical," "shimmering, blurred space," "symbolic meaning") that reads as narrator's literary overlay rather than Elara's lived perception. Under peak pressure (untwisting the rope, merging seal and braid) the diction remains calm and abstract—"absorbing the diplomat's lost purpose"—where stress might compress or fragment syntax. Perceptual signature is generic; we lack character-specific noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no major loops or scaffold. Sentence openings vary. Information density is moderate: many lines do one job (describe), fewer do two. The peak beat—rope reconfiguration—leans on abstract verbs: "absorbing," "glowed," "solidify," "dissolving." Figurative language is present but not dense enough to trigger overwriting penalties. The phrase "warmly methodical" recurs three times as a label without evolving. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; the prose breathes evenly rather than accelerating at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—archivist uses ceremonial rope to stabilize a door into the past—synthesizes archive/history/ritual in a specific way. However, the "fables of absence" and diplomat's ghost echo familiar ghost-story and memory-recovery templates. The rope-braiding method is detailed but introduced late and executed without visible trial or improvisation. Emotional specificity is thin; Elara's satisfaction ("smiled, her warmly methodical nature satisfied") feels generic. The transformation test is weak: swap archivist for another scholar, rope for another artifact, and the arc persists largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elara (adaptable archivist) appears throughout and makes the key choice to use the rope. Setup is immediate; she approaches the door, recalls fables, and decides to act. Development: she lifts the rope and begins untwisting braids (middle beat). Payoff: her reconfiguration completes the closure. However, her adaptability is told ("the university's adaptable archivist") rather than tested; she executes the plan without error or pivot. The choices advance plot but do not narrow options with visible cost. Two gates solid, causal pressure present but modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The wax seal appears early (Elara draws it from her pocket, recalls the forgotten diplomat) and returns at the climax when she presses it into the rope braid, causing the fibers to glow and the void to solidify. Two beats, causal role in the ending. The seal is specific (diplomat's, intricate design never deciphered) and irreplaceable in the ritual logic. However, the mechanics of why this seal stabilizes this void are asserted rather than earned through prior constraint. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement lift it into mid-7 eligibility, but the lack of intermediate friction or visible cost caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Fables of absence are introduced early ("core concept that had haunted her research") and shape Elara's interpretation of the door. They return in the climax: "tales of a diplomat who vanished mid-treaty" guide her ritual. The concept frames the stakes (filling the void) and informs her method. However, it functions more as backstory/explanation than on-page constraint; the fables do not narrow her tactical options or force a choice under pressure. They thematically color the closure but do not drive turns. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Warmly methodical" is attributed to Elara three times but never constrains an action or creates friction. We do not see warm impulse conflict with methodical caution, nor does the trait enable a unique tactic. It remains a label. The trait is present (setup) and mentioned during the rope work (development) and at closure ("her warmly methodical nature satisfied"), satisfying all three gates. However, its function is purely ornamental; no cost or trade-off is visible. Gates met but no causal pressure, placing it in the 4.0–4.9 functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The action "merge" is explicit and central: "to merge this unstable rift with the solid world," "to merge the absence with presence, the forgotten with the remembered," and enacted when she presses the seal into the braid and the fibers absorb the diplomat's purpose. Setup by midpoint, drives the climax, shapes the closure image. However, "merge" could be swapped for "bind," "fuse," or "reconcile" with minor wording changes and the logic would hold. The verb is thematically apt but not mechanically unique. Two-plus gates, causal role, but moderate swappability limits it to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ceremonial rope is introduced early ("coiled near the central pendulum"), lifted and untwisted in the middle beat, and its reconfiguration drives the climax. The method is specific: "re-weave the braids, altering their symbolic connections," "pressed the wax into a specific braid." All three gates met. The rope's presence is irreplaceable in the ritual logic. However, the reconfiguration mechanics are told ("Each braid represented a thread of time") rather than shown through visible trial, error, or intermediate cost. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but the method's execution lacks friction, capping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clock tower mechanism room anchors the story from the opening line and supplies the ceremonial rope. The setting enables the climactic action (rope coiled near pendulum, gears groaning in sympathy). The room's verticality and brass-and-iron labyrinth are vivid. However, the setting does not pressure Elara's choices; she moves through it without spatial friction or resource constraint. The gears sync with her work but do not resist or complicate. Setup, development (rope location), and payoff (gears groan) all present, but the setting functions more as stage than crucible. Mid-6s for solid presence and one causal link.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "when the door shouldn't exist" (tonight, the door appears where blank wall should be) frames the inciting disruption and recurs implicitly at closure when "the door was gone, the wall once more unbroken." The impossibility defines the stakes. However, no live clock tightens tactics; the story's present tense is continuous and unrushed. The timeframe is conceptual (the breach of normal time) rather than durational. Setup and payoff gates met, but middle development (time pressure on choices) is absent. Lyric reprise carries thematic weight but no tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to translate confusion into clarity" is stated early ("Her motivation, always to translate confusion into clarity, ignited instantly") and recurs at closure ("She had translated the profound confusion into perfect, lasting clarity"). It drives her decision to act and shapes the ritual's goal. However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested; Elara does not weigh confusion's value or clarity's cost. It functions as consistent drive rather than lived friction. Setup, development (the ritual enacts this goal), and payoff all present, but no visible trade-off or want-versus-need tension. Mid-6s for coherent presence without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Tone of "clear complexity" is maintained: the prose is lucid yet layered with symbolic detail (wax seal, braids as time threads, fables of absence). The narrative voice remains calm and explanatory even at peak moments, and the ending crystallizes meaning without ambiguity ("the complex made clear"). However, the tone does not modulate with pressure; urgency is told ("profound confusion") rather than enacted in syntax or rhythm. The final image is clear but not charged with contradictory texture. Coherent through turns, but static mood and lack of tonal escalation place it at the threshold of 6.0.</comment>
