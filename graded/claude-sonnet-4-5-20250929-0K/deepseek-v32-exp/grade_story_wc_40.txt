<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (decode linguistic growth patterns) is clear and consistent, but she remains largely unopposed and her interiority is thin—"weathered innocence" functions more as label than embodied contradiction. The final choice to testify carries stated cost ("reticence made the action daunting") but is not dramatized through micro-choices that foreclose a live path; the voice simply comes and the transition is summarized. No secondary character applies pressure, and the arc from silent scholar to confident speaker feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is prompt (scholar, library, dawn, post-dictionary age) and the lens reads Accumulative/Textural (crystal work accumulates toward pattern revelation). Closure exists—Elara finds her voice and testifies—but cost is asserted ("reticence...daunting") rather than shown; no visible forfeiture or tactical change accompanies the speech act. The pattern of crystal tapping and fractured-echo documentation builds density, yet the final beat ("words came slowly...then with growing confidence") summarizes the decisive moment rather than dramatizing it, weakening the RR/DC legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shadowed library is vivid and purposeful: towering shelves, gloom, defunct chandelier, scarred oak table, high windows casting rainbows. Sensory selection is strong (dust, suspended hush, dawn light striking crystal), and spatial choreography is clean. The crystal's physical properties (prismatic, sonically reflective) constrain Elara's method and charge the final image when it amplifies her voice, satisfying the micro-setting / object-as-setting criterion for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode growth, share the finding) is signaled early and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via crystal work. However, escalation is tepid: no reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Elara simply completes her method and decides to speak. The final act (testify) is stated as daunting but unfolds without visible opposition or cost-forcing trade-off, leaving the tightening/deepening requirement barely met and the cost abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (language as dormant, not dead; growth as networked rather than linear) emerges from concrete images—crystal, fractured sequences, library as womb—without overt moralizing. The final lines approach resonant repricing ("not just decoded growth; she had become part of its endless, fractal sequence") but veer into abstraction and hover near thematic echo. Subtext operates in the "suspended hush" and the shift from tomb to womb, yet the conceptual layer does not fully resist statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("reticent," "nascent," "counterpoint") but occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("testament to decoded patterns and enduring innocence") that feels detached from lived perception. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is scholarly but generic; filter verbs ("seemed to lean in") appear without voice motivation, and the prose texture does not modulate distinctly under the final emotional turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally high, but heavy overwriting clusters in key beats: "a cathedral of forgotten knowledge," "suspended hush filled the vast space, a breath held for centuries," "sonic shards into a coherent tapestry," "endless, beautiful pattern of growth." Metaphor density in the closure paragraph ("not in ink, but in light and air," "soft promise of renewal," "testament to decoded patterns") approaches ornamental saturation without pattern-teaching. Template stems recur ("She had to...," "The library...," "Elara realized..."). Paraphrase loops appear ("The shadowed library, once a tomb, now felt like a womb" / "no longer shadowed but filled with the golden light of dawn"), and the final third contains stacked figurative phrases that dull propulsion. Apply −0.8 for density + coherence issues and −0.4 for template/loop patterns; the closure beat is touched, escalating the penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Premise (decode linguistic evolution via sonically reflective crystal after dictionaries end) offers a fresh synthesis, but execution leans on familiar scholar-quest and dormant-knowledge tropes without sharp transformation. "Weathered innocence," "suspended hush," and the library-as-tomb/womb pivot read competent but not surprising. The conceptual payoff (language grows fractally, not linearly) is told more than dramatized, and the final image ("light and air," "promise of renewal") opts for safe lyricism over a risky, singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara (reticent scholar) is present throughout and her choices (retrieve crystal, tap it, document sequences, prepare to testify) anchor the arc. She appears early, drives two distinct beats (crystal work, decision to testify), and shapes the ending. However, her agency is largely observational until the final summary; the testimony itself is not dramatized as a choice with visible cost, limiting causal pressure. Swappability is moderate—another scholar type could fill the role with minor edits—and the final "reticence made the action daunting" is asserted, not shown.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal is introduced early (retrieved from chandelier), used in two beats (tapping with tuning fork; casting rainbows), and returns charged at closure when it amplifies Elara's voice. Its unique property (sonically reflective, captures whispers) enables the fractured-sequences method and is irreplaceable for the story's logic. Causal pressure is strong; cost connection is implicit (crystal validates the discovery). One minor friction: the crystal's mechanics are asserted rather than tested under opposition, and it does not constrain a choice so much as facilitate one.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Suspended hush" recurs frequently as atmosphere and appears in the closure paragraph ("The suspended hush broke"). It frames the library's stasis and modulates at the end (breaking with "soft promise of renewal"), providing a lyric early-to-final reprise that reweights the dominant stake. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; its role is thematic and atmospheric rather than causal. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met; middle development is absent. Score reflects lyric resonance without beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Sonically reflective" is named early and its mechanics (captures whispers, splinters sound into fractured echoes) are described. It enables the fractured-sequences method and is present in the ending when the crystal amplifies Elara's voice. The trait is irreplaceable for the story's premise and participates in two beats (crystal tapping, final amplification). However, it does not impose a visible tradeoff or constrain a choice under pressure; Elara uses it without complication. All three gates are met; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Testify" is signaled as Elara's goal ("She had to testify to this discovery") and provides the closure action ("she testified to the endless, beautiful pattern of growth"). It appears in setup and payoff, shaping the arc's resolution. However, the testimony is summarized rather than dramatized, and the action does not create a turn or reversal—it is the natural endpoint of her work. Swappability is moderate (present, share, announce could substitute). Middle development is weak; the action is declared rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Fractured sequences" is introduced early ("through fractured sequences of sound, the crystal could reveal hidden rhythms") and drives Elara's method throughout: she taps the crystal, listens to echoes, documents each sequence, and eventually presents via this method. It shapes two beats (crystal work, final presentation) and is irreplaceable for the premise. The method is setup and paid off but does not constrain a choice under pressure; Elara applies it without friction or cost. All gates met; causal pressure is present but light.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is introduced in the opening line, supplies multiple resources (chandelier crystal, oak table, high windows), and transforms at closure ("no longer shadowed but filled with the golden light of dawn"). Dawn light strikes the crystal mid-story, creating the rainbow effect that deepens the pattern revelation. The setting is irreplaceable and participates in three beats (crystal retrieval, rainbow moment, final illumination), charging the ending image. Spatial choreography is clear; the environment pressures choices indirectly by symbolizing stasis that Elara breaks.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the last dictionary was printed" is established early as backstory context and recurs in the closure paragraph ("after the last dictionary was printed, a new chapter began"). It motivates Elara's quest (language deemed fixed) and frames the thematic stakes. However, it does not tighten a decision or alter tactics on the page; the timeframe is declarative rather than pressuring. Setup and payoff gates are met, but middle development is absent and swappability is high—any post-decline setting would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Decode the pattern of growth" is named early ("Her motivation was a quiet obsession: to decode the pattern of growth") and drives the entire arc: crystal work, documentation, realization ("Elara realized that growth was not linear"), and testimony. It shapes two beats (method application, final speech) and is present at closure. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible costs; Elara pursues it without friction. All gates met; causal pressure is moderate but the desire is not shown in contested micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Weathered innocence" is introduced early ("The weathered innocence in her eyes") and recurs twice ("lent her tone a weathered innocence," "enduring innocence"). It colors Elara's stance and appears in the closure paragraph, providing tonal coherence. However, the tone is asserted via label rather than embodied through diction or rhythm modulation under pressure; the prose does not shift perceptibly when Elara moves from reticence to speech. Lyric reprise is present but the tone does not charge the final image with distinct texture.</comment>
