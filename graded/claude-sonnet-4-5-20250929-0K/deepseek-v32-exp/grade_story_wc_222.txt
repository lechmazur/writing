<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's "chivalrous thief" archetype and "apprentice of wonder" motivation are stated rather than shown through contradictory impulses under pressure. His actions at the summit—bowing, swapping pieces, placing the sundial lid—proceed without visible internal conflict or cost that would reveal character particulars. The "sacredly playful grace" remains a label; we never see him struggle or forfeit anything personal. Emotional states are asserted ("heart full of purpose," "profound connection") rather than embodied through specific sensory degradation or micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a causal chain: climb → arrive → swap pieces → place sundial lid → sky mends. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Kaelen retrieves the white queen and descends, the world "unaware," with no visible price paid or path foreclosed. The ritual succeeds exactly as planned without complication, making the ending a completion rather than a transformation. Orientation is clear early (icebound spire, wrong sky, Kaelen climbing), and the lens holds as causal, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire, blue ice platform, and "wrong sky" with violet smears and green halo provide vivid, purposeful anchoring. The pocket sundial lid clicks into place on the ice pedestal, a tactile detail that charges the ritual moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the ascent and summit encounter. The setting constrains the action (sheer faces, windswept platform, thinning air) and the sundial pedestal becomes a functional prop that enables the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—amending the fractured sky—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Kaelen climbs, meets the guardian, performs the swap, and succeeds without a reversal, complication, or cost. The ritual proceeds as intended with no narrowing of options or visible trade-off. The guardian's presence could have applied pressure but remains cooperative. No tightening forces Kaelen to forfeit, adapt, or endure; the resolution is execution of a plan rather than agency under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The concept of "apprentice of wonder" and the cosmic repair via ritual touch thematic territory—curiosity, playfulness in the face of mystery—but the final image does not offer a non-literal answer. Instead, the sky is literally fixed, the sundial remains as sentinel, and Kaelen departs with a "new wonder to learn," a generic nod. The chess pieces as vessels for secrets and the sundial as celestial tool hint at motif work, but their meanings do not shift or deepen at closure; they function exactly as introduced, without resonance or reprice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Kaelen's perception throughout. Diction is elevated and occasionally generic ("profound connection," "vast, mending tapestry"), but voice remains consistent without head-hopping. The guardian's single line of dialogue ("We meet when the sky is wrong") carries mood but does not test subtext or pursue a goal. Psychic distance stays controlled, and filter verbs are minimal. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on wonder and playfulness, though not deeply character-specific under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and maintains momentum, with varied sentence structures and clean grammar. However, several lines rely on abstract intensifiers without concrete grounding: "profound connection," "vast, mending tapestry," "sacred playfulness surfaced." The phrase "cautious abandon" appears twice, once in dialogue and once in narration, as a thematic echo rather than purposeful iteration. Minor template cadence appears in the ritual sequence ("He produced... The guardian held out... Their hands met"), but it does not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touch the closure, keeping the score in the solid mid-range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "chivalrous thief who repairs the cosmos via ritual" premise touches familiar fantasy beats—wrong sky, ancient spire, mystical exchange—without a sharp angle. The chess pieces with secrets inside and the pocket sundial lid as cosmic tools are inventive details, but the transformation test reveals a replaceable core: swap Kaelen for another protagonist and the arc remains unchanged. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material; the ending delivers exactly what the setup promised. Emotional truth is present but generic ("embrace the unknown with open arms").</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaelen is present throughout and makes the decision to climb, swap pieces, and place the sundial lid. These choices drive the plot's major turns: arrival at the summit and activation of the ritual. However, his decisions do not alter tactics or foreclose options—he executes a known plan without deviation. The "chivalrous" and "apprentice of wonder" traits frame motivation but do not constrain choices under pressure. Present in setup, middle, and closure, with causal work in two beats (swap, sundial placement), but swappability and lack of visible cost limit the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pocket sundial lid is signaled early (in Kaelen's pocket), used functionally in the middle (he places it on the pedestal), and directly shapes the closure (beam of light pierces the sky, stitching reality). It appears in three distinct beats with causal pressure: its pairing with the hidden base is the key to recalibration, and its placement triggers the mending. The lid's celestial maps are traced as part of Kaelen's playfulness, adding specificity. Removing it would break the ritual's logic and the ending's mechanism, meeting high integration tests.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Apprentice of wonder" is stated early and repeated as a framing label ("His motivation was pure," "This was the heart of being an apprentice of wonder"), but it does not constrain choices or alter tactics on the page. Kaelen's curiosity and reverence are asserted rather than tested; the ritual succeeds without his wonder being challenged or costing him anything. The concept informs tone and theme but does not shape stakes in a way that narrows options. Functional but replaceable with "curious seeker" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sacredly playful" is introduced early ("moved with a sacredly playful grace," "treating each perilous handhold as part of a grand, reverent game") and reprised at the ritual ("His sacred playfulness surfaced; he grinned, tracing the etched maps"). However, it remains descriptive rather than mechanically consequential—no moment shows playfulness enabling a risk or reverence constraining an impulse. The attribute colors tone but does not drive a turn or impose visible cost. Present across beats but ornamental in function.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Amend" is the story's central verb, stated as Kaelen's task early ("His current task was to amend the fractured sky") and fulfilled at closure ("The sky was whole again, the Unweaving halted"). The action is signaled, developed through the swap and sundial placement, and directly shapes the ending's outcome—the beam of light stitching reality. Removing "amend" and replacing it with a generic "fix" or "restore" would require no structural change, limiting irreplaceability. Strong causal work and closure linkage, but moderate swappability keeps the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method—swapping hand-carved chess pieces with secrets inside—is introduced early ("a ritual known only to a few"), enacted at the summit (black knight for white queen), and tied to the closure ("the secrets inside the chess pieces now activating"). The swap is a required step for the sky's mending, and the pieces' hidden contents (starlight, counter-charm) add specificity. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown, and the swap could be replaced with another ritual exchange (tokens, scrolls) with minor edits. Present in setup, middle, and closure with causal pressure, but moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire is signaled early, provides the setting for all action, and houses the ice pedestal that receives the sundial lid at closure. The spire's height and isolation create the stage for the "wrong sky" to be visible and accessible. The blue ice platform and windswept summit offer sensory grounding. The spire constrains Kaelen's approach (sheer faces require climbing skill) and supplies the pedestal resource. Present across all three gates with one causal constraint (access) and closure participation (pedestal). Solid integration, though the spire could be replaced with another remote, mystical height.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"When the sky is wrong" is introduced early with vivid detail (violet smears, green halo, "the Unweaving"), echoed in the guardian's greeting, and resolved at closure (stars snap back, moon sheds hue). The timeframe creates urgency and frames the stakes, and its resolution signals the ritual's success. However, no ticking clock tightens decisions—Kaelen climbs and performs the swap without time pressure altering his tactics. The timeframe colors atmosphere and stakes but does not narrow options. Present in setup, middle, and closure with thematic charge but limited mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To embrace the unknown with open arms" is stated early as Kaelen's motivation and reprised near closure ("his arms open wide, embracing the unknown forces"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Kaelen faces no moment where embracing the unknown costs him safety, certainty, or an alternative path; the ritual succeeds as planned. The motivation frames his approach but does not create friction or visible trade-off. Present in setup and closure as thematic echo, but ornamental in function.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cautious abandon" is named early ("his tone one of cautious abandon, balancing risk with hope") and implicitly present in Kaelen's playful yet reverent approach to the climb and ritual. The tone is coherent throughout—wonder tempered by respect—and modulates subtly as he moves from climb to summit encounter to cosmic repair. However, the tone does not charge the final image with new pressure; the ending's mood (triumph, wonder) matches the opening without tonal reconfiguration. Present across beats with moderate coherence, but lacks the decisive shift that would elevate it into higher bands.</comment>
