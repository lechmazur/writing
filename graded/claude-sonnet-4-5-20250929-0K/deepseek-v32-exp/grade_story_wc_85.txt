<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's guilt is clearly established and her profession as a genealogist shapes the backstory, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract recounting ("gnawed at her," "twisted her insides") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The shore sequence shows her kneeling and tracing carvings, yet the decisive moment—accepting the brother's death—arrives through narrated memory rather than a present micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final walk away reads as summary resolution ("a little lighter in spirit though heavier in heart") rather than earned transformation through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (guilt accumulates through objects and shore setting until acceptance). The closure effect—Elara's decision to stop manufacturing false memories and dispose of the watch hand—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (renunciation with stated cost), but the cost is told ("heavier in heart") rather than made visceral in a final image. The single-shard shore visit provides one meaningful deepening, yet the link between finding the carving and the decision to change feels asserted in summary rather than earned through causal pressure or a visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace frames the opening and closing, anchoring place with color and mood. The shore's "sieved hush" and "overgrown" path create tactile detail, and the driftwood carvings serve as micro-setting objects that Elara handles. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—she simply finds the carving she sought, and the setting provides backdrop rather than complicating her access or forcing a tactical shift. Sensory hierarchy reads as consistent (damp sand, grooves in wood), but spatial choreography remains static.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—quelling guilt by confronting a withheld truth—is signaled early and sustained through the shore sequence. The single tightening occurs when Elara uncovers the carving she made and recalls the brother's death, narrowing her options to acceptance and a vow to stop fabricating histories. However, the turn is recounted in backstory ("she had tried to forget") rather than dramatized as a present reversal that forces a visible trade-off. The cost (no more false memories) is declared but not tested on the page, and coincidence (finding the exact carving) enables rather than complicates the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the watch hand, driftwood carvings, and the contrast between manufactured lineages and withheld truth, building a coherent question about the weight of deception. The shore's "sieved hush" offers a resonant final setting, and the decision to dispose of the watch hand provides a non-literal answer. Yet the closing paragraphs over-articulate the theme ("some silences could never be broken, only carried") and the final walk includes near-moralizing summary ("tempered regret shaping her resolve") that replaces scene pressure with authorial voice. The ending offers understanding rather than forgiveness, which fits, but the articulation trends abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited, with Elara's perceptual signature ("the air thick under the weight of unspoken words") established early. Diction stays largely consistent, though phrases like "perpetual reminder" and "mass and measure" drift toward elevated register at the close. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The narrative withholds the brother's identity until the shore discovery, which reads as purposeful compression rather than manufactured suspense. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, pulling closer during the carving moment and widening in the final walk, but the closing summary ("a little lighter in spirit though heavier in heart") lapses into telling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: "the air thick under the weight of unspoken words," "a burden she carried daily," "the rising tide of remorse," "a core of tempered regret" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff, violating density and coherence checks (−0.7). Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "gnawed at her, a burden she carried" and "twisted her insides" restate guilt without added pressure (−0.2). The final third ("heavier than any stone, a palpable force," "mass and measure," "tempered regret") layers metaphor in peak beats, reducing clarity (−0.5 escalation). Template cadence: runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" across multiple paragraphs flatten rhythm (−0.4). Total artifacts and loops justify the score and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—guilt-ridden genealogist manufactures false memories and must confront a withheld truth—reads as a midpoint template (moral reckoning through symbolic object) without distinctive transformation through world logic or non-obvious calculus. The driftwood carving functions as a planted clue rather than an organically integrated constraint. Emotional specificity (the brother's poverty, the watch hand as token) adds texture, but the arc follows a predictable guilt-to-acceptance trajectory without fresh inflection. The "sieved hush" motif and shore setting offer atmospheric detail yet do not reshape the familiar contours of the redemption frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's profession shapes backstory and motive (manufacturing false memories, burying the brother's existence), but her on-page choices are limited to walking to the shore, kneeling, tracing carvings, and deciding to stop her trade. The decision arrives through recounted memory rather than a present dilemma with visible cost. Present by the opening (setup ✓), but middle development reads as search rather than constrained choice, and closure participation is declaration rather than dramatized turn. Two beats (terrace departure, shore discovery) with causal pressure at the end, but swappability is moderate—a different morally compromised profession could replace genealogist with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The watch hand appears in the opening paragraph (setup ✓), is described as "cool against her skin" and later "no longer just metal" (two beats), and is slated for disposal in the sea as tribute at the close (closure linkage ✓). It returns with reweighted meaning (from accusation to tribute), but its physical presence does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara could conduct the same shore visit and reach the same resolution without it. Specificity is moderate (it belonged to the erased brother), and cost is conceptual (disposing it honors the truth), but the element is more symbolic marker than active pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" is introduced at the shore ("a sieved hush, a silence filtered of all but essential truths") in the middle third (late setup, −0.3), recurs once ("The sieved hush of the shore enveloped her"), and is named again in the closing reflection ("In the sieved hush, she understood"). It provides atmosphere and thematic echo but does not shape stakes or tactics—Elara's search for the carving proceeds identically whether the shore is hushed or loud. No middle choice is enabled or constrained by the concept, and closure participation is thematic label rather than causal mechanism. Ornamental use and swappability (any reflective silence) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The attribute is central to backstory (manufacturing false memories for clients, erasing the brother) and motivates her guilt, appearing by the first paragraph (setup ✓). It enables the premise and constrains her reputation, but on the page it functions as past context rather than a live tactical tradeoff. The decision to stop fabricating is declared at the end (closure linkage ✓), yet the attribute does not force a mid-scene choice with visible cost—no client confronts her, no fabrication attempt fails. Two beats (backstory establishment, final vow) with moderate causal pressure, but the trait could be replaced with a different morally dubious skill (forger, hacker) without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Quell" is named as her motivation in the opening ("to quell the rising tide of remorse") and recurs at the shore ("hoping the carvings would hold an answer" to quell guilt) and in the final walk ("She had quelled the immediate storm inside her"). Setup ✓, middle mention ✓, closure echo ✓. The action shapes the dominant stake and her shore visit traces to it, but the mechanics are passive (hoping, discovering) rather than active tactical choices. The cost (accepting the brother's death, vowing to stop her trade) ties to quelling, yet the verb itself is abstract—remove "quell" and substitute "confront" or "resolve" with minimal edits. Swappability and lack of irreplaceable specificity lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method is introduced early ("by sifting through driftwood carvings along a forgotten shore") and executed on the page: Elara descends to the shore, kneels, traces grooves in a bird carving, and uncovers the carving she made with dates and a name. Setup ✓ (signaled in paragraph one), development ✓ (middle sequence shows the sifting in action), closure ✓ (the discovered carving triggers the brother's memory and her final decision). The mechanics matter—she must physically find the specific carving—and the method is irreplaceable (no other action delivers the withheld truth). Two beats (arrival and search, discovery) with causal pressure that narrows options and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace frames the opening and closing, present by the first sentence (setup ✓). It provides atmospheric anchor ("painted in deep blue shadows," "no longer a prison but a place of reflection") and bookends the journey, but it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Elara's departure and return are geographic markers rather than tactical pressure points—the terrace could be any reflective space. Closure participation is thematic (prison → reflection) rather than causal. One ornamental beat (opening description) and one thematic reprise (closing), but swappability and lack of micro-setting constraint cap the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Under the weight of unspoken words" appears in the opening line and recurs in the final paragraph ("The unspoken words between her and the world would remain"), providing thematic bookends (setup ✓, closure echo ✓). However, it does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions—no clock or deadline compels urgency. The phrase is metaphorical rather than temporal, and Elara's shore visit proceeds at her own pace without time pressure. Missing middle development and no tactical constraint from elapsed time. Ornamental use and swappability (any thematic burden) lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in the opening ("to discover the weight of a withheld truth") and dramatized through the shore search and carving discovery (setup ✓, development ✓). The withheld truth (the brother's death) is revealed on the page, and Elara's decision to stop fabricating memories traces to it (closure ✓). Friction exists between her guilt and the cost of facing the truth, shown through "the weight of that truth crashed down, heavier than any stone." However, the discovery is recounted in memory rather than tested in present conflict—no live choice forces her to choose between wants and costs in the moment. Two beats with causal pressure, but the motivation is more told than enacted in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tempered regret" is introduced mid-story ("a core of tempered regret") and returns in the closing walk ("with tempered regret shaping her resolve"). Setup is delayed (−0.3), but the tone is coherent through the guilt-laden reflection and quiet acceptance at the shore. The mood modulates from "rising tide of remorse" to "quiet acceptance" to "tempered regret," tracking the emotional arc. Closure linkage ✓ (tone charges the final image of the walk). However, the tone is more asserted than embodied—phrases like "a little lighter in spirit though heavier in heart" tell the emotional state rather than letting syntax and rhythm carry it. One substantive beat (closing walk) with coherence but limited tonal specificity.</comment>
