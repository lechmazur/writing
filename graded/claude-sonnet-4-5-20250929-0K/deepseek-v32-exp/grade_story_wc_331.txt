<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared early and her action (tracing hyperbolic curves) propels the climax, but her interiority leans abstract ("her mind navigating the intricate folds of negative curvature") rather than embodied. The "sanely eccentric" trait remains a label without constraining a difficult choice; her solitude is told more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final step through the doorway reads as wish-fulfillment rather than a renunciation or trade-off with visible cost, and the scarf's dissolution feels convenient rather than forfeiting something she needs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the first quarter and follows a causal sequence: scarf → hyperbolic geometry → doorway → realm. The closure is a Decisive Change (Elara crosses into the story-realm), but the cost is asserted ("had become a part of them forever") rather than legibly paid—she loses the scarf yet gains everything she sought without visible trade-off. The inferred lens is Causal, and the escalation tightens once (geometry activates scarf, wall ripples), meeting the single-tightening allowance for this length, but the final image lacks the friction that would make the transformation undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is vividly rendered ("stained-glass atoms," "curved walls"), and the scarf's tactile detail (tattered silk, smell of old paper and roses) charges multiple beats. The central reading room's hyperbolic architecture directly enables the climax, constraining Elara's method and shaping the doorway's emergence. Patrons browsing in the background provide atmospheric pressure but remain underutilized as a live social constraint. The setting's micro-details (scarf, geometry) drive the ending, lifting the score into the 6+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled in the opening and drives Elara's action throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the scarf glows and the wall ripples, narrowing her path to a single threshold. However, the crossing itself carries no visible cost: she gains access, loses a relic she no longer needs, and faces no dilemma or trade-off. The patrons' presence never complicates her work, and no secondary pressure tests her commitment, leaving escalation functional but not deeply earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (the interplay of science, poetry, memory, and narrative) emerges from the setting and scarf rather than overt statement, and the final image (stories as living constellations) offers a lyric answer to the central question. Yet the resolution is too tidy: Elara achieves her goal without ambiguity or counter-reading, and the closing lines veer toward summary ("her eccentricity no longer just a quirk, but a key to deeper wonders"). The scarf's analog memories feel more decorative than thematically essential, and the piece lacks friction that would make the theme linger beyond the plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person POV remains stable, and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric-scientific idiom ("equations danced with metaphors," "silent sonnets"). Perceptual signature is present but generic—"adjusted the tattered silk scarf," "focused, her mind navigating"—and interiority leans toward exposition ("a realm she believed was hidden") rather than charged thought. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance holds, and there is no head-hopping, but the prose lacks the rhythmic control and specificity under pressure that would elevate it into the high 7s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly, and many sentences carry dual loads (setting + character mood). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops: "The tattered silk scarf, now radiant, dissolved into the light, its analog memories merging with the eternal library of tales" restates the scarf's fate already shown. Template cadence recurs: "She had reawakened not just memories, but the source itself" / "her eccentricity no longer just a quirk, but a key" / "no longer lonely, but filled." Stock metaphors ("stories floated like constellations") and overwriting in peak beats ("projecting scenes around her: lovers whispering in sonnets, scientists scribbling revelations") dull immediacy. Apply −0.8 for loops and stems; no closure-scene harm, so cap deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of scientific poetry library, hyperbolic geometry, and analog memories offers surface novelty, but the emotional arc (lonely seeker finds magical realm and achieves fulfillment without cost) follows a familiar template. The geometry remains abstract window-dressing rather than a constraint with trade-offs, and the patrons' obliviousness is convenient rather than purposeful. The scarf-as-key and "place where stories live" lack transformation; a near-synonym (enchanted bookmark, hidden archive) could replace them with minor edits. No bold risk elevates the premise beyond its parts.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decision to trace hyperbolic curves triggers the climax, meeting setup, development, and payoff gates. However, her role is largely observational until the final gesture, and the patrons' browsing creates backdrop rather than forcing a difficult choice. The "odd-hour librarian" attribute matters less than her knowledge of geometry; the job itself is functional but replaceable. Score reflects modest causal work across beats but no indispensable constraint or cost tied to her specific occupation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The scarf appears early (first quarter), is handled in at least three beats (adjustment, glowing activation, dissolution), and its analog memories enable the climax. Its loss at the end reweights its role, though the cost feels more symbolic than felt. The scarf's properties (tattered silk, smell, analog imprints) are specific and irreplaceable within the story's logic. It crosses all three gates and drives closure participation, but the dissolution is narrated summary rather than a dramatized forfeiture, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Analog memories are introduced early (scarf backstory) and shape the method (reawakening through geometry) that opens the doorway. The concept appears in at least two beats (scarf history, final projection of scenes) and participates in closure (memories merge with the eternal library). However, "analog" functions more as atmospheric label than a constraint—removing it and using "latent" or "woven" would not break the plot. The concept alters tactics modestly but lacks irreplaceable causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is introduced in the first paragraph as a label ("she could discuss quantum entanglement in one breath and the rhythm of Sapphic stanzas in the next") but never constrains a choice or imposes a visible cost. Elara's actions (tracing geometry, stepping through the doorway) do not hinge on this trait; a methodical scholar or intuitive mystic could perform the same beats. The attribute is ornamental, failing development and closure gates, and swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is signaled early (motivation) and executed on the page when Elara's geometry causes the scarf to glow and project scenes, directly enabling the doorway's emergence. The action appears in at least two distinct beats (scarf activation, wall ripple) and participates in closure (analog memories merge with the story-realm). However, the mechanics are vague enough that "unlock" or "summon" could replace "reawaken" with minimal rewrite. The action drives the plot but lacks irreplaceability, capping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is introduced early (Elara "had devised a method through hyperbolic geometry") and appears in the middle beat ("tracing hyperbolic curves in the air," "navigating the intricate folds of negative curvature") and at closure ("hyperbolic pathways," "the very geometry she had mastered"). However, the method remains abstract decoration—no constraint or trade-off depends on its hyperbolic properties versus any other mystical framework. Removing "hyperbolic" and using "sacred" or "spiral" would not alter causality. The method is present across beats but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is introduced immediately, its curved reading room directly enables the hyperbolic geometry method, and the setting's dual nature (science + poetry) reflects the theme. Patrons browsing provide temporal texture ("while patrons browse") and the library itself houses the hidden realm. The setting crosses all three gates and constrains Elara's method (curved walls as laboratory), but it could be swapped for any mystical archive with minor edits—"alchemical scriptorium" or "geometric monastery" would function identically. Score reflects strong presence but modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"While patrons browse" is mentioned three times but never tightens a decision—Elara's work proceeds uninterrupted, and the patrons remain oblivious. No clock or deadline pressures her; the timeframe is ambient backdrop rather than a constraint. The element is present (setup in opening, recurring mentions) but fails development and closure gates: removing it would not alter causality. Ornamental use without causal pressure keeps the score low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the place where stories live" is declared in the opening ("her motivation burned brightly"), drives Elara's action (tracing geometry to manifest the realm), and is fulfilled at closure ("she had found where stories live"). It shapes at least two beats (scarf activation, stepping through) and participates in the ending. However, the desire faces no friction or competing cost—she achieves it fully without trade-off—and the phrasing is abstract enough that "unlock the archive's heart" could replace it. Motivation is functional and present across beats but lacks the conflicted choices that would reach 7+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is introduced early ("the familiar pang of observed solitude, a quiet isolation amidst the crowd") and recurs at closure ("her solitude was no longer lonely"). The tone is coherent but static—Elara's isolation does not modulate with pressure or constrain a choice. The final line asserts transformation ("filled with the whispers of countless tales") without dramatizing the shift. The tone is present at setup and payoff but skips meaningful development, and its mood could be replaced with "quiet determination" or "wistful focus" with minor edits.</comment>
