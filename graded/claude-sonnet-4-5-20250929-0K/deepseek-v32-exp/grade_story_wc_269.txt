<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is clear and rooted in the bleaching trauma, but interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("drifting," "mooring") rather than embodied contradiction. The tapping method is introduced as characterization but functions more as décor than a pressure-driven compulsion. The "delayed revelation" moment reads as intellectual summation rather than earned discovery through concrete struggle; the shift from doubt to hope arrives via data correlation, not a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal experience remains largely explanatory rather than dramatized under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: descriptive density around the station, atlas, tapping, and data builds toward a thematic reconfiguration at closure. The "delayed revelation" functions as Conceptual Repricing—nature's cyclical renewal reweights the atlas and prior loss—but the cost remains abstract (years of doubt "cleansed," drifting "moored") rather than a specific forfeiture or tactical change on the page. The closing image gestures toward resonance but does not crystallize a decision or price that alters Kaelen's options going forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The monitoring station, sensors, control room, and console are named and spatially coherent. Sensory detail (salt air, hum of machinery, tap-tap rhythms) appears but does not constrain choice or evolve with pressure. The atlas page recurs and shifts meaning at closure, providing micro-setting function. However, the station itself remains a backdrop rather than a resource or obstacle that shapes Kaelen's assembling of the report or the revelation's impact.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding marine path disappearance—is signaled early but remains intellectual rather than urgently contested. The "specific task" of assembling the report provides a frame, yet no obstacle threatens its completion or forces a trade-off. The revelation arrives via data correlation without a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Pressure is conceptual (weight of witness, years of doubt) rather than an escalating friction that demands agency with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical renewal and nature's resilience emerges organically from the bleaching backstory, atlas page, data revelation, and coral recovery image. The closing shift from "witness to death" to "participant in life's...dance" risks moralizing but stays anchored in prior particulars (polyps colonizing skeletons, migration routes reemerging). Subtext operates in the atlas as benchmark and the tapping as rhythm-connection metaphor. The final image reweights prior material, though the conceptual cost (doubt replaced by hope) is not viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and psychic distance appropriate for reflective accumulation. Diction is controlled with occasional register elevation ("periodically eternal," "moored to this truth") that reads slightly ornamental rather than urgent. Tapping rhythm ("Tap-tap-tap, pause, tap-tap") is mimetic and purposeful. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") appear frequently in the final third, dulling immediacy at closure. Internal voice is coherent but leans toward explanatory summary in peak beats rather than compressed perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and most lines carry information density. The phrase "periodically eternal" recurs four times, functioning as motif but bordering on overwriting for a piece this length. Paraphrase loops appear: "drifting...unmoored" (para 6) and "drifting sensation...found its mooring" (final para); "delayed revelation" named twice in close succession. Filter-verb stacks in the final third ("felt a surge," "felt more grounded," "felt the weight," "felt truly home") reduce immediacy at closure. No major causality breaks, but scaffold reduces propulsion in the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The post-fossil-fuel recovery premise and marine-biologist witness offer a plausible synthesis, but the arc follows a template of environmentalist despair → data insight → hope that does not transform through unexpected moral calculus or embodied risk. The atlas as artifact and tapping as grounding practice are specific touches, yet the revelation arrives as thematic articulation rather than a choice or image that feels inevitable in hindsight. Middle-ground hedging: the piece avoids bold structural or emotional risk, opting for explanatory closure over charged ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kaelen witnesses bleaching in backstory (para 4), which establishes motivation and recurs at closure ("bleached corals...new polyps"). Setup and payoff gates met; middle gate absent—witnessing shapes desire but does not constrain a choice in the present scene. The character's profession and memory drive the investigation but remain context rather than decision points that narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atlas page introduced early (para 5), handled on console mid-piece (para 6, "unfolded it"), and reweighted at revelation ("suddenly made sense...benchmark for recovery," para 11). Three beats across setup, middle, closure. The page shifts from loss record to recovery benchmark, but this is conceptual rather than tactical—it does not enable or block an action with cost. Swappable with another artifact (photo, journal) without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Delayed revelation" named explicitly (para 10) and structures the narrative arc: data collection → correlation → insight. Setup implicit in task framing, development occupies the assembly action, payoff lands when "pieces...clicked into place." The concept shapes stakes (why paths disappear) and alters knowledge, but the revelation itself is told rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Removing the delay framing would weaken coherence but not break causality.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears four times as descriptor (station operation, planet cycles, earth rhythms, dance) but functions as thematic label rather than constraint or enabler. No on-page action turns on this attribute's presence; it colors tone and concept without narrowing options or imposing cost. Label-only use trends low per rubric.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Assemble" is the framed task (para 7), occupies middle beats ("pieced together...correlated temperature data," para 9), and yields the revelation (para 10). Setup and development gates met; closure participation indirect (the assembled report enables insight). The action drives the revelation but could be replaced with "analyze" or "synthesize" without altering logic. Functional but not irreplaceable; visible in two beats with closure linkage via causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Tapping introduced as stress-management practice (para 6), recurs during assembly ("tapping began...slow and measured," para 9), and stills at closure ("tapping finally stilled," para 12). Three beats. The practice characterizes Kaelen and mirrors tide rhythms thematically but does not constrain or enable a choice—work proceeds identically whether tapping occurs or not. Ornamental rather than mechanically necessary.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Station framed early (para 1–2), houses the task and data (control room, console, sensors), and remains present at closure ("station hummed on," final para). Setup, middle, payoff gates met. The setting provides context and resources (satellite feeds, station readings) necessary for the assembly action, but it does not impose spatial constraint or tactical friction. Postcard-level use: coherent and apt but not pressure-driving.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the fossil fuel ban" anchored in para 2 ("decades had passed"), recurs in backstory context (para 4, bleaching "before the ban"), and reappears at revelation (para 10, "since the fossil fuel ban, these paths were beginning to reemerge"). Setup and payoff present; middle development absent—the timeframe contextualizes recovery but does not tighten a present decision or impose urgency. Background rather than pressure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation stated explicitly (para 4, "to discover why some paths disappear") and operationalized in the report task (para 7, "looking for anomalies"). The desire drives the data assembly and is answered by the revelation (para 10). Setup, development, payoff gates met. However, the motivation remains intellectual pursuit rather than conflicted want versus cost; no friction or sacrifice dramatized on the page. Functional but not deeply pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Drifting" and "moored" recur as metaphors (para 6, "felt adrift, unmoored"; para 13, "drifting sensation...found its mooring"; para 14, "felt truly home"). The tone shifts from detachment to grounding across the arc, modulating with the revelation. Setup and payoff gates met; middle tone stays consistent (reflective, elegiac) rather than escalating. The final image charges the metaphor with thematic weight but the tonal shift is told ("feeling the weight...lighten") rather than embodied in changed syntax or perception.</comment>
