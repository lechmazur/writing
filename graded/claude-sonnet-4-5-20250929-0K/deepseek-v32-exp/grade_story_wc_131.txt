<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is stated but remains abstract throughout; "to become visible to those who needed him" never faces a concrete cost or meaningful internal contradiction on the page. The "kindly methodical" trait is declared repeatedly but never constrains a choice or creates friction—he moves through the story without genuine struggle or competing impulses. Sense memory is told as emotion ("tears to his eyes") rather than embodied through contradictory physical reactions or micro-choices under pressure. The ending fulfillment reads as a summary of impact rather than an earned shift in self-knowledge or renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story establishes spatial anchors (library, crawl spaces, dawn) but never creates a meaningful tightening or reversal under any lens. Kaelen retrieves the tape without complication, plays it, and watches others respond—no decision narrows his options or forecloses a path with felt cost. The closure relies on telling us he "felt more visible than ever" rather than dramatizing a decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration through action or image. Under a Causal lens, there is no because/therefore chain that escalates; under Accumulative, no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake; the ending reports satisfaction without cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The library, crawl spaces, and pipe chases are anchored early and tracked consistently across moves. The ferromagnetic tape and old player provide tactile micro-setting that Kaelen handles in multiple beats, though neither constrains his choices or alters his tactics under pressure. The sapphire hush and flickering lights recur but remain atmospheric decoration rather than shaping decisions. Spatial choreography is coherent but the environment never forces a trade-off or charges the final image with specific cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—delivering the tape to ease the city's fear—is signaled early but faces no on-page complication or escalation. Kaelen encounters no friction retrieving the fragment, threading the tape, or broadcasting it; the task unfolds as a smooth checklist. The outage and flickering lights are mentioned but never tighten his window or force a tactical choice. The ending tells us people's "worries eased" without dramatizing a reversal, cost, or trade-off that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of hidden guardianship and preserved wisdom emerges through repeated motif (cache, sense memory, visibility) but is stated rather than earned through specific conflict. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the theme—"fulfilled his purpose," "bridge gaps through sense memory"—which replaces scene pressure with assertion. The tape's content (hope and resilience) is generic and the protagonist's arc is told as achieved rather than tested by on-page friction. No non-literal answer to the central question arises from the closure image; instead the text explains its own meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored to Kaelen's perception throughout. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("serene counterpoint," "woven him into the city's hidden fabric") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. The perceptual signature is generic—"kindly methodical grace," "calm determination"—without idiosyncratic noticing or bias that would distinguish this focalizer. Psychic distance is consistent but the voice lacks rhythmic variation or compression under the story's peak beats; syntax remains uniform across emotional turns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence proliferate: "the cache," "sense memory," "kindly methodical," "ferromagnetic tape reel fragment," and "sapphire hush" recur as near-identical phrases across 15+ lines without added pressure or reweighting. Runs of "He had [verb]" and "His [noun]" create drumbeat rhythm (−0.6). The final third restates the entire premise in summary rather than image: "his kindly methodical efforts had woven him into the city's hidden fabric" (line 29), then "the crawl space dweller had fulfilled his purpose" (line 33), then the closing lines repeat "sapphire hush" and "ferromagnetic tape reel fragment" as checklist confirmation rather than charged reprise. Stock metaphors ("beacon," "bridge gaps") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "watched") dull immediacy in peak beats. Apply patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.4 for loops and template cadence across closure beats, plus disallow 9+ globally per Q7 rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—guardian preserving community wisdom in hidden infrastructure—follows a familiar template (lone keeper, lost knowledge, crisis as catalyst). The tape's content and Kaelen's fulfillment are generic; swapping "ferromagnetic tape" for "journal" or "pipe chases" for "archive" would not alter the emotional arc or thematic calculus. No fresh synthesis or non-obvious angle emerges; the ending delivers exactly what the setup promised without complication or reweighting. The story hedges risk by making every element cooperative rather than testing Kaelen's motivation against a meaningful cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kaelen appears throughout but his decisions do not create key turns; he retrieves, cleans, threads, and broadcasts the tape without complication. Setup present, closure cameo present, but middle development lacks a choice that narrows options. Ornamental observer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ferromagnetic tape reel fragment is handled in multiple beats (retrieval, cleaning, threading) and returns in the final paragraph with thematic weight. Setup early, middle development shows tactile use, and closure links it to the ending's charge. Swappable with "recording" or "reel" without major edits; specificity matters less than function. Two gates plus lyric reprise earn mid-6s; lack of irreplaceability and cost tie to the element cap higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Sense memory is invoked when Kaelen picks up the tape ("scent of rain," grandmother's voice) and mentioned in closing summary, but it does not shape his tactics or create on-page friction. Setup present, closure echo present, but middle development absent—he does not choose between competing memories or face a cost tied to recollection. Functional but swappable with "nostalgia" or "reminiscence."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is labeled five times but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. It describes his movements without forcing a trade-off or creating friction. Label-only trait, no middle development or closure participation beyond repetition.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Caching and uncovering the tape frame the entire plot; setup early, middle development shows the retrieval, closure delivers the broadcast. However, the action is swappable—"preserve and retrieve" could be nearly any hidden object without altering the arc. Two gates plus closure linkage earn mid-5s; lack of specificity (no cost or complication tied to the act of caching itself) caps higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Pipe chases are mentioned early and Kaelen uses them to retrieve the fragment, satisfying setup and middle development. However, the method's mechanics do not constrain his choices or create friction—he simply knows the route. Closure participation is summary-only ("used the pipe chases"). Functional but swappable with "ductwork" or "maintenance tunnels."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is anchored in the opening line and tracked across beats (bookshelves, intercom, early risers). Setup strong, middle provides spatial coherence, and closure shows people drawn to the library. However, the setting does not pressure Kaelen's choices or alter tactics—it serves as backdrop. Micro-setting (tape player, ducts) is present but does not constrain action. Two gates plus coherent tracking earn mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The outage and flickering lights are mentioned early and in the middle ("lights flickered again, emphasizing urgency") but do not tighten Kaelen's window or force a tactical choice. By closure, "lights stabilized" without consequence. Setup present, middle echo present, but no cost or escalation tied to the timeframe. Swappable with "during maintenance" or "at night."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To become visible to those who need you" is stated early and reported as achieved at closure ("felt more visible than ever"), satisfying setup and closure participation. However, the motivation is never dramatized through conflicting choices or on-page cost—Kaelen's actions face no friction and his desire is told rather than tested. Functional but lacks middle friction; the want does not clash with a competing fear or resource limit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" appears in the opening line and recurs six times, including the final sentence, satisfying setup and closure reprise. However, the tone remains static—descriptive atmosphere without modulation under pressure. No middle development where the tone shifts or charges a choice. Lyric reprise without reweighting; ornamental recurrence caps the score.</comment>
