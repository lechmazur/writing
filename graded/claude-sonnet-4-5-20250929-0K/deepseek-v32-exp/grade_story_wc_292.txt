<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but not dramatized under pressure—her "nervously confident" trait appears as label only without embodied contradiction. The ancestor's story dominates via backstory dump rather than present choice; Roy exists solely to grant access without applying meaningful resistance. Internal experience remains thin: we're told about "spongey dread" and "frantic energy" but never see contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late—weather station location, time period, and Elara's physical situation remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The "reversible exile" mechanism is explained via summary rather than dramatized discovery; the copper nail retrieval happens off-page through a remote probe, denying the protagonist agency at the climax. Closure arrives as committee announcement via video link—a told resolution without visible cost or a final image that reweights prior material. Drive lens reads as attempted Causal but linkage breaks when convenience (Roy's sudden helpfulness, perfectly timed sonar data) resolves obstacles the protagonist did not create.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The weather station is described as "skeletal structure of sensors and whirring machinery" but never constrains a choice or becomes tactile. Alarms "sometimes blare" without affecting Elara's actions; the storm "brews outside" as wallpaper during the final report. The shipwreck and copper nail—potentially vivid—are viewed remotely via probe cameras, flattening sensory presence. Spatial choreography inside the station remains unclear; we never learn where Elara works, eats, or sleeps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—clearing the ancestor's name—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful choice with visible cost. Roy's suspicion evaporates without friction; the remote dive succeeds on first attempt; the committee grants exoneration after brief hesitation. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off faced. The "spongey dread" is asserted repeatedly but never translates into a decision that narrows Elara's path or forces sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of buried truth and restored honor is declared in the opening and closing rather than emerging from particulars. The copper nail functions as symbolic convenience—introduced late, retrieved without personal cost, presented as "sacred act" via assertion. The final line—"shifting winds outside seemed to carry a new tune, one of resolution and long-overdue justice"—states theme rather than earning resonance through image. The "reversible exile" concept remains abstract; we never see what reversal means beyond committee vote.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable and third-limited, but perceptual signature is thin—Elara's librarian lens never shapes what she notices or ignores. Diction occasionally drifts: "spongey dread" and "skeletal structure" read as imposed metaphor rather than character-particular perception. Roy's brief dialogue ("I'm here to study the atmospheric archives") is functional but carries no subtext or goal beyond information transfer. Psychic distance flattens during peak beats, summarizing emotion ("felt the dread intensify") instead of rendering perception under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "nervously confident" appears three times with synonym churn ("hands steady…tremor in her voice," "nervously confident determination," "voice nervously confident"). Template cadence runs through the middle third with repeated "she discovered," "she realized," "she felt" stems. The closing paragraph stacks filter verbs and abstractions—"felt a profound peace, the dread receding"—rather than grounding in concrete action or image. Figurative language mixes vehicles: "spongey dread" that "absorbs hope" clashes with dread that "morphs into frantic energy."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The core premise—coded journals revealing ancestor's innocence—follows a familiar template of historical vindication quest. The weather station setting and shifted jet stream remain ornamental, easily replaced by any remote archive location. The copper nail as proof-object and the committee-via-video-link resolution offer no fresh angle; the emotional arc progresses predictably from dread to peace without complication. No risk-taking in structure or perspectival choice; the piece reads as competent execution of a stock frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her "idealistic" and "map librarian" traits never constrain a choice—she could be any researcher. She unpacks gear, cross-references data, coordinates a dive, and presents findings, but these are procedural steps without decision friction. The climax (requesting exoneration) is a formality rather than a turn driven by her particular qualities.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The copper nail appears late (beyond the 40% mark) and is introduced as the solution rather than a constraint that shapes prior attempts. It is mentioned in a journal stanza early, retrieved via probe mid-story, and held "in hand" at closure, meeting the two-beat minimum. However, it resolves a problem (proof needed) without having pressured earlier choices, capping it at 4.6 per the resolver penalty. Small closure-linkage bump for the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Reversible exile" is explained as the central concept but operates as backstory exposition rather than on-page stakes. The mechanism (presenting proof at the submerged sentencing site) is summarized; the reversal itself is granted off-page by committee vote. It frames the quest but does not tighten options or force a trade-off during the story's present action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Nervously confident" appears three times as label—"hands steady…tremor in her voice," "nervously confident determination," "voice nervously confident"—but never constrains an action or creates visible cost. It functions as descriptor rather than attribute that enables or complicates a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Question" appears in three distinct beats: Elara's opening question about atmospheric archives (signaling hidden intent), her mid-story question to Roy about deep-sea probes (unlocking the dive), and her climactic question to the committee ("Will you now revoke the exile?"). Each advances the plot and the final one triggers the resolution. However, the climactic question is more formality than dramatic choice, limiting the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Coded stanzas are introduced early and mentioned across multiple beats—journal unpacking, cross-referencing, and final presentation. The method is signaled, but the mechanics remain vague: we never see Elara decipher a stanza on the page or struggle with ambiguity. The "copper nail from coffin" line is cited but not dramatized in translation, making the method functional but replaceable with any archival clue.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The experimental weather station is described but never pressures a choice or supplies resources that alter outcome. Alarms blare, a storm brews, but Elara's access to data banks and remote probes proceeds unimpeded. The setting could be swapped for any remote research outpost with minor edits. No micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) constrains action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the jet stream shifts" is mentioned twice—in the opening and closing—but the timeframe never tightens decisions or creates urgency. Elara's research proceeds at an untracked pace; no deadline or live clock alters her tactics. The shifted jet stream functions as atmospheric color rather than temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Honoring the ancestor's bravery is declared as motivation in the opening and restated at closure. It drives the overall quest but is not dramatized under friction—no moment where Elara must choose between honoring the ancestor and another live desire. The motivation remains singular and uncontested, told rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Spongey dread" is asserted five times across the piece—opening, mid-story intensification, morphing into "frantic energy," returning during committee deliberation, and receding at closure. It is labeled rather than embodied; the tone does not modulate with scene pressure or reflect in syntax and perception. The final "profound peace" arrival is declared, not charged through image.</comment>
