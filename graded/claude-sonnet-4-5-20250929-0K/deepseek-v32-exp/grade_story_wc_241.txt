<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared early ("widen perspectives responsibly") but her interior life relies heavily on abstract reflection rather than embodied contradiction. The father exists primarily as backstory and symbol; his journal appears late without prior setup. Agency at closure—deciding to teach—feels summarized rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. Label-heavy interiority ("clover melancholy," "lucid contradictions") substitutes for character-particular thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elara is beyond "daughter" and where she begins (subway? home?) remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure—deciding to teach—is told in summary ("Elara decided to teach others") without a scene that dramatizes the choice or its cost. The causal lens is undercut by coincidence: cryptic scrawls conveniently point to the library where her father's journal waits, resolving a problem the scrawls did not help create. No visible cost at the ending; the lantern swings as symbol, not constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The rainwashed library and mica-pane lantern offer vivid sensory anchors. Spatial choreography within the library (stacks, journal location) remains generic; the subway setting is a transit device rather than a pressure point. The lantern's "kaleidoscope of shadows" and "shimmer with new patterns" describe effect without showing how light or mica constrain Elara's search or charge the closure image with tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—widening perspectives responsibly—is announced but never tested by a concrete on-page choice with competing costs. Elara's subway journeys and library visit proceed without resistance, reversal, or tactical adaptation. The journal appears as a late gift rather than an earned discovery; no pressure escalates to force a decision at closure. Her resolve to teach is declared, not dramatized through sacrifice or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emergent: "lucid contradictions are not flaws to be resolved, but truths to be lived" and "to be theoretically rebellious is to challenge not just theories, but the way we live them" are explicit thesis sentences. The final paragraph moralizes ("testament to the clover melancholy of growth") instead of letting image carry resonance. No concrete particular reweights prior material; the lantern and mica pane recur as decorative tokens without evolving pressure or payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Diction remains stable and literary throughout, with a consistent reflective distance. Register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("lucid contradictions," "embrace both the certainty of statistics and the randomness of the human heart") that reads ornamental rather than character-particular under pressure. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw," "she realized") cluster in reflective passages but do not flatten immediacy fatally. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "lucid contradictions" appears six times, "clover melancholy" five times, "rainwashed" three times, often in adjacent or nearby sentences without added meaning. Template cadence dominates the final third: "She [verb], [noun]" and "The [noun] [verb], a [noun] of [abstraction]" recur mechanically. Line 18 ("His rebellion was not against math, but against its sobering truths") and line 28 ("For in the end, to be theoretically rebellious is to challenge not just theories, but the way we live them") restate theme without propulsion. Figurative language stacks without coherence: "clover melancholy of renewal and decay" mixes botanical with emotional register unconvincingly. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—daughter of a gambler/probability professor seeks meaning through cryptic messages—echoes familiar "signs and portents" templates. The lantern with equations, scrawls as coded probabilities, and the journal discovery feel orchestrated rather than inevitable. Emotional arc (grief → acceptance → resolve to teach) follows a predictable trajectory without a non-obvious turn. No bold structural risk; the piece hedges between lyric accumulation and causal progression without committing fully to either.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout as backstory anchor and motivation seed. The father's gambling and probability teaching frame Elara's quest, but he never appears on the page; the journal is discovered late. No on-page choice hinges on his specific traits; he could be swapped for "any parent with a tragic flaw" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 1), handled twice (lit in library, extinguished at closure), and returns in final paragraph. The mica pane "etched with faint equations" and casting "kaleidoscope of shadows" offers vivid detail, but the lantern never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Its symbolic recurrence charges the ending image modestly but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Repeated as a thematic label ("lucid contradictions") six times but never dramatized as a choice dilemma. The father's life is described as embodying contradictions, yet Elara does not face competing goods or unavoidable harms on the page. The concept functions as theme claim, not stake or tactic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Applied to the father ("theoretically rebellious nature") and restated at closure ("to be theoretically rebellious is to challenge not just theories, but the way we live them"). No visible on-page action constrained or enabled by rebellion; the trait is told, not shown through choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Signaled early ("traverse the city") and recurs as her method (subway rides, library journey, final subway return). Traversal organizes the narrative arc and provides spatial progression, but the action itself does not create turns; she could arrive by any means. The method matters more for atmosphere than causality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Introduced early ("interpreting cryptic scrawls on subway seats") and frames her search method. One scrawl points to the library, but the mechanics remain vague: how does she decode them? The method delivers a convenient solution (library location) without prior setup of interpretive rules or cost, capping score per the late-resolution limiter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The library appears in the second half, receives vivid description (stone facade, damp paper scent, midsummer quietude), and houses the journal discovery. It provides atmosphere and the closure location, but does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome. Setting functions as backdrop, not tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Established in the title phrase ("after the heart attack") and frames Elara's motivation (grief, search for meaning). Time does not tighten decisions; no urgency or deadline shapes her journey. The heart attack is past event, not live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Stated explicitly ("widen perspectives responsibly") and restated at closure ("decided to teach others... the wisdom to navigate uncertainties"). The motivation drives her quest structurally, but no on-page scene dramatizes friction between widening and responsibility or tests the desire against competing costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" recurs five times as a label, described as "bitter yet hopeful" and "sorrow and hope intertwine like vines." Tone remains uniformly reflective and elegiac throughout without modulation under pressure. The phrase itself is ornamental; removing it would not alter emotional trajectory or closure charge.</comment>
