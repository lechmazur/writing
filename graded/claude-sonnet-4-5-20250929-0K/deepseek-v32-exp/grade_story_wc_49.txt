<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared rather than shown through contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("profound peace," "whimsical nature") and abstract labels without embodied tension. The final "choice" to continue singing lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives—she completes her task without struggle or trade-off. No meaningful internal conflict complicates her arc; she executes a plan smoothly from hum to crescendo.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty (−0.4): who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but "verdant arbor" remains generic and the motivating decay/blight is told, not shown through prior failed attempts or visible consequences. Closure reads as Decisive Change (arbor restored), but cost is absent—no path foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The inferred lens is Causal (songs → restoration), yet the because/therefore chain is mechanical: she sings, the vine glows, life returns, with no complication or narrowing of options. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elara sacrificed or lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting is visually described ("emerald leaves and silver dew") but remains a postcard backdrop. The arbor's decay is asserted, not demonstrated through blocked movement or resource scarcity that would constrain Elara's choices. Spatial choreography is vague—no clear distance, obstacles, or micro-environment pressures. The vine tendril's physical handling (cool, trembling, curling) provides some embodied detail, lifting the score slightly, but the setting does not shape tactics or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore the arbor) is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening: Elara hums, the vine responds, she sings louder, restoration completes. Coincidence does not complicate; the "timeframe of alignment" arrives on cue without effort or trade-off. Agency is execution of a known method, not decision under pressure. The resolution lacks visible price—her pockets still jingle, her spirit is "alight," and no live option was foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme (memory, restoration, cycles) is declared through meta-commentary ("These narratives were not mere words; they were the essence") rather than arising from concrete choice. The "golden stories" and "harvest moon" recur as ornamental motifs without constraining action or reweighting prior material at closure. The ending offers no non-literal answer—restoration is stated directly, and the final image (tendril "spinning silently into the future") is a thematic Echo rather than earned resonance. No complexity or counter-reading emerges.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("benevolent energy," "sacred renewal") that clashes with Elara's whimsical tinkerer framing. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is generic—she notices what the plot needs (dew, leaves, vine) without character-specific bias. Psychic distance remains static; no modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "understood") dull immediacy in key beats without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "sacred practices" restated across four paragraphs; "golden stories" repeated nine times with minimal variation. Template cadence: "The [noun] [verbed]" runs for five consecutive beats mid-story (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("tapestry of emerald leaves," "beacon of sacred renewal") and therapy-speak ("profound peace," "emotional honesty") flatten texture. Figurative density in the final third obscures propulsion without taught pattern (−0.6). Artifacts touch closure ("spinning silently into the future" echoes prior loops), disallowing 9+ globally and capping Q7 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Premise (healing through forgotten song) is a familiar fantasy template executed without fresh inflection. Elara's whimsical tinkerer trait is label-only—no on-page tinkering with gears or improvisation under constraint. The "timeframe of alignment" and "golden stories" arrive as convenience rather than earned surprise. Emotional template (declaration → execution → peace) offers no risky or counter-intuitive turn. Transformation test fails: swap "vine tendril" for any other artifact and "songs" for ritual, and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her goal frames the arc, but her choices do not create reversals—she executes a known plan. Setup (first paragraph), development (sings to activate vine), closure (arbor restored). Swappable with "healer" or "ritualist" with minor edits (−0.7). No visible cost tied to her specific whimsical tinkering trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vine tendril appears in setup (first paragraph), middle (trembles, pulses, glows), and closure (curls around wrist, "keeper of golden stories"). Three beats (+1.4), but handling is passive—Elara carries it, it responds. No cost or trade-off tied to its use. Specificity weak: "slender form," "vibrant" are generic. Lyric reprise (first → last) reweights slightly but does not transform prior material.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Harvest moon mentioned three times as thematic symbol ("loomed in her thoughts," "essence lingered") but never alters tactics or constrains choice. Setup (paragraph 6), absent in middle beats, closure cameo ("wisdom endured"). No closure participation—vine and songs do the work. Ornamental (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Spins golden stories" is asserted early and demonstrated in middle beats (stories unfold, depict rituals). Setup, development, closure cameo present. But the trait is passive—Elara does not trade or sacrifice to unlock it, and its mechanics ("right conditions") are vague. No visible cost (−0.6). Swappable with "reveals visions" (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Remedy is the dominant stake and closure goal. Setup (paragraph 8), development (method applied), closure (arbor revitalized). Drives two beats (+0.9). But the remedy is executed without complication—no failed attempt or cost. Swappable with "healing" or "restoration" (−0.7). Closure linkage present (+1.0).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Forgotten songs signaled early (method paragraph), applied in middle (hum → sing → crescendo), shape closure (restoration completes). Three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (songs enable remedy, +1.0), closure linkage (+1.2). Specificity weak: no lyric content, cadence, or trade-off in melody choice. Cost unclear—why were they forgotten, and what price to recall them?</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Verdant arbor framed in opening and closing lines (lyric reprise, +0.6). Decay asserted but not shown through blocked movement or scarcity. Setting does not constrain choice; Elara has free access and no environmental obstacles. Dawn provides ambient light but no tactical pressure. Postcard description (−0.9).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"When everything aligns" declared twice but never tracked as a live constraint. No clock pressure—alignment arrives on cue without cost. Setup (paragraph 7), absent in middle, closure mention ("moment of perfect harmony"). Vague (−1.0), does not alter tactics (−0.9).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Motivation to restore sacred practices stated in paragraph 3 and closure ("she had fulfilled her motivation"). Setup, closure present; middle beats show execution but no friction between desire and cost. Told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses (−0.7). No visible trade-off or foreclosed path (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Gathering hush appears in opening, middle ("deepened"), and closure ("remained"). Three touches (+1.0), lyric reprise (+0.6). Tone is static—no modulation under pressure or contrast when vine activates. Does not charge final image beyond label. Coherent but unvaried (−0.8).</comment>
