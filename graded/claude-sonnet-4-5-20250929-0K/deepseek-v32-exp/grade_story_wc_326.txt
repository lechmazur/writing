<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand her catastrophic failure and her constant heartbeat counting are established early and consistently embodied. The transition from counting obsessively to final acceptance is earned through the ink-defragmentation sequence, with the porcelain shard materializing internal change. However, interiority occasionally slips into label-speak ("graceful acceptance," "newfound clarity") that abstracts rather than dramatizes the shift. The digital ghost Kael functions more as narrative device than pressuring presence—his warnings and fears are shown through ink patterns but don't create genuine conflict on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Elara, opal observatory, post-catastrophe). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered memory fragments in ink until the final cadence shift delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis—she stops counting, integrates the shard as lesson, accepts the loss). Cost is legible: she releases obsessive proof-of-life rituals and acknowledges her reckless leadership. One meaningful deepening occurs when ink patterns coalesce into distinct choices rather than tragedy-blur, reweighting her stance from haunted to whole. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal observatory's milky luminescence and encasing snow create coherent atmospheric pressure for midnight reckoning. The spilled ink on the workbench becomes functional micro-setting, constraining the defragmentation method and charging the final image when its patterns "fix in her mind forever." Spatial choreography remains clear (floor shard, desk, workbench, dome above). The porcelain shard and ink anchor tactile choices. However, the observatory itself remains somewhat postcard—its structure and resources don't alter Elara's tactical options beyond providing solitude.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled: fetch wisdom from failure, understand the catastrophe. One meaningful tightening occurs when ink patterns force Elara to see "not as a blur of tragedy, but as a series of distinct, understandable choices," narrowing her interpretive options and confronting her culpability. Her agency—choosing to defragment via ephemeral ink, examining Kael's acceptance, placing the shard in the drawer—drives the resolution. Visible cost: she must acknowledge her "reckless confidence" and that she ignored warnings, forfeiting the protective narrative of blameless victimhood. Escalation is textural/accumulative rather than causal, fitting the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara's enacted choice to parse failure as teacher rather than monster. The porcelain shard's transformation from symbol of breakage to artifact of lesson is purposeful and non-literal. Final image—"she did not count"—answers the opening's obsessive heartbeat proof without stating a moral. "Failure was not a monster, but a teacher" teeters on the edge of moralizing but is anchored in the specific ink-sequence that dramatized her culpability. Subtext operates in Kael's "silent acceptance" and the shard's cold weight, avoiding abstraction until the final third where "graceful acceptance" and "gentle solace" edge toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtered through Elara's sensory particulars (heartbeat counting, ink shimmer, shard coldness). Perceptual signature is consistent: survivor guilt colors every observation. Kael's digital ghost dialogue is economical and functionally distinct ("defragment the data" synthesizes memory/machine idiom). However, narrative distance occasionally slips into elevated summary—"the wisdom she sought" and "hard-won understanding" feel more authorial than character-grounded. Diction remains within Elara's technical-survivor lexicon without jarring register shifts. Free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with short declarative beats alternating with longer reflective lines. Information density is high in the ink-sequence paragraphs where memory coalesces into discrete images. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She had fetched what she needed" / "fetched her wisdom" and "deep, peaceful quiet" / "absolute quiet" recycle phrasing. Template cadence emerges in repeated "The [noun]" openers across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors intrude: "internal fires" for clarity, "steady flow of life." Figurative language clusters in final third without clear pattern payoff. Line-level clarity is good; no causality breaks, but scaffold and synonym churn accumulate to −0.6 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The opal observatory, death-certificate survivor premise, and defragmentation-through-ink synthesis offer a fresh angle on grief and reckoning. Specific verifiable detail (digital ghost, porcelain shard, ink patterns) grounds the speculative frame. However, the emotional arc—survivor confronts guilt, achieves acceptance—follows a familiar template. The final "she could finally sleep" resolution and "sanctuary not prison" reframing are earned but predictable. Transformation test: swap names/setting and the arc remains largely unchanged. No proximity echoes of famous lines detected. Risk-taking is modest; the piece executes competently within its chosen lane without bold structural or perspectival gambles.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Death certificate error survivor frames the premise and drives Elara's proof-of-life obsession (heartbeat counting). Her choice to defragment and ultimately stop counting closes the arc. Present in setup, middle reflection, and ending. However, the "error survivor" label itself doesn't constrain choices—her guilt over Kael's death does the causal work. The administrative error is texture, not pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Porcelain shard appears early ("cold floor near her desk"), is handled at midpoint ("felt cold in her hand"), and closes with deliberate placement in a drawer, reweighted from "symbol of breakage" to "artifact of a lesson learned." Three beats, meaningful reprise, causal participation in closure. Specificity—porcelain, singular, sharp—matters. Scores in solid causal-involvement band but stops short of indispensable: the ink does more mechanical work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Digital ghost of Kael is signaled early, materializes as "flicker of pale light," guides the defragmentation process ("helping her mind defragment the chaotic stream"), and fades when "its purpose fulfilled." Present across setup, middle guidance, and closure participation. Its synthesis of "memory and machine" provides the method's supernatural/tech frame. Without it, Elara's self-examination lacks external anchor and the observatory remains solitary monologue. Core concept shapes stakes (understanding Kael's death) and tactics (ghost-guided ink reading).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Heartbeat counting is present from paragraph 3 ("constant, quiet counting of her own heartbeats"), accelerates under pressure ("frantic drum against her ribs"), slows to "calm, steady rhythm," and ends with "she did not count." Constrains her attention and embodies survivor guilt across four beats. Final cessation marks acceptance, providing closure charge. Causal role: the counting is both symptom and measure of her state. Visible cost at end: relinquishing the compulsive proof.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Defragment the data" is introduced by the ghost in early beat, performed through ink patterns at midpoint ("defragment the chaotic stream of sensory and emotional data"), and completes when "she had defragmented her history, and in doing so, had made herself whole again." Action drives all three gates, organizes the story's central mechanism, and is irreplaceable—no synonym captures the tech/memory fusion. The act redefines her understanding from "blur of tragedy" to "series of distinct, understandable choices." Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ephemeral patterns in spilled ink are signaled as "the only method that could organize the shattered pieces," demonstrated at midpoint when "delicate, transient lines began to form," show reactor core and Kael's face, and close as "dry, its patterns fixed in her mind forever." The method's mechanics—watching ink coalesce into memory images—shape the entire middle sequence and provide the vehicle for her insight. Present in all three gates, drives two major beats, and charges the final image. Ink's ephemerality vs. permanence-in-mind echoes theme.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Opal observatory under snow is established in opening line, provides "perfect atmosphere of midnight solace for this reckoning," and closes with brightening dome and "testament to resilience." Setup and closure participation present; middle involvement is atmospheric only—snow and encasement don't constrain her choices. The setting pressures mood but not tactics. Lyric reprise (prison → sanctuary) reweights meaning at end. Two of three gates, purposeful early-final arc, but swappable with any isolated introspective space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the radio static cleared" appears twice (paragraphs 4 and 27), framing a before/after window but not functioning as live clock. The timeframe signals post-catastrophe and a threshold into silence, but doesn't tighten decisions—Elara's examination unfolds without time pressure. Setup present, closure echo present, but middle development absent. The phrase charges atmosphere more than tactics. Missing middle gate caps at 4.6; lyric reprise lifts slightly within band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To fetch wisdom from failure" is stated as singular motivation in paragraph 5, dramatized through the ink-defragmentation sequence where she confronts her "reckless confidence," and fulfilled at closure: "She had fetched what she needed from the ruins of her failure." Present in all three gates. The desire creates friction when she must accept culpability ("saw herself ignore his warnings"). Motivation drives the central action and shapes the ending's acceptance. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; "fetch" recurs purposefully.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Midnight solace is established early ("perfect atmosphere of midnight solace"), modulates through "frantic drum" acceleration and "peaceful quiet," and closes with "solace of midnight, a time for peace after the long noise of static." Tone coheres through turns: haunted opening, pressured middle examination, earned calm at end. The shift from terror to companionship ("midnight held no more terror, only the quiet company of hard-won understanding") charges the final image. Cadence modulation fits accumulative lens. Present across all gates, purposeful evolution, strong closure participation.</comment>
