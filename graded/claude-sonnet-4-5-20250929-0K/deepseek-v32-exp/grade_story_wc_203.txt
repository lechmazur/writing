<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivation to discover what ceilings hide is consistent, and his dual role as repairman-medium is internally coherent. However, the emotional arc remains largely flat—his "weightless burden" is labeled repeatedly without embodied contradiction or visible cost in his decisions. The ghost interactions feel passive; Leo listens and promises rather than facing a choice that forecloses a path. The closure moment (packing the barrel, feeling "quiet pride") asserts change without dramatizing the price or tension that would earn it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece infers an Accumulative lens: dust patterns, hidden compartment, and gathering ghost stories build toward a thematic reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first ~100 words. The closure—Leo's promise to honor the clockmaker and the ghosts fading—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: he accepts his role), but the cost remains abstract ("weightless burden now a quiet pride") rather than showing a foreclosed option or visible trade-off on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovery of ledgers and ghost backstories), but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly sketched with faded posters, overhead fluorescent buzz, and dusty surfaces. Spatial choreography (ladder, ceiling, rafters) remains clear throughout. The mainspring barrel and dust patterns function as micro-setting elements that guide Leo's investigation, but the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it serves as backdrop rather than crucible. The setting earns functional credit but does not reach the constraint/charge threshold for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to discover what ceilings hide—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Leo's investigation escalates from floor dust to wall compartment to ceiling rafters, and the appearance of multiple ghosts deepens the pressure. However, the escalation is exploratory rather than agonistic: no live dilemma forces Leo to trade one good for another, and the resolution (promising to return the barrel) costs him nothing visible on the page. The tightening is present but the price legibility needed for higher bands is missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges around honoring forgotten wrongs and bearing witness, which fits Leo's arc. The "weightless burden" motif recurs but is stated rather than embodied in choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The closure offers a quiet answer—Leo finds purpose in mending the past—but the final paragraph moralizes ("it was never just about the mechanics; it was about the memories") instead of letting the image resonate. The thematic echo in the last lines ("light as air yet enduring as steel") reads as prompt-like summary rather than earned particularity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, filtering setting and ghost encounters through Leo's professional calm. The prose voice is workmanlike and clear but lacks perceptual signature—Leo's way of noticing reads generic rather than character-specific. Dialogue with the ghost is minimal and functional. The repeated phrase "weightless burden" and similar constructions ("he was motivated," "he decided," "he knew") flatten voice through template stems, but the effect does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are sound; no pronoun confusion or tense drift. However, paraphrase loops abound: "The silence felt heavier, more profound" immediately after "the quiet would change everything"; "cracks in the façade" appears three times with near-identical phrasing; "weightless burden" recurs five times without evolution. Template cadence is pervasive—"He [verb]" opens at least a dozen sentences, creating drumbeat monotony. The final paragraph stacks summary statements ("He was just a repairman... He mended the past... The weightless burden was his to bear") that dull the closure image. Apply −1.2 for loops, template runs, and closure-beat summary stacking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—elevator repairman who sees ghosts investigates an abandoned circus—offers a fresh synthesis of occupation and supernatural detective. However, execution leans on familiar beats: hidden object, wronged spirit, promise of restitution. The emotional arc (burdened → at peace) and the closure image (driving away with new story) are stock resolutions for the ghost-helper archetype. Dust-pattern analysis and the horologist's barrel add specificity, but the story does not transform the template through bold stakes or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Leo is present throughout and his dual identity (repairman/medium) frames the investigation. He makes functional decisions (climb ladder, engage ghost, promise to return barrel), but none involve visible trade-offs or constrain later moves. His ghost-seeing ability enables discovery but does not create pressure or cost on the page. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mainspring barrel appears in the hidden compartment (middle), is held as the clockmaker's ghost materializes, and is pocketed at the end with a promise to honor it. It touches three beats and links to closure, but its properties remain static—it symbolizes broken promises without mechanically altering Leo's choices. The object's meaning does not evolve; it is a token rather than a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" is mentioned three times: as a visible crack in plaster, then as metaphor for fractured memories, then again as "less menacing" after resolution. The concept operates thematically but does not shape tactics or narrow options. It could be replaced with "hidden truths" or "buried secrets" with minimal edits. Present in middle and ending but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is labeled in the opening and demonstrated through dust-pattern analysis and ceiling inspection. However, the trait enables discovery without cost—Leo's keen eye does not force him to overlook something else or create friction. It functions as a professional competence rather than a trait that constrains choice. Present throughout but swappable with "thorough" or "detail-oriented."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Engage" appears as a decision point twice: Leo decides to engage the spirit after the clockmaker appears, then engages in deeper conversation to learn the backstory. This action drives the middle turn (ghosts materialize, stories are pieced together) and shapes the ending (Leo's promise). However, "engage" is broad enough that "listen" or "speak" could substitute. Present in setup (as future intent), middle (enacted), and ending (referenced), with causal pressure on two beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dust analysis is introduced early ("analyzing dust accumulation patterns on the floor and walls") and leads to discovery of the hidden compartment. Later, uneven dust around the ceiling crack suggests recent movement, prompting Leo to investigate the rafters. The method shapes two investigative beats and primes the discovery that enables closure. However, the mechanics are generic—any observational skill could yield the same results. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office provides the spatial arena (floor, boarded window, ceiling, rafters) and thematic backdrop (wronged circus workers). It supplies the hidden compartment and overhead space that Leo investigates. The setting's decay and layered history charge the ghost encounters. Present in setup, structures middle action (ladder climb, rafter search), and is referenced in the final image. The office is integral to the investigation but does not impose a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"When the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" is signaled as the moment Leo waits for, and the silence's arrival marks the start of his investigative work. At the end, "the fluorescent light buzzing back to life" bookends the sequence. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Leo works at his own pace with no clock pressure. The buzz functions as atmospheric marker rather than constraint. Present in setup and ending; minimal causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To discover what ceilings hide" is stated as Leo's belief and motivation in the opening, drives his ladder climb and rafter search, and is affirmed in the closing reflection ("he would always be drawn to such places"). The desire is consistent and shapes his investigative arc. However, it is never tested against a competing want or cost—Leo pursues it without friction. Present across all three gates but without dramatized conflict or visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" is introduced as Leo's gift, repeated five times throughout, and appears in the final paragraph ("carried it well"). The phrase gestures toward paradox (burden that is weightless) but remains a label—Leo never demonstrates the burden's weight through choice or trade-off. Tone is consistent (calm, reflective) but static; it does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image with new meaning. Present throughout but ornamental.</comment>
