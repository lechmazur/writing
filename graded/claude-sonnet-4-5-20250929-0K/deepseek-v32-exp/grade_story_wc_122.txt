<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's journey from numbness to reawakening is clear and her agency drives the phonograph experiment, but key moments rely on telling rather than embodied contradiction—"no longer numb" is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in action. The backward-song transformation occurs too smoothly without visible resistance or cost beyond tears of reawakening. Interior voice occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("filament of hush had guided her") that reads more thematic than character-particular under duress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (reawakening through backward vibration) with Elara's final teaching stance showing altered options, and the cost is visible in her journey from isolation to communion. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (cavern, Kael, Elara's deafness by line 4). The accumulative/textural lens holds through the phonograph experiment, building density via vibration-as-language. However, the final third multiplies declarative theme statements ("defeat emotional numbness was not about drowning out silence") that summarize rather than let the image speak, weakening the closure's resonance by ~0.4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cavern setting (shaped wood, stretched hides, hammer tap) anchors early and the phonograph's vibrations through wood constrain Elara's sensory access, charging the transformation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (she "felt more than heard"). Spatial choreography remains clear across the phonograph corner, workbench, and drum-lined walls. The broken needle pressed into clay at closure supplies a concrete micro-setting payoff that reweights her journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escaping emotional numbness—is signaled in line 1 and pressure accumulates through the backward-song experiment, which narrows her isolation into communion. One meaningful deepening occurs when vibrations shift from "chaotic pulse" to "filament of hush," altering her sensory stance. Cost is legible in her tears and the mark left in clay. However, Kael's role remains passive observation without applying secondary pressure, and the transformation's smoothness (no false starts, no cost to the experiment itself) slightly undercuts escalation texture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (silence as canvas, listening with one's whole being) emerges organically from the phonograph experiment and sensory particulars. The broken needle's shift from loss-symbol to connection-carver shows purposeful image reweighting. However, the final third over-explains theme: "defeat emotional numbness was not about drowning out silence, but listening to its depths" and "music is not merely heard but felt" state the premise rather than letting the clay-mark image and piano scene resonate without commentary. The mirrored-hush motif recurs but borders on decorative recurrence without additional pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping; her perceptual filter (vibration over sound) is consistent and character-specific. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during phonograph immersion, pulling back for teaching-room denouement). Dialogue is spare and goal-driven ("Can you fix it?" pursues hope; Kael's reply reframes purpose). Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("filament of hush," "tapestry of silence") that reads thematic rather than immediate perception, though the effect remains largely legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice cleanly. Information density is high in the phonograph sequence. However, pervasive scaffold and paraphrase loops dull momentum: "audibly muted save for" / "This audibly muted performance" / "mirrored hush"; "rustle of turning seasons" appears four times with minimal reweighting; "filament of hush" recurs as decorative echo. Synonym churn clusters around silence/hush/stillness. Template cadence runs in the final third: "She [verb]" / "Elara [verb]" across adjacent lines. These patterns accumulate to −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The backward-phonograph premise offers a fresh angle on rediscovering music through deafness, and the broken needle as imperfection-as-key is non-obvious. Emotional specificity (vibrations etching patterns into soul, thawing ice within) avoids generic templates in places. However, the deaf-teacher-finds-healing and broken-object-gains-new-purpose frames are familiar, and the transformation lacks friction or failed attempts that would deepen ingenuity. The teaching-room coda and student scene feel appended rather than inevitable, reducing synthesis tightness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara appears in setup (line 1), her choice to use the needle drives the middle phonograph experiment (beats ~14–23), and her teaching stance at closure shows altered options. Her decisions create the key turn from numbness to reawakening. Cost is visible in tears and the clay mark. Minor deduction for the teaching-room scene feeling slightly appended rather than causally tight to the cavern closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken phonograph needle is introduced early (line 6), Elara picks it up and asks Kael about it (beat 1), slots it into the machine to enable the backward play (beat 2), and presses it into clay at closure (beat 3) as a journey marker. Its brokenness is specified as enabling "something else entirely" and it "carved pathways of connection." Swappability is low (a functional needle would not serve the imperfection-as-key theme). Closure linkage is strong with the clay-mark payoff. Cost connection is present (symbol of loss transformed). Minor deduction for the mechanics of how brokenness specifically alters playback remaining abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "filament of hush" is named at line 16 as the thread weaving through chaos, recurs as Elara's recall anchor (line 38), and is tied to her learning in line 39 ("that filament of hush"). It shapes her sensory reorientation and appears in closure framing. However, it reads more as poetic label than a mechanical constraint—removing the exact phrase would not break story logic; "thread of stillness" or "core of silence" would serve identically. The concept charges theme but does not narrow tactical options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" appears twice as descriptor (line 3 cavern, line 21 performance) but does not constrain action—the deafness itself (separate trait) drives sensory access, and "audibly muted" functions as atmospheric synonym for quiet rather than a trait that enables or forecloses a choice. Swappable with "quiet" or "silent" with negligible impact. Label-only use without on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Enthrall" appears once in middle framing (line 25: "used the phonograph to enthrall not an audience, but herself") and is echoed at closure (line 35: students "enthralled by her presence"). The action of self-captivation via backward songs drives the transformation and the teaching payoff. However, the verb itself is abstract—"immerse," "captivate," or "transport" would serve nearly identically. The enthralling shapes one key turn (phonograph immersion) and returns at closure, but swappability limits indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are introduced at line 13 as Kael's suggestion, Elara executes the method at line 15 (disk spun reverse), and the backward melodies provide the sensory unraveling (lines 17–20) that drives her reawakening. The method's mechanics matter (vibrations reach fingertips, crescendos become whispers) and it shapes the central transformation. Present in setup, middle execution, and closure framing. Minor deduction for the suggestion coming from Kael rather than Elara discovering it, slightly reducing her agency.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern anchors setup (lines 2–4: shaped wood, hides, hammer), houses the phonograph in the corner, and provides the taut drum skins that hum in sympathy (line 18), creating environmental resonance. Elara steps out at line 33, and the needle remains there as testament at line 36. The cavern constrains sensory access (audibly muted) and supplies the vibration-conducting surfaces. Closure participation is present but indirect (she leaves; the needle stays). Would score higher if the space itself forced a tactical choice rather than serving as container for the phonograph action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Faint rustle of turning seasons" appears in setup (line 2), syncs with rhythm at line 26, brackets her learning at line 39, and is mentioned as "companion" at line 33. The seasonal frame provides lyric resonance and mirrors transformation (dying leaves, natural metronome). However, it does not tighten decisions or create time pressure—the phonograph experiment could occur in any season with negligible change. Timeframe functions thematically rather than tactically. Late lyric reprise lifts score slightly but swappability and lack of urgency limit height.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation to defeat emotional numbness is stated in setup (line 1: "escape her emotional numbness"), drives her question to Kael and phonograph choice, and is dramatized through the transformation (line 23: "no longer numb," line 28: tears of reawakening). Friction appears in her initial cool, waiting heart and the struggle to feel buried emotions. Closure shows the motivation fulfilled with cost (tears, journey mark). Minor deduction for "defeat emotional numbness" being directly stated in line 30 rather than left implicit, and for the reawakening reading slightly smooth without sustained conflicting impulses in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" is named in lines 27 and 40 as the space where silence reflects silence and becomes her lifelong melody. Tone throughout is contemplative, quiet, and textural (audibly muted cavern, filament of hush, profound stillness), coherent with the concept. The hush modulates as chaos becomes stillness (line 16) and charges the final image (line 40: "mirrored hush had become her melody"). However, the exact phrase "mirrored hush" appears only twice and functions more as thematic label than a tonal constraint shaping sentence rhythm or closure pressure. Tone is consistent but not indispensably tied to this specific phrase; "reflected silence" or "doubled quiet" would serve nearly identically.</comment>
