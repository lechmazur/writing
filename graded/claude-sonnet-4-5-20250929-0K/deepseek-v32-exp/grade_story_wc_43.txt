<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but never tested by meaningful internal conflict; she executes her method flawlessly without struggle or cost. Alistair's reconciliation with Lena feels mechanical—his dictated message and the vinyl gift resolve the estrangement without dramatized friction or trade-offs. The "decisively kind" attribute appears as a label rather than a trait that constrains choices. Elara's competence is unbroken, leaving no visible mistakes or blind spots that would compound pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph and maintains clear orientation. However, the closure lacks felt cost: Alistair's peaceful death and Lena's gratitude offer symmetric satisfaction without foreclosing a path or reweighting prior material with visible price. The causal chain (blood work → message → reunion → death) is linear but unearned; the vinyl and message solve the estrangement they did not help create. The final image (broken vinyl as wholeness) is asserted thematically rather than earned through on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The Radiant Haven setting is vivid (mountains, clouds, jasmine) but remains postcard description; it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that affect outcome. The vinyl shard is handled in multiple beats and gains symbolic weight, lifting micro-setting above ornamental. Spatial choreography is clean (room, window, terrace) but the environment never pressures tactics or the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—executing a flawless goodbye—is signaled early but never meaningfully tested. Elara's method succeeds without complication; Lena arrives on cue, reconciliation unfolds smoothly, and Alistair dies peacefully. No reversal narrows options or raises cost; the single "tightening" (Lena's arrival) is coincidental rather than driven by protagonist agency. The resolution awards equal satisfaction (peace, forgiveness, memorial) without visible trade-offs scaled to this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of fragmented wholeness is stated directly in the final paragraphs ("broken things can inspire unity," "even shattered things can inspire unity") rather than emerging from particulars. The "scent of hope" and "pulsing stillness" are repeated as prompt labels without dramatized cost. Elara's insight that "hymning the mundane was not just a method, but a way of life" is abstract philosophizing disconnected from scene pressure. The ending moralizes ("every goodbye, when done with care, could be flawless") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored to Elara with no head-hopping. However, voice lacks distinct perceptual signature; diction is elevated and uniform across narrative beats without modulation under pressure ("decisively kind," "pulsing stillness," "hymning the mundane"). Alistair's dialogue ("Clara and I danced to this at our wedding") and Elara's tag-free exchanges are serviceable but lack subtext. The prose reads as averaged consensus rather than a singular mind filtering events.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy template cadence pervades: "She [verb]," "Elara [verb]," and "The [noun] [verb]" stems dominate across the opening and closing thirds, including the final paragraph. Paraphrase loops recur: "reunify" appears five times, "pulsing stillness" three times, "hymning the mundane" four times, and "decisively kind/kindness" three times without evolving meaning. Synonym churn ("execute," "facilitating," "sacred work") and stock metaphors ("fragments can hold wholeness," "light to the darkest transitions") flatten momentum. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the global 9+ disallow and high-band cap at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The hospice-therapist-facilitates-reunion premise follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The vinyl shard as reconciliation token is a conventional symbol; the "flawless goodbye" goal and its seamless execution lack fresh inflection or risk. Elara's method ("hymning the mundane") is named but not dramatized in a way that feels inevitable in hindsight. The piece avoids bold choices in favor of median, safe resolutions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her choices are declarative rather than pressured; she smooths sheets, sings, suggests a message, and steps back without on-page cost or tactical shifts. Her role as facilitator means most turns trace to Alistair or Lena rather than her agency. Present and functional but swappable with a generic "kind caregiver" archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The vinyl shard appears in three beats (introduction, gift to Lena, bedside at death) and is signaled early. It carries symbolic weight (Mahler, wedding memory, "fragments can hold wholeness") and participates in the closure image. However, its mechanics are static; it does not constrain choices or evolve in meaning beyond the initial setup. The element shapes one key turn (the gift) and is present at the ending, qualifying for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"The scent of hope" is mentioned four times as a descriptive tag (jasmine blossoms, jasmine and fresh rain, lingering reminder, "fragile yet persistent fragrance") but never shapes stakes or tactics. It remains ornamental atmosphere without altering options or charging the final image. Present but not integrated into pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" is named twice ("Elara was decisively kind," "decisively kindness") as a label without constraining or enabling on-page action with visible cost. Her smoothing sheets and calm tone are competent but lack friction or trade-offs. The attribute does not force a choice between competing goods or unavoidable harms.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Reunify" drives two beats: the message that reunifies Alistair and Lena, and the framing that Elara "reunifies souls with their deepest truths." The reconciliation is a major turn and the verb recurs in the closure paragraph. However, the action is easily swappable with "reconcile" or "reconnect" without structural loss; its specificity does not define options in a way only "reunify" could.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Hymning the mundane" is named four times and demonstrated in two beats (singing about breathing, steam, sunlight). The method appears early and is revisited at closure ("she knew that hymning the mundane was not just a method, but a way of life"). However, its mechanics never matter to the outcome; Elara's singing succeeds without complication or tactical adjustment. Functional but replaceable with any calming technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The Radiant Haven is described vividly (mountains, clouds, jasmine terrace, window framing sky) and is present in the opening and closing beats. However, the setting never pressures choices or alters tactics; it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The high-altitude sanctuary does not supply resources or obstacles that affect the goodbye's execution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the blood work comes back") is signaled in the opening sentence and brackets the narrative arc through Alistair's death and memorial. However, time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the sequence unfolds without urgency or countdown pressure. The blood work result is a trigger rather than a clock that shapes moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To execute a flawless goodbye" is Elara's stated motivation in paragraph three and revisited at closure ("she had helped execute a flawless goodbye"). The desire is declared and pursued, but it is never conflicted or tested by friction between wants and costs. Elara achieves her goal without trade-offs, and the motivation does not dramatize competing impulses or force difficult choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Pulsing stillness" is named three times (room enveloped, electric with emotion, constant companion) as a tonal tag. The phrase coheres across beats but remains static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image in a way that reweights prior material. Present and consistent but not dynamically integrated into escalation or closure.</comment>
