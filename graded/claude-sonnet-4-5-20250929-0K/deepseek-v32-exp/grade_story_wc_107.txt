<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (crafting safe zones) is clear but remains abstract throughout; the emotional thaw is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The decision to leave her former studio is recounted in reflection without on-page cost or friction. Embodied emotion is largely absent—grief and thaw are declared ("her heart thawed") rather than shown through specific physical sensation or contradictory choice under pressure. The final departure carries no visible trade-off or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the window (glassblower, control room, thaw). The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural—ice melting parallels emotional thaw—but closure lacks visible cost: Elara simply packs and leaves, with no on-page decision that narrows options or reweights prior material. The sphere and bookmark are left behind, but this gesture is asserted as "testament" rather than dramatized as renunciation with felt price. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the thaw progresses in parallel summary without a causal or textural turn that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned control room supplies vivid anchors (grimy windows, dusty panels, frigid air, dripping ice) and the portable furnace constrains her work spatially. The cracked bookmark and cobalt glass rod are handled on the page. However, the environment does not pressure a choice or charge the closure—Elara's departure is not forced by structural danger but declared as future necessity. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (glassblower's priorities), but the setting remains backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—crafting safe zones—is signaled early but never tested or deepened. No reversal or tightening occurs; lighting the furnace, shaping the sphere, and packing tools unfold without opposition or rising cost. The decision to abandon her former studio is recounted in backstory without on-page friction. The final departure is asserted as liberation but lacks a visible trade-off or price that would elevate pressure. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification or cadence shift is required; here the thaw simply continues in parallel.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The thematic premise—safe zones for inquiry, imperfection as necessity—is stated directly ("inquiry needed room for imperfections") rather than emerging from scene pressure. The cracked bookmark and trapped bubble function as on-the-nose symbols without dramatic cost. The final paragraph moralizes ("messy, beautiful process of inquiry") instead of landing a resonant image. Thematic echo in the last lines ("The abandoned control room stood silent behind her, its purpose fulfilled") articulates the thesis rather than letting closure earn it. Apply −0.6 for end-paragraph theme summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable (single third-person limited, Elara). The dramatic self-narration ("And now, the great fire awakens") establishes voice early and recurs, but diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("weighty lightness," "thoughtfully aligned") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance is consistent. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature (glassblower's focus on gather, marver, punty) is present but not deeply idiosyncratic. The voice reads competent but not distinctive enough to elevate the category.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence weaken momentum: "thawing heart of the landscape outside mirrored a thaw within her, a slow unfreezing of emotions" restates the same idea across clauses. Runs of "She [verb]" stems in the final third (She shaped, She held, She knew, She felt, She packed, She stepped) create drumbeat rhythm. Stock metaphors ("pearl," "molten," "sanctuary") appear without fresh angle. Figurative density in non-peak beats (dramatic narration passages) reads as overwriting without pattern payoff. Apply −1.0 for loops and template cadence; −0.3 for stock metaphor strings. Total artifacts ≥−1.3, which disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—glassblower crafting emotional safe zones during literal thaw—is a transparent symbolic template (ice = frozen emotion) without fresh transformation. The dramatic self-narration offers a small inflection but is underused and does not shape key turns. The cracked bookmark and trapped bubble are convenient symbols introduced to illustrate theme rather than complicate choice. The final turn (departure as liberation) is asserted without the earned hindsight or specific synthesis that would charge originality. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 for template thaw metaphor without lived transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara observes, reflects, and performs routine glassblowing without a single on-page choice that alters tactics or narrows options. Her decision to abandon the former studio is recounted in backstory. Packing and leaving at the end is a stated intention ("she would have to abandon this control room soon") without dramatized cost. Present in setup and ending, but no middle development. Cap 4.6 for missing middle; further reduce for observation-only presence and swappability (any artisan would function equally). Lyric early-final reprise does not apply—no reweighting occurs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The bookmark appears twice: picked up mid-scene and placed beside the sphere at the end. Both mentions are descriptive ("cracked," "frayed," "soft and pliable from age") without causal work—it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The final placement is asserted as "testament" but the object itself is inert. Setup and payoff present; no middle development. Cap 4.6 for missing middle; further reduce to 4.1 for ornamental use and lack of causal pressure. The crack is compared to her heart in summary, not dramatized as cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The thawing heart shapes the dominant stake (emotional thaw paralleling literal thaw) and is signaled early. It appears in the opening (ice melting), middle reflection ("thaw within her"), and final paragraph ("her heart thawed"). However, it functions as theme-claim rather than tactical constraint—no on-page choice is gated by the thaw. All three gates present; beat involvement across setup, middle, and ending; but causal pressure is absent (the thaw is declared, not tested). Score 5.9 for three-gate presence with thematic recurrence but no cost or tactical narrowing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully spirited" appears once as a label ("with a thoughtfully spirited sigh") in the opening. No on-page action is constrained or enabled by this trait; the narration and glassblowing could proceed identically without it. Ornamental mention without beat involvement or cost. Present in setup only; no middle or closure participation. Cap 2.8 for missing development and payoff, plus label-only use with no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Abandon" appears three times: leaving the former studio (backstory), planning to abandon the control room (future intention), and leaving the sphere and bookmark behind (final action). None is dramatized as a turn—the studio departure is recounted; the control room exit is asserted as necessity without on-page friction; the objects are left as "testament" without visible cost. Setup, middle, and ending all reference abandonment, but the element is summary-only and does not force a choice. All gates present but swappable and summary-only; apply −0.8. Score 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks is signaled early ("And now, the great fire awakens"), recurs mid-scene ("The gather is rolled"), and falls to a hush at the sphere's completion. The method is consistent and voice-motivated. However, it does not constrain a choice or shape outcome—the glassblowing would succeed without the narration. Setup, middle, and payoff present; distinct beat involvement (lighting furnace, shaping sphere). No causal pressure or cost tied to the method. Score 5.7 for three-gate presence with specificity but no tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The abandoned control room is introduced early, supplies vivid detail (consoles, dusty panels, grimy windows), and is referenced at closure ("stood silent behind her, its purpose fulfilled"). The setting enables her work (space, freedom from former studio) but does not pressure a key choice—her departure is asserted as future necessity, not forced by on-page danger. Setup and payoff present; middle reflection mentions it. The structure is postcard rather than crucible. Score 5.4 for two-gate presence (setup, ending) with vivid detail but no causal constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"During ice melting" is signaled early (rivulets, thaw begun days ago), recurs in middle parallels ("thawing heart of the landscape"), and is present at closure (slushy world). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline—Elara works at her own pace and leaves when ready. The thaw is environmental metaphor, not tactical pressure. All three gates present; thematic recurrence without time-pressure mechanics. Score 4.8 for presence across beats but no urgency or clock that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation to craft safe zones for inquiry is stated early, drives the glassblowing activity, and is referenced at closure ("the next safe zone waiting to be crafted"). It shapes the dominant stake and is tested on the page (she completes the prototype sphere). However, no friction or cost opposes this desire—it unfolds without obstacle or trade-off. All three gates present; beat involvement (lighting furnace, shaping sphere, departure); causal role in driving action. Lack of conflicted choice or visible sacrifice prevents higher score. Score 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Weighty lightness" is labeled once explicitly ("profound sense of weighty lightness") and echoed in the final paragraph ("her spirit thoughtfully aligned"). The tone is asserted rather than emergent from rhythm or pressure modulation. The prose remains uniformly reflective and declarative throughout, without tonal shift at turns. Present in setup (implicit in "thoughtfully spirited") and ending label; no middle modulation or pressure-driven cadence change. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development and static execution.</comment>
