<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are declared rather than tested on-page—her desire to bridge generational wisdom drives narrative summary but never forces a contradictory choice under pressure. The feisty trait is labeled repeatedly but does not constrain any action with visible cost. The reunion with Lyra arrives off-stage (weeks pass) and the embrace feels awarded rather than earned through dramatized renunciation or trade-off. Interiority relies on therapy-speak ("deciduous vows," "accidental insights") and stock gestures rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The closure unit—Lyra's return and their reconciliation—occurs after a "weeks passed" ellipsis that elides the escalation; the critical reversal happens off-page. Orientation is present by the second paragraph, but causality is weak: Elara crafts quartz eyes and leaves them on an altar, then weeks later Lyra conveniently appears holding the box with full understanding. The journal's "deciduous vows" passages provide the insight, but the protagonist's agency at closure is passive—she waits, then embraces. No visible cost forecloses a path; the breach is healed without sacrifice. The drive lens appears Causal but collapses into summary and coincidence at the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters image is vivid and purposeful, anchoring the setting early and returning at closure ("dew on the orchard leaves"). Spatial choreography is clear—cathedral, crypt, altar, orchard—and the mossy altar functions as a micro-setting that charges the offering. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices; the orchard "whispers" and "thrives" as backdrop rather than obstacle. The crypt's rubble and the bag's contents are tools retrieved without difficulty, not environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repairing the rift with Lyra—is signaled early but never tightens under protagonist agency. Elara's project (crafting quartz eyes, reading the journal) is recounted in summary; no on-page beat shows her wrestling with a trade-off or narrowing her options. The reversal (Lyra's return) is delivered by coincidence after an ellipsis, not by Elara's decision. The journal's "accidental wisdom" bypasses earned escalation; the insight softens her heart in narration, and the reunion follows without visible price or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of "deciduous vows"—promises that must shed to renew—is stated explicitly in multiple passages and by Lyra in dialogue, reducing subtext to thesis. The orchard and hair ribbon recur with thematic weight, but the final paragraph moralizes: "some vows are deciduous, but love and knowledge persist through all changes." The accidental-wisdom motif is coherent but announced rather than inferred. The particulars (quartz shards, journal, ribbon) support the theme, yet the ending delivers a sermon instead of a resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The POV is stable third-person limited on Elara, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic—"endearingly feisty" and "accidental insights" are labels rather than character-specific syntax. Dialogue is minimal; Lyra's single line ("I read about deciduous vows—how our old promises had to fall away") is expository and converges with the narrative voice. Filter verbs and stock phrasing ("her heart," "tears blending with the dew") dull immediacy. Voice modulates little under pressure; the tone remains declarative and summarizing throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "accidental wisdom" and "deciduous vows" are repeated across adjacent lines without added pressure, and multiple sentences restate Elara's realization that she must listen to Lyra. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("She polished… She read… She realized… She persisted"). Register drifts into abstract diction ("adaptable vows," "unintended wisdom") that clashes with the protagonist's hands-on craft. The final third stacks summary sentences that deflate momentum rather than propel toward closure. Minor stock metaphors ("like sap through the trees") and the overuse of "accidental" as a modifier further reduce clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—reconciliation through crafted symbolic objects and a journal's wisdom—follows a familiar template of symbolic repair without fresh inflection. The quartz-eye mender occupation is mentioned but not integrated into the problem or solution in a non-obvious way; the eyes are crafted off-page and function as tokens. The "deciduous vows" metaphor is explicitly stated rather than discovered through action. The orchard-in-rafters image is the sole vivid, non-generic detail, but it remains atmospheric rather than causal. The ending's warm reunion and shared laughter read as a median resolution with no bold risk or transformation of the breach-of-contract premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her project (crafting eyes, reading the journal) is recounted, but her key choice—leaving the offering—occurs in summary and does not narrow options or force a trade-off on the page. She waits passively after the offering, and the reunion is delivered by Lyra's return. The character is introduced early and appears in the ending, meeting two gates, but her agency at closure is reactive. Causal pressure is low; the element is functional but replaceable with any protagonist who waits and hopes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The hair ribbon is introduced early ("tucked in Elara's pocket"), handled in the middle third ("wrapped around her wrist"), and returns at closure ("retied in Lyra's hair"). It appears in three beats with evolving meaning—ghost of bond, tactile reminder, symbol of renewal. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; its role is symbolic rather than causal. The lyric reprise at the end reweights the ribbon's meaning with modest charge, qualifying for mid-band score under the allowance, but the cost is not tied to the ribbon itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Deciduous vows" is seeded in paragraph eight ("vows between them seemed deciduous"), developed in the journal passages, and articulated by Lyra at closure. It shapes the thematic question but does not alter Elara's tactics on the page; the insight is delivered through reading, not through a choice with stakes. The concept is present in all three gates but functions as theme rather than constraint. Swappable with "evolving bonds" or "generational change" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" is labeled in paragraph four and mentioned again ("feisty determination," "feisty spirit"), but the trait does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. Elara's choices—retrieving the bag, crafting eyes, leaving an offering—are patient and methodical, not feisty. The attribute is ornamental, appearing only in narrator description without visible friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Persist" is signaled early ("Elara decided to persist"), drives the middle beats (she persists through days of trial, tends the orchard), and is echoed at closure ("persistence had transformed loss into gain"). The action shapes the arc and is thematically central. However, it is enacted through summary rather than on-page scenes, and the resolution is delivered by Lyra's coincidental return, not by Elara's persistence forcing a turn. Present in all three gates with modest causal pressure; essential to the frame but not irreplaceable in execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The forgotten bag is retrieved early (paragraph eleven) and its contents—quartz shards, journal, pouch—are used across multiple beats: she crafts eyes, reads the journal, uses cloth from the pouch. The method is signaled, developed, and contributes to the ending (Lyra reads the journal). However, the bag's mechanics are recounted in summary, and the contents do not impose constraint or scarcity; they are discovered and used without friction. Present in all three gates with functional involvement but low specificity; the bag could be replaced with any cache of tools.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters setting is vividly introduced in paragraph two, returned in the middle ("orchard whispered around her"), and appears at closure ("dew on the orchard leaves"). It provides atmosphere and anchors the location, meeting setup and payoff gates. However, it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that affect tactics; she tends it, but it remains backdrop. The cathedral's crypt is used once for the bag retrieval but does not pressure the ending. Functional but ornamental; strong on tone, weak on causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the breach of contract" anchors the inciting condition and is mentioned in the opening and final paragraphs. However, time does not tighten decisions; "weeks passed" elides the escalation entirely, and no clock or deadline pressures Elara's work. The breach is historical context rather than a live constraint. Present in setup and closure but does not alter tactics; replaceable with any backstory inciting event.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to bridge generational wisdom" is stated in paragraph five, drives Elara's project (crafting eyes, offering the journal), and is resolved at closure when she and Lyra "revived the craft" together. It shapes the dominant stake and is present in all three gates. However, the motivation is told rather than tested through friction; Elara never wrestles between her desire and a competing cost on the page. The ending awards the goal without visible trade-off. Functional involvement but low dramatization of conflict between want and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Accidental wisdom" is seeded as a concept ("accidental revelation," "accidental insights," "unintended wisdom") and appears at closure ("beacon of accidental wisdom"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly—patient work, then reunion—but remains declarative throughout. The "accidental" quality is stated repeatedly rather than enacted through surprise or irony; the journal's insights are convenient rather than genuinely unexpected. Present in setup and closure, but the tone does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure or visible cost. Ornamental labeling rather than tonal control under escalation.</comment>
