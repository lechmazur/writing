<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is dominated by declarative statements about her craft rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The motivation to "translate heartbeats into maps" is told but never meaningfully tested—no choice forces her to weigh cost against desire. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (chapped hands, misting breath), but peak beats rely on craft exposition rather than visceral stakes. The ritual unfolds without genuine struggle or renunciation; completion feels mechanical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is adequately anchored (orchard, crater, Elara), but no decisive change occurs—Elara begins with her craft mastered and ends having executed it successfully. The ritual proceeds as planned without reversal, complication, or cost; the "urgency in the air" dissolves uncontested. Closure reads as task completion rather than a reconfiguration of options or meaning. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) requires a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake; instead, the final image ("map pulsed softly") reasserts the premise without pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered (thin air, cold, twilight), and the orchard setting supplies atmospheric texture. However, environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara kneels, arranges items, and completes the ritual unimpeded. The discarded objects and flash-paper function as procedural props rather than obstacles. Spatial choreography is clear, but the micro-setting (snow, frozen earth) does not shape the outcome or charge the final image with constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to bind starlight and map heartbeats—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens under opposition. No reversal narrows options; the ritual proceeds from intention to completion without friction. Agency is present (Elara initiates and executes), but no on-page cost forecloses a path—cold is noted, patience invoked, yet no sacrifice or trade-off materializes. The world's held breath dissipates without dramatized consequence, leaving escalation flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (transformation, empathy, mapping the intangible) emerges from the craft premise but remains asserted rather than tested. The "act of empathy" and "guides for those who had lost their way" are told motivations without on-page conflict or counter-pressure. The final image ("map pulsed softly, a beacon") restates the concept without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer to a central question. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; the text favors direct thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable, and the elevated register (gnarled sentinels, moving stillness, celestial glow) is consistent throughout. However, the diction leans toward stock fantasy-craft lexicon without character-specific perceptual signature—Elara's way of noticing does not feel distinct. Psychic distance remains descriptive rather than immediate during peak ritual beats. No dialogue to assess. The voice is competent but generic, lacking the idiosyncratic texture that would mark it as Elara's interior rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean, but multiple paraphrase loops appear: "creating patterns... this method of creating patterns"; "safekept starlight, captured... safekept starlight now eternally preserved"; "moving stillness... which had been holding its breath... moving stillness" recurs without added pressure. Figurative language is dense (clawing branches, symphony of silent vibrations) yet often inert, decorating rather than propelling. Sentence openings vary minimally in the ritual sequence, creating template cadence. Information density is low; many lines restate the premise without advancing stakes or revealing new facets.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The flash-paper alchemist and starlight-mapping premise offer surface novelty, but the execution follows a familiar arc: artisan performs ritual in atmospheric setting, completes task, departs. No turn subverts expectation; the emotional and plot arc could transfer to another craft-magic system with minor edits. The orchard and discarded-items method are vivid but do not transform genre conventions. The ending reasserts the premise without risk or fresh synthesis, and the central question (how to map heartbeats) is answered by executing the stated method without complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and executes the ritual, but her choices are procedural (kneel, arrange, pour, gesture, ignite) rather than forced turns. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. Setup is clear; middle involves action; closure references her ("the alchemist's craft"). However, the character's agency does not create a reversal—she carries out a plan without opposition. One functional beat (ritual execution) but swappable protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The storybook illustration plate is introduced mid-text (~40% mark), handled in the ritual (starlight poured, etched lines traced, sealed), and wrapped at closure. It appears in at least two distinct beats (drawing it out, sealing the final symbol, wrapping it) and is indispensable to the ritual's mechanics. However, its meaning does not shift—it remains the canvas throughout. Causal pressure: the plate enables the map; closure linkage: the map is the artifact stored. Late signal (−0.4) and no reweighted reprise (−0.3) lower the score from high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Safekept starlight is introduced at ~30%, described as core to her work, used as ink during the ritual, and sealed into the plate at closure. It shapes the ritual's method (liquid light) and appears in the ending ("safekept starlight now eternally preserved"). Two beats: pouring and sealing. Causal pressure: the starlight is the binding agent; closure linkage: the final map glows with it. Swappability concern: "captured energy" could replace it with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability. No visible cost tied uniquely to the starlight itself (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Patience is labeled ("patience she demonstrated physically," "Elara's patience was a physical presence") and illustrated by deliberate hand motions and refusal to rush despite cold. It appears in setup and middle but does not constrain a choice with on-page cost—Elara's patience succeeds without trade-off. No closure linkage: the final image does not hinge on patience. One functional beat (slow ritual execution) but label-heavy (−0.3) and no felt cost (−0.4). Mid-band for functional presence without decisive pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sealing is the ritual's climax: Elara lights flash-paper to transfer energy and bind starlight into the plate, repeated across beats ("initiated the action to seal," "sealed the final symbol," "light had been sealed"). The action drives the middle sequence and completes at closure. Two distinct beats (initiation and final seal); causal pressure: without sealing, the map fails; closure linkage: "As she sealed the final symbol, a sense of completion" triggers the ending. Irreplaceability: "binding" or "fixing" could substitute with minor edits (−0.5), preventing top-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Creating patterns with discarded items is signaled early ("arranging discarded items—broken pottery, shed feathers, and dried berries—into spirals and sigils"), described as foundational to her work, and noted during the ritual ("discarded items around her seemed to resonate"). However, the method is not shown constraining or enabling a choice; the patterns are set and then static. One functional beat (arrangement); no closure linkage—the final image is the plate, not the ground patterns. Swappable with "drawing runes" or similar (−0.6). Mid-band for setup and functional use without pressure or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vividly described at opening and closing, anchoring setting and tone. Cold is noted (chapped hands, misting breath, seeping into bones), but the environment does not constrain tactics or supply resources that alter outcome—Elara completes the ritual unimpeded. Postcard-level description without micro-setting pressure. One beat (atmospheric frame); no middle development or closure constraint. Swappable with "abandoned temple" or similar isolated setting (−0.7). Functional but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "while the world holds its breath" appears early and at closure ("The world, which had been holding its breath, seemed to release a sigh"), framing the ritual. However, the phrase remains metaphorical—no on-page clock, deadline, or time-driven choice materializes. The ritual's duration is untracked; urgency is asserted but not dramatized. One lyric reprise without causal work. Ornamental use (−0.8); no middle development (−0.5); no closure constraint (−0.6). Low-band for present but functionless framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation to translate heartbeats into maps is stated early ("Her motivation burned within her"), elaborated mid-text ("she remembered why she did this: to create guides"), and referenced at closure ("she had translated heartbeats into maps"). It drives the ritual's purpose and shapes the artifact's meaning. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested—no choice forces Elara to weigh this goal against cost. Two beats (stated purpose, recalled rationale); closure linkage via the completed map. Told-only motivation without friction (−0.9); no visible trade-off (−0.5). Mid-6s for present and thematically integrated but undramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Moving stillness is introduced at opening ("realm of moving stillness"), woven through description ("stillness that was alive with potential," "moving stillness giving way to a gentle breeze"), and reprised at closure ("orchard stood once more in moving stillness"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (held breath → sigh → enduring quiet), but the paradox remains atmospheric rather than charged by cost or choice. Two beats (setup, closure reprise); no pressure modulation tied to escalation. Lyric consistency without decisive charge (−0.7); swappable with "quiet tension" (−0.4). Mid-band for coherent but static mood.</comment>
