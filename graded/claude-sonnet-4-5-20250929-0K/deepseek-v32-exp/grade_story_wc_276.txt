<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's cool-headed trait is asserted repeatedly but never tested by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His motivation remains abstract—catching the echo—without embodied cost or foreclosed paths until the very end. The "transliterating emotions into physical vibrations" attribute is described but never dramatizes a trade-off or mistake that compounds pressure. Interior texture relies on stock fantasy-quest phrasing rather than character-particular thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph (waiving the Orientation Test penalty). However, closure relies on assertion rather than dramatized cost: "He had succeeded, not by conquering, but by harmonizing" tells the outcome without showing a foreclosed path or felt price. The causal lens is attempted but undercut by passive phrasing ("the echo responded," "constellations stilled") that removes agency from Kael at the pivotal moment. No clear before/after stakes shift lands on the page with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly rendered and consistently strange; sensory detail (shimmering ribbon, dissonance waves) filters through the quest frame. The rail spike and garden both constrain movement choices (zigzag paths, sonic structures collapsing). However, the environment does not charge the final image—Kael simply "held" the echo and walked away—so Q3 remains below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early (catch the echo). Pressure accumulates through collapsing patterns and erratic constellations, but the tightening is atmospheric rather than choice-driven; Kael's zigzag and voicing silence are repeated without escalating cost or a live trade-off. The resolution ("gently pinned the echo… with understanding") lacks on-page friction or a foreclosed option. Coincidence (constellation interference) complicates but protagonist decisions do not narrow the field with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of harmony-versus-conquest emerges through imagery (feral lullaby, transliterated emotions), but the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("He had succeeded, not by conquering, but by harmonizing") instead of letting the image resonate. The rail spike and echo motifs recur, yet neither reweights prior material at closure; the ending restores stasis without ambiguity or cost that would invite reflection. Subtext is present in the sensory design but undercut by the moralizing summary in the last third.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent and the prose has a distinct lyric-fantasy texture. Perceptual signature (audible ripples, sleepwalking constellations) is maintained throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("profound peace," "legacy," "the world felt whole") that feels generic rather than filtered through Kael's fisher idiom, especially under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates appropriately. However, paraphrase loops appear: "voicing silence" is explained three times without new information; "zigzag" recurs descriptively across multiple beats without functional difference. Stock metaphors ("ribbon of sound," "beacon") and elevated diction ("profound peace," "legacy") cluster in the closure sequence, dulling specificity. Template cadence: "He [verb]… He [verb]…" runs appear in the middle third. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats (total −0.9 within Q7).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise (sound wave garden, transliterating rail spike, feral lullaby) is inventive in detail but the quest structure and harmony-resolution arc are familiar. The emotional beats (patience, focus, success, peace) follow a predictable median path without contradiction or surprise. "Voicing silence" as technique is intriguing but never tested or subverted; Kael's cool-headed trait is label-only. Specificity in world-building elevates the piece above pure template, but the transformation test fails—swap names and the arc is unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's "cool-headed" trait is present throughout but observation dominates; his key decisions (zigzag, voice silence, pin the echo) are described rather than shown altering tactics under live pressure. He is on the page in every beat (setup, middle, closure) but his choices do not create reversals—the garden and echo respond to him passively. Apply: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure minimal +0.2, closure linkage +0.7, swappability −0.6 (any calm quester could replace him). Total neighborhood ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rail spike appears in setup (belt), middle (absorbs turbulence, glows), and closure (pins the echo, then rests). It enables two distinct beats (stabilizing pulses, transliterating resolve into beacon) and its "transliterate emotions" property matters to the method. However, it does not impose a cost—using it never backfires or narrows options. Apply: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, no visible cost −0.3, ornamental glow in closure −0.4. Total ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations are seeded early, disrupt mid-scene (star trails too close), and still at closure. They complicate Kael's task (one beat) but do not constrain his method or force a tactical shift. Their "stilling" at the end is described as effect, not cause. Apply: early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal pressure light +0.3, closure linkage passive +0.5, swappability −0.5 (any cosmic disruption would work). Total ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Transliterates emotions" is the rail spike's defining trait, seeded early and used in two beats (calm focus → stabilizing pulses; determination → beacon). It enables tactics but imposes no on-page cost or trade-off. Apply: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.6, no visible cost −0.4, label-only in one mention −0.3. Total ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Zigzag is seeded early, executed three times (avoid collapsing structures, dodge dissonance, close distance), and described as necessary given the garden's unraveling. It shapes tactics but does not create a reversal; the choice to zigzag versus move directly is stated rather than tested. Apply: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.6, swappability −0.6 (any evasive path would work), ornamental final mention −0.3. Total ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Voicing silence" is seeded early, executed three times (calm frequencies, shape void into net, command with greater intensity), and described as the method. It enables the capture but is never shown failing or requiring adaptation. Apply: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, summary-only in climax −0.5, paraphrase loop −0.3. Total ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sound wave garden is the sole setting, present in every beat. It supplies obstacles (collapsing structures, dissonance waves) that force zigzag tactics and pressures Kael's method throughout. The garden "settles into a new pattern" at closure, charging the final image. Apply: early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, irreplaceable +0.6. Total ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"When patterns break themselves" frames the opening and recurs descriptively but does not impose a ticking clock or tighten Kael's decisions. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical; no on-page moment shows time running out or forcing a trade-off. Apply: early signal +0.5, ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.6, summary-only −0.4. Introduced at start but no middle development of time pressure: apply missing-middle cap at 3.4, but closure participation (patterns mentioned settling) lifts slightly; final ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To catch the echo of a goddess" is Kael's stated goal from line two, drives every beat, and is fulfilled at closure. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized with internal friction or competing wants; no cost (what he sacrifices or risks) is shown until a generic "profound peace." Apply: early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, told-only friction −0.6, generic closure emotion −0.4. Total ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Feral lullaby" is seeded early as the echo's melody, recurs in three beats (twisted through sound waves, curling toward Kael, coiled and softened), and modulates from wild to tamed at closure. Tone coherence is maintained but the final image defaults to "gentle hum" rather than sustaining the wild-yet-soothing tension. Apply: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, tone shift with pressure +0.8, specificity +0.5, final flatness −0.6. Total ~5.8.</comment>
