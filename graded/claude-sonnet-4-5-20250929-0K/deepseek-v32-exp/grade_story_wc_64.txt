<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her interiority relies on stock phrases ("felt a pull," "profound bond") and label-only emotions without embodied contradiction. The climactic "realization" that she must continue the work is delivered as summary rather than earned through a visible choice with cost. Mr. Hemlock exists only as a framing device; his death mid-game never complicates Elara's actions or forces a difficult trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear lens (Accumulative/Textural) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when Elara decodes the tapestry and commits to honoring the stories. However, the orientation anchor is delayed—"who" is clear early, but "where" (cemetery silo) and "when" (after Mr. Hemlock's death) remain vague until the second paragraph, triggering a −0.3 penalty. The closure lands with thematic weight but lacks visible cost: Elara's decision to "carry that torch forward" is asserted, not tested by a forfeited option or on-page sacrifice. The causality is mostly linear summary rather than motivated turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cobalt silo under stars provides a coherent setting that anchors the nocturnal mood. Sensory detail is present ("velveteen gloom," "rough-hewn shelves," "dusty crate") but remains ornamental—none of these textures constrain a choice or alter tactics. The tapestry's frayed threads and hidden compartment shape the plot mechanically but do not force Elara to navigate spatial or material limits. The setting never complicates her work or charges the final image with spatial particularity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the shape of intentions—is signaled early but never tightened through genuine opposition or foreclosed options. Elara's work proceeds without obstacle: the tapestry yields its secrets linearly, the journal appears conveniently, and the map reveals itself without requiring a difficult trade-off. The "urgency" after Mr. Hemlock's death is told, not dramatized through a ticking constraint. No visible price is paid; the resolution ("she must continue") is declared rather than earned by a choice that narrows her path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory as legacy, voices beyond death—emerges from the tapestry conceit but relies on explicit statement rather than specific dramatization. The final image ("echoes were charted, their shapes etched into her heart") asserts thematic closure without offering a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. The journal's revelation is expository; Elara's epiphany ("by decoding the threads, she could fulfill his unfinished mission") is told in thesis language. The piece gestures toward complexity but delivers a tidy, affirmed conclusion without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature—diction is generic literary ("blithe," "velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes") without character-specific idiom. Filter verbs and summary interiority ("she felt a pull," "she sensed") dominate rather than embodied perception. The prose reads as authorial rather than filtered through Elara's specific way of noticing. Mr. Hemlock's brief dialogue is functional but lacks subtext or goal pursuit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the piece: "uncharted echoes" appears five times across paragraphs 8, 19, 27, 35, 38 with minimal functional variation; "velveteen gloom" recurs in paragraphs 2, 13, 36 as decorative repetition. Template cadence runs dominate: "She [verb]" stems structure at least eight sentences (paragraphs 11, 12, 14, 15, 26, 30, 37, 39). Stock metaphors ("echoes that seemed to vibrate," "threads seemed to pulse") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she sensed," "she knew") dull immediacy in peak beats. Sentence rhythm is monotonous, with most paragraphs opening on subject-verb-object constructions. Information density is low: many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—decoding a tapestry to recover lost voices—follows a familiar treasure-hunt template without transformation. The "hidden compartment reveals a journal" beat is stock mystery mechanics. Emotional specificity is absent: Elara's bond with the vanished gardener is asserted rather than built through particular detail. The piece cycles through prompt elements (sovereign case, tapestry, cobalt silo) without synthesizing them into a surprising or inevitable whole. The safe, affirmed ending ("she would carry that torch forward") avoids risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the decision to decode the tapestry and continue the work. However, her choices are declarative rather than dramatized under opposition—she encounters no meaningful obstacle that forces a trade-off. Her role is primarily observational (tracing threads, reading the journal) until the final assertion of intent. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but swappable with any curious protagonist without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The antique sovereign case appears in setup (paragraph 5), houses the tapestry and hidden journal (paragraphs 9, 24), and is closed at the ending (paragraph 38). It enables the plot by containing the puzzle but lacks unique properties—any container with a hidden compartment would serve equally. The case is handled across three beats but does not constrain choice or reweight meaning at closure; its "cool surface" in the final mention is decorative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" is seeded in paragraph 8 and repeated in paragraphs 19, 27, 35, 38, framing the thematic claim that the tapestry captures voices from the graves. However, the concept remains metaphorical label rather than on-page pressure—Elara never hears, confronts, or negotiates with these echoes as active forces. The phrase functions as ornamentation for the theme, not as a stake that alters her tactics or choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" appears twice: describing Elara's curiosities (paragraph 4) and the journal's notes (paragraph 25). The trait is label-only; no scene shows Elara making an organizing choice under pressure or paying a cost for this fastidiousness. The attribute does not enable or constrain a beat. Its final mention (paragraph 37, "tenderly organizing these stories") is summary assertion, not dramatized action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Untangle" appears four times: as Elara's goal (paragraph 6), her border-decoding work (paragraph 10, 17), and the final mission (paragraph 43). The action is present across setup, middle, and ending, but the mechanics remain vague—untangling is narrated in summary ("patterns began to emerge," "she untangled the final section") without specific technique or obstacle. Easily swappable with "decode" or "interpret" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The method—"decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border"—is seeded in paragraph 10 and drives paragraphs 11–21, 31. However, the process is told rather than shown: we learn that "patterns began to emerge" and symbols are revealed, but the mechanics (how tracing threads produces meaning) remain abstract. The method does not impose a visible constraint or enable a specific tactic Elara must discover. It shapes the plot's premise but not her tactical choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo under stars is anchored in paragraph 3 and recurs in paragraphs 23, 38, 39, 42. It provides atmospheric setting and houses Elara's work, but does not constrain her actions—the rough-hewn shelves, dusty crate, and starlit sky are postcard details that do not alter her tactics or the outcome. The silo could be replaced with any private workspace without changing story logic. Present across setup and ending but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the chess clock runs down" is established in paragraphs 1–2 and briefly recalled in paragraph 14 and 40. Mr. Hemlock's death sets the initial mood but does not create a ticking constraint—Elara works "deep into the night" (paragraph 23) with no urgency or deadline pressuring her choices. The clock metaphor is thematic decoration rather than a mechanical force that narrows her options. Minimal closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the shape of intentions" is stated in paragraph 7 and echoed in paragraphs 19, 28, 34. It frames Elara's goal but is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—she pursues the mystery without friction, and the "shape of intentions" revelation (paragraph 34) is delivered as exposition rather than a choice-point. The desire is present but told-only, not tested by on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" appears in paragraphs 2, 13, 36 and sets a consistent nocturnal, soft-dark tone that modulates slightly when replaced by "warm, purposeful light" (paragraph 36) and "soft and velvety" night air (paragraph 42). The tone is coherent and recurs across setup, middle, and ending, charging the final transition from gloom to warmth. However, the effect is decorative—tone does not constrain Elara's choices or shift in response to escalating pressure. The mood wraps the narrative but remains static in function.</comment>
