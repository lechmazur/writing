<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains fundamentally flat—a vehicle for thematic delivery rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her "perceptively calm" trait is stated repeatedly but never tested or complicated; no micro-choice reveals competing desires. Mr. Hemlock's moment ("That's my wife and me, before the accident took her") is the only beat with embodied grief, but Elara's response is passive absorption, not agency. The closure substitutes collective mood for individual cost; we never see Elara forfeit anything or wrestle with a decision that would charge her arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: photographs accumulate, residents gather, community shifts from suppressed grief to "solidarity." Orientation anchors arrive early (lavender field, factory ruins, map case). The fatal flaw: no on-page closure moment with legible cost. The exhibition opening and Mr. Hemlock's gratitude are told outcomes, not dramatized reversals. "The collective healing had begun" is assertion, not an image that reweights prior material. The final paragraph offers lyric summary ("lavender whispered secrets") where a resonant reconfiguration should crystallize. Without visible cost or a decisive image, closure remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lavender field and factory ruins are vividly established and return in the final image, satisfying the lyric-reprise path. Spatial choreography is clear (field → blanket → community hall). However, setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics. The vines climbing and bees humming are atmospheric decoration, not pressure. For the 9-band, environment must shape a decision; here it remains postcard backdrop throughout, capping the score below 6.0 despite strong sensory anchoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transmuting communal pain into collective healing—is signaled early but never tightens on the page. No reversal: residents simply arrive, share, and approve. Elara faces no resistance, resource constraint, or competing pull. The exhibition's success is narrated ("the room buzzed"), not tested. Mr. Hemlock's gratitude confirms rather than complicates. The Accumulative lens allows gradual intensification, but even that requires one meaningful deepening that narrows options or changes knowledge with felt cost; this piece offers steady addition without friction or price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—art reshaping memory, nature reclaiming ruin—emerges through image (vines, arcs of photos, lavender against decay) rather than statement, which is strong. The final exhibition and Mr. Hemlock's realization gesture toward resonance. However, the closing paragraphs dissolve into abstraction: "transmuting years of anguish into a legacy of resilience," "a world reborn from ruins," "the peace it had helped to create." These are thematic echo statements, not images that reweight the premise. A concrete final beat—Elara leaving the empty map case, the sunset coloring the photos, a single resident touching an image—would have anchored meaning in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices arcs, transformation, "silent stories"—but diction occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("visual symphony," "tapestry," "echoes"). Dialogue with Mr. Hemlock is clean and purposeful, carrying subtext in his trembling voice and Elara's "stillness inviting him to share." The final third inflates register ("collective soul of the town," "legacy of resilience") beyond the grounded voice established earlier. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the prose does not modulate under pressure; closure paragraphs read like thematic summary rather than character-filtered perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Severe template-cadence runs plague the second half: "As vines climbed… / She aimed to transmute… / Opening the map case… / Each image captured… / Her motivation stemmed… / The lavender field… / She noticed how… / Elara's perceptively calm… / One man… / He pointed… / She learned… / By showcasing… / The whimsy… / Yet the tone… / As vines climbed… / More residents… / They lingered… / Elara's dove gray map case… / She arranged…" The repetitive sentence stems and scaffold phrasing ("Her method was via," "She aimed to," "Her motivation stemmed") accumulate to −1.2. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 2–3 restate "transformation" and "pain into masterpiece" without added detail. Filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she noticed," "she felt," "she learned") dull immediacy in mid-pressure beats. The closure paragraphs pile abstractions ("collective soul," "renewed bonds," "legacy of resilience") where concrete images would sharpen. These artifacts touch the ending, triggering the Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise—artist curates communal memory via photographs to foster healing—follows a well-worn template: sensitive outsider catalyzes collective catharsis in a wounded community. The lavender-against-ruins contrast and the "arcs" motif add texture but do not transform the familiar arc. No surprising turn or non-obvious moral calculus emerges. The resolution is frictionless validation rather than a synthesis earned through risk. Elara's puzzle-archivist framing is underused; she behaves as a standard empathetic curator. The derivative-premise guardrail applies: −0.8 for close alignment with "art heals community" templates without specific lived complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no key decision. She arranges photos, listens to Mr. Hemlock, and stages the exhibition—all off-page or summarized. Her "subtle puzzle archivist" role is told, not enacted; no puzzle is solved through her choices. Observation dominates; agency is absent. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dove gray map case appears in paragraph 2 (carrying it), paragraph 11 (opening it to arrange photos), and paragraph 18 ("now held… the collective soul"). Three touches across setup, middle, development. However, its function is static container; it does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning. The final mention ("empty but for the peace it had helped to create") is metaphorical assertion, not dramatized transformation. Functional but replaceable—a portfolio or box would serve identically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Collective healing" is the dominant stake, present from paragraph 10 ("foster collective healing") through the exhibition climax and closure ("The collective healing had begun"). It shapes the exhibition's purpose and Mr. Hemlock's arc. However, healing is narrated outcome, not on-page friction or choice. No moment where Elara or the community must trade comfort for truth, or where one resident's pain resists easy resolution. The concept drives theme but not tactics under pressure, placing it in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is labeled in paragraphs 4 and 16 but never constrains or enables an action with cost. We are told her calm "helped her connect" and invited Mr. Hemlock to share, yet no scene tests whether maintaining that calm requires suppressing her own emotion or missing an urgent cue. Label-only trait, no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Linger" appears in paragraph 5 ("chose to linger") and again in paragraph 27 ("lingered in the lavender field one last time"). Early signal present. However, the action is passive observation; it does not create a turn or foreclose an option. Easily swappable with "stay," "pause," "remain." Present across beats but without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Arcs in black-and-white photographs" is signaled in paragraph 8 ("via arcs in black-and-white photographs"), displayed in paragraph 11 ("arranged photographs in sweeping arcs"), discussed in paragraph 15 ("explored the arcs"), and exhibited in paragraph 19 ("The black-and-white arcs formed a timeline"). Four touches, setup through closure. The method matters thematically (transformation, timeline) but does not constrain mechanics—color photos would function identically. The arcs are compositional metaphor, not a unique means that alters tactics. Mid-band: present across beats, modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lavender field and factory ruins anchor the story from paragraph 2 through the final sunset. The setting provides vivid contrast (beauty/decay) and returns at closure. However, it never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. Residents could gather anywhere; the field is backdrop, not constraint. One causal beat: paragraph 23 notes it "became a gathering place," which enables the communal shift, lifting the score into the 5s via closure linkage, but the spatial properties themselves (access, proximity, scent that might trigger memory) are unused.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"As vines climb" appears as a recurring image (paragraphs 7, 15, 23, 26) but functions as poetic motif, not a time constraint. No deadline tightens decisions; Elara works at her own pace. The vines mark thematic passage (nature's reclamation) without altering tactics. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To transmute pain into a masterpiece" is stated in paragraph 9 and echoed in paragraphs 13, 28. Early signal, present at closure. However, the motivation is told ("Her motivation stemmed from") rather than dramatized through conflicting pulls. No scene where creating beauty requires Elara to withhold a painful truth or risk her own composure. Friction between want and cost is absent; the desire faces no resistance. Functional but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Earnest whimsy" is attempted via "playful compositions: a child chasing butterflies, light dancing on rusted metal" (paragraph 18) and "Yet, the tone remained earnest" (paragraph 19). The piece aims for this hybrid but delivers earnest lyricism throughout with one labeled whimsical beat. Tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image, which is purely earnest abstraction ("lavender whispered secrets"). Single static mood with a token gesture toward whimsy.</comment>
