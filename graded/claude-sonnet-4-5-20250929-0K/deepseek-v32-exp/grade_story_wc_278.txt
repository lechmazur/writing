<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but rarely tested through on-page choice under pressure. The guilt over abandoning her niece is told via letters and summary rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The "translation" attribute remains a label without visible cost or trade-off shaping a key decision. Interiority relies on abstract constructions ("the weight lift," "sharp sting") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but never crystallizes into coherent pressure; time-folding and firmware glitches serve as atmospheric decoration without narrowing options. The ending claims resolution ("hushed the dissonance") through summary assertion rather than an on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Orientation is vague past 120 words (laboratory setting and timeline remain abstract), triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. Causality is weak: letters explain backstory but do not alter present tactics, and the amber's "frequency" solves a problem it did not help create.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The laboratory is named but never grounded spatially; no tool, room dimension, or constraint shapes a choice. "Meteor hush" and "haunted firmware" remain metaphoric labels without physical anchors. The amber and escritoire appear but do not constrain movement or access. Sensory detail is generic ("profound silence," "faint energy") and filtered through an omniscient catalog rather than POV-specific urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (hushing guilt) is declared but never tested through a choice that narrows options or incurs visible cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elara moves from discovery to solution without opposition or trade-off. The firmware "resists" in summary but does not force tactical adaptation. The ending asserts peace without showing what was foreclosed or paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme of guilt and forgiveness is stated explicitly ("woven into a tapestry of redemption") rather than emerging from particulars. The amber-as-monument and constellation-tattoos function as decorative symbols without reweighting prior material. The final paragraph moralizes the arc ("listen without fear, to translate without sorrow") instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer. No plausible counter-reading exists; the piece resolves into a tidy binary of guilt → acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient distance remains stable but generic; no perceptual signature or character-particular diction. Sentences share uniform literary register ("the laboratory's ghosts settled, their anguish finally acknowledged") that does not modulate under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Metaphoric density is high but vehicles are mixed ("time folds," "threads," "tethers," "tapestry") without coherent logic. Elara's professional idiom as tattooist never colors her perception of the lab work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "hush the dissonance" / "hushed the dissonance"; "guilt washing over her" / "weight lift"; "tether the frayed threads" / "tethered the lost sounds." Template cadence runs dominate (e.g., four consecutive "She [verb]" openers mid-story). Filter-verb stacks ("she could translate," "she decided," "she resolved") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Mixed metaphors (time "folds," guilt "bleeds," frequency "merges") muddle the closure image. Apply −1.2 for loops/templates and −0.4 for figurative incoherence, totaling −1.6 in Q7; artifacts touch closure, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Core premise (time-folding guilt lab, firmware haunted by baby cries) is high-concept but executes as checklist assembly: tattooist + amber + letters + firmware. The "constellation tattooist" trait never transforms the lab work; she could be any technician. Emotional arc (guilt → forgiveness) follows template stages without fresh inflection. Proximity to genre tropes (haunted technology, artifact-as-key) without meaningful subversion. The transformation test fails: swap names and the arc is unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara observes and reacts but makes no key turn through decision; the tattooing action is summary-only and does not alter tactics. Present throughout but ornamental to plot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Amber appears in discovery and connects to the resonator at closure, meeting two beats and closure participation. However, its "frequency" solves a problem it did not help create, and the mechanism is told rather than shown. Swappable with any artifact; cap 4.6 for late problem-solving role.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or tactic; it "resists" and "glitches" in summary without altering Elara's options. Functions as atmospheric label rather than stake-shaping mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Translation attribute is declared and used once (interpreting the cry's meaning) but without visible cost or trade-off. The skill is told to be a "curse" but never dramatized as one. Label-only use; cap 2.8 for missing closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Tethering is the named action and appears in middle beats (tattooing soundboards) and the ending claim, meeting setup and closure gates. However, the process is summarized and the outcome is asserted rather than shown changing options. Swappable with "repair" or "harmonize."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Letters appear early and supply backstory but do not shape present tactics; the escritoire is used for a late message that has no on-page effect. Present in two beats (discovery, message placement) but ornamental to escalation. Cap 4.6 for late introduction of message mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Laboratory is named and present throughout but never supplies a constraint, resource, or spatial choice that alters outcome. "Lost sounds" is metaphoric rather than architectural. Postcard description without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Time-folding is declared and mentioned in glimpses but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The mechanism remains vague and does not force tactical adaptation. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Guilt motivates Elara throughout and is present in the ending resolution, meeting setup and closure gates. However, the desire is told and summarized rather than dramatized through on-page friction between want and cost. No micro-choice shows her choosing guilt-driven action over another need.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears in opening and closing frames and names the tone, but the prose does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through rhythm or cadence shift. Static mood label rather than dynamic tonal control.</comment>
