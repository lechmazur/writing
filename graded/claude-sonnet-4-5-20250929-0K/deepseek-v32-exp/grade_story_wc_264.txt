<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior is abstract label-speak ("hollowed-out shell," "dreamless nature") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to "cultivate sparks" is told and generic; no micro-choices reveal competing impulses under pressure. The ending pivot—"did not guard against dreams but welcomed them"—lacks prior causality showing what forecloses the dreamless state. Agency reads passive: she performs cultivation without visible trade-offs or mistakes that compound.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation debt: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but "after the last forest burned" timeframe and "divergent archive" remain atmospheric rather than concrete until midpoint. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density increase via spark-tending repetition, final lullaby smoothing), yet the closure—sparks ignite, Elara "no longer empty"—lands as summary rather than a decisive on-page image with visible cost. The chess clock "promise, not a prison" reweights prior material but the cost is asserted, not dramatized. Orientation penalty −0.4; closure RR is present but felt cost is weak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The glowing dune supplies vivid sensory anchors ("sand warm and alive beneath her boots," "flowers pulsed like slow heartbeats") and the fractured lullaby modulates tone across beats. Yet setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the dune and archive remain postcard backdrops. The chess clock is handled twice (set down, observed) but does not enable or block an action. Micro-setting allowance met minimally; no closure charge from environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivate sparks—is signaled early but pressure remains flat: Elara moves from spark to spark without visible resistance that narrows options. "The spark resisted, flickering" dissolves in the next line without cost. No tightening choice forecloses a path; coincidence (sparks simply respond to her intent) resolves the problem. The accumulative lens should show density increase or pattern break that reweights cost; instead repetition dulls escalation. Agency is procedural, not under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of renewal-from-ashes emerges through the dune blooming and sparks igniting, avoiding overt statement. The chess clock's shift from "prison" to "promise" reconfigures time's standstill with quiet resonance. Yet the final paragraph moralizes ("she did not guard against dreams but welcomed them") rather than trusting the image. Subtext in "fractured lullaby" modulates effectively. Epiphany feels unearned; no prior particulars dramatize the cost of welcoming dreams.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited with stable distance. Perceptual signature is generic high-fantasy register ("repository not of facts but of possibilities," "quantum foam") lacking character-specific idiom. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") cluster in reflection without voice motivation. Psychic distance appropriate for contemplative mode, but diction drifts into corporate abstraction ("divergent streams," "collective brightening") at peak beats, undermining embodied immediacy. Purposeful compression not taught early; reads as underspecified rather than patterned elision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "cultivate the sparks" / "tend to multiple sites" / "cultivating each spark with care" churn synonyms without added pressure. Template cadence in middle third: "She charmed it too… She focused on the method… She reached for one such spark" stacks identical stems across seven lines (−0.6). Figurative density ("needle through cloth," "labyrinth of light and shadow," "vessel for this work") in most sentences of closure beats without taught pattern (−0.5). Register drift into quantum-physics diction clashes with fantasy setting. Information density low; many lines restate without advancing. Artifacts touch closure beat: disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Premise—post-apocalyptic guardian tends metaphysical archive via quantum mechanics—mashes familiar SFF templates (liminal guide, probability manipulation, spark-tending) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious stakes. "Dreamless freight guard" and "occasionally everywhere" read as quirk-for-quirk's-sake labels. The chess clock and fractured lullaby are atmospheric tokens, not causally necessary. Emotional arc (hollowed → at peace) follows predictable redemption template. No bold risk-taking; middle-ground hedging favors poetic mood over specific consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role (freight guard, spark cultivator) frames the action. Yet her choices do not create key turns; she executes a procedural loop (find spark, charm it, move to next) without on-page dilemma or decision that alters tactics. The ending shift to welcoming dreams is told, not chosen under pressure. Functional but replaceable; the arc could proceed with a generic "wanderer" descriptor. Mid-setup, no middle development via choice, weak closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The chess clock appears in three beats: Elara feels its weight in her pack, sets it on the sand, observes it at closure. Yet it remains inert description; she never winds, consults, or uses it to constrain a choice. The final reweighting ("promise, not a prison") is asserted without dramatized cost tied to the object. Present and thematically consistent but ornamental. No causal pressure, no closure linkage beyond cameo mention. Setup +0.3, two beats +0.9, but swappable and static: cap 4.6 for missing middle development, then −0.5 ornamental, −0.4 swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The divergent archive is introduced early and shapes Elara's method (moving through wave functions to access branching realities). It appears in four beats: she recalls it, accesses it, navigates its branches, receives its whispered gratitude. Yet it does not constrain her choices or narrow options; she simply wills sparks into brightness without cost or trade-off. The archive supplies atmosphere and metaphor but remains functionally passive. Setup +0.5, beat involvement (three+) +1.4, but no causal pressure (−0.8), swappable with "dimensional library" or similar (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Occasionally everywhere" is named three times and described as enabling her to "tend to multiple sites at once" and "feel the chill of dead cities and the warmth of hidden groves simultaneously." Yet this quantum-presence trait does not visibly constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost; she could cultivate sparks sequentially without it. The attribute drains her ("leaving her more hollow"), but that cost is summary, not dramatized through a tactical choice. Setup +0.5, beat involvement (two) +0.9, but label-only (−0.3), no visible trade-off (−0.6), swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Charm" is the verb Elara uses across five beats: she learns to charm the archive, charms the first spark, charms the library spark, and at closure "charmed not just the archive but herself into peace." The action is central but its mechanics remain vague ("not with words but with intent, weaving probability"). Major turns trace to charming—sparks ignite—but the method is swappable with "coax," "persuade," or "awaken" without structural change. Setup +0.8, beat involvement (three+) +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability (−0.6), summary execution (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Through wave functions" is named in four beats: Elara moves through them to access the archive, adjusts probabilities via them, merges consciousness with divergent streams, and the method is explicitly called out mid-story. Yet the mechanics are abstract; wave functions do not impose a visible limit or cost that alters her tactics. The method could be "through mental projection" or "via meditation" with minor edits. Setup +0.5, beat involvement (three+) +1.4, but ornamental science-speak (−0.7), swappability (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The glowing dune is present in six beats: Elara stands on its crest, the sand is warm beneath her boots, she sets the clock on it, the dune "seemed to breathe," its light intensifies, and flowers burst into chorus at closure. The setting supplies vivid imagery and modulates with the story's emotional arc. Yet it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome; Elara's spark-tending would proceed identically on a plain hillside. Setup +0.8, beat involvement (three+) +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but postcard description (−0.8), no causal pressure (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After the last forest burned" anchors the opening and establishes a post-catastrophe frame. The timeframe recurs implicitly (ashes, blighted era, dead cities) and the chess clock's frozen midnight symbolizes stalled time. At closure, "time would move forward when the world was ready." Yet the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Elara's work unfolds at contemplative pace without a ticking constraint. Setup +0.6, thematic presence across beats +0.8, closure linkage +0.7, but no tactical pressure (−0.9), vague tracking (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners" is Elara's stated purpose, etched by "forgotten command." The motivation appears in seven beats and drives every action. Yet it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; she performs the task without visible friction between desire and cost until the summary ending claims she is "no longer empty." Setup +0.8, beat involvement (three+) +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, but told-only interiority (−0.8), no on-page friction (−1.0), summary payoff (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Fractured lullaby" is named four times: the air hums with it at opening, it grows louder mid-story, its rhythms are "discordant yet compelling," and at closure it "smoothed into a coherent song of renewal" before fading. Tone modulates purposefully with escalation and charges the final image. Yet the lullaby remains auditory decoration; it does not constrain Elara's choices or impose cost. Setup +0.8, beat involvement (three) +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, coheres across turns +0.6, but ornamental (−0.6), no causal role (−0.8).</comment>
