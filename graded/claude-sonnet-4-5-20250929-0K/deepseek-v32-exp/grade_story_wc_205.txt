<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reimagine the civilization is established, but her interior life remains abstract—"burnished sorrow" and "poetically inclined mind" function as labels rather than embodied contradictions. The experiment sequence shows goal-directed action, yet the emotional arc from failed revolutionary to fulfilled scholar feels too smooth, lacking the irrational friction or self-deception that would ground her transformation. The final museum visit gestures toward peace but doesn't dramatize what path she foreclosed or what specific want she sacrificed to arrive there.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes Elara's goal (reimagine the civilization) and tests it through the storm experiment, delivering a Decisive Change when holographic images validate her theory and she compiles a treatise. However, the closure moment—"she found peace in having reignited a spark of creativity"—summarizes rather than dramatizes the cost; we're told she remains "defunct" but don't see what specific option or relationship she forecloses to achieve this peace. Orientation is clear early (baroque asteroid, visible time, archaeological dispute), and the causal chain holds under a largely Causal lens, but the final beat lacks the on-page felt cost required for high bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid, visible time strands, and ion storms create a vivid conceptual setting, and the mirror-covering practice recurs with purpose. The crystal shard constrains Elara's experiment and charges the final museum image, meeting the micro-setting test. However, spatial choreography remains vague—her study, the dig sites, and the museum blur together without tactical grounding—and the "baroque" descriptor is never made concrete through architecture or lived detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving the civilization was poetic, not martial—is signaled early and escalates through Kael's dismissal to the climactic presentation. The storm experiment provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Elara's options (risk public failure or remain silent). Yet the resolution hinges on other scholars being "captivated," an off-stage validation that dilutes agency; Elara's internal transformation is asserted ("she understood now") rather than tested through a visible tradeoff or renunciation on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme—art and transience versus utilitarian history—emerges through the civilization's mirror practice and the crystal shard, but the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "mastered the art of sorrowful beauty" and "her own revolution had failed because it lacked this poetic core." These assertions replace scene pressure and read as thematic echo. The connection between Elara's defunct revolution and the ancient poets is told rather than dramatized through choice, weakening the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elara's perceptual signature—seeing structures as poetry, noticing time strands—is consistent. Diction like "burnished sorrow" and "spaces between facts" fits a poetic filter, though it occasionally tips into elevated register ("reimagined the entire civilization") that abstracts rather than grounds. No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice distinction are not tested. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains clean focalization throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear and grammatically clean, with purposeful rhythm in the opening ("time had recently become visible, weaving through the air like golden threads"). However, the piece recycles syntactic stems—"She saw," "She spent," "She would," "She realized"—across a dozen beats, creating template cadence. Phrases like "burnished sorrow" and "poetically inclined mind" repeat without variation, and the final sequence summarizes key turns ("compiled her findings," "presented her work") rather than dramatizing them, flattening momentum at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—visible time strands on a baroque asteroid—offers a fresh angle, and the mirror-covering practice tied to time avoidance is inventive. Yet the core arc (scholar vindicates unorthodox theory against establishment dismissal) follows a familiar template, and the resolution (holographic projection reveals truth) relies on a convenient device rather than character-driven synthesis. The emotional link between Elara's failed revolution and the ancient civilization's poetry is asserted but not transformed through specific, lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's status as "defunct revolutionary" frames her motivation and appears in the final reflection ("she remained a defunct revolutionary"), but the attribute doesn't constrain on-page choices—her revolutionary past never creates friction with the scholars or limits her methods. It's functional setup that colors backstory but doesn't drive beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard is introduced early (paragraph 5), drives the storm experiment (paragraph 17), and reappears in the museum ending (paragraph 27) with reweighted meaning ("glowed with the captured time"). It touches three distinct beats and its unique property (attracting time strands) is irreplaceable. The causal pressure and closure linkage are strong, though the middle use is somewhat mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute is established in paragraph 3, intensifies when Kael dismisses Elara's theories (paragraph 11), and reaches climax at her presentation (paragraph 22). It shapes the dominant stake and appears in the ending reflection ("transformed the understanding of Veridia"). The concept drives escalation and closure, though Kael's role remains thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" is mentioned twice (paragraphs 2, 28) but functions as a label rather than a constraint—Elara writes verse and sees metaphors, yet no on-page choice shows her poetic tendency creating friction or cost. The attribute colors her POV filter but doesn't alter tactics or foreclose options.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Devise" appears in paragraph 6 (devise a new interpretation), paragraph 14 (devise an idea), and paragraph 15 (devised an experiment). The experiment is the major turn, but "devise" as a repeated verb doesn't shape irreplaceable beats—other verbs (plan, test, conceive) could substitute without structural loss. Mid-band for functional but swappable presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Covering mirrors is introduced in paragraph 7, explained as a local practice, and drives Elara's hypothesis (paragraph 13) and experiment design (paragraph 15). The method reappears in the ending ("she would cover her mirror and remember"), charging the final image. It shapes two beats and the closure, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is named early and the visible time strands provide visual texture, but "baroque" is never concretized and the setting doesn't constrain choices—the dig, her study, and the museum are interchangeable backdrops. The ion storms enable the experiment, lifting the score slightly, but spatial pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Time becoming visible is mentioned in the opening and recurs as visual detail (time strands) throughout, but the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions—Elara waits for the next storm without urgency, and the "after" framing is static. The element colors atmosphere but doesn't alter tactics or create a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reimagine the civilization is stated in paragraph 6, drives her experiment (paragraphs 14–17), and is echoed in the ending ("reimagining the civilization was not just about the past"). The desire shapes the dominant stake and touches multiple beats, though it's more told than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices with visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" appears in paragraphs 5 and 19, establishing tone, but the phrase is static—it doesn't modulate with pressure or deepen through the turns. The ending gestures toward melancholy peace, yet the tone remains a declared label rather than an effect built through rhythm and image that charges the final beat.</comment>
