<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation to learn architectural language is sustained, and the interiority remains consistent through the teaching sessions. However, the protagonist's emotional arc lacks concrete contradiction or micro-choices that test commitment; the acceptance of Finch's ghostly nature arrives fully formed rather than earned through on-page friction. The final moment—receiving the seal—feels like inheritance rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Finch remains more atmospheric device than character with agency that pressures the narrator's decisions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through weekly sessions, the seal becomes a teaching instrument, and the final transfer reweights the premise. Orientation anchors arrive early (rooftop, meteor shower, narrator meets ghost tutor). The closure—Finch dissolving, seal passed to narrator—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the conversation continuing silently is Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract; no on-page forfeit or tactical shift demonstrates what the narrator loses or must now endure alone. The accumulation pattern is taught and held, qualifying the piece, yet the conceptual cost at closure lacks the sharp proof sentence required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during the Leonid shower supplies vivid sensory anchors—jasmine, ferns, meteor streaks—and recurs across beats to frame lessons and the final dissolution. The seal as micro-setting object constrains teaching method (warm wax, parchment, tracing patterns) and charges the final image when it glows and transfers. Spatial choreography is clean; the spectral transparency detail and tea-pouring ballet embed Finch in the setting without postcard cataloging. Environment actively shapes the teaching ritual and the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the building's language—is signaled early and tightens through weekly lessons, each deepening the method (seal impressions, silence interrogation). The peak moment when the narrator asks "Why are you really here?" functions as a mild reversal, and Finch's dissolution narrows options (no more live instruction). Yet the escalation is gentle; no on-page choice forces a trade-off or visible price during the narrative. The cost arrives only at closure as inheritance of solitary work, legible but not foregrounded by prior tactical pressure or a decision that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—languages spoken between living and dead, the lies we agree upon to make impossible work possible—emerges through the teaching ritual, the seal's symbolic weight, and the final exchange without didactic summary. The closing line reweights "agreed upon lies" as mutual courtesy that enables connection, and the seal becomes a key to ongoing silent conversation. One small slip: "The lie we agreed upon… was that you could teach me, and that I could learn from a ghost" edges toward articulating the thesis rather than letting the image carry it. The meteor-shower frame as "punctuation in the sky's grand text" charges the architectural-language conceit without forced symmetry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a distinct literary register—"our introduction was a masterpiece of mundane pretext," "curdled into something far more profound"—that fits an architecture enthusiast's perceptual signature. Dialogue carries subtext (Finch's sad smile, the question-and-answer exchange), and the spectral descriptions avoid filter-verb stacks. One minor drift: "patiently nimble… a quiet ballet" leans ornamental in the opening but coheres with the tutor characterization. The prose rhythm modulates between reflective passages and the compressed final dissolution without head-hopping or tense slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; figurative language ("celestial fireworks," "iron bones and mortar veins," "wind through an alley") remains controlled and voice-consistent. Two friction points: "a fact I accepted with a strange, mysterious familiarity, as if I had always known" loops the prompt's "mysterious familiarity" as theme claim rather than dramatizing it through action, and "our entire arrangement was built on a foundation of agreed upon lies" similarly front-loads the core concept as summary. The final third avoids scaffold and propels cleanly to the seal transfer. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats, but the early expository framing slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The ghost-tutor-of-architecture premise offers a fresh angle on mentor/haunting material, and the seal as teaching tool (wax impressions translating building stories) is specific. The "agreed upon lies" frame—pretending he's alive, she can learn—adds emotional texture. However, the architecture-language conceit remains abstract; we never see the narrator apply a learned "dialect" to an actual building choice or problem outside the lessons, limiting transformation test payoff. The meteor-shower setting and spectral dissolution are vivid but not structurally indispensable—substitute another celestial event or time frame and the arc holds. Freshness lies in synthesis rather than bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Professor Alistair Finch appears early (setup ✓), teaches across multiple beats (development ✓), and dissolves at closure while delivering the final lesson and seal (payoff ✓). His choices—pouring tea, guiding the narrator's hands, answering the "Why are you really here?" question, passing the seal—create beats but do not force the narrator into a costly decision that narrows options. He enables rather than pressures; his role is facilitator, not antagonist or true co-agent in a choice with stakes. Present across all three gates and integral to the teaching structure, but his agency does not drive a reversal or escalation under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The antique desk seal is introduced early as Finch's cherished object, used across teaching beats (pressing into warm wax, tracing patterns, correlating with wall stresses—multiple distinct uses ✓), and reappears at closure glowing with internal light before transfer. It shapes the teaching method (setup ✓, development ✓) and charges the final image as "the key to a conversation" continuing silently (payoff ✓). Removing it would require a different teaching mechanism. Cost connection is indirect—the seal enables work but does not impose a visible trade-off on the page. Strong integration across all gates with functional specificity; the glow effect and transfer clearly reweight its meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Agreed upon lies" is named early ("a common lie agreed upon by neighbors" for sugar-borrowing, then "our entire arrangement was built on a foundation of agreed upon lies"), recurs in the peak exchange ("The lie we agreed upon… was that you could teach me"), and frames the closure ("some languages are only spoken between the living and the dead"). It structures the relationship's terms (pretending he's alive, she can learn) and thus constrains the teaching dynamic (setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓). However, the concept is more thematic frame than on-page tactical pressure—no moment where the lie's maintenance costs the narrator a choice or forecloses an option. The final articulation borders on thesis statement rather than image-driven reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" appears once in the phrase "He was patiently nimble, his movements a quiet ballet as he poured tea, his fingers deft and sure despite their spectral transparency." The attribute describes Finch's physical grace but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost; it remains descriptive texture. Later references to his "gentle guidance" and mental nimbleness are paraphrases of patience, not distinct dramatizations. Setup present (early description), but no development beat where the trait alters a tactic, and no payoff where nimbleness matters to the closure. Label-only mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Interrogate" is seeded early ("My role was to interrogate the silence, to ask the walls questions"), recurs in teaching beats (asking questions, waiting for answers in creaks and groans), and peaks in the direct question to Finch: "Why are you really here?" (setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓). That question triggers Finch's key response and the subsequent dissolution, making it causally active at closure. However, the interrogation method—asking and listening—could be replaced with "observe" or "study" without major structural change; the specificity lies more in the direct human question than in a unique action only "interrogate" enables. Present across gates with modest causal pressure at the turn, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Borrowing sugar as "common lie agreed upon by neighbors" appears early, immediately "curdled into something far more profound: weekly tea sessions in his aerie." The tea ritual recurs across teaching beats ("weekly tea became our ritual, the steam from our cups mingling") and frames the rooftop setting for lessons (setup ✓, development ✓). At closure, the tea itself does not reappear, but the structure it built—weekly sessions leading to the final transfer—shapes the arc (payoff indirect). The method is signaled, its mechanics (routine intimacy enabling impossible lessons) matter, and it enables multiple teaching beats. Swappable with "weekly dinners" or similar ritual, lowering irreplaceability slightly, but the sugar-to-tea transformation is specific and purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during the Leonid meteor shower is introduced in the opening line, recurs as Finch's sanctuary and teaching space across multiple beats (night-blooming jasmine, potted ferns, meteor streaks as "punctuation"), and frames the final dissolution ("meteors fading, holding the key"). The setting supplies sensory resources (jasmine scent, meteor light intensifying at the peak question, starlight into which Finch dissolves) that charge emotional beats and the closure image (setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓). The rooftop's "lush, hidden world" and celestial backdrop differentiate it from a generic location; removing it would require a different atmospheric container for the teaching and dissolution. Environmental specificity and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn the language of old buildings" is stated early ("I wanted to learn… to understand the whispers in their stones"), drives the initiation (knocking on Finch's door, beginning lessons), recurs in teaching beats ("listen to the architecture itself," "every building has a dialect"), and persists to closure where the narrator is left "holding the key to a conversation that would now continue silently, between me and the old bones of the city" (setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓). The desire is consistent and culminates in the seal inheritance. However, the motivation is never tested by a competing want or cost—no moment where learning the language requires sacrificing comfort, time, or another goal on the page. Told and sustained but not dramatized in friction; the choice to continue after Finch's dissolution is presented as inevitable inheritance rather than a costly decision.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" appears explicitly ("a fact I accepted with a strange, mysterious familiarity, as if I had always known he would be the one to teach me") and implicitly in the ease of accepting the ghost premise and the tone of the prose—literary, unhurried, layered with metaphor and gentle inevitability. The tone remains coherent through teaching beats and modulates slightly at the peak question (tension rises) and dissolution (elegiac). At closure, "the final lesson" and the seal's glow infuse the image with that same uncanny acceptance. The tone charges the ending but is more atmospheric consistency than a shift that reweights stakes. Coherent and purposeful, yet static; no tonal break or recalibration that deepens pressure at the turn.</comment>
