<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's blindness is mentioned but never meaningfully constrains a choice or creates visible cost; she works "with unwavering patience" through a repair that encounters no genuine setback. The drone repair proceeds in a smooth, competence-only arc with no mistakes or contradictory impulses forcing a trade-off. Her "heartfelt" quality and "magnetic calm" remain label-only; we never see her under pressure making a choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The successful repair feels automated rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive quickly. The piece follows a causal sequence: drone broken → Elara diagnoses → patches → tests → success. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; the patch "takes hold" without complication, and the test flight succeeds on first attempt. Closure lacks cost: the drone flies, the ship sails, Elara returns to her shop fulfilled—nothing is foreclosed, no price paid, no option narrowed. The ending delivers satisfaction without sacrifice, failing the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot anchors place and tone early, and the Aethel's visible anchor-lift provides spatial reference. However, the workshop interior remains generic ("tools and half-mended devices") and the water bowl—central to her method—is a shallow prop that never constrains her movement or choice. Sensory detail leans visual despite Elara's blindness; her tactile perception of "minute changes in temperature and energy" through light refraction is asserted but not dramatized through choice or cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (repair the drone before the ship departs) is signaled early but never truly tested. Time pressure is declared ("Time was short") yet Elara works "with unwavering patience" and completes the repair without any misstep, resource constraint, or forced trade-off. The anchor-lift provides atmospheric urgency but does not alter her tactics or narrow her options. No reversal, deepening, or tightening occurs; the repair proceeds smoothly from diagnosis to success, and the test flight works on first attempt with no cost visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>A coherent theme of seeing-deeper-truths-while-blind emerges from Elara's method, and the hummingbird's "mirrored nature's beauty" observation ties repair to harmony. However, the piece frequently states theme rather than enacting it: "she saw what others could not," "a beacon of magnetic calm," "decoded feedback...into a path forward" are direct claims. The light-refraction method is asserted as revelation but not dramatized through wrong turns or conflicted interpretation. The ending's "quiet victory" offers thematic satisfaction but no non-literal reconfiguration or ambiguity that invites reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally inflates beyond the scene's needs: "magnetic calm," "harmonious dance," "ghostly shroud" lean toward generic lyricism. Elara's perceptual signature (tactile, auditory) is mentioned but underused; the narration describes light refraction visually rather than filtering through her blindness. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent, and the voice supports the contemplative tone, but the prose does not modulate under pressure—Elara's calm never breaks, so rhythm remains uniform throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is high and grammar clean, but several text-artifact patterns appear: synonym loops ("decode the feedback" / "decoding it into direction"), redundant restatements ("Though blind, she saw the success" echoes earlier "seeing nothing...but everything of its essence"), and template stems ("She decided," "She placed," "She applied," "She carried"). The repair sequence lists steps without propulsion or complication. Stock metaphors ("gentle as a lover's caress," "ghostly shroud") and elevated diction ("testament to her craft") do not arise from POV stress. Final paragraph recaps theme rather than driving forward.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The blind artisan repairing a hummingbird drone for a maiden voyage combines familiar tropes (disability as superpower, mission clock, steampunk aesthetic) without fresh transformation. The light-refraction method is visually intriguing but functions as a magic tool rather than a constraint or source of friction. Emotional arc and plot would work unchanged with a sighted mechanic using standard diagnostics; blindness is ornamental. The mist-coated depot and "Aethel" naming gesture toward atmospheric originality, but core beats—smooth diagnosis, successful patch, triumphant test—follow a predictable template without risk or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara appears in every beat but makes no choice that narrows options or creates cost. She decides to patch, diagnoses, applies the patch, and tests—all succeed on first attempt without complication. Her role is observer and executor rather than decision-maker under pressure; the repair proceeds along a single, uncontested path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The artificial hummingbird drone is introduced early, handled across multiple beats (arrival, diagnosis, patching, test flight), and its successful repair drives the ending. However, it remains functionally interchangeable with any repairable navigation device; its hummingbird nature (mimicry of nature, grace) is mentioned but does not constrain method or charge the closure. Present in three beats and shapes the ending, but cost is not tied to its specific properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The repair shop is setting and occupation but does not constrain choice or shape tactics. Elara's method (light refraction) could occur anywhere; the "tools and half-mended devices" are generic dressing. The shop is mentioned in the opening and closing but remains static backdrop. No specific feature of the shop (limited tools, space, interruption) alters her approach or creates friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Blindness is mentioned frequently but never constrains a choice or imposes visible cost. Elara uses tactile and auditory cues, but the repair proceeds without any mistake, misreading, or trade-off caused by her lack of sight. The light-refraction method is described as requiring sight yet somehow accessible to her through "fingertips...feeling...changes in temperature"—a contradiction left unexamined. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The patch action appears mid-story, drives one key beat (application), and is verified in the next beat (test flight). It is signaled and executed, but the patching itself encounters no resistance or complication—it "takes hold" immediately. The action is necessary but not irreplaceable; "reprogram," "reset," or "recalibrate" would serve identically. Present in two beats and essential to outcome, but lacks specificity and cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Light refraction through water is introduced mid-story, used to diagnose and verify the patch. The method is visually distinctive but its mechanics are vague: how does watching light through water reveal corrupted programming? It is mentioned in two beats but functions as a magic tool rather than a method with steps, constraints, or failure modes. Swappable with any diagnostic technique without loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot anchors location and tone in the opening and provides a backdrop for the test flight. However, no feature of the depot (layout, weather, access) constrains Elara's work or alters her tactics. The mist is atmospheric dressing; the rails and machinery hum but never interact with the repair. Setting is described but inert.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The anchor-lift timeframe is introduced early and provides narrative urgency ("anchor was being lifted," "Time was short"). However, the time pressure does not alter Elara's method or pace—she works "with unwavering patience" and completes the repair in time without any visible sacrifice or corner-cutting. The clock is present but does not force a trade-off or constrain choice. Mentioned in three beats but lacks causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode feedback into direction is stated explicitly and frames her goal. However, it is never dramatized as a conflicted choice or shown competing with another want. She pursues the repair smoothly from start to finish with no friction between desire and cost. The motivation is told and fulfilled but not tested or charged with internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Magnetic calm" is asserted multiple times ("magnetic calm of her presence," "a beacon of magnetic calm") and matches the contemplative pacing. However, tone remains static throughout; Elara's calm never modulates under pressure, and no moment of doubt, frustration, or urgency breaks the serene surface. The tone supports atmosphere but does not shift to charge the final image or reflect escalation. Coherent but one-note.</comment>
