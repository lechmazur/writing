<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("patch holes in her soul") is clear and drives her journey through the orchard, but her internal contradiction remains abstract—the reckless idealist label doesn't generate specific on-page tension between competing impulses. The keeper's appearance forces a micro-choice (shifting from dominance to surrender), though the transition feels more told than embodied. Interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("voids left by years of poor choices") rather than concrete, character-particular thought under pressure. The final acceptance carries some weight, but the path from "reckless intensity" to "quiet healing" lacks visible struggle or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (catacomb orchard, Elara, present-tense journey) arrive early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elara inlays meaning across the orchard, and the keeper's intervention deepens her understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance over control) with felt emotional cost. However, the causal link between laying the card on the rib and the roots "seeming to stir" is weak—coincidence complicates but does not resolve, yet the keeper's arrival feels convenient rather than earned. The closure shifts her stance from trammel-as-control to trammel-as-surrender, but the transition bypasses on-page friction; the cost is more asserted ("quiet healing") than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical change forced by prior constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid and purposeful: roots embracing bones, half-lit amber glow, bone-piled archway. Spatial choreography remains coherent (Elara kneels, keeper emerges from archway, she settles among roots). The setting constrains her physically (navigating bone-laced earth) and symbolically (life/death intertwined), and the final image of roots curling around the card charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's introspective lens, though the "vast, silent space" risks generic scale where micro-texture would sharpen the moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mending her soul through symbolic ritual—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the keeper challenges her method, forcing a tactical shift from dominance to acceptance. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on told interiority ("she felt the fragility of her approach") rather than a concrete on-page choice that narrows options. The cost at closure (placing the card as offering rather than control) is legible but lacks a visible forfeit—what path is foreclosed? The shift reads more as epiphany than earned consequence of prior pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (acceptance over control, meaning through empathy rather than force) emerges from events and the keeper's counsel. The burned tarot card shifts from emblem of regret to symbol of understanding, and the final image of roots weaving it into their dance offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the keeper's line "meaning must flow from truth, not force" edges close to thematic statement, and Elara's realization ("patching holes requires acceptance, not dominance") risks articulating the thesis rather than embodying it fully in concrete action. Subtext operates in the roots' response and the card's transformation, but the story telegraphs its insights more than it trusts the reader to infer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is elevated and consistent ("dusky resolve," "fiercely gentle"), filtering the orchard through her introspective lens. The keeper's dialogue carries wisdom-figure register ("You cannot patch your soul by merely rearranging symbols") that feels slightly formal but serves the mythic tone. Under peak pressure (the keeper's challenge), syntax remains ornate rather than compressing—"she felt the fragility of her approach" could tighten to immediate perception. No head-hopping or POV leakage; perceptual signature is selective (root curves, bone arrangements as text).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("boots whispering," "heart a mixture of shadow and determination," "cocoon of introspection"), and while some images are vivid, the accumulation in high-pressure beats (kneeling before the oak, keeper's challenge) slows momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "to patch holes in her soul" repeats in varied form three times (opening, midpoint, near-close). Template cadence: "She was a reckless idealist… She had come to trammel… She was trammeling…" employs parallel "She [verb]" stems across adjacent paragraphs. Synonym churn around "meaning" (inlaying, assigning, flowing) without added pressure. Artifacts cluster in the final third ("quiet healing," "dusky resolve softening into peace"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard (life entwined with death) is a fresh synthesis of setting and symbol. The burned tarot card and bartered destinies offer specific texture, though "trading destiny for a promise" remains abstract. Elara's arc (control → acceptance) follows a familiar spiritual-journey template; the keeper as wise guide is archetypal without transformation. The story commits to its premise and follows through with image consistency (roots, bones, card), but the keeper's intervention and Elara's epiphany arrive without surprise—the trajectory feels earnest but predictable. Emotional specificity in the final paragraph ("quiet healing") leans generic where a sharper image would land harder.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara (reckless idealist) is present throughout and her choice to shift from control to surrender is the story's pivot. Setup is early (paragraph one); development occurs when the keeper challenges her; payoff is her final acceptance. However, the "reckless" trait is told more than enacted—her journey reads cautious and introspective rather than rash. The idealism drives her to the orchard, but no on-page decision demonstrates recklessness under pressure (e.g., ignoring a warning, forcing a ritual despite cost). Present in all three beats but swappable with "earnest seeker" without major edits. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The burned tarot card appears in five distinct beats: cradled in opening, laid on rib, extended to keeper, placed at oak base, woven by roots at close. Early signal (first paragraph); development (laid on rib, extended); payoff (roots curl around it, charging closure). The card's state (burned, blistered imagery) is specific and its meaning shifts from fractured fate to offering to integration. However, the card is more handled than used—it doesn't constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it's a symbolic token. Present across setup/development/payoff with charged reprise, but swappable with any other broken token. Causal pressure is low; closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Bartered destinies" frames Elara's backstory (traded destiny for a promise) and recurs in dialogue ("I have bartered destinies, and I will barter again"). Setup is implicit in opening; mentioned in keeper dialogue (middle); absent from closure action. The concept remains abstract—what was traded, what promise, what are the terms?—and never materially alters her options or tactics on the page. It colors theme but does not shape stakes in scene. Present but ornamental; easily swappable with "past mistakes" or "broken vows." No causal pressure; no closure participation beyond thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" is labeled three times ("touch remained fiercely gentle," "With a fiercely gentle hand," "She would be fiercely gentle in her surrender"). Setup is early (first paragraph); middle (smoothing card edges); payoff (surrender phrasing). The trait is described but never dramatized as a constraint or enabler—does her gentleness prevent her from forcing the ritual? Does her fierceness allow her to confront the keeper? The label recurs without visible tradeoff or cost. Present in setup/middle/end but as descriptor, not action driver. Swappable with "careful determination" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Trammel" (to guide/confine) anchors her method: "trammel the chaotic echoes," "trammeling the flow of time," "trammeled her own despair." Setup is paragraph one; development across her attempts; payoff when she shifts to "trammel through surrender." The action shapes her goal (confine the past) and the keeper's challenge redefines it (guide, not control). However, the mechanics are abstract—how does she trammel? The verb labels her intent but does not constrain tactics on the page (e.g., a ritual she must complete, a boundary she must draw). Present across beats with thematic weight but low causal pressure. Functional but replaceable with "bind" or "contain."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Inlaying meaning everywhere" is method and motif: reading root curves and bone arrangements as text, assigning stories. Setup is paragraph one; development (laying card, assigning purposes); implicit in payoff (roots weave card into dance). The method characterizes her approach but never faces a test—what happens if meaning doesn't "take"? The keeper challenges the method conceptually ("meaning must flow from truth"), but no on-page scene shows her inlaying failing or succeeding in a way that alters her next move. Present across setup/middle/theme but ornamental in execution. Swappable with "seeking patterns" or "interpreting signs."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard (tree roots snaking between femurs and skulls) is vivid and specific. Setup is immediate (paragraph one); development across all navigation and kneeling beats; payoff when roots curl around the card. The setting pressures her physically (navigating bone-laced earth) and symbolically (life/death network). The oak embracing a skeletal torso provides a spatial anchor for her ritual; the bone-piled archway stages the keeper's entrance. The orchard's life/death duality charges the closure image (roots accepting the card into their eternal dance). Essential across beats; would fundamentally alter the story's logic and final image if swapped. Strong specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Half-lit corridors" and "glow" establish ambient light but not a ticking clock. The timeframe is atmospheric (dusky, amber/gray glow) rather than constraining—no urgency, no deadline, no pressure from limited time. Setup is early (paragraph one glow); development (glow deepens solemnity); payoff (within half-lit corridors she finds patches). The lighting sets tone and mood but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Present in setup/middle/end as static backdrop. Swappable with "twilight" or "dim lantern-light" without impact on stakes or closure. Functional for atmosphere; low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Patch holes in the soul" is Elara's explicit motivation, stated in paragraph one and echoed at closure. Setup is immediate; development when she offers the card to "mend those cracks"; payoff when she realizes "patching holes requires acceptance." The desire drives her journey and frames her final shift. However, the stakes remain abstract (what are the holes? what happens if they aren't patched?) and friction between want and cost is told ("feeling the weight of possibilities") rather than shown through a hard choice. Present across setup/development/payoff with thematic cohesion but low dramatized conflict. Functional; swappable with "heal past wounds" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" anchors tone: shadow mixed with determination, solemnity, introspection. Setup is paragraph one ("dusky resolve"); middle (does not waver); payoff (softening into peace). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (reckless intensity → quiet healing), supporting the arc. However, the register remains uniformly elevated and ornate even at peak pressure (keeper confrontation), where sharper syntax might heighten urgency. Tone charges the final image (roots in half-lit glow) but does so through consistent mood rather than dynamic pressure. Present across beats; contributes to atmosphere and closure charge. Solid integration but not indispensable—could shift to "somber determination" without major loss.</comment>
