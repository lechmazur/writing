<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated rather than tested; her backwards aging is an ornamental trait that never constrains a choice. Kael exists as recipient, not agent—his "fear flickering" and gasping are told reactions without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that alter the lesson's path. The climactic "understanding" arrives as epiphany summary ("he understood then") without prior interiority building contradictory impulses. Interior voice is generic meditation-speak; neither character's perceptual signature is distinct.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation delayed: who, where, when remain vague past the 120-word threshold; the floating platform and "world below" are spatial abstractions. Drive lens is ambiguous—lyric accumulation competes with a causal lesson structure, yet no clear pressure tightens or deepens until the final paragraph's summary revelation. Closure is asserted ("the lesson was complete") rather than enacted; no on-page decisive change or felt cost forecloses a path. The trance functions as a convenience device to deliver exposition rather than a causally earned event.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating platform and magnetic grotto provide atmospheric backdrop but never constrain a choice or supply tactical resource. Spatial choreography is abstract—"below," "drifted," "beneath them"—without concrete distances or anchors that alter action. The sycamore hush and starlight are vivid tokens but remain static across the entire sequence. Micro-setting credit: Kael's embodied position (kneeling, closing eyes) briefly grounds the trance entry, lifting the score marginally.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teaching "vanishing to appear"—is stated early but never tested by resistance, resource scarcity, or competing values. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Kael's fear is mentioned once and immediately dissolved by Elara's urging without cost. The lesson unfolds as monologue with cooperative reception; the "delayed revelation" arrives on schedule without friction. No agency decision forecloses a path; the final "understanding" is granted rather than earned through prior struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of dissolution/integration is stated overtly multiple times ("to vanish is not to cease existing," "separation," "patterns in the pond") rather than emergent from specific choices. The pond-ripple metaphor is introduced, elaborated, then explicitly decoded in the penultimate line, eliminating subtext. Elara's backwards aging is noted as thematic tool in exposition rather than lived through constraint. No on-page epiphany arises from concrete struggle; the final image ("patterns in the pond, waiting for the stone to fall") restates rather than reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Narration is third-person with stable distance, but diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("tapestry of mist," "sycamore hush of the evening," "eons of knowledge") that flatten POV filter. Elara's dialogue carries subtext ("Watch the patterns") but Kael's interior is generic recipient mode without distinct perceptual signature. Sentence stems recur: "She was a weaver," "She withheld," "She wove," "She continued to withhold"—template cadence across the opening third. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("felt a strange detachment," "felt himself dissolving," "felt himself reappear") without dramatized perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "withheld the full explanation" / "began to speak... carefully" / "continued to withhold the key" restate the same withholding across three beats. Template cadence: "She was... She withheld... Through the trance... It was... She wove..." opening five consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors: "seeds awaiting rain," "sand under tide," "two sides of the same coin." Figurative density in nearly every line without pattern-teaching blurs momentum. The final paragraph stacks summary clauses that tell rather than show the lesson's completion, dulling the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—mystical teacher instructs student in trance state—follows a familiar meditation-fantasy template without transformation. The backwards-aging detail is ornamental, never altering Elara's choices or creating friction. The pond-ripple metaphor is extended but conventional; the "delayed revelation" setup promises tension yet delivers on schedule without surprise. Specific world details (magnetic grotto, floating platform) remain postcard backdrop. No bold risk or unconventional structure; the arc is linear exposition to summary epiphany.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters the lesson's trajectory; she delivers monologue without adaptation to Kael's resistance. Backwards aging is mentioned twice (opening, near-end) as label and thematic claim but never constrains her pedagogy or creates a tradeoff. Setup present, development ornamental, closure cameo.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Magnetic grotto appears in three beats: introduced mid-piece, "intensified" during trance, and noted as "mirrored this truth" at closure. However, its magnetism is asserted rather than shown constraining choice or supplying tactical resource; it functions as atmospheric pressure rather than causal agent. No visible cost tied to its presence. Setup delayed (~40% mark), development atmospheric, closure participation thematic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Delayed revelation shapes Elara's tactic (withholding) across multiple beats and is referenced at closure ("the withheld truth was fully revealed"). The withholding alters Elara's speech choices (metaphors instead of direct answers) with stated intention. However, no on-page cost or friction tests the delay—Kael cooperates without demanding clarity. Setup early, development constrains method, closure participation strong but cost absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is stated in the opening and restated ("wove her truth carefully") but never shown enabling or constraining an on-page action. Elara's speech is indirect throughout, yet the trait functions as narrative assertion rather than lived tradeoff. No moment where careful weaving creates a cost or forecloses a blunt alternative. Label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Withholding drives Elara's method across the sequence: she avoids "direct answers," "withheld the key," and "let the metaphors sink" in three distinct beats. The revelation's arrival ("fully revealed") marks the closure moment. However, the withholding could be replaced with any pedagogical delay tactic without altering story logic. Setup early, development spans beats, closure participation clear, but swappability limits score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Pond-ripple metaphor introduced mid-piece, elaborated in Kael's vision, and referenced obliquely at closure ("patterns in the pond"). It shapes Elara's explanation (the method of teaching) across two beats. However, the mechanics of "watching patterns" never constrain Kael's attempt or create a tactical choice; the metaphor is delivered rather than tested. Setup delayed, development present, closure participation weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Floating platform anchors the scene spatially and is mentioned early and at closure ("the platform drifted on"). However, it never pressures a choice, supplies a resource, or alters tactics; characters could conduct the lesson on solid ground with no change. Its floating quality is atmospheric rather than functional. Setup early, development absent, closure cameo ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Trance state is entered mid-piece and sustained through the lesson; "through the trance" appears twice and the trance state governs the revelation's pacing. However, time is vague—no duration, urgency, or clock tightens Elara's or Kael's moves. The trance is a static container rather than a pressure device. Setup mid-piece, development present as frame, closure participation weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Teaching "vanishing to appear" is stated in the opening, drives Elara's pedagogical choices across the sequence, and is referenced at closure ("This is the lesson"). The desire is consistent and on-page. However, it is never conflicted—no moment where Elara weighs teaching against another cost or where Kael's resistance forces adaptation. Setup early, development shapes method, closure participation strong, but friction absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Sycamore hush" appears in the opening and near-closure as a recurring image. Tone is consistently quiet and meditative, matching the contemplative lesson. However, tone does not modulate with pressure—Kael's fear and the grotto's intensification are narrated in the same register as the opening calm. Tone is coherent but static; the final image does not charge or shift it. Setup early, development static, closure participation ornamental.</comment>
