<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains a label-only protagonist whose "guarded" trait is asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The interiority relies on abstract summary ("her emotions locked away like seeds in winter") rather than embodied perception that would reveal character-specific ways of processing stress. The climactic moment—pressing the seed against ice—lacks genuine struggle or visible cost; she simply "wills" success without foreclosing any live option. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; the ending declares her guardedness has "unbent" without showing the internal contradiction or price that would make transformation credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is vague past the 120-word mark: "heart of the cursed lake" anchors location but "after the magic trick failed" provides no concrete temporal or causal grounding (−0.4 for orientation debt per Q2 test). The closure unit—vortex calms, confession revealed—lacks visible cost: Elara stands in "peace" with a declared emotional shift but no forfeited path or tactical constraint on the page. The drive lens wavers between attempted Causal ("to unbend… she would need to merge") and Accumulative mood-painting without teaching a coherent pattern by midpoint. The seed's mechanics are announced late and resolve a problem (frozen confession) it did not help create, breaking earned causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid in patches ("scent of ozone and rotting fruit," "veined like marble") but remains decorative rather than shaping choice. Spatial choreography is unclear: Elara moves "outward from the vortex's eye" through "expanding circles" yet the confession is later "wedged between two roots" with no legible path or distance established. The swirling orchard vortex supplies mood but does not constrain a tactic or alter the protagonist's approach; removing it would not break the plot. No recurring object or environmental element charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"unbend the rigid silence"—is declared but never tested on the page through a live trade-off or narrowed option. The single reversal (confession spills forth) is passive: the seed "consumes" and the ice "flows" without Elara making a choice that forecloses another path. No escalation under any lens: she chants, presses the seed, and succeeds in a straight line with no setback or cost legible in the text. Coincidence (the seed's hunger precisely matches the ice's rigidity) resolves the problem, undercutting earned agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme—"hidden wounds that fester in silence"—is stated outright in the penultimate paragraph rather than arising from image and action. The final image (tranquil grove, new growth) offers a generic reset without resonant particularity or non-literal answer to the central question. The "what mirrors don't show" concept is announced as a riddle but never dramatized through scene pressure; it remains an abstract claim. The flesh-eating plant seed could have charged the ending through its hunger-as-metaphor, but it "crumbles to dust" in a convenient exit that forecloses thematic tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is generically literary with stock phrases ("warlike serenity," "seeds in winter") that could belong to any fantasy narrator rather than a character-specific perceptual signature. POV distance is stable but remote: no diction that reflects a druid's idiom or a "guarded" psychology under stress. The prose shifts into elevated register ("admission of betrayal that had cursed the lake") during peak beats without tonal justification. Free indirect style is clean but flattens rather than charges the emotional arc. No dialogue is present to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "The vortex whirled… yet she moved" / "The vortex slowed, the cursed lake's heart calming" recycle the same image without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence runs appear: "She began… She recalled… She sensed… She found… She felt" across five consecutive beats (−0.6). Mixed metaphor: "seeds… locked away like seeds in winter" contradicts "flesh-eating plant seeds" as threat without clarifying the distinction. Filter-verb stack in high-pressure beat: "She sensed… she would need… she pressed… willing it…" dulls immediacy (−0.5). Stock metaphor "heart beat in time with the expanding circles" is cliché without fresh vehicle. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("she vowed to never again let confessions freeze"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—druid unbends frozen confession via magical seed at cursed vortex—reads as template fantasy without a fresh synthesis. "Expanding circles" as search method is mentioned but not transformed through specific druidic logic or lived cost. The "what mirrors don't show" framing promises psychological depth but delivers a standard reveal (betrayer's name). Emotional arc follows a tidy problem-solution path without ambiguity or risk. The piece hedges: guardedness is declared then neatly resolved, the dangerous seed crumbles on cue, and peace arrives without a counter-reading.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Guarded druid is a label; Elara's choices (chant, press seed) are procedural rather than turning points shaped by her guardedness. The trait does not constrain or enable a high-stakes decision with visible cost. Present in setup and payoff (declared "unbent" at end) but no middle development where guardedness alters tactics. Swappable: any competent mage could perform the same actions. Late payoff is summary-only ("her own guardedness unbend") rather than dramatized choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Flesh-eating plant seed appears early (setup), is handled in two beats (discovery, pressing against ice), and participates in closure (crumbles after use). Development: its "hunger" enables the tactic of consuming frozen words. Cost connection is weak: the seed's danger is mentioned but never tests Elara; it cooperates smoothly. Specificity moderate: "flesh-eating" properties matter to the logic, but "crumbles to dust" is convenient rather than consequential. Swappable with another magical catalyst without major rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Frozen confession is present in all three gates (setup: "trapped in ice," middle: search focus, payoff: spills forth). It shapes the dominant stake (unbend the confession) and the final revelation (Morwen's name). However, it does not narrow options or impose visible cost; Elara finds it and solves it in a straight line. The concept is more riddle than constraint. Causal pressure is low: the confession's "rigidity" is abstract, and its thaw does not foreclose a path or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Finds lost things" is mentioned in setup ("her singular gift") and frames the search through expanding circles, but the trait does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic with visible cost. Elara's search is procedural scene-work rather than a dramatized application of the gift that trades off against another option. The confession is "found" by proximity rather than through a specific druidic ability that only she possesses. Swappable: any determined seeker could follow the same path.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unbend" appears early (setup: "she needed to unbend the rigid silence"), drives the middle search (expanding circles to unbend the confession), and is the verb of closure ("unbending the confession… making it flexible"). The action is causally essential: the entire plot hinges on transforming frozen rigidity. However, the mechanics are declared rather than dramatized with cost—Elara "wills" success without a visible trade-off or setback. Specificity high: "unbend" is distinct from melt or break and charges the final image. Cost connection weak: no price paid for unbending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Expanding circles" is signaled early (setup: "through expanding circles") and shapes middle action (search path widens, "each circle took her deeper"). The method provides spatial structure for the search and is echoed at closure ("expanding circles of her magic pulsed outward"). Development: the circles guide Elara's movement and discovery. However, the mechanics are abstract—no map, no visible constraint that forces a choice. Swappable with another search pattern (spiral, grid) without major impact. Cost connection absent: the method succeeds smoothly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Swirling orchard vortex at cursed lake is present in all three gates (setup: opening location, middle: "vortex whirled around her," payoff: "vortex slowed"). It supplies vivid atmosphere ("froth of petals and decay") but does not constrain Elara's tactics or supply a resource that alters outcome. The vortex "pulls at her cloak" yet she moves "with a soldier's grace" without visible struggle or adaptation. Ornamental use: description dominates over causal pressure. Swappable with another cursed landscape without breaking plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the magic trick failed" anchors the opening but provides no concrete timeframe or urgency. No ticking clock, no deadline that tightens decisions. The search unfolds in an untracked span with no time pressure shaping tactics. The phrase is setup-only; it does not develop or participate in closure. Swappable: the story could begin "After the ritual" or "After the spell broke" with identical effect. Summary-only: the failed trick is recounted, not shown.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To discover what mirrors don't show" is signaled early (setup: "the one thing mirrors could not show: the truth of her own reflection") and echoed at closure ("what mirrors don't show: the hidden wounds"). It frames the thematic question and names the dominant stake. However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No friction between this want and another cost on the page. The motivation resolves into a convenient reveal (Morwen's name) rather than forcing Elara to trade one truth for another. Swappable with any generic "hidden truth" quest.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Warlike serenity" is present in setup ("warlike serenity, thick with the scent of ozone… a calm that promised violence") and echoed once at closure ("her warlike serenity giving way to peace"). The tone is asserted as mood rather than modulated through pressure. Static: the oxymoron is declared but not charged by contradiction or escalation. The final shift to "peace" deflates the warlike tension without cost. The tone does not shape choice or constrain action; it remains decorative.</comment>
