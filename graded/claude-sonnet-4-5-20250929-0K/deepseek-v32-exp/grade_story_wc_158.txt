<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet remains abstract—a collection of labels ("shyly unstoppable," "trembling hand") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of atmospheric claims ("centuries of longing") rather than character-particular thought. The final "rest" and palm-tattoo moment lack causal grounding in prior struggle; no path is foreclosed with visible cost tied to specific wants in conflict. Motivation is declared ("photosynthesize pain into beauty") but never dramatized through a difficult trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece offers no clear inciting pressure, escalation, or decisive change—only a static poet in a shell across vague "centuries" until voices echo back and he feels "warmth." The claimed armistice outcome appears without causal linkage: no on-page action by the protagonist creates the returned lullabies or fields bursting into color. Orientation anchors (who, where, when in concrete terms) arrive late and remain hazy; the accumulative texture does not teach a coherent pattern by midpoint, and the ending delivers assertion ("Blossom armistice was no longer a dream") rather than a legible closure image with felt cost. Under any lens—Causal, Accumulative, or Situational—the closure unit is absent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell supplies vivid phrases ("pearlescent arches," "reef-shadow joy") and functions as recurring anchor, but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the poet simply dwells and writes without spatial pressure. Sensory detail is filtered through elevated diction rather than POV-specific perception, and the setting remains static across the entire span. The galaxy postcard and shell reappear in the final image, lending modest resonance, but neither object forces a trade-off or charges the closure with consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to photosynthesize pain into beauty") is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma or rising cost. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the poet writes, voices return, he feels warmth—a sequence without escalation or agency. The resolution (lullabies inspire earthly armistices) is told rather than earned, and no visible price is paid; the protagonist's final rest is reward without struggle. The piece reads as a premise held in stasis rather than conflict that narrows options under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (transformation of pain, art as catalyst for peace) is stated overtly throughout—"photosynthesize pain into beauty," "blossom armistice"—rather than emerging from concrete action. The final paragraph moralizes ("Blossom armistice was no longer a dream, but a living truth he had helped to seed") in place of a resonant image. Prompt labels appear repeatedly without dramatized cost, and the ending offers tidy affirmation rather than earned complexity or ambiguity that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent in elevated, poetic register but lacks perceptual signature—diction ("gargantuan," "ensconce," "celestial ceasefire") remains ornamental and uniform across beats without modulating under pressure. Psychic distance is stable (close third), but interiority consists of abstract claims rather than the protagonist's particular way of noticing. Purposeful compression and lyricism are attempted, but the pattern does not tighten or shift cadence to mark escalation, and no elision is taught then paid off. Dialogue is absent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "centuries of longing" appears five times, "shyly unstoppable" three times, "photosynthesize pain into beauty" four times, often within adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs through multiple "The [noun]" and "His [noun]" openings. Figurative density is high but muddles without pattern payoff—"reef-shadow joy" is coined, repeated, then glossed rather than charged through action. Scaffold sentences ("This artifact whispered," "The core concept") stall momentum, and the final third stacks these artifacts into the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise (solitary poet in a shell writes world-changing verse) follows a familiar template: artist in isolation whose work magically transforms reality. Specific transformation is absent—"off-key wind," "galaxy postcard," "blossom armistice" are coined terms that remain abstract rather than grounded in lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The ending affirms the setup without complication or earned surprise, and the diction reads as median literary fantasy rather than a singular artistic stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The insomniac poet is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or stakes. Observation and declaration dominate; the character's final "rest" is not a choice with visible cost but a reward asserted in summary.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The galaxy postcard appears in three beats (clutched early, pulsing mid-story, becoming a palm tattoo at the end) but is handled only as symbolic object—no mechanical use, no constraint on choice. The final reprise reweights meaning modestly, lifting it into functional territory, but swappability remains high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Blossom armistice is named throughout and echoed thematically, but it does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. The concept appears in the ending as claimed outcome rather than dramatized pressure, leaving it functional but replaceable with any peace metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Shyly unstoppable is a repeated label without visible on-page trade-off. The trait does not constrain action or enable a choice under pressure; it remains ornamental description rather than functional attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ensconce is signaled early, recurs in three beats (retreating to the shell's chamber, ensconcing more deeply, final embrace), and frames the protagonist's tactic of withdrawal as sanctuary. The action does not drive a major turn but coheres with the dominant stake and participates in the closure image, meeting mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind are introduced early, recur as the method of transmission, and shape the middle beat (voices return the lullabies). The mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized—no scene shows the wind carrying the words or the protagonist adjusting the method—but the element participates in escalation and closure, reaching functional-plus.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is present throughout, supplies recurring imagery, and provides spatial anchor. It does not constrain choice or alter tactics; the poet could compose anywhere. The setting charges the final image modestly through "embrace of the shell," lifting it to functional.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Centuries of longing is repeated as timeframe but remains abstract—no clock tightens decisions, no passage narrows options. The span functions as backdrop rather than pressure, and the ending does not hinge on temporal cost. The element is present but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>To photosynthesize pain into beauty is declared as motivation in four beats and frames the protagonist's project. It is not dramatized through conflicted choice or visible friction between want and cost, but it coheres with the closure claim and participates across beats, meeting mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Reef-shadow joy is introduced mid-story, repeated in three beats, and modulates slightly (bittersweet satisfaction, defining existence). The tone remains static rather than shifting with pressure, but it participates in the final image and reweights the dominant stake modestly, reaching functional.</comment>
