<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness is character-particular and shapes her reliance on texture/scent during the search, but her motivation to "imprison the sky" reads abstract rather than viscerally rooted in contradictory impulses. The final acceptance ("learned to let it go") arrives without on-page struggle between her defiance and the sky's resistance; the renunciation feels asserted rather than earned through embodied micro-choices. Internal conflict operates as summary of her realization rather than simultaneous contradictory pressures in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a clear causal chain: search → puzzle → creation → realization, with the closure crystallizing around the conceptual cost that replication strips infinity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the craft sequence and the final image reweights the premise with undeniable pressure. Orientation is swift (tree library, artist, impending demolition by line 2). One modest turn—unlocking the safe—tightens options, and the conceptual repricing at closure (mimicry cannot capture boundlessness) lands with felt constraint, though the cost could be more viscerally anchored in a specific forfeited action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tree-library anchors early with "curved shelves carved from living wood" and "faint scent of oak and ink," filtering detail through Elara's textural perception. The lectern and crystalline lenses function as micro-setting that constrains her method, and the final tremor of demolition machinery charges the ending. Spatial choreography (shelves, lectern, dome overhead) remains coherent, though the mural's physical emergence—grinding pigments, applying fractally—could benefit from one additional sensory anchor (hand fatigue, quartz grit texture) to fully ground the craft action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the sky before demolition—is signaled in the opening and tightens when the hidden safe reveals the technique, narrowing Elara's path to one final attempt. The realization that replication loses infinity constitutes a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, reweighting her goal with conceptual cost. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or tactical price during the craft sequence itself; the sky's resistance is told ("lost its infinite quality") rather than shown through a specific failed brushstroke or perceptual limit that forces her to stop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through the craft action: infinite detail cannot capture boundlessness, and the final image (sky outliving walls, acceptance of release) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The fractally precise sketch and crystalline lenses function as concrete particulars that shift meaning at closure. The line "some things cannot be contained" risks overt articulation, but the demolition rumble and Elara's step back redeem it by grounding the insight in embodied choice rather than pure assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's world of "shapes and textures, not identities" filters the search and craft beats consistently. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during puzzle-solving, slight pull-back for the realization). Two mild slips: "mirror the sky inside these walls" reads slightly elevated for her crisis lexicon, and "boundless, ever-changing soul" in the penultimate beat edges toward authorial summary rather than her embodied perception. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifacts dull momentum. "Profound hush" and "suspended silence" in the opening paraphrase the same absence of sound. "Her motivation was not to preserve the library itself, but to imprison a piece of the boundless sky" reads as scaffold exposition rather than discovered through action. The phrase "heightened stillness, every breath a conscious event" stacks abstract intensifiers without concrete embodiment. Template openings appear: "She had spent months," "She remembered," "She could mimic." One mixed metaphor: "imprison a piece of the boundless sky" pairs containment with infinity, creating conceptual friction without payoff. Cumulative effect: −0.8 under the artifact pack, plus minor propulsion drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of face-blind artist and fractal sky-replication offers a fresh synthesis, and the conceptual turn—that perfect mimicry loses the original's essence—feels earned in hindsight. However, the tree-library and demolition frame are familiar high-stakes backdrops, and the emotional arc (defiant creation → humble acceptance) follows a recognizable template. The fractal coin-lock puzzle adds specificity, but the piece does not take bold structural or moral risks that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Face blindness shapes the search method (reliance on scent, placement memory) in one sustained beat and filters her perception throughout, but does not drive a key turn or create visible cost at closure. Her disability enables texture-focus, which aligns thematically, yet removing it would not break the plot; she could search by other means. Present in setup and development, absent from closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The safe appears mid-story, drives the puzzle beat, and provides the lenses that enable the mural, shaping two distinct beats. It does not return at closure or carry reweighted meaning in the final image; once opened, it vanishes from the narrative. Early signal is modest (legend mentioned before discovery), and closure linkage is absent, capping the score despite solid middle-beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Discovering limits structures the entire arc: Elara seeks infinite replication, the craft sequence tests the goal, and the realization that mimicry cannot capture boundlessness provides the closure's conceptual cost. The concept shapes stakes (perfect detail vs. true essence) and alters her final stance (acceptance of release). Present in setup (legend of celestial mapping), development (grinding pigments to fractally precise depth), and payoff (sky "lost its infinite quality"). High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Fractal precision appears in the sketch ("each curl and wisp containing smaller, identical patterns") and the mural technique ("each brushstroke echoing the larger swirls"), shaping the craft method across two beats. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; Elara successfully applies it without on-page struggle or trade-off. The attribute describes her method but does not force a tactical decision or foreclose a path. Present in setup and development; absent from closure as a felt constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Craft" anchors the entire second half: grinding pigments, applying brushstrokes, creating the mural. It drives the attempt to replicate the sky and provides the concrete action through which the conceptual limit is discovered. The craft sequence enables the closure realization (static beauty vs. boundless soul). Signaled early (months of preparation, intent to complete life's work), developed on the page (scroll technique, quartz-mixed pigments), and present at closure (the mural exists, triggering the insight). Removing "craft" would collapse the plot. High beat involvement and causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The coin and its indentations enable the safe-unlock, shaping one puzzle beat with specific mechanical detail (tilting for shadow, aligning grooves). Signaled via backstory (guildmaster ancestor) and used once. Does not return or constrain later choices; swappable with another keyed object (ring, medallion) without altering structure. Functional within its beat but replaceable and absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tree-library provides spatial anchors (curved shelves, lectern, dome) and the hidden-safe compartment, shaping the search and craft beats. The demolition threat creates urgency, and the final tremor pressures the ending image. Present in setup (opening line), development (search among shelves, lectern compartment), and payoff (machinery rumble). However, the setting could be replaced with another doomed, book-filled space (tower, archive) without fundamental loss. It constrains access (search difficulty) but not a pivotal choice. Two-gate participation with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The impending demolition is signaled immediately ("fate sealed for demolition at dawn") and returns at closure ("first rumble of demolition machinery"), bracketing the narrative. It creates urgency ("only hours left") but does not visibly tighten on-page tactics; Elara proceeds methodically without clock-driven compromise or visible time pressure altering her method. The timeframe functions as backdrop rather than active constraint. Early signal and closure reprise earn mid-band credit, but lack of middle-beat tightening (no moment where time forces a choice) limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The desire to "mirror the sky inside these walls" is stated early and drives every beat: the search for celestial knowledge, the puzzle-solving, the craft sequence. The motivation is tested at closure when Elara realizes replication cannot capture infinity, and she accepts release—a renunciation with felt cost. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized; we see her execute the plan but not an on-page moment of conflicted choice between defiance and acceptance during the craft itself. Strong setup, development, and payoff, but the friction between want (containment) and cost (loss of essence) could be more viscerally embodied in a micro-choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" and related cues ("profound hush," "suspended silence," "pervasive calm") establish tone early and recur through the search and craft beats. The final tremor breaks the stillness, modulating tone to charge the ending. However, the tone is maintained through assertion ("every breath a conscious event") rather than embodied in action or rhythm, and the piece layers near-synonyms (hush, silence, stillness, calm) without functional variation. Coherent through turns, present in closure, but the treatment edges toward stock atmospheric language rather than fresh sensory anchors.</comment>
