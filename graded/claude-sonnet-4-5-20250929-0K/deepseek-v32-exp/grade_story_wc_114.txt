<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior state is established through concrete details (fever-broken body, swaying certainties), and her motivation to confront buried truth feels genuine. However, her transformation arrives through reflective summary rather than dramatized choice under pressure—"she realized," "she saw," "she felt" dominate the closing third. The final acceptance (pinning the illustration back with a new smudge) reads as symbolic gesture rather than a decision that forecloses options with visible cost. Interiority remains abstract in peak beats: "swaying certainties," "fault-tolerant oracle," and "peripherally aware" function as labels more than embodied contradictions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes who/where/when early (Elara, mountain station, post-fever dawn) and pursues a coherent stake: confronting avoided truth about the Bloom's rarity. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she accepts imperfection and updates her methods—but the cost remains conceptual and told rather than felt on the page. The midpoint unpinning and end re-pinning of the illustration provide structural symmetry, yet the causal chain between these acts consists largely of reflection: "she realized," "she saw," "she decided." Under an Accumulative/Textural lens (inferred from the lyric repetitions and thematic density), one meaningful deepening occurs when she correlates the flower's cycle to weather patterns, but this discovery is narrated in summary, not dramatized as a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mountain weather station, botanical illustration, and data console are anchored early and return with purpose. The illustration constrains her final choice (unpinning, studying, re-pinning with acceptance), charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective: "slick with sweat," "auroral light," "smudge on the screen." The micro-setting (illustration, console, window) functions as the environment that pressures reflection. However, the station itself remains a backdrop; occupational systems (sensor calibration, atmospheric data) are mentioned but not dramatized in ways that alter tactics or complicate the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—confronting the buried truth about the Bloom—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when she compares the illustration to weather patterns and finds dismissed correlations, but this discovery is told in summary rather than dramatized as a decision under pressure. The resolution (accepting imperfection, updating predictions) is earned by prior reflection, yet the cost is abstract: "the weight of reality, not of guilt." No on-page choice narrows live options or trades competing goods; the ending reconfigures her stance through realization rather than action that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—fault-tolerance, embracing imperfection, the balance between data and intuition—emerges through recurring images (the illustration, the smudge, auroral light) and motifs (margins, swaying certainties). The final re-pinning with a new smudge offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the piece repeatedly states its thesis: "fault-tolerance was not about ignoring errors, but embracing them," "truths, like weather, are never absolute," "the weight of reality, not of guilt." These articulations in the final third ("she realized," "she saw") function as moralizing summary rather than scene pressure, triggering a −0.5 deduction for explicit theme statements replacing image work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled diction: "auroral sorrow," "the weight of a swallowed truth," "smudge the lines between data and intuition." However, register drifts into prompt-language at emotional peaks: "fault-tolerant oracle," "swaying certainties," "occupying margins," "peripherally aware" repeat as labels rather than lived perception. The prose remains clean and grammatical, but the vocabulary feels imposed rather than character-particular. Under peak stress (confronting the illustration), syntax does not compress or modulate; the same reflective distance persists throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate the middle and closing third: "she realized…," "she saw…," "she felt…," "she decided…," "she took…," "she found…," "she smudged…" structure adjacent sentences without syntactic variation. Conceptual redundancy appears across paragraphs: the truth about the Bloom is restated in lines 9, 15, 22, 33, 37. Figurative language ("swaying certainties," "auroral sorrow," "weight of a swallowed truth") recurs without evolving meaning or dramatized pressure, reading as motif checklist rather than earned accumulation. Stock metaphor strings ("blurred lines," "smudged lens," "occupying margins") cluster without concrete anchoring. Baseline −0.8 for loops and template cadence; escalate to −1.2 because artifacts touch the closure beat ("she realized," "she felt," "she had found").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of botanical study, weather prediction, and post-illness insight offers a specific premise. The meteorologist-as-oracle framing and the Aurelian Bloom provide fresh particulars. However, the emotional arc—perfectionist confronts imperfection, accepts flaws, finds peace—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The story commits to its premise but does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes. Transformation test: the plot and arc function unchanged with different names and settings (astronomer/star chart, cartographer/map), suggesting insufficient freshness. No derivative premise penalty applied, as the Bloom and station are specific, but the emotional journey remains median.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara (fault-tolerant oracle) is present throughout and her role as data interpreter shapes the premise. Her key decision—unpinning the illustration, studying it, re-pinning with acceptance—occurs on the page but feels more symbolic than causal. The "fault-tolerant" trait is mentioned repeatedly as a label but does not constrain tactics or create a visible tradeoff. She occupies all three gates (setup, middle reflection, ending gesture) but her choices do not drive reversals or narrow options; the story progresses through reflection rather than decision under pressure. Functional but mid-replaceable: the role could swap to astronomer or cartographer with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The botanical illustration is pinned to the wall (line 3), unpinned and studied (line 17–19), compared to data (line 26), and re-pinned with a new smudge (line 33), returning in the final paragraph (line 38). It frames the opening expectation, enables the middle discovery (noticing the marginal insect), and charges the closure image. The smudge she adds marks her acceptance and ties to the core concept. Three distinct beats, causal pressure (her study of it leads to the correlation insight), and closure linkage earn a strong score. Swappability check: the specific drawing of the Bloom is less essential than a drawing in general; a star chart or map could serve similarly, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" is named (line 5) and restated thematically throughout ("her certainties had been swaying," "swaying certainties could be held with grace"). It shapes the premise—her predictions feel blurred—but does not alter on-page tactics or force a trade-off. The resolution (accepting imperfection) echoes the concept but is delivered through reflection rather than a choice that narrows options. Present in setup and ending as theme, functional in middle reflection, but not causally active. Mid-band: shapes stakes conceptually but does not change moves.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" appears as a label (line 7, 20, 37) tied to noticing the marginal insect in the illustration (line 19) and finding dismissed correlations "in the margins of the charts" (line 27). The trait enables one discovery but does not constrain or create visible cost. It functions as exposition more than dramatized ability. Present in all three gates, but the mechanic is told rather than shown through a choice under pressure. Functional but replaceable: "detail-oriented" or "intuitive" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The action "smudge" occurs physically three times: she leaves a faint smudge on the illustration (line 17), smudges a line on the screen to emphasize a trend (line 28), and the final re-pinning acknowledges "the smudges that made life real" (line 37). It ties to the core concept (blurring boundaries) and charges the closure image. The smudge on the screen shapes her updated prediction, a key middle beat. However, the action itself is small and symbolic; removing it would not break the plot, only the thematic resonance. Two beats, closure linkage, thematic charge, but limited causal irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"By occupying margins" is stated as method (line 11, 12, 23) and demonstrated when she notices the marginal insect (line 19) and finds correlations "in the margins of the charts" (line 27). It is taught early and returns at closure, but the mechanics are narrated rather than dramatized as a choice that alters tactics. The method shapes her insight but does not constrain or enable a peak decision with cost. Functional in setup and middle reflection, echoed at ending, but replaceable: "by looking closely" or "by embracing nuance" could substitute. Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is named early (line 2) and returns throughout (sensors, console, window, instruments). It supplies the microclimate that explains the Bloom's rarity (line 22) and houses the tools she uses (data console, illustration, sensors). The setting pressures her isolation and provides the premise for her work. However, the station itself remains a backdrop; no spatial constraint alters her tactics or complicates the ending. The micro-setting (illustration, console, window) does more causal work than the larger location. Two gates (setup, middle tool use), partial closure linkage, but limited irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After fever breaks" is established in the opening line and colors her perception (head throbbing, legs unsteady, "after the fever, everything felt different"). The timeframe provides the transition from illness to clarity but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. "In the days that followed" (line 35) compresses the resolution off-page. The fever shapes the premise (buried truth rising post-illness) but does not constrain tactics or pressure the ending. Setup present, functional in framing, but no middle or closure pressure. Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To find the weight of a swallowed truth" is stated as motivation (line 8) and pursued: she confronts the illustration, discovers correlations, accepts the truth's weight (line 33, 34). The desire is coherent but delivered through reflection rather than dramatized friction. No competing want or fear creates on-page tension; she decides to act (line 16) and the path unfolds smoothly. The "weight" is repeatedly named but not felt as cost that narrows options. Setup, middle reflection, closure echo, but told-only desire without friction trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is named (line 10, 29, 35) and evoked through imagery: "auroral light outside deepened, casting a sorrowful glow" (line 29), "dawn brought both light and loss" (line 35). The tone is coherent and modulates with her acceptance, charging the final image. However, "auroral sorrow" is stated rather than embodied in scene pressure; the sorrow is told, not dramatized through loss or trade-off. Setup, middle evocation, closure charge, but static mood label rather than dynamic tonal arc. Strong lyric reprise lifts the score to low-6s.</comment>
