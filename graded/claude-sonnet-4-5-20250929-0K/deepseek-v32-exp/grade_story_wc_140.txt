<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is established and pursues his goal coherently, but interiority relies on elevated, abstract phrasing ("filtered reality differently," "palimpsest of a life") rather than embodied contradiction. The final realization—piecing together his attempted murder—arrives through accumulation but lacks a visible micro-choice or renunciation that forecloses a path with felt cost; he simply "stands there" with knowledge. The absence of embodied tension at closure and the reliance on summary over dramatized choice prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story layers overheard fragments toward a final synthesis; the poison-bottle label acts as a causal key that focuses the search. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (knowledge reweighted), but cost is asserted ("painful story") rather than shown through a choice or forfeiture that narrows future options. Orientation is clear early. The accumulation pattern is coherent, but the closure image remains static—standing and knowing—without a visible price paid on the page, which limits the band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly established and used as both literal setting and metaphor for the protagonist's fragmented mind. Sensory detail (slime-covered pilings, corrugated steel, water lapping) is selective and filtered through the POV. The poison label, a micro-object, returns with reweighted meaning and charges the closure by anchoring the final realization. The setting constrains movement and supplies the discovery beats, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering erased memories—is signaled early and drives each beat. The poison label tightens focus and the overheard port-official conversation narrows options to one answer. However, escalation unfolds through passive accumulation (listening, layering) rather than protagonist agency that forecloses paths; he receives answers rather than trading cost for them. The ending delivers knowledge but no visible choice or renunciation with on-page consequence, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (erased identity, betrayal, systemic invisibility) emerges organically from the container labyrinth, the clerical ghost status, and the layered fragments. The poison label and tidal rhythm act as recurring images that shift meaning at closure. The final image—"a man with a past but no future"—resonates without moralizing and reweights prior material. Subtext operates through silence and metaphor. The ending invites reflection on nameless existence with complexity, though the protagonist's passive stance slightly softens thematic charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual filter ("filtered reality differently," "layered potential"). Diction remains elevated and poetic throughout, appropriate to the reflective, accumulative mode. Register is consistent; no head-hopping. However, some phrases edge toward abstraction ("texture of memories," "palimpsest of a life") that slightly dilutes immediacy under pressure. Dialogue is absent. The narrative voice is distinct and purposeful, and the prose modulates appropriately with the protagonist's growing urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "filtered reality" / "layer" / "texture" / "fragments" recur without new specificity. The closing paragraph contains mild paraphrase ("his identity still nameless in the world, but now vividly real to himself" restates the stakes without advancing them). Figurative language is dense but controlled; no major clarity breaks. Sentence openings vary and the prose propels accumulation cleanly, but the conceptual redundancy and scaffold at closure prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—a death-certificate error survivor reconstructing his own assassination attempt through overheard fragments in a container port—is specific and vivid. The container labyrinth as metaphor for fragmented memory is apt but familiar. Tides as pacing mechanism and the poison label as key are purposeful. However, the protagonist's passivity (listening without trading cost) and the explain-everything convergence in the final paragraphs trend toward a template mystery-solving arc. The synthesis feels earned in hindsight but does not surprise or transform expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The death-certificate error survivor frames the entire quest and his choices (collecting fragments, hunting poison stories) drive middle beats. However, at closure he receives the final piece passively (overhears officials) rather than making a decision that alters tactics. Setup and development are strong; closure participation is observational.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The poison label appears early (receding tide beat), focuses the search in the second act, and anchors the final realization (arsenic memory returns). It is handled twice (discovery, then as recall trigger) and its meaning evolves from clue to lived memory. Causal pressure is clear; closure linkage is direct. Strong integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Erased histories shape the protagonist's stakes (erased from records, wiped clean by family conspiracy) and constrain his tactics (he must rebuild identity from fragments). It is signaled early and reappears at closure ("identity still nameless"). The concept drives pressure but remains somewhat abstract; it does not force a visible trade-off or specific cost at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently" is stated early but functions as description rather than constraint. The trait colors perception (sees "layered potential" in containers) but does not enable or block a specific on-page action with cost. It is label-only; we do not see a moment where this filtering causes a mistake or advantage that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Layer" appears in setup (layering fragments, stories, emotional residues) and drives the middle beats (layering whispers around the poison label). The final paragraph uses "layers snapped into place." The action is foregrounded and shapes the accumulation method. However, it is somewhat generic—collection and synthesis—and could be replaced with "assemble" or "weave" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Collecting overheard fragments is signaled early, demonstrated in multiple beats (dockworker's complaint, sailor's boast, fisherman's tale, laundress's mention, officials' whisper), and shapes the protagonist's method throughout. The mechanics matter: he plucks stories "from the air like drifting ash," actively hunts poison-related whispers. The method drives attempts and delivers closure. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is established vividly in the opening and recurs as metaphor and physical space. The setting supplies the discovery (poison label wedged between containers), structures movement, and provides cover for eavesdropping. The port city hums with overheard stories. At closure, the labyrinth is explicitly tied to the protagonist's mind. The setting pressures choices and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Tides are signaled early ("rhythm of tides," "sea's inhale and exhale"), mark time ("weeks passed, marked by the tides"), and frame two key beats (receding tide discovery, high tide breakthrough). However, the timeframe does not tighten a decision or impose a deadline; it provides atmospheric pacing rather than tactical pressure. Present but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The motivation—"to discover the texture of memories that were no longer his own"—is stated early and drives every beat. The protagonist's search is focused and sustained. However, the desire is told and abstract; we do not see friction between wanting to know and the cost of knowing dramatized in a choice. The motivation persists without internal contradiction or visible trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Nameless identity is coherent throughout: "clerical ghost," "silhouette against the corrugated steel, defined only by his absence from records," "identity still nameless in the world." The tone modulates from detached search to urgency ("renewed purpose") to painful recognition. The final image—"a man with a past but no future"—charges the nameless-identity tone with cost. Tone shapes the ending and remains consistent under pressure.</comment>
