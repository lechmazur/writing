<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias shows consistent interiority tied to his quest, with micro-choices like tracing condensation and comparing the phrasebook. However, his dry wit feels asserted rather than embodied through specific perception—"Glaciers make poor cartographers" lands as a writerly quip, not organic thought under pressure. The final revelation at the fissure lacks visible cost; he feels peace but immediately second-guesses it in abstract terms ("What if this discovery altered nothing"), which reads as philosophical musing rather than a stakes-driven trade-off. Internal contradiction is present (peace versus worry) but never forces a choice that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when adequately early (atlas editor, outpost, frozen lake, after falcon's return). Causality follows a causal lens: falcon brings token → condensation pattern matches phrasebook → Elias finds fissure. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (discovery of the geothermal source) but the cost is underspecified—his worry about altering nothing is told rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible trade-off. The final beat ("further enigmas waiting") suggests continuation rather than a decisive reweighting, weakening closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake are described vividly ("metallic decay," "white desert under a pallid sky"), and the fissure becomes a micro-setting constraint at the end. However, setting detail is front-loaded and then static; the trek to the center and the discovery feel spatially vague—steam curls from stone, but we don't feel proximity, cold resistance, or Elias's bodily negotiation of the ice. The condensation on glass is the strongest environmental actor, guiding his interpretation and final choice, which elevates the score modestly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to find where rivers begin—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the condensation pattern matches the phrasebook, narrowing Elias's search to the fissure. Yet the escalation is intellectual rather than visceral; no on-page cost alters later tactics (he simply walks to the center and finds the source). The final worry ("What if this discovery altered nothing") is asserted anxiety, not a dramatized consequence. Under a causal lens, the pressure coheres but never forces a trade-off with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of discovery and origins emerges organically from Elias's quest and the layered imagery of water, steam, and convergence. The line "The source speaks in steam and stone" works as earned insight from the phrasebook. However, the ending tilts toward overt summary: "singular convergence had happened, but it was merely a chapter, not the end" tells rather than implies, and "water has a memory" feels like a writerly epigram rather than an image that reweights prior material. The condensation motif charges the closure modestly but is not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable, with narrative certainty calibrated to Elias's knowledge. Perceptual signature is present—he parses shapes for meaning, traces moisture—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("immense burden," "primordial pulse") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The dry-wit moments read inserted rather than integral to his thought process under stress. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "The falcon soared overhead, its cry slicing the silence as if to herald the revelation" shifts into literary distance at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied syntax, but several passages loop or paraphrase: "worrying tranquility, a calm so deep it felt like the prelude to storm" restates itself, and multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" in the first half. Stock metaphors appear ("desert under a pallid sky," "icy hush") without fresh coloring. The closure beat—"steam curled from the stone, melting the surrounding snow into a small, nascent stream"—is concrete and propulsive, which saves the score from dropping further. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he knew") cluster in reflective beats but remain within acceptable density for voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The atlas-editor-seeking-river-origins frame is a specific synthesis, and the condensation-as-map device shows ingenuity. However, the quest structure and revelation arc (clues converge → protagonist finds hidden source) follow familiar template logic. The falcon as herald and the phrasebook-token convergence feel like motif checklist rather than transformation of tropes through character-specific stakes. The final hedge ("merely a chapter, not the end") retreats from bold closure, signaling risk-aversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes two key on-page decisions: comparing the phrasebook to the condensation pattern (middle beat) and trekking to the fissure (closure beat). Both choices are observational and low-conflict; no competing option is dramatized. The "dry-witted" trait appears in two quips ("Glaciers make poor cartographers," "water has a memory") but these feel asserted rather than shaping his perception or tactics under pressure. Setup is early, but middle and closure participation are passive observation rather than choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in three distinct beats: Elias reaches for it early, opens it to the dog-eared page mid-story to decipher "The source speaks in steam and stone," and clutches it tight when returning to the outpost at the end. The dog-ear itself is mentioned but not functionally reweighted—it marks a page, but the page's content (not the dog-ear) drives the choice. The object enables the condensation comparison, which is causal, but the final mention is summary rather than on-page use. Strong middle involvement and closure linkage, but the dog-ear as distinct element is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" is named repeatedly and explained as "not merely of water, but of insight and instance." It frames the quest thematically but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page—Elias already seeks the source; the convergence labels what he finds rather than shaping how he finds it. The concept is setup and thematically echoed at closure, but it is swappable with "the answer" or "the origin point." No middle beat uses the convergence to narrow options or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" appears as a label in the opening ("With a subtly confident air, he adjusted his glasses") and is asserted again near the end ("Elias's subtly confidence solidified"). No on-page action demonstrates a trade-off between confidence and doubt that alters his approach; he proceeds linearly from clue to discovery. The trait does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost—it is character decoration rather than a pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Herald" appears in three contexts: the falcon's arrival is "meant to herald a shift," its cry "slicing the silence as if to herald the revelation," and the deciphered line feels "like a herald, announcing the nearing convergence." The action is thematic framing rather than causal driver—Elias's search proceeds whether or not anything is heralded. The falcon's token (leather scrap with symbols) is more causally active than the heralding itself. Setup and closure echo are present, but the action is easily swappable with "signal" or "announce."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The condensation pattern is signaled early ("drew his attention, its beads and trails like a coded map"), drives the middle beat when Elias compares it to the phrasebook and deciphers the convergence, and implies the fissure's location at closure. This is strong causal pressure across three beats. However, the mechanics are vague—how exactly does the condensation pattern "mirror" the symbols or lead him to the center of the lake? The method is present and active but underspecified, which caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The outpost and frozen lake are established early and frame the entire story. The outpost's window provides the condensation (key tool), and the lake's center holds the fissure (closure payoff). However, setting does not pressure Elias's choices—he could leave or stay; no resource constraint, weather threat, or spatial obstacle alters his tactics. The "rusted" and "frozen" details are atmospheric rather than functional. Setup and closure participation are strong, but middle development (constraint/choice) is absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the falcon returns" anchors the story's start and is mentioned as a past event that "was supposed to signal the singular convergence." The timeframe is static rather than tightening—no countdown, no seasonal window closing, no urgency that alters Elias's moves. He reflects, walks out, finds the source, and returns with no time pressure on the page. Setup is present but development and closure participation are absent; time does not constrain a single choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where the rivers begin" is stated early, drives Elias's on-page actions (studying the phrasebook, decoding the pattern, trekking to the fissure), and is fulfilled at closure when he discovers the geothermal source. However, the desire is never conflicted on the page—no competing need, no cost to continuing the search, no moment where he must choose between the quest and something else. The motivation shapes all three story phases but without friction or visible trade-off, capping it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Worrying tranquility" is named in the opening ("a calm so deep it felt like the prelude to storm") and revisited at the end ("The tranquility was worrying because it veiled the ephemeral nature of truth"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly—early stillness, mid-story focus, final unease. However, the tone is asserted rather than embodied in syntax or sensory detail; the prose rhythm does not shift to match rising or falling pressure. Setup and closure echo are present, but the tone does not charge the final image or drive a choice.</comment>
