<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting micro-choices. The retrocognitive visions are told as burden but never shown constraining an on-page decision with visible cost. Interior experience relies on abstractions ("texture of time," "prison of shadows") rather than embodied contradiction. The final "smile" and newfound peace feel unearned because no prior moment shows her genuinely struggling between contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but never coheres; the story oscillates between causal setup (halo fragment causes visions), lyric abstraction (texture of time as fractal), and a physical act (bridge disintegrates) without teaching the reader how these modes connect. The Orientation Test is marginally satisfied by ~120 words, but the closure—bridge dissolving, visions flickering—occurs through summary rather than dramatized pressure. Cost is asserted ("trap loosen") but not shown in a concrete choice or foreclosed path. The ending lists outcomes ("new understanding bloomed," "profound peace") without an on-page moment where stakes visibly shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The living bridge garden and hyperbolic geometry are vivid in early description, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image. The bridge's disintegration is told as transformation, not shown through tactile detail that alters Elara's options. Sensory specificity is present (jasmine scent, crystal streams) but remains postcard-level and does not filter through urgency or professional bias. The halo fragment as micro-setting object is handled twice but without evolving meaning that shapes closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escape retrocognitive trap—is signaled early but never tightens through a meaningful reversal or choice that narrows options. Elara adjusts the maze layout, but the act is summarized without visible tradeoff or cost. The bridge disintegrates not from her agency but from geometric contrivance ("hyperbolic contours she had engineered"). No on-page moment shows her foreclosing a live alternative; the resolution arrives through coincidental mechanics rather than protagonist decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Texture of time" is repeated as abstract theme statement rather than earned through concrete particulars. The final insight—"time was not a river but a tapestry"—is delivered as platitude without dramatized cost. Fading photographs function as symbolic convenience, introduced early but never constraining a choice. The ending moralizes ("every end was a beginning") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image that reweights prior material. Thematic echo in the final third ("texture of time etched into her soul") triggers deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is stable third-person limited with no head-hopping, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("quaking reverie," "infinite loom of moments") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; a hedge maze designer's professional bias does not shape what is noticed. Psychic distance widens at closure when interiority becomes summary ("she knew," "she realized"). No dialogue appears. Elision of the actual adjustment to the maze layout withholds process the POV would know, manufacturing suspense rather than imposing dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "fading photographs... their images slowly bleeding into obscurity" is restated as "Each lost detail felt like a piece of her own memory dissolving." Template cadence runs appear ("She had designed... she hoped... she found"). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle ("prison of shadows," "tide," "tapestry"). The bridge disintegration beat stacks filter verbs and passive constructions ("was not destruction but transformation, guided by..."). Figurative density at closure ("motes of light," "tide," "tapestry," "infinite loom") muddles rather than clarifies. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering elevated penalty and global 9+ disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—retrocognitive trap solved by hyperbolic geometry—feels template-driven and not transformed through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The halo fragment and fading photographs are ornamental rather than freshly integrated. The resolution (maze adjustment causes bridge to dissolve, visions to fracture) arrives through coincidental mechanics rather than a turn that grows from prior character particulars. Emotional beats follow generic arc without specificity. Proximity to genre tropes (magical object, mystical geometry) is unearned; the piece does not execute at high level or subvert meaningfully.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Hedge maze designer is setup and closure-present but her professional knowledge does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. The maze adjustment is summarized, not dramatized as a decision with tradeoff. Swappable with "architect" or "gardener" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Halo fragment appears in setup, middle (visions surge when touched), and closure (dims and becomes inert), satisfying all three gates. However, its use is static: it triggers visions but does not narrow options or enable a tactic under stress. The final inertness is told rather than charged with cost. Functional but replaceable with any mystical object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Fading photographs are mentioned in setup and as metaphor in middle, but do not shape stakes or tactics. They "vanished" at closure without causal work. Ornamental; could be cut without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Retrocognitively trapped is stated as condition but never shown constraining a choice with visible cost. The visions are described as burden but do not force a tradeoff in scene. Label-only mention; missing development gate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Disintegrate drives the climax beat (bridge unravels) and is causally linked to the resolution (visions fracture). However, the act is summarized and passive ("started to disintegrate") rather than dramatized through Elara's agency. Present in closure but does not redefine options through protagonist choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is setup (she "designed this maze using") and appears in the climax ("channeling the maze's geometric paradoxes") but its mechanics are never dramatized. The method is told as solution, not shown shaping an attempt with visible cost. Swappable with any mystical technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Living bridge garden is setup and closure-present. The bridge's disintegration is causally central, but the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Description remains postcard-level; the garden does not pressure Elara's decisions in scene.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>To discover the texture of time is stated in setup but never dramatized as conflicted desire that forces a choice. The motivation is told rather than shown through friction between want and cost. Ornamental; missing development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Quaking reverie is introduced early ("air hummed with a quaking reverie") and reprised at closure ("quaking reverie settled into profound peace"). Tone is static rather than modulating with pressure; the shift from trembling to stillness is told as summary. Functional but does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>
