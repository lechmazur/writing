<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's transformation from arsonist to preserver is asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. His "analytically intuitive" nature remains label-only; we never see him intuit hidden meanings under pressure with visible cost. The vandalized portrait insight arrives as convenient epiphany rather than emerging from established character limits. Interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("volcanic tenderness," "desperate need to cleanse") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative aspiration but fails to hold coherently. The story opens with adequate anchors (archive, six months off-grid, tapestry fragment), satisfying the Orientation Test. However, the central discovery—portrait-as-map—arrives through convenient analytical leap rather than motivated linkage. The closure unit (mending the tapestry, becoming "keeper of the promise") gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost remains abstract; no on-page choice forecloses a legible path or alters his external situation in a felt way.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The archive is vividly sketched with dust, cold air, crumbling walls, and a shaft of light, but remains largely postcard description. Spatial choreography is adequate (corridors → halls → alcove) but the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. The tapestry fragment is handled across beats, yet its physical properties (faded colors, patterns) do not narrow tactical options at the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing the forgotten promise—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The portrait-as-map insight provides one minor tightening, yet no visible price is paid; Kaelen simply proceeds without trade-off. The ending claims transformation (arsonist to keeper) but this shift occurs off-stage over "days" of documentation rather than through a pivotal on-page choice that forecloses a live option. Agency reads as endurance without demonstrable cost at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus destruction and the ethics of knowledge-sharing emerges organically from the archive trail and arsonist backstory. However, the final paragraph ("some promises are so vital they demand every sacrifice, even the use of fire to illuminate rather than consume") delivers an overt thematic summary that replaces scene pressure. The vandalized portrait's conceptual weight—self-erasure for collective memory—is told rather than dramatized, and the volcanic tenderness motif recurs without reweighting prior material at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (analytical focus, arsonist's fire metaphors) but diction drifts into elevated register ("volcanic tenderness," "abyss of forgetfulness") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. The phrase "volcanic tenderness" recurs mechanically without modulating under pressure. Psychic distance is consistent, yet the narrator's way of noticing lacks the selective, biased texture that would distinguish this mind under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose carries significant template artifacts: repeated "He [verb]" stems across paragraphs, paraphrase loops ("rescue"/"rescued" echoed without added pressure), and stock metaphors ("abyss of forgetfulness," "shadows"). The phrase "volcanic tenderness" appears three times with identical phrasing, functioning as thematic label rather than evolving image. Information density is low; several beats restate Kaelen's mission without advancing causality. Line-level propulsion stalls during reflective blocks that summarize rather than dramatize key turns (the days of documentation, the mending of the tapestry).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—arsonist turned preserver following an art trail in a lost archive—offers a fresh synthesis, yet execution leans on familiar redemption-arc beats. The "trail of artistic creations leading to a hidden message" reads as puzzle-box convention without transformation. The vandalized portrait as map is clever but arrives late and resolves conveniently. Emotional particulars (why this promise, why these fires) remain generic; the story could function with different names and places, failing the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's arsonist identity is backstory exposition; no on-page choice dramatizes the tension between burning and preserving. His past fires are summarized reflection, not lived pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears in the opening, guides him through beats (compass, patterns echoed in portrait, final mending), and is present at closure. However, its physical properties (faded colors, threads) do not constrain a choice under pressure; it functions as narrative device rather than causal lever with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is introduced mid-story, reappears as map-encoding insight, and is reflected upon at closure. It shapes one key turn (the slash-mark pattern revelation) but does not constrain multiple beats or carry visible cost; Kaelen decodes it without struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is mentioned twice as label but never demonstrated through on-page action with cost. We are told he can "dissect complex symbols and intuit hidden meanings" yet the portrait insight arrives as convenient epiphany, not earned by prior limits or visible effort.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Portray" appears as mission statement and final action (compiling guide, creating sketches), framing the arc. Yet the portrayal itself—documenting and mending—occurs in summary over "days" rather than dramatized beats that shape turns. The verb could swap for "preserve" or "record" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The trail (seedling sketch, carved stone, murals, portrait) is present across beats and leads to the hidden message. However, its mechanics are stated rather than tested; Kaelen follows without wrong turns, failed attempts, or visible price. Setup is adequate but middle development lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive frames every scene, supplies the artifacts, and is present at closure. Dust, cold, crumbling walls, and the shaft of light create atmosphere, and the spatial sequence (corridors → alcove) tracks coherently. Yet the archive never constrains a choice; no resource scarcity or environmental hazard alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" is mentioned in the opening but functions as static backstory. The six-month timeline and the "days" of documentation are untracked; no live clock or temporal pressure tightens decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The motivation—rescuing the forgotten promise—is signaled early, recurs across beats, and anchors the closure. However, it remains abstract; we learn his family "once sworn to protect" the vow but never see Kaelen's personal stake or the friction between rescuing this promise and the cost of his isolation. Desire is stated, not dramatized through conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" is named three times (opening, middle, end) but functions as thematic label rather than tonal modulation. The phrase is static; rage and gentleness are told rather than woven through syntax, imagery, or rhythm that shifts under pressure. The tone does not charge the final image with embodied contradiction.</comment>
