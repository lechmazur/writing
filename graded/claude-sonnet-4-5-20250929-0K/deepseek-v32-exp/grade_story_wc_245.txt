<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (grief navigation) is established and embodied through her dowsing quest, but her internal experience remains somewhat abstract—"vast, unmapped sea" and "transforming chaotic storm into structured composition" read as elevated metaphor rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final acceptance moment lacks visible micro-choices that would foreclose a path with felt cost; she kneels, pours intention, and finds her way without dramatized struggle or trade-off. Interiority stays consistent and grief-driven, but the closure renunciation feels declared rather than earned through on-page friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (blind mapmaker, ultrasonic forest, dowsing for stillpoint) arrive early and remain stable. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layers of absorbed sound, musical notes, and ultrasonic history build toward the threshold where Elara kneels and achieves acceptance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she transforms sorrow into structured composition—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no visible path is foreclosed on the page, and the "quiet blaze of acceptance" is asserted rather than shown through a decisive forfeiture or altered option. One meaningful deepening occurs (trail of notes → sustained chord in earth), satisfying the lens, but the closure effect lacks the sharp cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vivid and purposeful: trees sing at frequencies Elara's skin absorbs, and the great resonant tree floods her with history, clarifying purpose. The platinum ring's warmth and directional pull, the gully's stillness, and the earth's quiet song all constrain her path and guide micro-choices. The final kneeling and hand-placement on soil charge the closure image, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object shapes the ending. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (textures, sounds beyond common hearing, vibrations in marrow), though spatial choreography stays simple.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (navigate grief to find stillpoint) is clear from the outset. One meaningful tightening: the musical trail descends and ends, forcing Elara to reinterpret the hidden melody as earth vibration rather than airborne sound—this narrows her method and deepens understanding. The ring's pulse and the absorbed forest languages raise sensory pressure, but no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or forecloses a live option; she follows the trail, kneels, and succeeds. Cost remains told ("transforming chaotic storm into structured composition") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or altered tactic under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (grief as unmapped territory requiring acceptance rather than conquest) emerges through dowsing metaphor, absorbed languages, and the stillpoint concept. The final image—kneeling, letting the hidden melody tune her sorrow—offers a resonant answer without explicit moralizing. Recurring motifs (compass ring, musical trail, ultrasonic absorption) accumulate and reweight at closure. However, phrases like "quiet blaze of acceptance" and "state of being revealed only when the heart's constellations paused" edge toward abstraction; the transformation is asserted more than it is embodied in a concrete, non-literal image that reweights prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Elara's tactile and auditory perceptions. Diction ("ghostly understanding," "psychic dew," "marrow of her bones") is elevated and consistent, fitting a lyric-textural mode. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("perceived," "felt," "knew") are voice-motivated and maintain psychic distance. Perceptual signature is clear (touch, vibration, absorbed sound replace sight). However, several phrases—"wordless tongue," "smoldering intensity beneath profound stillness," "terrifying quiet of being alone"—lean generic and lack the character-particular syntax or rhythm that would enter the 9-band. Purposeful compression and pattern are legible; the piece teaches its lyric method early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are mostly controlled, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and elevated diction that repeats concepts without adding pressure. "The dowsing was a pull in her blood, a magnetic yearning guided by the platinum band" near-duplicates the ring's function already shown. "Quiet blaze" appears twice in identical phrasing. "Vast, unmapped sea" and "uncharted emotional depths" recycle the navigation metaphor without fresh detail. Stock phrases ("ghostly understanding," "psychic dew," "smoldering intensity") and filter-verb stacks in the second paragraph ("perceived," "felt," "understood," "knew") dull immediacy. Template cadence in paragraph three: "She reached out… It did not overwhelm her; it clarified her purpose. The platinum ring grew warm… The trail of notes descended…" runs identical stems across four beats. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase/loop and template issues, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats (total −1.1), landing mid-6s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The blind mapmaker dowsing for emotional stillpoint via absorbed ultrasonic languages is a specific synthesis, and the constellation-pause timeframe adds lyric texture. However, the core arc—grief journey resolved through acceptance at a threshold—follows a familiar template without a sharp transformation or non-obvious moral calculus. The musical-trail method and skin-absorption trait are inventive details, but they function as ornament rather than constraints that force difficult choices. Emotional truth is present but rendered in elevated abstractions ("quiet blaze," "heart's constellations paused") that lack the grounded, verifiable particularity needed for higher bands. No close echoes of famous lines, yet the piece reads more as a skillful execution of a lyric quest template than a bold, irreplaceable vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout; her choice to follow the musical trail and kneel at the threshold drives two beats. However, her decisions feel guided by external cues (ring pulse, trail of notes) rather than conflicted agency; she observes, interprets, and complies without visible internal friction or trade-off. Setup early, development in trail-following, payoff in kneeling; causal pressure is moderate. Swappable with another seeker archetype without major edits. Round down to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The platinum ring appears in all three sections: worn on thumb (setup), pulses to adjust path and grows warm pointing forward (development), presses into soil during dowsing (payoff). It enables navigation and signals threshold proximity, constraining two on-page choices. Cost is implied (ring's warmth = exertion or nearness to goal), but not explicitly tied to a visible forfeiture. Specific and purposeful, not easily swapped. Strong setup and development; moderate closure linkage. Round down to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hidden stillpoint is the quest's target, named in paragraph one and reached in the final beat; it shapes stakes and Elara's entire trajectory. Development: the trail of notes leads toward it, and Elara's realization that it's "not a place on any map, but a state of being" reweights the concept at closure. The shift from spatial to emotional target narrows her method and charges the ending image. Irreplaceable; removing it breaks the closure logic. Strong setup, development, and payoff with conceptual cost. Round down to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Skin-absorption of ultrasonic languages is introduced early and used twice: drinking the forest's drone to perceive musical notes, then touching the resonant tree to download its history. These uses clarify purpose and guide path choices, but no visible cost or trade-off is dramatized—absorption simply works. Label-only in closure paragraph (still "humming with absorbed languages"). Functional but replaceable with another sensory gift. Setup, development, weak payoff. Round down to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dowsing drives the entire quest: ring-guided pull adjusts path in paragraph two, trail-following in paragraph two, and kneeling to pour intention into earth in paragraph three. The act of dowsing defines Elara's method, motivates all on-page movement, and anchors the closure image. Irreplaceable; the story is a dowsing sequence from start to finish. Strong setup, development, and payoff with thematic cost (grief navigation). Round down to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The trail of musical notes is introduced in paragraph two as "shimmering notes hanging in the air," guides Elara's path through a sequence her body understands, and ends abruptly in the gully, forcing her to reinterpret the hidden melody as earth vibration. This shift narrows options and deepens understanding, creating one meaningful turn. Setup, development, and payoff present; causal pressure moderate. Swappable with another sensory breadcrumb trail. Round down to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is established immediately and pressures choices throughout: the drone soaks into Elara's skin, the resonant tree downloads history that clarifies purpose, and the gully's stillness signals threshold arrival. Micro-setting (earth, bark, soil) anchors the kneeling closure. Environment supplies resources (absorbed sound, vibration) and constrains method (must follow notes, then interpret earth chord). Strong setup, development, and payoff; irreplaceable sensory world. Round down to 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The constellation-pause timeframe is mentioned twice ("rare, silent moment when the stars held their breath" and "constellations overhead were frozen") but does not constrain tactics or tighten decisions on the page. Elara's journey unfolds within this cosmic pause, yet no clock or urgency arises from it; it functions as lyric backdrop. Setup present, no development, weak thematic payoff. Ornamental. Round down to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Navigating grief is declared in paragraph one ("profoundly personal; uncharted emotional depths") and invoked at closure ("raw ache of loss, memory of mentor's voice, terrifying quiet of being alone"). The motivation drives the quest for stillpoint and shapes the final acceptance. However, the emotional depths are told rather than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices; no on-page friction between wanting to hold grief versus letting it go. Setup, weak development (no visible want/cost tension mid-story), payoff present. Round down to 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Quiet blaze" is named in paragraph one and invoked at closure ("quiet blaze of acceptance"). Tone is coherent: restrained intensity, lyric cadence, smoldering beneath stillness. It modulates slightly (urgency in trail-following, calm at threshold) and charges the final image by framing acceptance as contained fire rather than extinguishment. However, the exact phrase recurs without evolution, and tonal texture stays uniform across beats. Setup and payoff strong; development static. Round down to 6.9.</comment>
