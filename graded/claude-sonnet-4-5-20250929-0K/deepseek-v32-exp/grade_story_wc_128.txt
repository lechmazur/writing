<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are stated rather than embodied in present conflict ("motivation, long simmering" is told directly). The character remains externally functional but lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene; her "shrewd" nature and "whimsical attentiveness" are labels without visible cost or tradeoff. Anya appears late and her interiority is accessed only through summary, weakening the relationship crucible. The final "transformation" is declared across weeks in summary rather than earned through a single pivotal choice with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough, but the piece violates 600–800 word scope by covering weeks across multiple events and locations without teaching a mosaic pattern or maintaining a single contiguous window. The closure unit is diffuse: weeks of gatherings and cascading effects are summarized rather than landed in one decisive image with felt cost. The Drive Lens wobbles between Causal (mistaken envelope sparks investigation) and Accumulative (cycles of compassion ripple outward), never crystallizing at closure. Cost is asserted ("filling a void," "inspiring others") but not made visible in a final on-page moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The breezy library under stars recurs and frames key beats, but remains atmospherically generic without constraining choice or charging the final image with specific sensory detail. Spatial choreography across multiple locations (streets, cottage, library, port events) is competent but the piece does not use environment to pressure decisions. Sensory detail is present ("saltwater stain," "starlit sky") but leans decorative rather than filtered through Elara's professional or personal priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uplift silent contributors—is signaled early but never tested by a forced trade-off or visible cost to Elara on the page. The envelope discovery prompts investigation and community organizing across weeks, yet no single tightening or reversal narrows options or forecloses a path with felt price. Escalation reads as accretive (more events, more people inspired) rather than a deepening that changes Elara's knowledge or stance under pressure. The resolution is asserted through summary of cascading social effects rather than earned by a protagonist choice with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Cycles of compassion" recurs as a label throughout but theme emerges more through direct statement ("cycles of compassion rippled outward," "enduring impact of their actions") than through image or constrained choice. The locket photo could function as a charged motif but its meaning remains static after the initial discovery. No resonant, non-literal answer reweights the premise at closure; the final paragraphs summarize moral outcomes ("filling her world with purpose and joy") rather than offering an image that invites reflection beyond the immediate plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and the POV remains stable throughout, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled and diction fits a thoughtful broker's register. However, perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias; descriptions of stars, library, and cottage read interchangeable rather than filtered through Elara's cargo-world expertise. Template cadence is visible in repeated "cycles of compassion" phrasing and several parallel sentence stems ("Elara realized," "Anya, once silent"). Dialogue is absent, so naturalism and subtext cannot be evaluated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are frequent: "cycles of compassion" appears verbatim multiple times without added pressure, and adjacent sentences restate content (e.g., "uplifting others had filled a void" echoed by "filling her world with purpose"). Template cadence runs across the final third with repetitive "[Character], [state], [past participial phrase]" constructions. Clarity and grammar are clean, but information density is low; many lines summarize weeks of events rather than advancing on-page pressure. Stock metaphors ("beacon," "rippled outward," "shimmer with approval") dull peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure zone, triggering −1.2 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—mistaken envelope kindles friendship and community recognition—follows a familiar feel-good template without transformation through specific world logic or moral calculus. The "shrewd cargo broker" trait and port setting could offer fresh professional friction but remain ornamental; Elara's shrewdness never complicates her altruism. Emotional progression is tidy and predictable (curiosity → compassion → community organizing → fulfillment) with no ambiguity or counter-reading. The ending could work unchanged with different names and places, indicating insufficient specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as cargo broker is mentioned early but her professional shrewdness does not constrain or enable key choices on the page. She recognizes a ship in the locket photo and organizes community events, but these actions do not depend on brokerage expertise. The character is present across all beats yet her decisions (trace envelope, visit Anya, plan gatherings) are generic investigator/organizer moves, swappable with any protagonist. No on-page cost tied to her broker identity appears.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The locket photo appears in two beats: discovery (sparks investigation) and return (becomes symbol on mantle). It enables the middle investigation turn and recurs at closure with reweighted meaning ("symbol of their friendship"), satisfying the gate model. However, its specific properties (gentle eyes, cargo ship) do not constrain later choices or create visible cost; it functions as a trigger and later emblem without evolving use under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Cycles of compassion" is named repeatedly as theme but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The concept is echoed in summary ("cycles of compassion rippled outward," "continued to turn") rather than dramatized through a choice where compassion trades against another value. It frames interpretation but remains told-only, trending low per the rubric.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Whimsically attentive" is mentioned twice as a label ("whimsically attentive," "whimsical attentiveness") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The trait does not create visible tradeoffs or friction; Elara's attention to the envelope's script and stain prompts investigation but any careful observer could do the same. Label-only use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Initiate" appears explicitly ("initiate an investigation," "initiate a community effort") and frames two key turns: the envelope investigation and the community organizing. Both actions redefine Elara's options and drive later beats. However, the action is stated rather than dramatized at the moment of decision, and the second use (community effort) is summarized across weeks rather than shown as a single initiating choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The mistaken-address envelope is signaled early, drives the investigation middle beat, and kindles the friendship that frames closure. It satisfies setup, development, and payoff gates. Yet its mechanics (how it was misaddressed, why it ended up in that book) remain vague, and the friendship that results feels inevitable rather than earned by friction the envelope created. Swappable with any found keepsake that prompts a quest.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The breezy library under stars recurs across three beats (opening retreat, planning gathering, final reflection) and frames closure, satisfying all gates. However, it remains atmospherically generic without constraining choice or supplying resources that alter tactics. Postcard description ("starlit sky," "breezy night air") trends low; no micro-setting detail (shelf arrangement, seating, access) shapes decisions under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the symphony ends" anchors the opening moment and recurs as a framing device ("after another symphony," "after symphonies ended"). It provides temporal flavor but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the narrative spans weeks with no live clock or time pressure. Vague time tracking trends low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation to uplift silent contributors is stated explicitly ("motivation, long simmering, was to uplift silent contributors") and drives Elara's investigation and organizing across all beats. It appears early and shapes the ending's thematic charge. However, it is told rather than dramatized through an on-page choice where uplifting conflicts with another desire or cost. Told-only motivation without friction trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named twice but never modulates with pressure or charges the final image. The tone remains uniformly gentle and optimistic across investigation, friendship, and celebration without tension or tonal shift. A single static mood trends mid-low; no coherent modulation under stress appears on the page.</comment>
