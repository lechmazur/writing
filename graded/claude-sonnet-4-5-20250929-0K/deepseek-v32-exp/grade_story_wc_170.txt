<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is declared but never tested by concrete opposition or cost. Interior states are asserted through labels ("perceptively calm," "borrowed heartbeat") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The work complete, she "slips away" without any visible forfeit or transformation—no path is foreclosed, no flawed choice compounds. Agency reads as observation rather than decision with consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is present early (terrace, spring, waiting for bells), but no causal linkage drives the narrative—each sentence adds descriptive texture without because/therefore pressure. The closure unit is a passive fadeout: "the mirages held for a breath longer" then Lyra departs with "her work complete," offering no decisive change, felt cost, or reconfiguration of prior stakes. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in method but delivers no pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. Inferred lens: Accumulative, but closure does not land with cost under that lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The terrace, parapet, and prismatic moisture are vividly described and filter through Lyra's perceptual priorities. However, the environment remains a static backdrop—no spatial constraint forces a tactical choice, and the final image does not charge setting details with new meaning. Sensory selection is consistent but ornamental; the world does not push back.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through opposition. No reversal, visible price, or trade-off occurs; Lyra hums, the mirrors "tremble slightly," and "one mirror after another" complies without friction. The first bell tolls and she leaves; no option is foreclosed, no cost paid. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>A theme of possibility versus reflection emerges through the mirror conceit, and the prismatic imagery recurs with coherent tonal texture. Yet the final image—mirages fading as Lyra slips away—delivers no resonant answer or conceptual repricing; the question is posed but not reweighted. The lullaby mechanism and "borrowed heartbeat" remain metaphorical claims without dramatic friction or subtext that would elevate theme beyond assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register with purposeful diction ("elusive," "dusky harmony"). Psychic distance remains controlled and the perceptual signature—light, sound, texture—is character-specific. However, the prose leans heavily on abstract terms ("possibilities," "potential," "intent") and filter constructions ("she envisioned," "she focused") that dull immediacy at key beats, and the final paragraph's elevated register feels slightly detached from scene pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the text is grammatically clean, but paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Her perceptive calm allowed her to notice the subtle shifts" echoes "Lyra's grace was not just in her movement but in her patience"; "through coded lullabies" repeats as "embedding new codes"; "the mirrors trembled slightly" / "the first mirror shimmered" recycle the same beat without added pressure. Information density is low—many lines restate mood or setting without advancing choice. Figurative language ("threads in her tapestry of illusions," "canvas ready for her to paint upon") stacks without coherent vehicle logic. Apply −1.2 for loops, template cadence, and mixed metaphor clusters across the text, with −0.3 additional for filter-verb stacks in the middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The mirage-painter premise and coded-lullaby method offer a fresh angle, and the prismatic parapet after rain is a specific anchor. Yet the emotional arc and plot structure are generic: artist works magic, magic succeeds without friction, artist departs unchanged. The core could be reskinned (e.g., sculptor persuading stone, dancer persuading shadows) with minimal structural impact. No bold risk heightens stakes, and the closure avoids confronting the premise's implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout and the text labels her "elusive mirage painter," but her choices do not create turns—she hums, traces stone, and "slips away" without opposition or visible decision cost. Setup and closure presence are met, but middle development shows observation rather than agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prism parapet is handled in multiple beats (Lyra traces it, guides light toward mirrors, it becomes "her palette"), satisfying setup and development. It appears in the penultimate paragraph ("prism parapet after rain became her palette") but does not decisively shape the ending action or image—the mirrors respond to the lullaby, not the parapet's mechanics. Closure linkage is weak; cap at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The "borrowed heartbeat" is mentioned three times as metaphor ("felt borrowed," "synced with the song's rhythm," "quickened") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. It remains thematic decoration rather than a stake-shaping mechanic. Present in setup and middle, absent from closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is a label applied twice ("stood perceptively calm," "Her perceptive calm allowed her to notice") without enabling or constraining an on-page action with cost. It describes mood rather than creating friction or trade-off. Setup met, development and closure absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Grace" appears in multiple lines ("moved with a quiet grace," "Lyra's grace was not just in her movement," "Grace defined her every action") but functions as descriptive trait rather than a decisive action that turns the plot. The text could substitute "precision" or "patience" with minor edits and retain the same arc. Ornamental integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The coded lullabies are signaled early ("through coded lullabies in children's songs"), Lyra hums and varies pitch mid-story, and the method drives the mirrors' response at closure. Setup, development, and closure presence are met. However, the mechanics remain vague—what the codes do or how they persuade is asserted, not dramatized with friction or cost. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The echoing terrace is anchored early and recurs as a spatial frame; the "echoing" property amplifies Lyra's song and the final line reprises "the echoing terrace" to close the frame. Setup and closure met. Development is weak—the terrace does not constrain her movement or force a tactical choice; it remains a backdrop. Lyric reprise with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The hush before bells is signaled in the opening line and the first bell tolls in the penultimate paragraph, bracketing the action and imposing a deadline. This creates mild urgency ("before the bells broke the silence," "As the first bell tolled") that shapes the ending's timing. Setup, development (implicit countdown), and closure met with modest pressure. The clock is acknowledged but not leveraged for tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Lyra's desire "to persuade the ancient mirrors" is stated early and pursued through humming and light manipulation. Setup and development met. However, the motivation is never conflicted—no cost, doubt, or friction tests her commitment. The mirrors comply without resistance, so the want is dramatized as action but not as stake with pressure. Closure shows success without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" is named twice and the text sustains a consistent lyric, contemplative register (soft echoes, gentle breeze, lingering promise) across all beats. Tone modulates slightly as the lullaby crescendos and the bell tolls, and the final line reprises the tone to charge the ending image. Setup, development, and closure met with coherent modulation. The tone does not tension the concept or reveal cost, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>
