<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her "carefully resourceful" trait surfaces in several beats (consulting the diary, cross-referencing gaps), but her interior life remains thin—she "assessed their scant options without panic" tells rather than embodies contradictory impulses. Kael's fear is asserted ("grew impatient, his fear palpable") but never dramatized through embodied perception or micro-choices that reveal his hierarchy of values. The final choice—Kael confronting his error—lands without visible struggle or cost on his part; the botanical diary does the heavy lifting while both characters glide through the quest.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is hybrid causal-accumulative: the diary decode → floating books → doorway sequence follows because/therefore linkage, while the "unheard symphony" motif and meditation pause gesture at textural deepening. Orientation anchors arrive late (the Glimmering Stack's nature and spatial logic remain vague until midpoint), triggering a −0.4 penalty. Closure lands on-page—Kael reads the book, the timeline heals—but the cost is asserted in summary ("the library was now a part of her, its lessons silently echoing") rather than felt in the final image. The constraint (library shifts based on seeker's intentions) shapes one turn but is introduced and resolved within a single beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain is evocative but remains a postcard backdrop; spatial choreography is vague (how do aisles twist? where is the horticulture wing relative to biography?). The floating-books chamber and the botanical diary constrain one beat each, but the environment never pressures a choice at closure—the doorway simply "shimmers into existence" when the ritual completes. Sensory detail is sparse and generic ("dusty alcove," "glowing tomes") without POV-filtered specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve the volume to stabilize Kael's timeline) is signaled early and drives the quest. Pressure tightens once: the realization that Kael's own avoidance caused the paradox shifts tactics from frantic search to meditative journey. However, the escalation is summary-driven ("they renegotiated their approach") rather than dramatized through on-page choice under duress, and the final resolution (Kael reads, timeline heals) unfolds without visible cost or trade-off—luck and the diary's decode do the work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme (redemption through confronting unlearned lessons) emerges from the diary's coded guide and Kael's avoidance, avoiding overt statement until the penultimate line ("the library was now a part of her, its lessons silently echoing"), which borders on summary but stops short of moralizing. The "unheard symphony" motif recurs but remains abstract—it neither constrains choice nor charges the closure image with concrete resonance. Subtext operates lightly in the meditation pause and the shift from rescue to confrontation, but the final image defaults to gentle resolution without ambiguity or earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV (Elara) with stable psychic distance. Perceptual signature is generic—her linguistic expertise surfaces in the decode beat but her way of noticing (word choice, syntax) does not feel character-specific. Diction remains competent but uniform ("carefully resourceful," "unheard symphony," "complex harmony") without rhythmic variation under pressure. Kael's brief dialogue and behavior sketch a distinct urgency, but his internal texture is withheld; the piece avoids head-hopping yet also withholds embodied interiority for both characters.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean and grammatical with varied sentence openings and no glaring loops. Information density is moderate—several beats (diary retrieval, decode, floating books, ritual) advance causality, but connective tissue ("After the time traveler arrived, everything changed") relies on summary scaffolding. Template cadence appears in the setup ("She stood within…her motivation was singular…") and the tone claims ("The tone of their quest was like an unheard symphony") tell rather than enact the rhythm. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops touch the closure, keeping the score in mid-range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The bookstore-as-mountain and Library of Unlearned Lessons premise offers modest freshness, but the quest structure (find coded guide, decode, unlock hidden place) follows template fantasy-adventure beats. The botanical diary as key is a serviceable twist yet swappable with any arcane artifact without structural loss. The "unheard symphony" tone and the shift from rescue to confrontation gesture at originality but remain under-developed; the emotional arc (Elara remains, Kael returns healed) resolves without bold risk or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara (arcane linguist) decodes the diary and binds their purpose in ancient tongue—two distinct beats that alter tactics. She is present at closure but does not make a final choice; the library becomes "part of her" in summary. Early signal, middle causal work, passive closure participation: 5.0 baseline +0.4 beat involvement +0.3 early signal −0.5 passive ending = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Botanical diary appears in beat two (retrieval from alcove), beat three (decode of patterns), and beat four (identifies the gap—missing volume on temporal ethics). It enables the unlock but does not return with reweighted meaning at closure. Early signal, three beats, causal pressure, no charged reprise: 5.0 +1.4 beats +0.8 causal +0.3 early −0.7 (no closure linkage) = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Rescue missions frame the inciting incident ("his presence initiated a series of rescue missions") but do not shape on-page tactics—Elara and Kael pursue retrieval, not rescue, and the shift from rescue to confrontation is asserted in one line without dramatized friction. Present early, theme-level echo, minimal causal work: 3.0 +0.3 early −0.5 ornamental +0.3 (one beat mention) = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Carefully resourceful appears as label ("being carefully resourceful") and surfaces in the cross-reference beat and the meditation pause—two on-page actions with cost (time, method shift). No closure linkage. Early signal, two beats, mid-level causal pressure: 5.0 +0.9 beats +0.5 causal +0.3 early −1.0 (label-only introduction, no charged ending) = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Renegotiate drives the turn from frantic search to meditative journey and the ritual that binds their purpose, redefining options twice. Present at midpoint (late for setup), causally indispensable, no direct closure image: 5.0 +0.9 (two beats) +1.0 causal −0.5 (late first use, second third) = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>By researching gaps is signaled early ("researching gaps in the existing catalogs"), used in the cross-reference beat and the identification of the missing volume—two distinct beats that shape attempts. Mechanics matter and are shown on-page. Early signal, two beats, causal role: 5.0 +0.9 beats +0.8 causal +0.3 early −0.9 (no closure participation) = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Labyrinthine bookstore occupying entire mountain frames the quest and provides the horticulture wing and floating-books chamber—two locations that supply resources. Spatial vagueness and postcard description limit pressure; the environment does not constrain the final choice. Early signal, two beats, moderate resource role: 5.0 +0.9 beats +0.5 (resource, not pressure) +0.3 early −0.8 (swappable with generic maze, no closure charge) = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>After the time traveler arrives marks the inciting boundary but time is not tracked or tightened thereafter—Kael's collapsing timeline is asserted as urgent yet no clock narrows decisions on-page. Setup gate only, no middle or closure participation: 3.0 +0.3 early −0.5 (ornamental use) = 2.8, but the inciting role lifts slightly to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To find the Library of Unlearned Lessons is Elara's stated motivation, drives the quest across three beats (setup, decode, ritual), and achieves partial closure when the library becomes "part of her." Desire is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between want and cost until the meditation pause, which is brief. Early signal, three beats, causal but underplayed: 5.0 +1.4 beats +0.7 causal +0.3 early −0.8 (told-only, minimal friction) = 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Unheard symphony appears in the setup ("The tone of their quest was like an unheard symphony") and the resolution ("Elara felt the unheard symphony swell to a crescendo"), functioning as bracket. Tone is asserted rather than enacted through rhythm or sensory modulation—the prose cadence does not shift with pressure. Lyric reprise with cost claim but no felt charge: 5.0 +0.8 (closure mention) +0.3 early −1.4 (static mood, told-only) = 4.7.</comment>
