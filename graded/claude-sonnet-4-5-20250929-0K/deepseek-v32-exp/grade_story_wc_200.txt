<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is presented through consistent external description ("modestly fearless," "quiet bravery") but her internal life remains flat and label-driven. The soul-collector premise never generates contradictory impulses or embodied struggle; she executes her method without friction, cost, or surprise. Lyra's chuckle-to-laugh progression is mechanically narrated rather than earned through a dramatized choice that forecloses an alternate path. The ending recycles opening labels ("luminous ache," "modest fearlessness") as static decoration, not as evidence of change or renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative decoration (recurring "luminous ache," harp notes). Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 4, waiving the penalty. However, no meaningful because/therefore linkage tightens options: Elara sets the harp, Lyra appears, Elara asks for joy, Lyra laughs, soul dissipates—each step is narrated consecutively without opposition or cost that narrows tactics. The closure unit (Lyra's laughter dissolving pain, lines 19–22) reads as Decisive Change under Causal lens, but the cost is asserted ("pain dissolved") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible price Elara pays. The final paragraph loops opening phrases without reweighting them, diluting closure resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is named and described (whispering walls, amplifying silence, golden rays) but functions as postcard backdrop; no spatial constraint alters Elara's choices. The harp and crocodile's tooth are handled on the page (set on rock, traced in air, clutched), satisfying micro-setting presence. The hidden sunrise bookends the piece and modulates light (chill → golden rays), charging the final image with tonal shift. However, the gorge's acoustics never complicate the spectral summoning or force a tactical adjustment, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (heal Lyra's soul through laughter) is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The sequence—pluck harp, Lyra appears, request joy, Lyra laughs—unfolds without reversal, escalation, or a choice that forecloses an alternate path. Elara's "modest fearlessness" is told but not dramatized under pressure; no moment forces her to trade one value for another or endure a visible loss. The soul dissipates as an automatic outcome rather than a protagonist-driven turn, undercutting agency. No causal tightening narrows options under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (healing through laughter, integration of joy and pain) is stated repeatedly ("luminous ache," "integrate laughter into healing") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. Lyra's memory of dancing in rain and the silly tune are token gestures, not events that test or complicate the thesis. The crocodile's tooth and harp recur but do not shift meaning; their final mentions echo opening descriptions without conceptual repricing. The ending asserts "one laugh at a time" as a thesis statement, replacing resonant image with sermon. No counter-reading or ambiguity complicates the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited on Elara; POV distance is stable, no head-hopping. Diction mixes concrete images (crocodile's tooth, flat rock) with elevated abstractions ("luminous ache," "spectral realm") that feel imported rather than character-rooted. Dialogue is minimal (two lines from Elara) and functional but carries no subtext or tension. The prose recycles opening phrases in the final third ("modestly fearless," "luminous ache," "hidden sunrise") without rhythmic or perceptual evolution, flattening voice under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara's noticing does not reflect a character-specific filter or bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "modestly fearless" appears three times, "luminous ache" four times, "hidden sunrise" three times, "crocodile's tooth" five times, often in identical syntactic slots without added pressure. Template cadence dominates the final third: "She knew… She walked… Her… Through the… The… For now…" runs eight consecutive paragraph-initial declaratives. Lines 30–43 form a scaffold summary restating the premise without advancing situation or emotion. Mixed metaphor: "amplified every sound, but now it was silent" (line 3) contradicts itself. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph (lines 30–43), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Premise (soul collector uses misaligned harp and laughter to heal ghosts) combines familiar fantasy tropes (psychopomp, magical tool, confession ritual) without transforming them through specific stakes or moral calculus. The crocodile's tooth and Echo Gorge are named but generic in function—any mystical object and acoustic space would serve. Emotional arc (sorrowful ghost → laughter → dissipation) follows template beats with no friction or surprise. The transformation test fails: swap names and setting, and the plot persists unchanged. No bold risk or conceptual commitment elevates the synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara, the lost soul collector, is named and present throughout. Her role frames the premise but generates no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She performs her method without obstacle or trade-off; the pursuit is declared (line 2) but not dramatized as a choice under pressure. Present by setup, absent in middle development (no choice that changes options), ornamental at closure (loops opening labels). Two-gate miss and swappability (any psychopomp archetype fits) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The crocodile's tooth appears in five beats (clutched line 4, traced line 14, cool line 23, secure line 26, symbol line 35) but function remains static: "key to the spectral realm" (line 4) and "symbol of her journey" (line 35) are told labels without dramatized constraint. Tracing a symbol (line 14) does not narrow options or impose cost. Setup and closure gates met, but middle development is ornamental. Swappable with any mystical key; no unique property matters.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Spectral confessions appear in setup (line 2, 5) and middle (Lyra's voice line 11, revealing regrets line 11), shaping one beat (Lyra confesses memory of joy, line 16). However, the confession mechanic never constrains Elara's tactics or generates friction—Lyra complies immediately when asked for joy, bypassing the "regrets and fears" mentioned earlier. Closure participation is ornamental (line 38 restates the premise without reweighting it). Functional in one beat, replaceable elsewhere.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Modestly fearless" is labeled three times (line 1, 12, 29) but never dramatized as a constraint or enabler that alters a choice. Line 12 claims it allows Elara to "absorb the pain without flinching," yet no on-page moment tests this capacity with cost or tradeoff. The attribute is ornamental, repeated without causal work. Present by setup, absent in development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Pursue" is named (line 2, 24, 37) but the pursuit itself is not dramatized as a choice-driven action. Elara arrives at the gorge already in position; no on-page beat shows her tracking, deciding to engage, or risking a miss. The word recurs as thematic decoration without shaping a turn. Easily swappable with "summon" or "heal" with minor edits. Setup met, development and closure ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The misaligned harp is set and plucked in two beats (lines 8–9, 17) and its distorted notes "creating a dissonance that pierced the veil" (line 9) enables Lyra's appearance. The method shapes one causal turn (notes → Lyra materializes) and is present at closure (line 38). However, the distortion never imposes cost or complicates the process—notes align "slightly" (line 17) without dramatized adjustment by Elara. Functional across beats but lacks specificity or irreplaceability; any mystical instrument fits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is named and described (whispering walls line 3, silence line 3, golden rays line 22, amplifying silence line 35) in setup and closure. The gorge's acoustic property ("amplified every sound") is stated but never used tactically—the harp's distortion, not the gorge's echo, summons Lyra. Spatial positioning (harp on flat rock line 8) does not constrain choice. Setup and closure gates met via lyric reprise (line 30 "returned to its quiet state"), but middle development is absent. Postcard function, not pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Hidden sunrise" bookends the piece (line 1, 22, 30, 38) and modulates light (chill → golden rays), charging the final image with tonal shift. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a clock; the ritual unfolds without temporal pressure or cost tied to dawn's progression. Lyric reprise reweights atmosphere but not stakes. Setup and closure met, middle development ornamental. Functional as tone marker, replaceable as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Integrate laughter into healing" is stated (line 6, 32) and enacted (lines 13–19: Elara requests joy, hums silly tune, Lyra laughs). The motivation drives one beat (requesting joy line 15) but is not conflicted—Elara pursues it without friction, cost, or competing desire. The phrase "lifelong motivation" (line 32) is told rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses an alternate path. Setup and one middle beat, closure ornamental (restates premise without reweighting).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" recurs four times (line 7, 21, 27, 33, 41) as a phrase blending light and pain. It modulates slightly—line 7 "blend of dawn's light and pain," line 21 "intensified… brightening as pain dissolved," line 41 "burden and reward"—reweighting the dominant stake across setup, middle, and closure. However, the tone remains static in execution; no syntactic or rhythmic shift reflects pressure changes. The reprise charges the final image but does not cohere with scene dynamics. Lyric function met, but emotional modulation is told rather than enacted through prose texture.</comment>
