<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is consistently rendered through concrete sensory anchors (faded blue paint, salt-stung air), and her motivation to confront buried memory drives the cave journey. The final choice to leave the shell behind enacts visible cost—she walks away lighter, unburdened—but the epiphany ("nostalgia had been a cage") edges toward therapeutic label-speak without fully embodied struggle in the moment. Internal contradiction is present (clinging to memory vs. seeking peace) but could layer more viscerally under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The wrong-turn discovery → painted shell → realization sequence builds coherent pressure and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she places the shell back, foreclosing the nostalgic grip with visible cost). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length. The closure image (cracked mirror becomes "new pattern") reweights prior material, though the cost could be more viscerally immediate rather than reflected upon.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coastal cave network constrains the revelation: light through fissures, the pool's reflection, and the natural rock shelf all guide Elara's final choice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her nostalgic lens (brine, ancient stone, shifting patterns). The cave's architecture—hidden entrance, secluded chamber—directly enables the discovery and charges the closure image. Micro-setting (the pool, the rock shelf) functions as an active agent in the realization beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (return to unbroken peace) is signaled early and tightens when Elara finds the painted shell, forcing a choice between clinging to the past and releasing it. One meaningful reversal: discovering the shell reframes her promise from preservation to liberation. The final act—placing the shell back—enacts protagonist agency with visible cost (unburdened heart, lighter satchel). Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, though the escalation could narrow options more sharply in the cave beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (temporary eternity's beauty in its fleeting nature) emerges organically from the painted shell, the cracked mirror, and the cave's "pausing yet inexorable" time. The final image—cracked mirror as new pattern, not break—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates through gesture (trembling fingers tracing brushstrokes, placing the shell back) and the oasis metaphor. The core concept integrates with theme via specific events rather than exposition, though one late phrase ("promises to oneself are the hardest to keep") edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV maintained with stable psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific (artistic lens, nostalgia-filtered details). Diction occasionally shifts into elevated register ("temporary eternity," "intimately aloof") that feels slightly imposed rather than native to Elara's interior voice under pressure. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though one filter-verb cluster in the opening paragraph ("felt," "seemed") slightly dulls immediacy. No dialogue; voice modulates with emotional beats (trembling discovery, quiet peace at closure).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. Two minor scaffold artifacts: "This was the shell she had painted as a girl, leaving it here as a vow" restates discovery content within the same beat, and the final paragraph's summary mode ("she would paint again…the most rewarding") recaps rather than trusts the image. Figurative language ("salt-stung present," "cage of nostalgia") is functional but occasionally stacked in descriptive passages. Propulsion is strong until the closing reflection slightly diffuses momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nostalgic-artist-confronts-past premise is familiar but transformed through specific details: the wrong-turn discovery, the painted shell as time capsule, and the cracked mirror motif. The coastal cave network and the "temporary eternity" framing add texture. However, the emotional arc (letting go of the past to embrace the present) follows a well-worn template without a sharp twist; the resolution feels anticipated once the shell is discovered. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative design without bold structural deviation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara makes two key decisions: taking the overgrown path (inciting choice) and leaving the shell behind (closure choice that redefines her relationship to memory). Present in setup, middle beats, and ending; her occupation colors perception throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The painted seashell appears in setup (packed but unpainted), is discovered and handled in the cave (trembling fingers trace brushstrokes), and is placed back in the closure beat with reweighted meaning (release rather than preservation). Three distinct beats, irreplaceable specificity (her own childhood work), closure-active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Temporary eternity is introduced early, recurs in the cave reflection, and underlies the final realization (fleeting beauty). It shapes Elara's stakes (seeking a moment that feels infinite) but does not constrain tactics on the page; functions more as thematic lens than tactical pressure. Two gates (setup, payoff) with mid-tier causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Intimately aloof" is described in the opening (knows fishermen but remains distant) but does not constrain an on-page choice with cost. It characterizes her demeanor without altering tactics or closure. Present in setup, absent from middle and ending beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reveal" drives the climax: finding the shell reveals the truth of her nostalgic cage, and placing it back enacts the revelation's cost. The action is signaled (hidden promise) and redefines options at closure. Two beats (discovery, release); essential to the ending but the verb itself is somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The wrong turn is signaled (distracted by memory), enacted (stumbles into gorse), and its mechanics matter (leads to hidden cave entrance). It enables the discovery beat and thus the closure. Three gates; causal pressure; irreplaceable in this exact sequence (no turn, no cave, no shell).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The coastal cave network supplies the hidden chamber, pool, and rock shelf that enable the shell discovery. It constrains movement (narrow entrance, secluded chamber) and charges the final image (sanctuary where time paused). Present in setup mention, active in middle and ending beats; setting-as-agent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the mirror cracks" frames the inciting event (yesterday's fracture) and primes the revelation beat (fractured heart motif). The timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock; it provides emotional context. Two gates (setup, thematic payoff) but no middle escalation tied to elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hidden promise (return to perfect peace) is introduced early, drives the wrong-turn journey, and is fulfilled—then redefined—at closure (release rather than return). Friction between the promise's original intent and its true cost creates the central tension. Three gates, causal pressure, closure-active.</comment>
