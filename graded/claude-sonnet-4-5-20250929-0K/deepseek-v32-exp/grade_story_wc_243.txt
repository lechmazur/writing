<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to preserve the weight of small moments") is declared repeatedly but never tested by an on-page choice with visible cost. Her actions proceed without friction: she soaks the locket, writes in her ledger, and the covenant regenerates without obstacle or sacrifice. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("haunted euphoria," "bittersweet triumph") rather than embodied contradiction, and no micro-choice under pressure reveals her values. The grandmother's rescue exists only as backstory summary; Elara herself makes no decision that forecloses a path or demonstrates internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The orientation is functional—archivist, jetty, twilight, locket—but the central causal sequence breaks: Elara performs a ritual (steep locket, write story) and the covenant "takes hold" and "is saved" with no on-page resistance, cost, or change in options. The story declares that the jetty is "saved...from being forgotten" rather than demolition, collapsing the stated external stake (town council vote) into an off-page abstraction. No meaningful turn or tightening occurs; the ritual simply works, and the ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with felt cost, or conceptual repricing legible on the page. Under a causal lens the piece lacks because/therefore linkage; under an accumulative lens no density shift or pattern break reweights the stake with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The jetty setting is introduced early and described with sensory detail (jasmine, gravel, gulls, salt air, twilight flowers). However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics—she unpacks her tools and performs her ritual without interference. The locket functions as a small recurring object across beats (clutched, opened, steeped, glowing, carried away), giving the piece modest object-as-setting credit. The town council's demolition vote is mentioned but never pressures the on-page action, and the final image ("blooming jetty at twilight") reprises the opening without reweighting cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>A dominant stake is declared early (preserve the jetty's memories before demolition), but no on-page reversal, tightening, or cost emerges. The ritual proceeds without obstacle: Elara performs each step, the covenant regenerates, and she walks away satisfied. No choice narrows options, no price is paid, and coincidence does not complicate—magic simply works as intended. The piece signals escalation with phrases like "urgent" and "haunted euphoria" but never dramatizes pressure or a trade-off. Under any lens (causal, accumulative, situational), the lack of a meaningful turn or deepening caps the score well below high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme ("weight of small moments," covenant, memory preservation) is declared throughout rather than arising from concrete events. The locket and grandmother's rescue are recounted as backstory summary, not dramatized with choice or cost. The final paragraph provides overt thematic statements ("she had found her own," "testament to her motivation") that replace scene pressure. Prompt language ("proximate causes," "context changes," "regenerated covenant," "haunted euphoria") appears as unearned labels, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The ending does not offer a resonant, non-literal answer; it restates the premise without reweighting prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent lyric-archival register ("walnut-ink archivist," "gently thorough," "haunted euphoria"), but the prose relies on repeated abstract phrases and stock interiority ("she believed," "she knew," "she felt") rather than a distinct perceptual signature. Elara's way of noticing remains generic rather than character-specific. The piece uses purposeful diction for its fantasy-archival world, but lacks syntactic variety or embodied perception under pressure. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive text artifacts harm momentum: paraphrase loops ("The jetty was saved...from being forgotten" / "The story was saved"), template cadence ("She felt...She knew...She was"), synonym churn for the same concept across adjacent paragraphs ("covenant," "promise," "regenerated covenant"), and stock metaphors ("threads holding the covenant together," "beacon in the dark"). The final third repeats "haunted euphoria" three times and recycles "gently thorough," "proximate causes," and "weight of small moments" as scaffold. Register drift into prompt-label language ("proximate causes," "context changes") clashes with the narrative voice. Minimal information density: many sentences restate prior claims without advancing action or internal shift. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack for loops, template runs, and filter stacks touching multiple beats and the final paragraph: baseline −1.2 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise (magical archivist preserves memories via ritual ink) is recognizable from fantasy-craft templates. The walnut-ink mechanic and blooming jetty offer surface texture but the ritual proceeds without surprise, cost, or non-obvious turn. The grandmother's backstory rescue and the "covenant" frame read as stock emotional beats. Prompt elements ("proximate causes," "regenerated covenant," "haunted euphoria," "context changes") function as imposed labels rather than organic story discoveries. No twist, deepening, or perspective shift feels inevitable in hindsight; the ending delivers exactly what the opening promised with no fresh angle or risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, framing and executing the ritual, but her choices do not create key turns—she observes, unpacks, writes, and succeeds without obstacle. Observation dominates; no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The locket photo appears across multiple beats: clutched (opening), opened (paragraph 4), steeped (paragraph 13), glowing and clearing (paragraphs 25–26), carried away (closing). It returns with modest reweighted meaning (grandmother's smile "sharp and alive") and ties to the ritual's success. However, the locket does not constrain a choice under pressure; it is used as intended without friction. The piece meets the gate model (setup, development, payoff) and shows beat involvement, but the object's role is functional rather than indispensable—removing it would require reframing the ritual, yet the core arc (perform preservation → succeed) would survive with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "regenerated covenant" is introduced early (paragraph 11) as Elara's goal and recurs across the text ("original covenant," "renew the promise," "covenant was reborn," "regenerated covenant now lived"). It names the stakes but does not constrain on-page choices or alter tactics under pressure—Elara's ritual simply regenerates it as planned. The concept functions as a thematic claim rather than a dramatized force that changes options. Present functionally but replaceable with a near-synonym (e.g., "restored bond," "renewed vow") without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is labeled three times (paragraphs 9, 23, 39) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The trait describes Elara's manner without creating friction, tradeoff, or choice under pressure. Label-only use with no causal or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Steep" (paragraphs 13–15) is the ritual's key action: Elara steeps the locket in walnut ink, memories surface, and the covenant begins to regenerate. This moment anchors the middle beat and directly produces the climactic glow (paragraph 25). However, the action proceeds without obstacle or cost—steeping works as intended, and no choice or trade-off emerges. The act could be swapped for another ritual verb (infuse, bind, inscribe) with minimal structural change. Functional and causally present but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" appears in three paragraphs (10, 19, 47) as a method Elara uses to "trace how minor events shaped destinies" and "unlocked the power of a single act." The phrase labels her approach but its mechanics never matter on the page—Elara does not test, trace, or discover proximate links in scene. The method is told rather than dramatized, and the ritual's success does not depend on this specific causal lens. Ornamental use with no beat involvement or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "blooming jetty at twilight" is established in the opening and sustained throughout with sensory detail (jasmine, gravel, gulls, salt air, stars). It anchors the single location and returns in the final image ("blooming jetty at twilight would forever hold its weight," "eternal bloom"). The setting provides atmosphere and a container for the ritual but does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics—she works uninterrupted. The twilight-to-stars progression marks time but imposes no clock pressure. The lyric reprise reweights meaning modestly (jetty "guarded by its stories") without cost. Meets all three gates (setup, development, payoff) and contributes to the ending's charge, but the scene's stakes and choices would survive relocation to another memory-laden site with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"When context changes" is introduced in paragraph 6 ("the context had changed" due to the town council vote) and echoed in the closing paragraphs ("context changes," "the context had changed, but the covenant was reborn," "ready for the next context change"). The timeframe declares urgency ("mission urgent") but does not tighten on-page decisions or tactics—Elara performs her ritual at her own pace with no clock or deadline pressuring her moves. The council vote exists as backstory motivation rather than a live constraint. The element shapes framing but not execution; easily swappable with "before the jetty is lost" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of small moments" is stated explicitly in paragraph 5 and recurred across the text (paragraphs 10, 23, 28, 49). The motivation frames Elara's goal but is never dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs—she pursues preservation without obstacle or sacrifice. The desire is told rather than tested. The grandmother's rescue provides backstory support but Elara herself makes no on-page choice that reveals competing values or pays a price for her mission. Functional setup and thematic accent but not indispensable to the arc's structure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is labeled five times (paragraphs 16, 29, 39, 48, 49: "she felt a haunted euphoria," "that haunted euphoria again," "haunted euphoria a companion," "haunted euphoria lingered"). The tone is declared rather than evoked through image or modulated rhythm. The prose does not build contradictory emotional texture—sadness and joy are stated as labels, not embodied in perception or action. The tone remains static across beats without coherent escalation or a payoff that charges the final image. Present but ornamental, with no cost or closure participation.</comment>
