<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet remains abstract throughout—"aesthetically driven soul" and "agent of transformation" are labels without contradictory impulses acting in scene. Motivation is declared ("to stride through boundaries once thought sacred") but never tested by a competing want or cost that would reveal character under pressure. The "tremor of certainty" arriving as insight lacks embodied struggle; no micro-choice forces a visible trade-off. The final walk-away feels unearned because no path was foreclosed with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the poet approaches, speaks, crosses threshold, reaches pool, composes verse, and departs in a sequence that deepens atmosphere but lacks a because/therefore linkage or a meaningful tightening that narrows options. Closure unit is ambiguous—crossing the threshold, gazing into the pool, or the final departure could each serve, but none reweights prior material with visible cost; the ice thaws as symbol, not consequence of choice. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first few lines (waive penalty). The ending offers Conceptual Repricing (boundaries dissolve, beauty in change) but the cost remains abstract; I cannot point to an on-page sentence where a foreclosed path or price is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (deep blue glass, low resonant hum, liquid cobalt pool). The quartz constrains the poet's approach (he must place his hand to feel vibration, signaling a key), and the pool serves as the site for verse composition, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across moves. However, the setting does not alter tactics under pressure—the poet's path from entrance to heart to exit proceeds without environmental friction or resource constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—striding through forbidden boundaries—is signaled early but never faces on-page resistance or a trade-off. The poet approaches, speaks, crosses, composes, and departs without encountering a live obstacle, internal conflict, or cost that alters tactics. The "tremor of certainty" and subsequent question ("what other boundaries could fall") suggest deepening but do not narrow options or force a choice. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake; here the sequence feels like a procession rather than a tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in dissolution of limits, change over permanence—emerges clearly from the poet's journey and is reinforced by recurring images (boundaries blur, ice cracks, atrium walls waver). The final image (shadow blending with clouds, ice melting) offers a non-literal answer. However, the ending paragraph moralizes overtly: "He was free, and in his freedom, he found infinite beauty" states the thesis rather than letting the image carry it, triggering thematic echo penalty. The "lantern-moth hush" recurs but remains ornamental description rather than a motif that constrains choice or charges closure with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person maintains stable distance and a consistent lyric register throughout. Perceptual signature is present (cloud-shadow metaphor, aesthetic framing) but voice leans toward elevated diction without strong character-specific idiom. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned phrasing (e.g., "paraphrase" recurs as concept and action) teach a motif, though its payoff at closure is theme-stated rather than dramatized. Filter verbs ("He knew," "He understood," "He felt") stack in reflective beats but remain voice-consistent. The prose reads as singular perspective with controlled psychic distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "dissolving boundaries" / "boundaries dissolved" / "boundaries around him began to blur and fade" / "dissolving another layer of separation" across multiple paragraphs restate the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear: "He placed… He began… He stepped… He was… He continued… He walked… He reached… He composed…" in sequential paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("tremor of certainty," "lantern-moth hush") recur without fresh inflection. Register is elevated and consistent but line-level density is low—many sentences perform one job where two would fit. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: baseline −0.8 for loops and template stems; total deduction pushes score into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—poet dissolving forbidden boundaries through reinterpretation of old texts—follows a familiar "breaking constraints" template without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived-detail transformation. The quartz colonnade's hum as "key" and liquid cobalt pool as reflection site are vivid particulars, but the emotional arc (seclusion → crossing threshold → composing new verse → walking free) proceeds without risk or surprise. The "cloud-shadow poet" label and "aesthetically driven" trait remain ornamental. Transformation test: swapping names and setting (e.g., exiled scholar crossing forbidden library) would leave the structure and arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Cloud-shadow poet is named early (setup gate met) and present throughout. His choices—approaching the colonnade, placing hand on pillar, speaking paraphrases, crossing threshold, composing verse—drive the sequence (development and payoff gates met). However, these are declarative acts without visible cost or competing pressures; he observes and decides in succession with no friction. The choices do not narrow options or alter tactics. Functional but replaceable; the role could be filled by "exiled scholar" or "boundary-keeper" with minor edits. Gates met (all three) but causal pressure and cost connection are absent: +0.3 setup, +0.4 one beat, +0.0 causal pressure (no narrowing), +0.3 closure linkage (he departs), −0.6 swappability, −0.4 label-only trait. Lands ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Humming quartz colonnade appears early (setup gate met), is handled in two beats (poet places hand to feel vibration; colonnade hums as he crosses), and is mentioned again at closure ("stood silent, its purpose fulfilled"). Development and payoff gates met. The hum serves as "key" to dissolving boundaries, but mechanics are vague—vibration is felt, not used to solve a problem. The object does not constrain a choice or impose cost; its presence is atmospheric. +0.6 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.5 causal pressure (weak; enables crossing without friction), +0.5 closure linkage (mentioned but not active), +0.3 specificity (quartz hum is concrete), −0.5 ornamental in final mention. Lands ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>A tremor of certainty appears mid-story ("Through dissolving boundaries, he felt a tremor of certainty—a doubt that solidified into truth") and recurs late ("The tremor of certainty became a steady pulse"). Setup gate missed (not present in first third). It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the poet already knows the ban was fear-based. The concept is theme-claimed rather than dramatized with cost. Development gate missed (no middle choice tied to it), payoff gate weak (mentioned as internal guide but not active in closure image). +0.0 setup (late), +0.4 one beat (mid-story realization), +0.0 causal pressure, +0.2 closure linkage (mentioned but not shaping), −0.6 late appearance, −0.5 ornamental. Lands ~2.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Aesthetically driven is label-only: "As an aesthetically driven soul, he found beauty in the dissolution of limits." The trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. Setup gate met (first third), development and payoff gates missed (no choice tied to aesthetic priorities vs. another value). The poet's actions (crossing, composing) are not shown to require aesthetic judgment or trade-off. +0.4 setup, +0.0 beats (label-only), +0.0 causal pressure, +0.0 closure linkage, −0.7 label-only, −0.5 swappability. Lands ~2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase is named early and recurs: poet paraphrases old texts to reinterpret laws, speaks soft words, continues to paraphrase dissolving layers, reaches heart and composes "paraphrasing the old into something vibrant." Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The action drives the sequence but mechanics are vague—what exactly is paraphrased, and how does it dissolve boundaries? The action could be swapped for "reinterpret," "rewrite," or "speak new verses" with minor edits. +0.6 setup, +1.4 three beats, +0.5 causal pressure (weak; enables crossing without friction), +0.7 closure linkage (composes new verse), −0.7 swappability, −0.3 summary-only (the paraphrasing is told, not shown). Lands ~4.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Through dissolving boundaries is method-named repeatedly ("Through dissolving boundaries, he felt…"; "boundaries dissolved"; "dissolving another layer of separation"). Setup gate met. The method shapes the sequence (poet's paraphrases cause boundaries to blur and fade), meeting development and payoff gates. However, mechanics are abstract—boundaries dissolve as consequence, not through a dramatized mechanism with cost. The method is swappable with "breaking," "crossing," or "unmaking" without structural change. +0.5 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.5 causal pressure (weak), +0.5 closure linkage (ice melts as symbol), −0.6 swappability, −0.5 ornamental (boundaries dissolve as theme, not tactic). Lands ~3.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium by frozen lake is named early and anchors all action. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The atrium's walls waver as boundaries dissolve; the poet crosses threshold, reaches the heart where liquid cobalt pool lies, composes verse there, and departs as ice thaws. The setting provides the spatial frame for every beat and the pool charges the final composition. However, the setting does not constrain tactics or supply resources that alter outcome—the poet moves freely without environmental friction. +0.7 setup, +1.4 three beats, +0.5 causal pressure (weak; setting enables but does not resist), +1.0 closure linkage (pool and thawing ice active in ending), +0.5 specificity (cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade concrete), −0.4 no constraint. Lands ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>After the ban lifts is timeframe stated in the opening line. Setup gate met. The lifted ban enables the poet's entry and frames the journey, but time does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Development and payoff gates weak—the poet proceeds at his own pace with no clock pressure. The timeframe could be swapped for "after the exile ended" or "when the gates opened" without affecting structure. +0.5 setup, +0.4 one beat (enables entry), +0.0 causal pressure (no urgency), +0.2 closure linkage (thawing ice symbolizes "end of era" but timeframe itself is not active), −0.5 swappability, −0.3 ornamental. Lands ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>To stride through boundaries once thought sacred is motivation declared early: "His motivation was pure: to stride through boundaries once thought sacred." Setup gate met. The poet's crossing, composing, and departure all enact this desire, meeting development and payoff gates. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through friction between wants and costs—no competing value tests commitment. The poet achieves his goal without sacrifice or trade-off. +0.6 setup, +1.4 three beats, +0.5 causal pressure (weak; drives sequence but no friction), +0.7 closure linkage (departure enacts freedom), +0.4 specificity ("stride through boundaries" concrete), −0.7 told-only, −0.4 no friction. Lands ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lantern-moth hush is tone phrase introduced early: "The air was filled with a lantern-moth hush, a silence so delicate it seemed to breathe." Setup gate met. It recurs twice ("The lantern-moth hush deepened, as if the universe itself was listening"; poet carries it within him at departure), meeting development and payoff gates. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (hush deepens, then internalized). However, it remains atmospheric rather than charging the final image with pressure—removing it would not alter the closure effect. +0.6 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.3 causal pressure (sets mood but does not constrain), +0.5 closure linkage (carried within at end), +0.4 specificity (lantern-moth evocative), −0.5 ornamental at closure. Lands ~4.8.</comment>
