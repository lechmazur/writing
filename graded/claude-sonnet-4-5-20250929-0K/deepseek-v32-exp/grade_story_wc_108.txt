<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Leo's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The phobias are told ("of heights, of enclosed spaces, of falling") but never tested on the page—no embodied terror shapes a choice. Internal conflict is summarized ("he remained firmly adaptive, using each panicked breath") instead of shown as simultaneous warring impulses. The final confrontation declares transformation ("his vulnerability became his power") without earning it through prior scene work where fear constrained a micro-choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late: "Leo, a stunt double" and "rusted library under stars" establish who/where by the opening, but the timeline ("Only days ago") and the Silas-hunt stakes remain abstract until the child appears mid-story. The closure—Leo "outwits" Silas by declaring his fears are strength—is asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page reversal forces a trade-off. The dominant lens (causal) breaks when Leo's "plan" and the tower confrontation occur off-page, then are summarized. Apply Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and closure validity failure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The rusted library is vividly sketched ("skeletal structure," "oxidized metal mixed with dry perfume"), but it does not constrain Leo's choices—he kneels, deciphers, leaves, with no spatial friction. The seashell and notes are handled, meeting micro-setting criteria, but the environment itself remains postcard. No gate penalty, but the setting does not charge the final image or alter tactics, capping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (outwit Silas) is signaled early but never tightens on the page. Deciphering the notes is told in summary ("He began to decipher...found patterns in the chaos") with no failed attempt or visible cost. The tower confrontation occurs off-stage; Leo "called out" and "declared," but no reversal or trade-off is dramatized. Coincidence does not resolve, but agency is also absent—Leo's final stance is asserted, not earned through a pressure-tested choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme ("vulnerability is power") is declared repeatedly ("his very fears could be his strength," "his vulnerability became his power") rather than emerging from Leo's choices. The seashell "whispers" and the smudged notes echo the concept, but the final image—Leo walking away with "unshakable" certainty—states the moral instead of offering a non-literal answer. The stars as witnesses is a gesture toward resonance but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person close POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature ("trembling certainty") is purposeful. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("sibilant urgings coil in his mind," "ethereal voice merging with his thoughts") that clashes with a stunt double's likely lexicon under crisis. Eli's brief dialogue is naturalistic, but Leo's internal voice at peak beats ("in his cruel genius") reads as narrator assistance rather than character thought. No head-hopping, but psychic distance wavers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "his motivation was clear" → "he must prove"; "his phobias...screamed" → "each panicked breath to sharpen his focus." Template cadence runs in the final third ("He did not conquer his fears; he invited them along"). Stock metaphors ("tomb of knowledge," "anchored himself in the storm") dull specificity. The closure beat is touched by scaffold ("forever changed, his certainty no longer trembling but unshakable"), triggering the artifact escalation (−1.7 baseline, disallow 9+ globally). Rhythm is sluggish; information density is low.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise (phobia-ridden hero proves vulnerability is strength) follows a familiar self-help template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "whispering seashell half" and "smudged notes on a cast" are specific, but the emotional arc—fear as weakness → fear as power—resolves predictably. The tower confrontation, delivered as summary, offers no synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Apply derivative premise adjustment (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Leo is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics. His phobias are mentioned (setup gate met) but never tested in the middle; the final confrontation is summarized rather than dramatized (payoff gate missed). Swappable with "anxious detective" or "traumatized soldier." Late-closure summary (−0.8), ornamental use (−0.7), swappability (−0.6). Cap 2.8 (missing payoff).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The seashell appears in two beats: Leo clutches it at the start, and it "seemed to pulse" during decryption. However, its "whispering" and "ethereal voice" are decorative—no choice hinges on its guidance. Setup and middle gates met (eligible ~6.0), but payoff is absent (cap 2.8). Ornamental use (−0.6), summary-only guidance (−0.5). Round down to 3.2 under dominant limiter (missing payoff).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The betrayal is setup (Silas hid Leo's lineage) and shapes Leo's goal (prove himself), meeting setup and development gates. It returns at closure when Leo "declared...understood the betrayal," but this is told rather than dramatized (payoff weak). Causal pressure is present but mediated through summary. Swappability moderate (−0.4). Eligible ~6.0 (two gates), but summary-only closure and weak cost lower to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" is mentioned twice ("remained firmly adaptive," "firm adaptability to cryptanalysis") but never constrains a choice—Leo adapts off-page. Setup gate met, middle and payoff absent (cap 2.8). Label-only (−0.3), no visible tradeoff (−0.5). Round to 2.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Outwit" is the stated goal and the final summary ("he outwitted the man"), but the mechanics occur off-page—Leo deciphers and confronts in summary. Setup and payoff gates met (eligible ~6.0), but the action itself is swappable with "outsmart," "outmaneuver," etc. (−0.6). Summary-only execution (−0.7). Cap 4.6 (late payoff partial), lower to 3.6 under frictions.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (Eli's cast with "smudged notes...scribbled in charcoal"), used in the middle beat (Leo deciphers), and pays off (he learns the tower coordinates). All three gates met (eligible ≥6.1). However, the decryption itself is summary ("began to decipher...found patterns") with no failed attempt or visible cost (−0.8). Swappability moderate (−0.4). Land at 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The library is vividly described and present in setup and middle (Leo kneels among the shelves). It does not pressure his choices—no spatial constraint alters tactics—but it returns as "witness to his rebirth" at closure (weak payoff). All three gates met (eligible ≥6.1), but postcard use (−0.9) and no causal pressure (−0.6) lower to 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after discovering you're not who you thought") is setup via "Only days ago" and shapes Leo's motivation. However, time does not tighten tactics on the page—no clock pressure during decryption or travel. Payoff gate missed (cap 2.8). Vague tracking (−0.4). Round to 3.1 under cap.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("prove that vulnerability is power") is declared at the start and repeated at closure ("his vulnerability became his power"). Setup and payoff gates met (eligible ~6.0), but the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No on-page friction between want and cost (−0.9). Summary-only (−0.6). Land at 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Trembling certainty" is introduced early ("trembling certainty" appears twice) and modulates slightly ("no longer trembling but unshakable" at the end). Setup, middle echo, and payoff present (all gates met, eligible ≥6.1). However, the tone is static through most beats—Leo remains resolute without on-page wavering—and the final shift is asserted rather than earned (−0.9). Single static mood (−0.5). Land at 4.7.</comment>
