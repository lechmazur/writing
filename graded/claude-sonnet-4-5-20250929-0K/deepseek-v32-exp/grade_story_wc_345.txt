<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to follow the ghost's guidance is largely told rather than shown through conflicted micro-choices. The group dynamic reads generic ("ragged group of strangers who had become family") without individual tensions or status shifts visible in action. Jax's doubt ("We're following a ghost based on sidewalk scribbles") arrives late as a lone beat of internal conflict, then dissolves without cost. The ghost's altruism is asserted through summary ("Its altruism had never wavered") rather than dramatized through choices that reveal contradictory impulses or limits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (ghost, orchard planet, survivors) arrive early. The lens reads Causal initially but shifts to Accumulative/Textural at closure when the nebula unveils and "the garden grows" becomes the resonant image. The transition is taught, but the closure unit—environmental restoration triggered by collective effort—lacks on-page felt cost; the brambled hope simply blooms without a visible price paid by any character. The pieces connect (bell → arches → nebula) but the final image asserts transformation rather than showing what was foreclosed or sacrificed to achieve it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating arches, orchard, and bell are vivid and recur across beats. The bell's placement "at the highest point of the largest floating arch" constrains the climactic choice and its resonance charges the ending. Spatial choreography (eastern ridge, butterfly garden center, sleeping domes) remains clear. However, the orchard planet's sensory texture relies on visual cues (luminous fruit, glowing veins) without other senses sharpening urgency, and the "deserted sidewalks" function as message boards without further environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—awakening the nebula for survival—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when doubt creeps in and Jax voices the need to "reexamine," forcing Elara's renewed determination. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or cost: the group simply "focused their efforts" and the nebula appears. Coincidence (the bell's warmth, the arches' glow) resolves the problem without protagonist sacrifice or a path foreclosed, undermining agency at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of trust and collective effort emerges through the ghost's consistent guidance and the group's coordinated action. The final message "The garden grows" resonates as an earned image tied to prior struggle. However, the theme is occasionally stated directly ("Its altruism had never wavered," "their hope was no longer a bramble") rather than fully embodied in specific action. The brambled-hope motif bookends effectively but the resolution ("vine reaching for the sun") veers toward sentimental abstraction without a non-literal complication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Elara with brief multi-character glimpses. The prose carries a consistent lyric register ("essence whispering," "brambled thing") that modulates appropriately under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("What are we supposed to do with this?"). However, perceptual signature is generic—Elara's way of noticing does not differ in texture or idiom from the narrator's elevated diction, and the ghost's communication method (chalked messages, feelings more than words) is asserted without showing the interpretive friction or uncertainty that would sharpen her focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and vivid images ("floating rock arches," "tarnished brass watering bell"). Rhythm modulates from lyric description to tighter action ("she gathered the others"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Their hope was a brambled thing, tangled in the memory" and "their hope was no longer a bramble, but a vine" restate the same motif without adding pressure. Template cadence runs in the final paragraph ("The ghost watched... the ghost was gone... The bell chimed on") with identical subject-verb stems. Stock metaphors ("vine reaching for the sun") and a light filter-verb stack ("seemed to cleanse," "began to bud") dull immediacy in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ghost-as-guide and collective-effort premise are familiar; the transformation is incremental rather than transformative. The floating arches and chalked sidewalk messages add texture, but the nebula's unveiling follows a predictable arc (doubt → renewed faith → environmental reward). The bell as resonance key offers a fresh inflection, yet the resolution echoes template "community overcomes adversity through trust" beats without a bold structural or thematic risk. The ending's healing radiance and single butterfly read as genre-fulfilling rather than defamiliarized.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The altruistic ghost is present throughout (setup, middle guidance, closure observation) and drives the plot by providing instructions. However, its "choices" are largely off-page—messages appear pre-written each dawn without on-page decision moments where the ghost weighs options or pays a visible cost. The ghost's fading at closure is mentioned but not causally tied to a sacrifice or transformation earned by prior action. It remains more a plot device than a character whose decisions create key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The butterfly garden watering bell is discovered mid-story, handled in multiple beats (finding, warmth pulse, placement on arch, sustained chime), and its resonance directly enables the climax. Its use evolves from mystery object to active key, and the bell "chimed on" in the final paragraph reprises with reweighted meaning. However, it does not constrain earlier choices—it simply works once found—and no cost is tied to wielding it, which limits irreplaceability and closure linkage to functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The nebula of respite frames the goal early ("awaken the nebula") and its unveiling is the climax. However, it remains largely abstract—described as "celestial phenomenon of profound peace" without mechanics that shape tactics or constrain choices. The group's method (bell resonance) is Kael's realization, not a discovery forced by the nebula's properties. The nebula appears passively at closure as environmental reward rather than an active force the characters must negotiate, making it thematically present but operationally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is asserted as a quality of the ghost's script multiple times ("a quality that clung to the ethereal script," "Its altruism had never wavered") but never constrains an on-page action with visible cost. Elara's decision to rally the group after doubt is informed by this trust, yet the trust itself is narrated rather than tested through a beat where trustworthiness creates friction or forces a trade-off. The attribute functions as thematic color rather than a trait that enables or limits choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reexamine" is spoken by Jax mid-story and triggers Elara's reflective beat ("She thought of all they had endured") that leads to renewed determination and the final push. This reexamination is a pivot that alters tactics from doubt to collective focus, creating a meaningful turn. However, the word itself is generic—any call to reassess would serve—and the turn occurs in narrated summary rather than a dramatized scene where reexamination yields a specific new insight or cost. The action is functional and causal but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Chalked messages on deserted sidewalks are signaled early, appear in at least three beats (opening, "Find the bell," "Trust the resonance," final "The garden grows"), and their dawn timing creates a ritual that shapes the group's daily rhythm. The method is specific and recurring, and the final message charges closure. However, the mechanics—how the ghost writes, why sidewalks, whether the medium constrains what can be said—are not explored, and no choice hinges on the limitations or affordances of chalk. The method is vivid but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is established early, provides the setting for all action, and the arches are integral to the climax (bell placement, glowing mineral veins). The orchard supplies sustenance and the arches function as the resonance conduit, directly affecting the outcome. However, the setting does not pressure earlier choices—characters move freely without environmental constraint—and the arches' properties (why they resonate, how they connect to the nebula) are discovered conveniently rather than forcing tactical adjustments. The setting is essential to the climax but does not shape the path to it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After strangers become family" frames the backstory but does not function as an on-page timeframe that tightens decisions. The narrative spans weeks ("For weeks, they worked") in summary, and no countdown or temporal pressure forces choices. The fact that they are already family reduces rather than creates friction—there is no dramatized transition or cost to bonding. The timeframe is a static premise rather than a dynamic constraint that alters tactics or charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation to orchestrate collective effort is stated explicitly ("to orchestrate a collective effort that would awaken the nebula") and drives the plot structure. However, the motivation is conveyed "through a feeling more than words" without dramatized friction—no moment where the ghost's desire conflicts with the group's autonomy or where orchestration imposes a cost. The group follows instructions without resistance until Jax's brief doubt, which resolves in summary. The motivation is functional and thematic but not tested through conflicted choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" is named early ("Their hope was a brambled thing, tangled in the memory") and returns at closure ("their hope was no longer a bramble, but a vine... still scarred but growing strong"), creating a purposeful reprise that reweights the stake. The tone modulates from despair to earned optimism in step with pressure. However, the bramble metaphor is somewhat stock, and the final image ("vine reaching for the sun") softens into sentimental uplift without retaining the sharp cost the bramble implied. The tone is coherent and charges the ending but does not fully sustain its thorny complexity.</comment>
