<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Father Elian's motivation—to illuminate hidden assumptions—remains abstract and is never embodied through contradictory impulses or internal friction. His method unfolds without visible struggle or cost to his own certainty; he executes a plan rather than wrestling with doubt. The possession entity is told rather than dramatized, reducing the antagonistic pressure to conceptual narration. Interiority relies on stock metaphysical phrasing ("muffled clarity," "unraveled stillness") rather than character-particular perception under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation arrives late—who, where, and when coalesce only after multiple paragraphs of abstract description, triggering a −0.4 deduction and capping Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit (possession fragments under exposed assumption) reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains assertion rather than on-page consequence: no trade-off, forfeiture, or visible alteration in Elian's state. The lens is Accumulative/Textural (layered sound, color, silence build toward a conceptual collapse), but the final image ("simple, unadorned reality, secured") deflates rather than reweights prior pressure, and the cost is summary ("its form dissolving") rather than felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor is named but not grounded spatially—no walls, light sources, distances, or access points constrain movement. The loop pedal and ultramarine mark are handled on the page and constrain Elian's ritual choices, lifting the score above generic placeholder. Sensory selection remains narrow (sound, light, silence abstracted) without temperature, air quality, or tactile grounding that would charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (stop possession before completion) is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or live dilemma. Elian's method succeeds linearly: loop question, mark floor, pose paradox, entity recoils—no reversal, adaptation, or visible price paid for the victory. The timeframe ("before the possession completes") generates urgency in concept but not in dramatized pressure; no ticking manifestation forces a rushed or costly choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme (language and silence as disarming tools, hidden assumptions as vulnerability) is stated rather than emerged from embodied struggle. The final question "If silence is your decoration, what is your substance?" lands as a rhetorical flourish rather than a resonant repricing of prior material. The blue mark and loop pedal function as symbolic tokens without charging the ending with non-literal meaning; the closing line "plumbed the depths and found the answer in the questions themselves" is explicit moralizing that replaces scene pressure, triggering a −0.6 penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent but generic-literary, with repeated phrases like "unraveled stillness," "muffled clarity," and "decorated with silence" creating a template cadence. Psychic distance remains stable (close third), and focalization is controlled. Dialogue is minimal and serves function ("What do you seek?" as ritual device), but the live-voice questions to the entity feel staged rather than goal-driven under stress. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "decorated with silence" appears three times, "unraveled stillness" four times, "muffled clarity" twice, often restating the same atmospheric effect without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs in the ritual sequence ("He decorated… He must plumb… He dipped… He needed…") flatten rhythm. Mixed metaphor: stillness "unraveled" and later "rewoven" clashes with "threads of calm pulling apart"—织 logic breaks. Stock metaphor "a stain of pure concept" abstracts rather than grounds. Apply −1.2 in Q7 for loops and cadence debt; the final paragraph's clarity is intact, so avoid escalation beyond that range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise (priest uses rhetorical devices and single-color ritual to combat possession) reads as template mysticism without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The chiasmus ("What is taken is never truly held") and paradox structure are told rather than integrated into embodied choice or world logic. The ultramarine and loop pedal feel ornamental rather than causally necessary—swappable for any ritual objects with minor edits. No fresh inflection emerges; the resolution (entity dissolves when assumption is exposed) follows expected exorcism beats without surprise or risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Father Elian is present in all beats and his choices (loop voice, mark floor, pose questions) drive the ritual sequence. However, his decisions unfold without adaptation or friction—no mid-course correction when a tactic fails—so agency reads as execution rather than struggle. Introduced immediately (setup gate met), active in middle ritual beats (development gate met), and present at closure when possession fragments (payoff gate met). Causal pressure is moderate: his method succeeds linearly without visible cost to him. Score: three gates + moderate beat involvement + closure presence, but low irreplaceability (another exorcist method would function similarly) and no felt cost tied to his character state. 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The palette with one ultramarine appears in beat 1 (introduced early, +0.5), is used in beat 2 (Elian dips thumb, marks floor, +0.4), reappears in beat 4 (draws a line, +0.4), and is noted at closure ("the one color now dim, its purpose fulfilled," +0.3). Three gates met. However, the color itself is swappable—any ritual substance would function—and the "dimming" is told rather than shown to alter later tactics. No specific cost tied to the palette's depletion beyond summary. Score: early signal + multi-beat use + closure mention, minus swappability and summary-only payoff. 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unraveled stillness" recurs as atmosphere label but does not constrain tactics or alter options on the page. Mentioned in beats 1, 3, 4, and closure ("rewoven into a deeper, more resilient peace"), but each mention restates mood rather than imposing cost or enabling a new move. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak (no middle choice hinges on it). Swappable with "fraying calm" or similar metaphor. Score: multi-beat presence + closure reprise, minus ornamental use and no causal pressure. 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Decorates with silence" appears three times: beat 1 (chamber decoration), beat 3 ("decorated further"), and beat 6 ("The dimensional anchor groaned, a sound that was quickly absorbed by the decorated silence"). The trait enables Elian's method (suppressing dimensional hum to focus) but is never tested or traded off—no moment where maintaining silence costs him information or speed. Setup and development gates met; closure gate weak (silence is "released" at the end but without reweighting prior material). Score: multi-beat use + method enablement, minus no visible tradeoff and label-only mentions. 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Plumb" (or "plumbed") appears in beats 2, 4, 5, and the closing line ("plumbed the depths and found the answer"). It names Elian's investigative method and is tied to his rhetorical questioning, but the mechanics remain abstract—no on-page demonstration of what "plumbing" reveals that a simpler inquiry would not. Three gates met (setup, development, closure). Causal role moderate: the term frames his approach, but swapping "probe" or "interrogate" would not alter story logic. Score: multi-beat presence + closure linkage, minus abstraction and swappability. 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through rhetorical devices" is named in beat 2 and demonstrated via paradox ("conqueror or refugee") and chiasmus ("What is taken is never truly held") in beats 3–4; the final devastating question ("If silence is your decoration, what is your substance?") in beat 6 triggers the entity's recoil. Three gates met. The method shapes multiple attempts and the entity's collapse hinges on it, but the rhetorical forms themselves are told rather than shown to impose cost on Elian (e.g., no mental strain or risk of self-deception). Score: early signal + multi-beat shaping + closure participation, minus abstract execution and no cost to protagonist. 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "dimensional anchor" is named in beats 1, 6 (it groans), and closure (it "settled"). It provides atmospheric frame and a final stability image, but no spatial constraint or resource affects Elian's choices—no locked doors, failing geometry, or access trade-off. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate missing (no middle choice hinges on anchor properties). Swappable with "ritual chamber" or "threshold" without structural loss. Score: presence at beginning and end + mild closure charge, minus no causal pressure and ornamental use. 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Before the possession completes" is stated in beats 1, 3, and 7, framing urgency, but no on-page clock tightens—no accelerating symptom or narrowing window forces a rushed or costly choice. The timeframe remains assertion rather than dramatized pressure. Setup gate met (named early); development and closure gates weak (the phrase recurs but does not alter tactics or charge the final image). Score: multi-mention + thematic frame, minus no live escalation and swappable with "during the incursion." 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden assumptions" is named in beat 1 and restated in beat 7 ("to illuminate was to disarm") and the closing line. The motivation drives Elian's method (questioning the entity's assumptions) and frames the victory, but it is never conflicted or tested—no moment where illuminating one assumption obscures another or costs him certainty. Three gates met (setup, development, closure). Causal role moderate: the desire structures his approach, but friction between want and cost is absent. Score: multi-beat presence + closure linkage, minus no dramatized conflict or visible price. 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Muffled clarity" appears in beats 2, 5, and closure ("The muffled clarity lifted"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (intensifies mid-ritual, resolves at end), charging the final image of "simple, unadorned reality, secured." Setup and payoff gates met; development gate moderate (tone is noted but does not shift tactics). However, the phrase is abstract and swappable with "veiled focus" or similar. Score: multi-beat presence + closure participation + coherent modulation, minus abstraction and ornamental phrasing. 4.9.</comment>
