<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian has minimal internal contradiction or on-page struggle—his emotions are labeled ("mournful elation") rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ghost bride's motivation spans lifetimes but her present agency is thin; she appears, offers the bead, and vanishes without a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("his heart heavy," "wave of...grief and joy merging") instead of character-particular perception. The resonant awakening floods Elian with memories, but this is a convenience unlock rather than a decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (the bead's repeated presence and memory-charging function accumulates toward the final dissolution). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost bride's debt is settled, she dissolves into light, and Elian gains peace), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatically legible—her freedom is told, not shown through a forfeited option or visible price on the page. The bead warms and "its task complete" reads as exposition wrapping up stakes rather than an image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vivid (luminescent fruits, glass panes, twisting branches) and the endless night frames tone, but setting does not constrain a tactical choice or charge the final image—Elian could complete this arc in any isolated space. Spatial choreography is clean (rows, shelf, fields beyond). The carved stone bead (a micro-object) reappears and is placed on a shelf, but this is ceremonial rather than a move that alters options. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful without becoming a checklist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: repay the debt across lifetimes (ghost bride) and understand their shared past (Elian). One tightening occurs when the bead triggers memory and the ghost bride begins to fade, but this reversal is triggered by a convenience artifact (the bead's alchemical charge) rather than protagonist agency. The ghost bride's visits grow more frequent ("as if time was running out"), suggesting escalation, but no on-page choice narrows options—she offers the bead, he accepts, memories arrive, she vanishes. The cost (her dissolution) is declared rather than felt through a trade-off or forfeited path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of redemption and love beyond death emerges from the debt-repayment frame and the bead as a wedding token. The final image (bead on shelf, endless night now peaceful) offers a quiet answer without a stated moral, but the thematic resolution is tidy—debt paid, ghost freed, orchard thrives—without ambiguity or cost that lingers. "Lovingly venomous" is asserted as a duality but not explored in contradictory action. Subtext operates in the ghost bride's smile and touch, but key beats (memory flood, debt settlement) are narrated rather than implied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV (Elian) with stable distance and perceptual signature (he notices chill, memories, fruits). Diction is elevated and poetic, fitting the alchemical-gothic frame, but some phrasing is generic ("his heart heavy," "wave of mournful elation"). The ghost bride's dialogue ("Take it," "Now you understand," "Thank you") is functional but lacks subtext or character-specific idiom. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled. Purposeful compression in the memory-flood beat supports pace without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports pacing. Information density is adequate but some lines loop: "mournful elation" appears twice, "resonant awakenings" three times as a label without varied embodiment, and "lovingly venomous" is repeated identically. Template cadence appears in mid-story beats: "She would glide...," "He felt...," "Elian clutched...," "The ghost bride smiled..." (subject–verb opener runs). Clarity is high and no causality breaks occur. The final image ("endless night...peaceful, not oppressive") tells rather than shows the tonal shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ghost-bride-repaying-debt premise is a familiar romantic-gothic template, and the execution does not transform it through non-obvious synthesis or fresh moral calculus. The bead as a wedding token infused with alchemical energy is logically consistent but predictable. Emotional truth is present (grief and joy coexist) but rendered through stock phrases rather than specific lived detail. The alchemical orchard is a vivid setting, yet the story could function unchanged in any isolated supernatural space. No bold structural or perspectival risks; the arc proceeds along expected contours.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ashen-veil ghost bride appears throughout and her offering of the bead is the inciting beat, but her choices are minimal—she visits, offers, smiles, fades. Her dissolution is a consequence of Elian's acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Setup early; middle beats involve observation; closure participation is passive (she vanishes when the debt is settled). Functional but swappable with another ghostly debt-bearer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The carved stone bead is handled in multiple beats: clutched by the ghost bride, offered to Elian, touched (triggering memory), clutched again, warmed, and placed on a shelf. It carries reweighted meaning (wedding token → alchemical catalyst → reminder of redemption). Early signal, causal pressure (unlocks memories), and closure linkage (placed on shelf as symbol). Irreplaceability moderate—another token could serve, but the bead's wedding-day origin ties it to the debt premise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Resonant awakenings" is named repeatedly and the memory flood is a key beat, but the concept functions as a label for what happens rather than a constraint that shapes tactics. The orchard responds (fruits glow, trees sway), but this is atmospheric consequence, not a choice-altering mechanic. Setup via title-level phrasing; middle beat (memory surge); closure mentions the awakenings as complete. Swappable with "mystical revelation" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Lovingly venomous" is described twice (her actions, her expression) but never dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The ghost bride brings "moments of joy intertwined with sharp sorrow," but this is summary. Her touch is "ice and fire," a metaphor without tactical consequence. Label-only use; no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The ghost action (haunting, appearing, offering the bead, dissolving) drives the premise and the ending beat. Her dissolution is the closure image, but it is caused by the bead's mechanics rather than a choice she makes. She appears "directly before him" to hand over the bead—a key turn—but the act is ritualistic rather than a decision under pressure. Functional and present across beats, yet easily swappable with another spectral mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Ephemeral cameo appearances" is signaled early ("barely substantial," "fleeting moments," "brief disturbance") and her visits grow more frequent, creating a pattern. The method matters insofar as she cannot interact fully until the bead is offered, but the mechanics do not constrain her tactics—she glides, appears, extends her hand. Setup, middle pattern, closure participation (she dissolves as a final cameo). Functional but could be replaced with "intermittent visitations" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is anchored early and provides vivid sensory detail (luminescent fruits, glass panes, endless night). It shapes tone and supplies the alchemical energy that charges the bead, but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elian's arc could occur in any isolated magical space. The orchard responds at closure (fruits glow, trees sway), a purposeful reprise that reweights the space from isolated to thriving. Early signal, middle presence, closure linkage. Essential to tone, less so to plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Hush of winter-cracked fields" frames the setting and "this winter, her visits grew more frequent, as if time was running out" introduces temporal pressure. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no live clock or deadline alters tactics on the page. Winter persists throughout and afterward ("over the days that followed"), but duration is vague. Setup and thematic presence; no middle or closure pressure. Swappable with any season.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To repay a debt across lifetimes" is the ghost bride's stated motivation, signaled early and repeated. The debt is dramatized when she offers the bead and dissolves after Elian accepts, but the friction between want and cost is thin—she has no competing desire or obstacle beyond time running out (asserted, not shown). Elian's parallel desire (understand their past) is passive receipt of memory. Early signal, middle presence (visits increase), closure participation (debt settled). Causal role in the ending, but the cost is told rather than felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Mournful elation" is named twice and the tone is coherent (grief and joy coexist in Elian's reaction, the ghost bride's smile, the peaceful yet endless night). Tone modulates slightly (chill → memory surge → dissolution → contentment), but the final image is static mood ("strange contentment") rather than a charged tonal shift. Setup via the oxymoron, middle presence in descriptions, closure participation as declared emotion. Functional but not indispensable—similar duality (bittersweet, wistful triumph) would serve.</comment>
