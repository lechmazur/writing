<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("discover the color of sound") is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. His internal experience remains abstract; we never witness him struggling with competing desires or making a meaningful renunciation. The final "vow" and transformation feel unearned—no on-page cost forecloses a prior path. The characterization relies on summary exposition ("haunted by," "believed") without embodied micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored (lamplighter, pier, festival night) but the causal chain weakens after the key discovery: Elias inserts the key, finds the orb, witnesses color-sound synesthesia, then rows back with no complication or choice. The closure reads as Decisive Change (he perceives differently), yet the cost is invisible—no trade-off, no path foreclosed on the page. The "luminous vows" brighten in acknowledgment but do not constrain or reweight his options. Drive lens appears Causal but ellipsis replaces motivated linkage at the peak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sunken library and glowing tome are vivid, and the pier's gas lamps anchor the opening. However, spatial choreography inside the wreck is vague (how does he surface in an air chamber? where is the pedestal relative to the fissure?), and the environment does not constrain his choices—he encounters no obstacle, only discovery. The library charges the final image but does not shape tactics. Within the 9+ gate test, the setting fails to constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discover color of sound) is signaled early but never tested. Elias dives, finds the library, unlocks the orb, and succeeds without reversal, complication, or visible price. No tightening narrows options; the melody manifests and he rows back unchanged except for perception. Coincidence (the key matches the lock) resolves rather than complicates. Agency is minimal—observation, not decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of sensory fusion and "luminous vows" emerges through image and action, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraphs, where "keeper of sensory truths" and "purpose had expanded" edge toward summary. The color-sound synesthesia offers a fresh angle, but the ending moralizes gently ("honor it until the end of his days") rather than leaving resonance implicit. The vows themselves remain abstract—what truth do they hide behind?—and the final question is told, not felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains third-limited POV with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter (lamplighter's practiced hand, "meteor hush") is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("repository of knowledge," "aura of preservation") that feels more authorial than character-bound. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains stable, though some filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "understood") dilute immediacy in peak beats without voice justification.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice, but paraphrase loops appear: "The hum swelled…colors blossomed" / "deep blues swirled…vibrant reds danced" repeats the same syntactic stem. "Wandered purposefully" recurs as both title concept and summary phrase without tension. Figurative language is dense in the library scene without pattern-teaching ("radiating," "pulsing," "blossomed," "swirled," "danced") and some vehicles contradict (vows "hide behind truth" yet "reveal depths"). Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loop and template cadence in high-pressure beats, and −0.3 for mixed metaphor coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The core synthesis—color-sound synesthesia tied to a sunken library and luminous vows—offers a fresh angle, but the emotional and plot arc closely follows a familiar template: seeker finds artifact, artifact grants vision, seeker returns transformed. The key-lock match is convenient rather than inevitable, and the transformation lacks a non-obvious cost or moral calculus. No bold structural risk or perspectival choice heightens stakes. Within-band: the premise avoids cliché but execution does not transform the template through lived detail or friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his role (lamplighter) frames the opening and closing beats, but his choices do not create key turns—he observes the tag, rows to the wreck, unlocks the orb, and returns. The middle beats are driven by discovery, not decision. His occupation charges the frame (lighting lamps → lighting perception) but does not constrain tactics. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met; development (choice) is weak. Score: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The skeleton key tag appears in three beats: discovery, pocket warmth as linkage, and the lock click that opens the drawer. The tag enables the climax and is reweighted in the return ("tangible link to his journey"). However, it resolves a problem it did not help create—Elias never seeks the key or earns its discovery. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three) +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, but late-resolves-unearned problem −1.0, swappability (any key) −0.5. Score: 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "luminous vows" appear twice: as the glowing tome's content and as the final internal echo ("his heart…beat in rhythm with the luminous vows"). The vows are described as hiding truth and pulsing with meaning, but they do not shape Elias's choices or tactics—he reads, unlocks, and witnesses. The concept charges the ending image but is not causal. Two gates (setup in library, payoff echo); no middle constraint. Score: 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" is attributed to the vows ("revealing depths only to those who read with sincere intent"), but the trait does not constrain an on-page action—Elias reads and succeeds without friction. The phrase is metaphorical decoration, not a visible tradeoff. Label-only, no cost. Score: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Signify" appears three times: the key tag as signifier of access, the lock click "seemed to signify" unlocking, and (implicitly) the orb's hum signifying color. The action is functional but swappable—"unlock," "reveal," or "activate" would serve identically. It does not redefine options or drive a major turn; the lock click is a hinge, not a choice. One beat involvement, causal role present, but swappable. Score: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" is named twice: once as Elias walks the pier and again in the final paragraph as meta-summary. The method does not shape his attempts—he rows directly to the wreck and succeeds without detour or revision. The phrase is thematic label, not dramatized tactic. Mentioned, not mechanized. Score: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The forgotten library is central: it supplies the tome, the lock, and the orb, and its underwater location frames the entire middle sequence. The setting provides resources (air chamber, pedestal) that enable discovery. However, it does not pressure choices—no obstacle, no navigation cost. Three gates (setup via legend, middle discovery, ending reflection), beat involvement strong, but no tactical constraint. Score: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The sky lantern release is present in four beats: opening atmosphere, reflected pathway on water, light through water onto library walls, and final sky adorned with lanterns. The timeframe does not tighten decisions—Elias rows, dives, and returns with no clock pressure. The lanterns charge the mood and frame the closure image but do not alter tactics. Ornamental time. Score: 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (discover color of sound) is stated early, recalled mid-story ("tied to his search"), and fulfilled at the orb. It drives the quest structure but is never conflicted—no cost, no competing want. The desire is told ("haunted," "believed") rather than dramatized through friction. Two gates (setup, payoff); causal but frictionless. Score: 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears three times: opening atmosphere, deepening around Elias in the library, and final binding to silence and light. The tone is consistent (awe, stillness, reverence) and modulates with the library discovery, charging the final image. However, the tone does not shift under pressure—no contrast or break. Coherent but static. Two gates, closure linkage present. Score: 5.8.</comment>
