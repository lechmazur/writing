<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated rather than tested through contradictory impulses. Her "acoustically perceptive" trait remains label-only; we never see her hear absences in a way that constrains a choice. The nightly ritual unfolds without internal friction—she never questions whether releasing echoes honors or exploits her family's memory. Emotional progression is smooth and therapeutic rather than jagged and costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words is met. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural by design, but closure lacks visible cost—Elara's final realization ("true beauty lies in the unfinished") is asserted rather than paid for through renunciation or foreclosed option. The "chronic hush" shifts from oppressive to companion via declaration, not dramatized pressure. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the story cycles through nightly performances without a turn that narrows options or changes knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks anchor early and recur, but they remain postcard backdrops—Elara never navigates spatial constraints or uses wreckage as a resource that alters tactics. The mendicant's bowl is handled across beats, which elevates the score moderately. Sensory detail is vivid but not filtered through urgency or professional bias; every night feels identically atmospheric.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"find beauty in the unfinished"—is declared but never tested by a trade-off or competing pressure. Elara's nightly performances are repetitive loops without escalation; no reversal narrows options. The bonfire ritual unfolds without friction or cost; echoes unbind cooperatively, voices return, and the hush becomes "companion" through assertion rather than earned renunciation or Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated in the final third: "true beauty lies in the unfinished, in the eternal dance between sound and silence." The mendicant's bowl shifts symbolic register—poverty to wealth—via authorial summary rather than scene pressure. No counter-reading is invited; the ending ties up ambiguity mechanically. The rainforest fire backstory is recounted rather than resonating through present particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited voice is stable and carries some lyric texture ("magnificent simplicity," "chronic hush"). Psychic distance remains consistent. However, elevated diction ("acoustically perceptive," "mendicant's bowl," "unbinded") drifts toward essayistic register rather than grounding in Elara's perceptual idiom under pressure. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "chronic hush" + "vast silence" + "quiet world" recur without accumulating new pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens five consecutive sentences mid-story. Stock metaphors: "space for contemplation and creation," "eternal dance between sound and silence." The final paragraph stacks summary-mode restatements ("true beauty lies," "magnificent simplicity") that dull the closure image. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.5, stock metaphor strings −0.4, total −1.5 in Q7; artifacts touch closure, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—musician reviving tradition after ecological catastrophe—reads as a recognizable template (resilience/beauty-from-ashes). "Acoustically perceptive violinist" + "echo-harbor" + "mendicant's bowl" feel assembled rather than inevitable. The transformation from oppressive silence to companion backdrop is told rather than discovered through specific choice. No bold risk heightens stakes; the story hedges toward median comfort.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her nightly violin performances frame the story, but her choices do not create reversals—she decides to build the bonfire and play, and the echoes cooperate without friction. Label-only trait ("acoustically perceptive") and static motivation lower integration. Setup + middle presence + weak closure linkage = functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The mendicant's bowl appears in setup (collecting echoes), middle (near the bonfire heat), and ending (pulsing with stories). It shifts symbolic meaning (poverty → wealth of memory) and is handled across beats. However, the bowl does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; echoes stir and release without resistance. Two-gate strong + lyric reprise + no causal pressure = mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "chronic hush" is named early, recurs throughout, and reweights in the ending ("no longer oppressive but part of the beauty"). It shapes the premise but does not constrain Elara's tactics—she plays each night without the silence blocking or complicating her ritual. Setup + thematic closure reprise + no middle pressure = mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Acoustically perceptive" is stated once ("hearing not just sounds but their absences") but never dramatized—Elara does not use this ability to solve a problem, navigate a constraint, or pay a cost. Label-only mention, no beat involvement, no closure linkage. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears in setup metaphor ("learned to unbind these echoes"), drives the middle bonfire scene ("echoes unbinded"), and titles the thematic turn. However, the action is passive—echoes release cooperatively without struggle or cost. Setup + middle + thematic closure + no felt resistance = lower-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The family tradition (storytelling around a bonfire) is seeded in backstory, attempted in the middle climax (Elara builds the fire and tells stories), and affirmed in the ending ("Night after night, she continued the tradition"). The method shapes the central ritual but does not impose cost or create friction. Setup + middle + closure presence + no constraint = solid 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks are described early and recur, but they function as atmosphere rather than pressure—Elara does not navigate spatial limits, gather resources under constraint, or use wreckage properties to solve a problem. Setup + scenic presence + no causal or tactical role = mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the rainforest burned" anchors the backstory and premise but does not create forward pressure—no ticking clock, no seasonal constraint, no escalating consequence tied to elapsed time. The nightly ritual repeats without temporal urgency. Setup present, no middle or closure tightening = low functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To find beauty in the unfinished" is stated early and becomes the thematic thesis by the end. However, it is never tested by a competing want or cost—Elara succeeds without renouncing an alternate path. Setup + thematic closure + no friction = mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Magnificent simplicity" is named late ("In her storytelling, she found a magnificent simplicity") and recurs in the final line ("a beacon of magnificent simplicity"). The tone is stable and lyric throughout, coherent with the accumulative design. It charges the final image moderately but is asserted rather than earned through tonal modulation under pressure. Lyric reprise + coherence + late signal = upper-5s.</comment>
