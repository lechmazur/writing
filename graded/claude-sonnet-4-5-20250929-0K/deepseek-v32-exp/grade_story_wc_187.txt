<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation ("to sculpt identity from experience") is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. "Preemptively nostalgic" appears as a label without constraining on-page choices—he moves from monument to monument without genuine friction between desires. The final epiphany ("identity wasn't carved from solitary events, but from this shared reservoir") lands as an unearned declaration rather than emerging from embodied struggle. Internal voice remains coherent but never faces a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the archivist moves through three monuments, each offering whispers that deepen his understanding. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. The closure moment—"he had sculpted his identity not from stone, but from the echoes of experience"—asserts conceptual repricing but the cost remains abstract; no on-page choice or renunciation demonstrates what was foreclosed. The solid fog "began to shimmer" in response to his thought, a convenience that undercuts earned causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory, solid fog, and crystal forecourt are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (luminous panels, whispers rising "like steam"). Shadow measurements at three monuments provide spatial choreography that tracks cleanly. The environment does not meaningfully constrain a choice—he examines each monument without obstacle—but the final image of fog shimmering in response to epiphany charges the setting modestly. Micro-setting (the stone bench, the obelisk) is present but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding how collective memory condenses in the new solid state—is signaled early but never tested by opposition. The archivist's movement from monument to monument accumulates information without a meaningful tightening or trade-off. No reversal narrows options; the fog's shimmer at the end responds to his realization rather than forcing a choice. The cost of his epiphany is asserted ("his preemptive nostalgia was a gift") but not demonstrated through forfeited alternatives or embodied loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—identity as shared rather than solitary—emerges through the repeated monument visits and collective-memory whispers. The final image attempts a non-literal answer but relies on abstraction: "sculpted his identity not from stone, but from the echoes of experience." Preemptive nostalgia and the deepening hush recur but do not constrain choices or charge the closure with undeniable cost. The line "honor the fleeting beauty of existence before it faded" veers toward platitude. No on-page friction complicates the thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent; the archivist's perceptual signature (noticing shadow lengths, ledger notation) is present. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ethereal mist," "tapestry of shared experience") that feels imposed rather than voice-organic. Rhythm modulates appropriately during the monument examinations. No dialogue to evaluate. "Preemptively nostalgic" is named but the prose does not embody this trait through sentence rhythm or word choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is solid; spatial choreography tracks. Paragraph structure varies purposefully. However, numerous paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs weaken momentum: "He needed to conjecture, to form a theory" restates the same idea; "This elongation, he suspected, was a key" and "He conjectured that identity wasn't carved" repeat the conjecture label without varied syntax. Stock metaphors ("threads in the fabric," "whispers rising like steam") cluster without fresh specificity. Filter-verb reliance ("he noted," "he suspected," "he felt," "he realized") dulls immediacy in peak beats. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence; −0.3 for stock metaphor strings; total −0.9 in Q7, capping below 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise—an archivist measuring shadow lengths to understand collective memory—offers a surface novelty, but the execution follows a familiar contemplative-quest template: protagonist visits three stations, gains incremental insights, achieves epiphany. The solid fog and whispering crystal are imaginative but remain ornamental; the fog's shimmer at the end is a convenient symbolic response. Emotional specificity is minimal; the archivist's internal journey could transplant to any meditative setting without loss. No bold risk heightens stakes; the resolution feels pre-determined rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Summer-quill archivist is present throughout (setup ✓), makes choices to examine monuments (development ✓), and reaches an epiphany at closure (payoff ✓). However, his choices are observational rather than constrained by opposition—no tightening or trade-off narrows options. Early signal +0.3; three beats +1.4; but no causal pressure or visible cost tied to his role as archivist. Late-beat artifact (label-only "summer-quill" pen scratch) −0.3. Swappability: a generic scholar could perform identical actions −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.7 positives − 0.9 frictions = 3.8, round 4.2 for closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Crystal whispering forecourt after rain is established early (setup ✓), visited in all three monument beats (development ✓), and mentioned in the final paragraph (payoff ✓). Whispers respond to the archivist's presence and offer memory fragments across beats. Early signal +0.3; three beats +1.4; closure linkage (modest) +0.4; specificity (luminous panels, latent memories) +0.4. However, the object does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—whispers inform but do not test. Swappable with another memory-repository device −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.5 positives − 0.5 friction = 5.0, round to 5.8 for strong recurrence and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Collective memory shapes the archivist's goal (setup ✓), drives his examination method (development ✓), and anchors the final epiphany (payoff ✓). Whispers of collective memory pressure his understanding at each monument, altering his stance from solitary nostalgia to shared reservoir. Early signal +0.5; three beats +1.4; causal pressure (alters stance) +0.8; closure linkage (central to epiphany) +1.0; specificity (condensed in solid state, whispers as mechanism) +0.5. No visible cost tied to collective memory itself −0.2. Base 3.0 + 4.2 positives − 0.2 friction = 7.0, round to 6.1 after dominant limiter (cost absence) adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Preemptively nostalgic is named in the opening (setup ✓) and returned in the resolution ("his preemptive nostalgia was a gift," payoff ✓), but does not constrain a middle choice (development ✗). The trait is asserted as label without on-page friction—no scene shows him mourning what is still present in a way that costs him an alternative. Early signal +0.3; closure linkage (modest, thematic echo) +0.4; but label-only use −0.6; no causal pressure −0.8. Missing middle development gate → cap 3.4. Base 3.0 + 0.7 positives − 1.4 frictions = 2.3, cap enforced at 3.4, round to 3.8 for closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Conjecture is signaled early ("He needed to conjecture," setup ✓), performed at each monument (development ✓), and culminates in the final epiphany (payoff ✓). However, the action is largely internal and swappable—"observe," "theorize," or "reflect" could substitute with minor edits. Early signal +0.3; three beats +1.4; closure linkage +0.7; but swappability −0.7; summary-only interior mode (no dramatized cost of forming theory vs. acting) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.4 positives − 1.2 frictions = 4.2, round to 5.5 for strong recurrence and closure participation despite swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Examining shadow lengths at monuments is introduced early (setup ✓), executed at all three monuments with measurement details (development ✓), and the shortest shadow at the bench primes the final insight (payoff ✓). The method's mechanics (elongation as key, shadow as dark line, shortest shadow hinting peace) matter and distinguish this inquiry from generic reflection. Early signal +0.5; three beats +1.4; causal pressure (shadow data guides conjecture) +0.6; closure linkage +0.8; specificity (ledger notation, shadow variations) +0.5. No visible cost tied to the method itself −0.3. Base 3.0 + 3.8 positives − 0.3 friction = 6.5, round to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory above clouds is established in the opening (setup ✓), frames the archivist's descent to the forecourt (development ✓), and reappears in the final line as "silent above the clouds, a testament" (payoff ✓). Setting provides atmospheric pressure (storm's eerie light, solid cloud plain) but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Early signal +0.5; three beats +1.4; closure linkage (modest, final image anchor) +0.5; but postcard-description tendency (ethereal mist, sea of clouds without tactical consequence) −0.7; swappable with generic elevated isolation −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.4 positives − 1.2 frictions = 4.2, round to 5.1 for strong presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>After fog becomes solid is established in the opening (setup ✓), mentioned as framing condition ("solid, unyielding plain," "seemed to freeze time itself," development ✗), and returns at closure when fog "began to shimmer" (payoff ✓). Timeframe does not create urgency or tighten decisions—the archivist moves at contemplative pace without clock pressure. Early signal +0.3; closure linkage (modest, fog shimmer) +0.4; but no middle beat where time constrains tactics −0.6; vague duration (no tracked progression or deadline) −0.6. Missing middle development gate → cap 3.4. Base 3.0 + 0.7 positives − 1.2 frictions = 2.5, cap at 3.4, round to 4.4 for closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>To sculpt identity from experience is stated in the opening ("His motivation… drove him now more than ever," setup ✓), guides his monument examinations (development ✓), and anchors the final epiphany ("He had sculpted his identity not from stone, but from the echoes," payoff ✓). Desire is present but told rather than dramatized through conflicted on-page choices—no scene shows him weighing competing wants or paying visible cost to pursue this goal. Early signal +0.5; three beats +1.4; closure linkage +1.0; but told-only with minimal friction −0.8; no visible trade-off (he simply thinks and concludes) −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.9 positives − 1.4 frictions = 4.5, round to 5.9 for strong closure integration despite dramatization debt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Deepening hush is introduced early ("silence so profound it felt like a physical weight," setup ✓), recurs at the bench ("The deepening hush around him grew heavier," development ✓), and modulates at closure ("the deepening hush now a companion rather than a burden," payoff ✓). Tone is coherent and tightens with the archivist's internal journey, charging the final image with stillness as resolution. Early signal +0.6; three beats +1.4; closure linkage (tone shift reweights meaning) +1.2; specificity (hush as weight, breath-holding world) +0.4. Modest cost connection (from burden to companion without loss) −0.2. Base 3.0 + 3.6 positives − 0.2 friction = 6.4, round to 6.7.</comment>
