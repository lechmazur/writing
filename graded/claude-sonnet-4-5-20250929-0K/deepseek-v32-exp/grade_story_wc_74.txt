<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's insomniac restlessness is established but functions primarily as context rather than complicating choice. Her motivation to "prove" kindness is declared repeatedly yet never faces on-page friction or cost—she collects visions without struggle, error, or trade-off. The "methodically hopeful" tag appears three times but constrains no decision; the final descent carries assurance without forfeiture. Interiority remains abstract ("surge of emotion," "calm certainty") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: visions layer toward a thematic culmination. Orientation anchors late (~180 words before "rooftop greenhouse" clarifies location), though the disorientation does not pay off at closure—apply −0.4 per the Orientation Test. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing (kindness echoes through time) but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page: Elara descends "carrying quiet assurance" with no path foreclosed, no visible price paid. The greenhouse-to-city gaze shift provides a soft closure image, yet because no option narrows or tactic changes, the reconfiguration remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, and moon-tipped brush establish vivid atmosphere. Sensory detail—humid air, saffron quiet, acidic haze—supports tone but does not constrain a choice or alter a tactic. The waxing moon intensifies visions yet functions as backdrop rather than pressure lever. Spatial choreography (stairs, table, greenhouse edge) remains clear, and the micro-setting (brush, bowl of water) charges the final vision sequence, narrowly meeting the 9+ gate at the low end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove strangers remember kindness) is signaled early but never tested by friction, failure, or competing cost. Elara paints visions methodically; each one confirms her belief without reversal, opposition, or scarcity. The "faster" painting in the climax represents intensity escalation without tactical shift or foreclosed option. No on-page cost—sleep can "wait," implying indefinite deferral rather than sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or cadence shift; here it repeats confirmation loops.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (remembered kindness transcends time and language) emerges clearly from layered visions and the network image. The lost-language motif avoids overt moralizing until "shared human truth" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thesis. The final image—city "softer, kinder, because strangers remember"—reconfigures perception but lacks the non-literal compression that earns resonance; the answer is stated rather than dramatized. Subtext operates lightly in the visions but the framing narration explains rather than implies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic painter-artist texture; diction ("smog-choked," "otherworldly sheen," "saffron quiet") leans elevated but stays legible. Sentence stems recur: "She painted…," "She saw…," "Elara felt…," creating template cadence across the vision sequence. Filter verbs cluster moderately ("she witnessed," "she felt," "she saw") without severe flattening, but rhythmic control under pressure is weak—syntax does not tighten as visions accelerate. No dialogue present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She painted… The greenhouse filled…," "She saw… She felt…," "The words… the kindness…" across adjacent lines. Multiple beats open with identical stems, triggering −0.6 for template runs. Stock metaphors ("drink the pale light," "tapestry of human goodness") and synonym churn ("roused," "rouse," "rousing" in three paragraphs) add −0.4. Figurative density is moderate; no mixed metaphors harm clarity. Information density is low—many lines restate the proof-gathering loop without advancing choice. Non-closure artifacts prevent 9+ eligibility globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Core premise (magic brush reveals forgotten kindnesses) is derivative of widespread memory-art tropes without fresh transformation. The visions function as confirmation gallery rather than conflict engine. Specificity appears in sensory detail (saffron, fig, scrolls) but emotional and causal arcs could swap names and settings with minimal change—fails the transformation test. The global kindness network image is abstractly ambitious yet arrives through accumulation rather than synthesis with cost. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece executes a familiar template competently but predictably.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her painting attempts frame all beats, yet her choices do not create turns—each vision confirms rather than complicates. Observation dominates; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. She descends at the end with "quiet assurance," a stance rather than a costly pivot. Setup strong, development functional (she paints repeatedly), closure participation minimal (she gazes and smiles). Swappable with any seeker-artist without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Moon-tipped brush appears in setup (weathered table paragraph), development (dipped, painted strokes, traced symbols, glowing fiercely), and closure (laid down, dimming, rested). Used in three distinct beats with evolving intensity (shimmer → glow → fierce glow → dim). However, its unique properties (moon-tip, memory-channeling) do not constrain a choice or impose cost; it enables visions without friction. Purposeful reprise charges the ending mildly. Eligibility ~6.3 via all gates plus lyric return; causal pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Lost languages appear in three visions (melodic tongue/fig, guttural dialect/fisherman, dead language/scholar) and the final synthesis claim ("lived on in these acts"). They flavor the visions thematically but do not shape stakes or tactics—Elara does not struggle to decode them or choose between them. Setup present, development ornamental, closure linked only as thematic echo. Swappable with "forgotten gestures" or "ancient customs" without structural change. Cap at functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" appears three times: opening paragraph, middle ("she worked methodically, hopeful"), and near-end ("methodically hopeful that others would find"). It describes her temperament but constrains no action with cost—she paints steadily without setback or doubt. Label-only trait. Setup present, development summary-only, closure participation ornamental (adverb in a reflection line). −0.6 for label-only use and lack of causal work; ornamental mention −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Rouse" drives the central action: she aims to "rouse a specific memory," "used the brush to rouse more memories," and "roused something essential." It appears in four beats and defines her method. However, the action is repeatable without differentiation—each rouse-cycle confirms rather than turns. Setup strong, development present across beats, closure participation direct ("roused something essential"). Causal pressure light (no failure, no cost per attempt); irreplaceability moderate. Eligible ~6.0 via three gates; lack of cost or tactical shift holds it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Daydreams sparked by moonlight" is the mechanism: moon radiance causes shimmer, visions unfold, moonlight intensifies. Signaled early (brush drinks pale light, lunar radiance), developed (moonlight responded, moon brightened), and present at closure (moon's glow held). Appears in setup, middle escalation, and ending image. Method is consistent and matters to the attempt structure. No cost tied to moonlight depletion or waxing/waning pressure. All three gates met; causal necessity moderate; score ~5.5 for solid presence without cost friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse frames the entire scene spatially and atmospherically. Smog-choked city contrasts with humid sanctuary, reinforcing theme. Setup strong (stairs, glass panes), development continuous (greenhouse fills with quiet), closure direct (she steps to edge, greenhouse holds glow). However, setting does not constrain choice—she could paint anywhere with the brush and moon. No resource scarcity, no access pressure. Postcard-level description elevated by sensory consistency. Three gates met; causal pressure absent; cap ~5.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Waxing moon appears in setup (opening line), development (moon brightened, intensified visions), and closure (under the waxing moon). It supplies light and symbolic growth but imposes no time pressure—Elara can continue "another night." No clock tightens decisions; no phase urgency. Setup present, development atmospheric, closure ornamental. Swappable with "full moon" or "clear night." Mid-gate participation without tactical constraint; cap ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Motivation ("to prove that strangers remember kindness") is declared in opening third, drives vision-selection, and resolves in final synthesis ("proof she sought," "shared human truth"). Setup strong, development steady (each vision serves the proof), closure direct. However, the desire is never conflicted—no doubt, no competing want, no friction. Told and restated rather than dramatized through choice with cost. Three gates met but no want-versus-cost tension; functional but replaceable with "to find" or "to witness." Mid-band ~5.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" appears once in mid-story ("The greenhouse filled with a saffron quiet") and indirectly in closure ("carrying the quiet assurance"). Tone is warm, hushed, and consistent but static—no modulation under pressure. Single mood pervades without charging the final image through contrast or return. Setup weak (late introduction), development single-use, closure tangential. Ornamental descriptor rather than tonal driver. One-touch lyric mention; cap ~4.7.</comment>
