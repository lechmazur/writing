<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is declared ("to reclaim the light stolen by midnight") but his interior life remains flat and generic throughout. The townsman scene attempts internal conflict via the covenant's test, but Elian's response is immediate and competent with no visible struggle or contradictory impulse. Emotions are labeled ("awe," "wonder") rather than embodied through perception or gesture. The final smile and "heart light" reads as summary reward rather than earned cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "resonance chamber" and "midnight" remain abstract past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 penalty. The covenant wilting when the townsman lies provides one micro turn, but the resolution—man confesses, song strengthens, light returns—unfolds in a single unbroken causal chain with no felt cost or foreclosed path on the page. The ending offers Decisive Change (light reclaimed) but the price is externalized to the townsman's confession rather than Elian's sacrifice or trade-off, weakening closure under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The resonance chamber amplifies sound and vibrates during the song, providing minimal setting constraint. The music box and philosopher's stone chip are handled across multiple beats and return at closure, qualifying as micro-setting objects. However, spatial choreography is vague—no clear sense of room layout, exits, or how the townsman's entrance affects proximity or tool placement. The chamber does not meaningfully constrain Elian's choices or alter his tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (reclaim stolen light) is signaled early. The townsman's lie creates a reversal (gears tarnish, song falters), but Elian's response is immediate and friction-free: he "spoke gently," the man confessed, and the problem dissolves. No visible trade-off or foreclosed option—Elian completes his task without sacrificing time, stamina, or social cost. The ending declares triumph but does not dramatize a price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. decay, mending unseen fractures) emerges through the covenant and Elian's craft, but the final paragraph states the moral outright: "his work…was about tethering hope to reality, mending souls." The covenant of rust functions more as symbolic machinery than lived particulars. The ending delivers a clean resolution without ambiguity or counter-reading—light is won, Elian smiles, mission complete—flattening thematic resonance into a tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and uniform ("humming resonance chamber," "tinkersong wonder") throughout, lacking modulation under stress. The single dialogue exchange ("urging truth") is summarized rather than dramatized, missing subtext or character-specific idiom. Psychic distance stays consistent but the narrative voice feels generic rather than character-particular—Elian's perceptual signature is not distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: nine consecutive paragraphs open with "Elian," "He," or "The" + noun, creating monotonous rhythm. Paraphrase loops appear ("tinkersong wonder" recurs four times; "mending what isn't torn" three times without reweighting). Stock metaphors ("stained with oil and starlight," "washed over") and summary beats ("he felt," "he knew") dull immediacy. Filter-verb stacks cluster in high-pressure moments ("He felt the covenant," "He knew he had to act"), reducing sentence-level propulsion. Applying −1.0 for template cadence and loops, and −0.4 for filter stacks touching peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise (music box repairman mends metaphysical wounds via covenant and philosopher's stone) combines familiar fantasy tropes without fresh synthesis. "Mending what isn't torn" is a clever inversion but remains conceptual rather than grounded in specific craft choices that differ from ordinary repair. The townsman's lie serving as the sole obstacle is a standard test-of-virtue beat. Emotional arc (competent hero succeeds) is linear and predictable. No bold risk or transformation distinguishes this from template quest-restore plots.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elian appears in every paragraph but his choices are reactive and competent: he adjusts, winds, focuses, channels. The townsman's confession, not Elian's decision under pressure, resolves the wilting crisis. Removing "music box repairman" and substituting another artisan role would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chip is introduced early (paragraph 2), handled during the winding process (paragraph 14), glows brighter during the tether action (paragraph 26), and rests "steady and pure" at closure (paragraph 37). It enables the metaphysical mending but its unique properties (why a chip vs. whole stone?) are not explored. Functional across beats; moderately irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The covenant is introduced (paragraph 5), governs the wilting when the townsman lies (paragraph 19), and recedes when honesty flows (paragraph 28). It shapes one key turn but does not constrain Elian's method or force a trade-off—he simply waits for the man to confess. Present in setup, middle, and ending; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Wilts near dishonesty" appears in setup (paragraph 6), activates when the townsman enters with a lie (paragraph 19), halts when truth is spoken (paragraph 21). It creates visible consequence (tarnishing gears, faltering song) and alters tactics (Elian must secure truth before proceeding). Present across all three gates; causal in one beat; moderate cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Tether" is seeded early (paragraph 7), attempted mid-story (paragraph 20, 23), executed at closure (paragraph 26, 32). The action is visualized ("strands of light being drawn back") and provides the mechanism for closure. Could be swapped for "bind" or "anchor" with minimal rewrite, but its repetition and closure linkage lift it above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Mending what isn't torn" appears in setup (paragraph 8), mid-story (paragraph 17, 29), and at closure (paragraph 35). It frames the metaphysical repair but the mechanics remain abstract—Elian "feels the gaps" and "weaves" without specific technique that differs from ordinary fixing. Present across beats; thematic but not concretely causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The resonance chamber amplifies sound (paragraph 1, 10, 32) and vibrates during the song, providing the physical anchor for the tether action. It enables the method but does not pressure choices—Elian could perform the same work in another space with amplification. Setup, development (vibration supports winding), and closure presence; functional but not uniquely necessary.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"In the balance" appears repeatedly (paragraphs 9, 24, 33, 39) as metaphor rather than tracked time pressure. No clock or deadline tightens Elian's tactics; the phrase labels urgency without dramatizing tempo. Present thematically but does not constrain action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reclaim the light stolen by midnight" is stated early (paragraph 4), recalled mid-story (paragraph 11), and achieved at closure (paragraph 33). The desire drives all action but is never conflicted—Elian pursues it without competing want or visible sacrifice. Functional across beats; shapes goal but not internal friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" recurs (paragraphs 10, 32, 40) as a label for tone but does not modulate with pressure—the same lyric diction persists during the crisis (townsman's lie) and triumph. The tone is stated rather than embodied through rhythm or image shifts. Present at setup and closure; decorative rather than dynamic.</comment>
