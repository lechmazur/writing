<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (grafting new meaning onto old wounds) is established but mostly remains abstract until the Kaito memory provides concrete footing. The interiority leans heavily on elevated metaphor ("lotus-hearted ache," "shrewdly innocent") that reads as label rather than embodied contradiction. The decryption work shows agency but unfolds in summary narration rather than moment-by-moment discovery with micro-choices under visible cost. The anesthetic frame allows reflection but flattens present-tense pressure, making the final "completion" feel declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the decryption beats layer meaning toward a final reweighting when the two-figures symbol is revealed. However, the entire sequence occurs in drugged memory without a present-frame constraint or cost that narrows options; the "completion" and catharsis are asserted in summary rather than dramatized as a resonant reconfiguration with on-page friction. The closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing (understanding as action), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than viscerally legible in a final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (bruised purple light, vapor curling, marble benches, ferns). Spatial choreography is stable and the brain coral fragment returns as a tactile anchor. However, the setting does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter Elara's decryption work; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure vessel. The body (drugged, floating) is described but does not limit her mental process in a way that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—grafting new meaning onto trauma—is signaled early but remains abstract. The decryption of Kaito's cast notes provides a structured sequence (circle, numbers, "river," two figures), yet each symbol is interpreted without visible resistance, failed attempts, or trade-offs. Pressure does not escalate; the anesthetic frame removes urgency and the "unknotting" proceeds linearly in summary. The final symbol's revelation offers thematic weight but lacks a live cost or tightening that forecloses an option on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (healing as understanding, trauma as shared language) emerges organically from the decryption particulars and the coral fragment's silent witness. The final image—two figures holding hands as a statement of connection—reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the piece edges toward thesis articulation ("understanding itself is a form of action, a way to rebuild") in the penultimate段, which dilutes emergent resonance. The lotus-hearted ache phrase recurs but remains decorative rather than earning new meaning through dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and the prose maintains a lyric, elevated register throughout. Psychic distance is consistent with the drugged, reflective frame. However, diction often drifts into abstract poeticism ("shrewdly innocent," "lotus-hearted ache," "psychic thread") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, and the register does not modulate under pressure because the anesthetic smooths all urgency. Perceptual signature is present but homogenous; the voice does not vary texture as emotional intensity shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often striking ("cold tide pulling her from the sharp edges of the world," "evening's bruised purple light"), but multiple beats stack metaphor without propulsion: the opening paragraph layers four distinct images in rapid succession, blurring focus. Paraphrase loops appear: "unknotting them for both of them, thread by psychic thread" restates the prior sentence's "untying a knot in a tangled rope." The decryption sequence summarizes rather than dramatizes each beat, reducing information density. Template cadence runs occur in the middle third ("The first mark was… Next, a series… Then, a word…"), flattening rhythm at a key escalation point.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The anesthetic-dream frame for processing trauma is familiar, and the translator-as-healer premise echoes established therapeutic narrative templates. The brain coral fragment and smudged-cast notes offer specific texture, but the decryption unfolds predictably without a non-obvious turn or moral calculus that reweights the premise. The piece commits to its lyric mode but does not transform the core material through risk or surprise; the emotional arc follows an expected path from fragmentation to cathartic integration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The translator role is seeded early and motivates the decryption task, but Elara's choices in the present frame are minimal; the memory unfolds in summary rather than through on-page decisions that alter tactics or foreclose paths. Present in setup and closure participation (the final understanding is framed as her professional skill) but lacks middle development beats where the trait constrains action under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The brain coral fragment appears in the opening beat, is held throughout, and returns in the final paragraph with a new charge ("felt lighter… testament to resilience"). However, its role is largely symbolic; it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic. The shift from "cool" to "faint remembered warmth" to "lighter" reweights meaning but remains ornamental rather than causally active. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band, but swappability limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Shared anxieties (fear of being misunderstood, losing home, post-explosion silence) are named explicitly and motivate the decryption work. The concept shapes the thematic stakes but does not alter on-page tactics; Elara's process is the same whether the anxieties are "shared" or solely her own. Present across all three gates but functions more as theme claim than pressure mechanic, holding it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is introduced early as a descriptor ("a paradox forged by years of hearing horrors while still believing in the pristine grammar of peace") and echoed once near the end ("Kaito's shrewdly innocent eyes"). The trait is asserted but never enacted; no on-page choice shows Elara navigating the tension between shrewdness and innocence with visible cost. Label-only usage and no causal pressure keep this ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Unknotting/decryption structures the entire middle sequence and is named as the task from the outset. Each symbol (circle, numbers, river, two figures) is presented as an unknotting beat, and the final symbol's release triggers the cathartic warmth. However, the action is narrated in summary rather than dramatized with resistance or failed attempts, and the verb "unknot" itself is somewhat generic. Present in setup, development, and closure but swappable with "decipher" or "translate" without fundamental change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method (decrypting smudged notes on Kaito's cast) is introduced in the first third, structures the middle beats, and completes at closure. The mechanics are signaled (wobbly circle, numbers, half-erased word, smudged drawing) and matter to the sequence of understanding. However, the decryption proceeds without false starts or methodology friction; the smudged quality does not impose cost beyond requiring effort. All three gates met with functional causal work, but specificity and irreplaceability are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly established in the opening and sustained throughout (vapor, ferns, marble benches, deepening twilight, swirling mist). It provides atmosphere and a container for reflection but does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter Elara's internal work. The setting is present at setup and closure but passive; it could be replaced by another liminal space without structural impact. Functional but replaceable holds it at mid-band floor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The anesthetic timeframe is signaled in the opening sentence and frames the entire piece as a drugged, suspended hour. However, time does not tighten; the anesthetic removes urgency rather than imposing a countdown or altering cognitive capacity in ways that shape tactics. The frame enables reflection but flattens pressure. Present in setup and implied at closure ("drifted into deeper sleep") but does not drive escalation, keeping it in replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation (to graft new meaning onto old wounds) is introduced early ("her current motivation, hazy yet persistent") and explicitly revisited near closure ("grafting new meaning was not about erasing the past"). It drives the decryption task and the thematic resolution. However, the desire is mostly told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; the anesthetic allows her to "bypass her own defenses" without visible friction between wound and healing impulse. Setup, development (shapes the task), and closure presence with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Lotus-hearted ache is introduced mid-piece as a phrase for "beautiful sorrow that acknowledged pain while nurturing the possibility of growth" and echoed in the final paragraph as settling "into peaceful resolution." The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (from suspended calm to quiet catharsis), but the phrase itself is ornamental and the emotional texture remains uniformly lyric without sharp contrast. Present at development and closure with thematic charge but lacks early setup and distinct tonal shifts under pressure.</comment>
