<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to prove that listening heals") drives her investigation, but interiority remains declarative rather than contradictory—her listening unfolds without internal friction or doubt. Mr. Hemlock's grief is told through summary ("his eyes clouded with years of silence") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice (unlocking the mailbox) arrives without visible cost to Elara; his transformation feels granted rather than earned through on-page struggle. Secondary characters (Mrs. Gable, the baker) deliver exposition without applying immediate pressure that forces Elara's choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors orientation (courtyard, dawn, Elara) within the first lines. Causality holds: locket → investigation → mailbox → letter. However, the core closure (Mr. Hemlock reading the letter and smiling) lacks visible cost—his emotional release is asserted ("the weight lifting") without a dramatized internal trade-off or forfeited path. The drive lens reads Causal (because/therefore linkage), but the final image does not reconfigure options with felt price; it grants resolution. One meaningful tightening occurs (the locket's key fits the mailbox), but the stakes dissolve rather than crystalize with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The vibrant courtyard is established early with sensory anchors (dawn light, cobblestones, fountain, pigeons). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (apartment, courtyard, mailbox). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it serves as backdrop rather than micro-setting that alters tactics. The locket's "faint scent of lavender" and the "rusted and stubborn" mailbox supply texture but do not pressure the ending beat. Entering the 7.0+ band requires setting to shape closure; here it does not.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (returning the locket to ease Mr. Hemlock's sorrow) is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation reads as accumulation (Mrs. Gable → baker → Mr. Hemlock) rather than a tightening that narrows options. The resolution (unlocking the mailbox and reading the letter) is driven by Elara's persistence but lacks a visible price—Hemlock's agreement and emotional release arrive without on-page friction or trade-off. Cost legibility is the high-band gate; here cost is asserted ("the weight lifting") but not dramatized with a forfeited path or visible stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme ("listening heals") emerges from Elara's method and the mailbox unlock, but the final beat states the thesis overtly ("Elara had proven that listening heals") rather than allowing the image to reweight prior material. The locket and mailbox recur with shifting meaning (love token → key → emotional release), which supports thematic resonance. However, the ending offers a tidy moral rather than a non-literal, resonant answer—"mending a wound through the simple act of bearing witness" is direct philosophizing. Mid-band fits work that signals theme clearly but resolves into statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows her "curator's eye" and attunement to "whispers of forgotten things," though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the attribute of leads through following guide her" reads as prompt echo rather than character idiom). Dialogue (Mrs. Gable, Mr. Hemlock) carries natural rhythm and goal pursuit. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the mailbox scene. The prose texture is controlled but leans toward the explanatory ("her listening a balm to his lonely soul") at peak moments, flattening immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Loops and scaffold appear: "This was the moment the outside world intruded, bringing with it a puzzle that would demand her attention" immediately follows "today felt different" without added pressure. "Her motivation was clear: to prove that listening heals, a belief forged from years of mending broken stories" is expository intrusion. Template stems recur ("She approached… She listened… She moved… She learned… She found… She left"), creating cadence monotony across the middle third. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt a connection," "she felt the attribute," "she knew") dull immediacy. The phrase "the attribute of leads through following guide her" is a syntax artifact that obscures sense. Penalize here per the Loop/Scaffold Screen and patterned-artifact pack; baseline −0.6 for template cadence, −0.3 for filter stacks, −0.3 for one clear paraphrase loop = cumulative −1.2, with the artifact touching multiple beats but not the closure sentence itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise (lost locket → neighborhood storytelling → locked mailbox mystery) follows a familiar found-object/community-healing template without fresh transformation. The emotional arc (withdrawn grief → cathartic letter reading) resolves predictably. Specific details (lavender scent, rusted mailbox, pigeons, baker's ritual) supply texture but do not synthesize into a non-obvious moral calculus or hinge. The "sandstorm calm" phrase recurs but remains ornamental rather than constraining choice. Transformation test: the plot and emotional resolution could transfer to different names and places with minimal change, signaling derivative design. Apply Derivative Premise Guardrail: −0.8 within Q8 for template reliance without bold risk or synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's trait (discerning curator) is present in the opening ("her curator's eye noting the intricate craftsmanship") and guides her investigation method (asking around, gathering fragments). She makes the key choice to investigate and later to approach Mr. Hemlock, altering tactics (neighborhood inquiry → direct contact). However, "discerning" itself does not constrain a choice with visible cost—her curatorial skill enables but does not force a trade-off. Setup early +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal enablement +0.8 = ~5.8 baseline. Swappable with "perceptive neighbor" or "kind social worker" with minor edits caps mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The locket appears in beat one (discovery on cobblestones), beat two (Elara examines and feels connection), middle beats (described to neighbors), and closure (handed to Mr. Hemlock, contains the key). Its properties (sealed clasp, lavender scent, tiny key inside) drive the mailbox solution and charge the final act. Setup early +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, irreplaceability (the key inside) +0.6 = strong integration. However, the locket's return to Mr. Hemlock and the key's function are resolved without on-page cost tied specifically to the locket's symbolic weight—it unlocks but does not itself foreclose a path. High 7s require cost; here the cost belongs to the mailbox reveal, not the locket's handling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locked mailbox mystery frames the investigation (setup by paragraph ~6, "the locked mailbox she passed every day"), drives middle tactics (Elara learns it belongs to Mr. Hemlock and holds his wife's final letter), and anchors closure (unlocking it with the locket's key, reading the letter). The mystery shapes stakes (what's inside? why sealed?) and tactics (Elara must hear his story to offer the key). Setup early +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure +1.0 = solid mid-high band. Cost at closure (emotional release) is visible but not tied to a price Elara or Hemlock pays—resolution grants rather than forecloses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is referenced once as label ("Elara felt the attribute of leads through following guide her") without dramatized cost or constraint. The trait should mean Elara discovers by indirect pursuit, but on-page she pursues directly (asks Mrs. Gable, approaches Mr. Hemlock). No beat shows her following a lead that then narrows her options or imposes a visible trade-off. Ornamental mention −0.8, late signal (mid-story) −0.3, label-only −0.3 = heavy friction. Swappable with "persistent curiosity" or omitted entirely without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Hear" drives multiple beats: Elara listens to Mrs. Gable, hears the baker's ache, hears Mr. Hemlock's flood of memories, and the final thesis ("Elara did not interrupt; she simply heard him"). The action is signaled early (Elara's senses "attuned to the whispers of forgotten things"), repeated across middle attempts, and charges the closure image (her listening as balm). Setup early +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, causal pressure +0.8 = high integration. However, "hear" as passive reception does not force a difficult choice with visible cost—Elara's listening succeeds without friction or sacrifice. Entering 8.5+ requires irreplaceability with cost; "listen" or "witness" could swap in with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Through neighborhood storytelling" is signaled ("She decided to investigate… through neighborhood storytelling") and executed across middle beats (Mrs. Gable, the baker, other residents). The method shapes her approach (ask and listen rather than investigate files or confront). Setup early +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7 = mid-band. However, the method does not impose a cost or constrain a choice—she gathers stories without friction, and the final resolution (handing over the locket, unlocking the mailbox) does not test or transform the storytelling method. Swappable with "asking around" or "community inquiry" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The vibrant courtyard at dawn is established in the opening and recurs at closure ("now bathed in full morning light," "once a backdrop for solitude, now thrummed with connection"). It provides spatial anchor for the inciting event (delivery truck, locket drop) and the climax (mailbox unlock). Setup early +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure reprise +0.8 = solid mid-band. However, the courtyard does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—it remains backdrop rather than micro-setting that pressures the ending. Postcard description trends low; tactical relevance trends high; this piece falls between.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes" is signaled in the inciting beat ("This was the moment the outside world intruded") via the delivery truck commotion. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a clock—Elara's investigation unfolds at her pace across an untracked duration (dawn → "awakening neighborhood" → "full morning light"). No urgency or deadline pressures her choices; the intrusion is a one-time event rather than a live constraint. Setup present +0.4, ornamental use −0.7, swappable with "one morning" −0.5 = low mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation ("to prove that listening heals") is stated explicitly ("Her motivation was clear") and drives her investigation method (asking, listening, not interrupting). It frames the thematic question and anchors the final thesis. Setup early +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2 = strong presence. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through friction—Elara's belief is never tested or conflicted; she listens, and it works. Cost connection weak: no visible trade-off (time, risk, doubt) tied to proving her belief. Entering 7.0+ requires friction between wants and costs; here the motivation succeeds without complication.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" is introduced early ("The air held a sandstorm calm, a peculiar stillness that belied the impending chaos") and recurs at closure ("the sandstorm calm enveloping her like a promise"). The phrase establishes tone (paradoxical stillness amid potential chaos) and modulates slightly (opening tension → closing serenity restored). Setup early +0.6, closure reprise +0.8 = mid-band lyric use. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure through middle beats—commotion erupts but the narrative voice remains steady and declarative rather than shifting cadence or diction under stress. Charged final image requires tone to reweight stakes; here the reprise asserts restoration without undeniable pressure. Swappable with "quiet morning" or "serene dawn" without breaking logic caps higher bands.</comment>
