<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (capturing texture of missed opportunity) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout; her "balancedly daring" trait is asserted rather than tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The final shift from "chasing a ghost" to acceptance lacks causal grounding—no on-page choice forces the renunciation, only declaration. Interiority relies heavily on conceptual abstractions ("texture," "resonance in chaos") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The dice become symbolic markers without constraining tactical choices that would reveal character hierarchy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, where precisely she stands, and what the staircase concretely is remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the "rupture" appears without prior escalation—mathematical proofs are described in summary, not dramatized as attempts that narrow options. Cost is asserted ("she had used the proofs... to accept") rather than felt on the page; no concrete forfeiture or tactical shift marks the before/after. Drive lens drifts between Accumulative (texture-seeking) and Causal (proofs forcing rupture) without teaching the pattern or holding it at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is named but not grounded in sensory particulars—no material (stone appears once, late), temperature gradient, acoustic signature, or spatial scale that would anchor Elara's position. The chipped die is handled twice (clutched, rolled) but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Spatial choreography is absent: we never learn if she's ascending, paused, or moving laterally when the rupture occurs. The setting functions as conceptual backdrop rather than lived-in pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the texture of a missed opportunity—is signaled early but never concretized into a testable on-page problem with live options. No reversal or tightening narrows Elara's choices; the "rupture" is a coincidental event (crack appears beneath her) rather than the result of her tactical decisions. The dice roll (3 and 5) feeds "into her calculations" by assertion only; we see no math, no narrowing, no cost paid for the attempt. Closure renunciation ("no longer chasing a ghost") is told rather than earned by a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of accepting imperfection ("the chip in the die, the imbalance that made chance beautiful") emerges clearly but is stated rather than earned through scene pressure. The final insight—"opportunities are never truly missed, just transformed"—reads as platitude rather than resonant answer grown from the rupture moment. Perpetual motion as both literal and metaphorical frame shows coherence, and the story resists a simplistic moral by embracing paradox (boundless confinement). However, late-paragraph articulation of theme ("texture she had sought was simply the feel of life itself") dilutes subtext with direct statement (−0.5).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and focalization through Elara's perception is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("stochastic element in her deterministic pursuit," "discontinuity that would tear the fabric") that sits uneasily with the grim optimist framing and emotional stakes. Sentence rhythm is uniform across pressure beats—no compression or acceleration during the rupture sequence. Filter verbs appear frequently ("she felt," "she believed," "she realized") without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "boundless confinement" / "endless progress toward nowhere" / "infinite ascent" restate the same idea across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate ("She was," "She believed," "She sought," "She adjusted") with identical stems across seven consecutive beats (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("fading light," "canvas for her dreams," "threads of the old") cluster in the final third without fresh vehicle or specificity. The rupture beat—"crack appeared... symbols glowed... rupture was not destruction but revelation"—uses passive constructions and abstract nouns where concrete action would sharpen the turn. Information density is low; many sentences restate theme rather than advance situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The infinite-staircase-as-psychological-prison premise is familiar from genre templates (Sisyphus, liminal metaphor spaces) and the story does not transform it through specific world logic or non-obvious moral calculus (−1.0 derivative premise deduction). The chipped die as symbol of imperfection is a widely used motif; here it receives label-only treatment ("flaw in every system") without fresh inflection. The mathematical-proofs method is mentioned but never visualized or made concrete, missing the opportunity for specific procedural texture. The final realization—accept imperfection, keep moving—is earnest but generic, applicable to countless resilience narratives without this exact character or setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Grim optimism is asserted in the opening line and restated at closure ("grim optimism brightening into pure hope") but does not drive on-page choices. Elara's decisions—rolling dice, using proofs, continuing ascent—are narrated in summary without moments where optimism and grimness create contradictory impulses that force trade-offs. Present in setup and payoff (two gates), functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dice appear in three beats: clutched in pocket (setup), rolled for calculation (middle), picked up and rolled again at closure. The chipped die is named and its wobble noted, but it does not constrain a tactical choice—Elara does not, for example, bet an action on the roll or face a cost when the chip causes an unexpected outcome. The final roll is framed as "joy of the random path" rather than a decision under pressure. Present across all three gates, shapes the ending image, but causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Perpetual motion is named as Elara's goal ("achieve what physics denied: true perpetual motion") and revisited at closure ("In the heart of perpetual motion, she found stillness"). However, the concept operates thematically rather than as an on-page constraint—no mechanism is attempted, no physics problem staged that Elara must work around. It shapes the dominant stake (capture lost opportunity through endless motion) but does not alter tactical options within scenes. Present in setup and payoff; mid-band for thematic use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Balancedly daring" is asserted once in exposition ("calculating each risk... yet embracing the leap when the math demanded it") and mentioned again late ("Her balanced daring had led her here"). No on-page moment shows Elara choosing between caution and leap with visible cost; her ascent and proofs are described in summary. The trait is told rather than dramatized. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The rupture appears at the midpoint ("a crack appeared in the step beneath her") and is revisited at closure ("this rupture that healed rather than harmed"). It triggers the appearance of glowing mathematical symbols and Elara's realization, shaping the turn. However, the rupture is not caused by Elara's action—it simply "appeared"—reducing agency and causal weight. Present in middle and payoff, enables one key turn, but swappability moderate (any breach event could serve).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Mathematical proofs are mentioned in three beats: Elara "intended to use" them (setup), "her proofs were not just scribbles" (middle), and "mathematical symbols glowed" at rupture, then "faded, their purpose served" (closure). Yet no proof is shown, no equation attempted on the page, no mathematical constraint tested. The method is summary-only, not dramatized. Present across gates but ornamental; swappable with "ritual" or "meditation" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The infinite staircase frames every beat, supplies the rupture (crack in step), and is reprised in the final image ("the infinite staircase became her home"). It embodies the "boundless confinement" premise and provides spatial continuity. However, it does not pressure a concrete choice—Elara never decides to stop, turn back, or take a visible risk because of stair geometry. Present in all three gates, shapes tone and closure image, but causal pressure on tactics is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Capturing the texture of a missed opportunity is named in the opening, drives Elara's use of proofs (middle: "isolate the exact point where her past opportunity had slipped away"), and is resolved at closure ("texture... was simply the feel of life itself"). The motivation is consistent but remains abstract—no flashback or triggered memory concretizes what was missed, weakening friction between want and cost. Present in all three gates, shapes the arc, but lacks on-page dramatization of the original loss.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Boundless confinement is named in the opening ("perfect embodiment of boundless confinement") and restated at closure ("her confinement felt boundless in a different way"). The tone—paradoxical freedom within constraint—coheres across the piece and modulates when Elara shifts from frustration to acceptance. Syntax and diction remain elevated and abstract throughout, matching the philosophical register. The tone charges the final image by reweighting the staircase from prison to home. Present in setup and payoff with clear tonal arc; strong thematic integration.</comment>
