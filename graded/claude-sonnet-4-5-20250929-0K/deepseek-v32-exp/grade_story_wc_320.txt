<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority reads as abstract philosophizing rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her "celestial signal interpreter" role is stated but never pressures a difficult choice; she performs a technical task with no visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path. The final "tuning her spirit" and similar phrases rely on therapy-speak metaphor instead of dramatized decision. No credible vulnerability or mistake shapes the arc; she succeeds through insight without struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is functional by ~120 words. The closure unit—discarding assumptions to hear silence—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual only and not dramatized as a foreclosed option or visible trade-off. The piece teaches a lens (accumulative/textural via density and cadence shift), but pressure does not meaningfully tighten; Elara's insight arrives without prior failed attempts or a reversal that narrows options. The ending reconfigures her perception, but no on-page choice or renunciation makes a before/after legible with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The radio tower city and gorge are vivid and establish a distinct micro-world. The "shard of hush" at the dish's focal point constrains the tuning attempt (one beat), and the hollywood star fragment warms in her hand, charging the moment. The lunar perigee frames urgency but does not alter her physical access or immediate tactics on the page. Sensory detail is purposeful, though the setting functions more as backdrop than as a resource that pressures choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking a celestial signal—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. Elara's shift from seeking amplification to attenuation is told in summary ("years of training and old charts had failed her") rather than dramatized through on-page attempts that narrow options. The resolution arrives via insight without a prior visible failure or trade-off; no live cost or foreclosed path charges the final image. Coincidence does not resolve, but protagonist agency is conceptual rather than enacted under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme—"find the beginning in every ending"—is stated repeatedly rather than earned through dramatized particulars. The shard of hush and hollywood star fragment are given symbolic weight via direct assertion ("not merely quiet; it was an active void," "once a token of earthly fame, was now a celestial key"), but their thematic function is told, not shown through constrained choice. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "To find the beginning in every ending was not a vague hope, but a practical method for navigating existence," replacing scene pressure with thematic summary and triggering the stated penalty (−0.6 to −0.8).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register ("serenely electric," "shard of hush") that remains legible, though diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the fantasy of the cosmos now a usable truth") during peak beats. Elara's perceptual signature—filtering the world through celestial metaphor—is present but not varied under pressure. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is controlled, but the prose does not modulate rhythm or syntax to reflect urgency at the climactic tuning moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The piece exhibits pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence. Adjacent sentences restate content without added pressure: "The shard of hush had not created silence; it had revealed the silence that was always there" immediately follows the prior image. Runs of identical sentence stems appear in the final third ("The hollywood star fragment... The shard of hush... By discarding assumptions... During lunar perigee... To find the beginning..."), creating mechanical rhythm (−0.6 for template cadence). Stock metaphors ("blank canvas upon which beginnings were painted") and elevated diction that exceeds the moment's needs ("perpetual rebirth woven into the fabric of space") dull immediacy in peak beats (−0.4 for register drift and stock phrasing). Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the stated disqualification from 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Total deduction: baseline −1.0 in Q7, with cross-category cap applied.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—tuning for silence rather than signal—offers a fresh angle, but the execution relies on prompt-language echoes ("serenely electric," "fantasy practicality," "shard of hush") that read as checklist fulfillment rather than organic synthesis. The insight arrives without prior grounding in Elara's failed attempts; the transformation is asserted rather than earned in hindsight. The ending's explicit thematic summary ("This was the essence of fantasy practicality: marrying the wondrous with the workable") replaces image with meta-commentary, signaling authorial intrusion. The piece avoids bold risk in structure or perspective, favoring safe median choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as celestial signal interpreter frames the story, satisfying setup. She makes one key choice—tuning for attenuation instead of amplification—but the choice is summarized rather than dramatized across distinct beats, and no visible cost or foreclosed path results. She is more observer than agent; the insight arrives without prior on-page struggle or failed attempt. Swappable: the role could be "signal analyst" or "frequency decoder" with minor edits. Caps: functional but replaceable, one beat involvement, summary-only (−0.8), late middle emergence of key choice (−0.3). Band guidance places this at 3.5–4.0; round down to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The hollywood star fragment appears in three beats: Elara carries it in her pocket (setup), it grows warm during tuning (middle), and cools again at the end (closure participation). However, its function is ornamental; the warmth does not alter her tactics or enable a choice under pressure, and it could be replaced with any symbolic object without structural impact. Signals: three beats (+1.4), setup (+0.5), closure mention (+0.3). Frictions: ornamental use (−0.8), swappable (−0.6), no causal pressure. Band guidance: 4.0–4.5; round down to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The shard of hush is introduced at ~40%, placed at the dish's focal point, and enables the attenuation that reveals the signal. It constrains one key beat (the tuning) with specificity: "seemed to absorb all sound around it... an active void." The object returns in the final paragraph with reweighted meaning ("a reminder that power often lies in restraint"), satisfying lyric reprise. Signals: setup (~40% mark, −0.3), one beat (+0.4), causal pressure in one beat (+0.8), closure linkage via charged reprise (+0.7), specificity (+0.5). Frictions: late first appearance (−0.4), single-beat involvement limits causal depth. Band guidance: 5.5–6.3 for lyric reprise; settle at 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" is used four times as a descriptive label for atmosphere and the shard, but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It reads as tonal decoration without causal work. Signals: setup (label present early, +0.3). Frictions: label-only trait (−0.3), ornamental (−0.8), swappable with "charged quiet" or similar (−0.6). Band guidance: ornamental, ≤3.0; settle at 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Tune" anchors the story's dominant action, appearing in setup ("needed to tune the array"), middle attempts ("began to tune the dials"), and closure ("tuned not just a machine, but her perception"). The action drives two distinct beats: the shift from amplification to attenuation, and the final successful alignment. However, the tuning is told in summary rather than enacted step-by-step with visible cost at each stage. Signals: setup (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0). Frictions: summary-only in key moments (−0.5), could be "adjust" or "align" with edits (−0.4). Band guidance: two beats and closure, moderate causal work; settle at 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The method "by discarding assumptions" is stated explicitly at ~50% ("The method, she realized, was by discarding assumptions") and shapes the tuning tactic: seeking silence instead of loudness. It appears again in closure ("By discarding assumptions, she had tuned not just a machine, but her perception"). However, prior assumptions are not dramatized as live constraints that fail on the page; the method is told rather than shown through a sequence of failed attempts. Signals: middle introduction (+0.4), shapes one tactic (+0.8), closure linkage (+0.9). Frictions: late first mention (−0.4), summary-only (−0.6), could be "changing approach" (−0.5). Band guidance: one beat involvement, closure mention; settle at 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city over a gorge is established in the opening line and frames the entire scene. The "rusted grating," "creaking structures," and "skeletal towers" create spatial pressure and reflect the theme of failure-as-adaptation. The gorge below is reprised at closure ("felt the gorge below not as an abyss, but as a cradle"), reweighting the setting's meaning. However, the towers do not supply a resource or constraint that alters Elara's tactics during the tuning; they function primarily as atmospheric backdrop. Signals: setup (+0.8), closure reprise that reweights (+1.0), specificity (+0.5). Frictions: postcard description in middle beats (−0.5), no tactical constraint (−0.6). Band guidance: early setup and charged reprise allow 5.5–6.3; settle at 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is mentioned in the opening ("Tonight was lunar perigee") and closing ("The lunar perigee waned"), framing urgency. The text states "its gravitational pull a tangible force on the creaking structures" and "this tight orbital embrace," but the timeframe does not tighten Elara's decisions on the page; no live clock or deadline alters her moves. The perigee is told as context rather than shown as a constraint. Signals: setup (+0.6), closure mention (+0.3). Frictions: vague urgency without live countdown (−0.6), swappable with "solstice" or "eclipse" (−0.5), ornamental framing (−0.5). Band guidance: functional framing, no tactical pressure; settle at 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the beginning in every ending" is stated in paragraph one and repeated at closure. It frames Elara's quest but is not dramatized as a conflicted desire under pressure; no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost or fear shapes a choice. The motivation is told as philosophy rather than tested through a difficult trade-off. Signals: setup (+0.6), closure linkage (+0.7). Frictions: told-only, no friction (−0.9), no visible cost or conflicted choice (−0.7), swappable with "seek renewal" (−0.5). Band guidance: told motivation without dramatized conflict; settle at 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" is not explicitly named until the final third ("This was the essence of fantasy practicality"), but the tone—grounding cosmic wonder in technical problem-solving—is present from the opening. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly: the opening's lyric register ("silent antennas swaying gently") shifts to procedural detail ("tune the dials... seeking the empty channel") and back to reflection at closure. However, the tone does not charge the final image with visible pressure; it remains static rather than intensifying. Signals: implicit setup (+0.5), coherent across beats (+0.6), closure mention (+0.5). Frictions: label arrives late (−0.3), static mood without sharp modulation (−0.4), explicit thematic claim in final third (−0.3). Band guidance: coherent but static; settle at 5.4.</comment>
