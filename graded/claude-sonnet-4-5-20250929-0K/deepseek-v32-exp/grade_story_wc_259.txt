<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "anguished joy" is asserted via therapy-speak labels ("transcendent joy," "anguished joy") rather than embodied through action or contradictory micro-choices. The final collapse reads as externalized exhaustion without visible internal cost foreclosing a path. No genuine flawed decision or renunciation emerges on the page; she succeeds without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Causal (purification ritual) but relies on Accumulative phrasing ("steadily unpredictable," lyric repetition) without teaching a pattern or achieving a decisive tightening. Closure reads as summary ("she had sacrificed her innocence") rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The "atoms of nostalgia" purification is told in abstract steps without narrowing options or revealing a visible price at the moment of success. Orientation is present early, waiving that penalty, but the ending lacks a legible closure unit under any single lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda and archive are anchored early with vivid visual detail. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Elara's "random movements" occur in spatial abstraction without props, distances, or physical obstacles. The setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure, keeping the score mid-band despite atmospheric competence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (purify atoms to heal sorrows) is declared but never tested by a live on-page trade-off. The "steadily unpredictable" atoms are asserted as obstacles yet never force a visible reversal or tactic shift. The ritual succeeds without dramatized failure, adaptation, or cost—collapsing exhausted is a physical consequence, not a narrowing of options. No agency-driven escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Theme (forbidden knowledge, innocence lost) is stated overtly in multiple lines ("the end of innocence," "forbidden knowledge now a part of her") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The atoms of nostalgia concept remains abstract; no specific memory fragment alters her stance. The final image offers a summary moral ("some truths are bittersweet") instead of a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is thin; most meaning is declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable and the saffron-veil detail offers perceptual color. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("irreducible essence of memory," "transcendent joy") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Sentence stems repeat ("She felt," "She believed," "She knew") across beats without variation. Psychic distance remains uniform under pressure when compression or perceptual narrowing would sharpen voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence ("She felt," "The atoms," "Elara [verb]") across adjacent lines create scaffold drag. Key beats are summarized ("Purification required her to separate the pain from the pleasure") rather than shown through concrete action. Stock metaphors ("whisper from lost ages," "weight of centuries") and near-synonym churn ("anguished joy" appears three times) dull momentum. Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats reduce immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disqualifying 9+ globally and applying −1.4 within Q7 for spread and closure contamination.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise (historian purifies emotional atoms via erratic ritual) blends fantasy-of-manners tropes without a fresh angle. "Atoms of nostalgia" remains a label rather than a dramatized mechanic with specific rules or trade-offs. The arc is template: scholar seeks forbidden knowledge, performs ritual, succeeds, reflects on cost. No turn or moment feels specific to this exact combination; swapping "atoms" for any mystical substance would leave the emotional arc unchanged. Derivative premise penalty applied.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her choices are procedural (approaching, chanting, moving erratically) rather than decisive. The purification succeeds without a visible on-page reversal driven by her agency. She does not alter tactics or sacrifice a live option; the ritual is summarized as complete. Present in closure but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda appears in the opening and closing paragraphs with atmospheric description. It is named as "the instrument through which the atoms could be channeled" but never handled, adjusted, or used in a beat that narrows options. Static backdrop in two touches; no evolving use or charged reprise that reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Atoms of nostalgia are the stated goal and purification target, shaping the dominant stake. However, their behavior is asserted ("steadily unpredictable") rather than demonstrated through a failed attempt or visible constraint. They appear in three beats (stirring, flooding memories, swirling purified) but remain abstract; no specific atom-driven cost alters Elara's tactics. Present across the arc but not causally active in a turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" is a label mentioned twice without on-page demonstration. The atoms do not shift behavior mid-ritual to force an adaptation. No visible trade-off or cost tied to unpredictability; the process succeeds as planned. Ornamental trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Purification is the central action, structuring the middle and closure. However, the mechanics are told in summary ("filtering out the anguish while preserving the joy") rather than shown through a specific failed step or choice. The action shapes the arc but is not dramatized in beats with visible cost, making it swappable with any ritual framework. One strong gate (closure) but weak middle development.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"By avoiding patterns" is signaled in one line ("her steps and gestures deliberately erratic") and mentioned again in "by avoiding patterns, she guided the atoms." The method is stated but never tested—no moment where a near-repetition threatens to corrupt the process. Present but not causally active in a beat with consequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is named early and provides atmospheric backdrop. It does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters Elara's tactics; the ritual could occur in any vast, ancient hall. Present in opening and closing with visual detail but no causal pressure on choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across the end of innocence" is a thematic label repeated in opening, middle, and closing paragraphs. The timeframe is not tracked as a tightening constraint; no clock pressure shapes decisions. The shift from innocence to knowledge is asserted in reflection rather than demonstrated through a before/after choice with visible cost. Present as theme but not as dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>To pursue forbidden knowledge is stated as Elara's motivation and drives the inciting journey. However, it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or on-page friction; she never hesitates, doubts mid-ritual, or pays a visible relational or opportunity cost. Desire is told rather than tested. Present across setup and closure but lacks beat-level conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Anguished joy is declared in two lines ("anguished joy," "tears traced paths down her cheeks, yet she smiled") but the tone does not modulate with pressure. Emotional texture remains uniform—solemn, elevated—across the arc. The final image recycles the phrase without reweighting it through a specific cost or shift. Static mood rather than tone that charges closure.</comment>
