<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but never tested by internal conflict or competing desires. She moves through beats without embodied emotion—"felt despair," "smiled," "felt peace"—all label-only states. The locust shell discovery triggers a plan without dramatized hesitation or cost. The statues' awakening unfolds as convenient external response rather than protagonist struggle with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words; who/where/when remain vague until "central clearing." The closure—crystal dies, orchard renews—occurs as external spectacle without on-page cost to Elara; she plays, things happen, she smiles. Causality is assertion-driven: "the method of signaling through heart rhythms" appears as label without prior setup or mechanical grounding. The inferred lens (Causal) collapses when the Warden's transformation and crystal's death are triggered by music with no visible price paid by the protagonist.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sky-bridge and orchard are sketched with vivid phrases—"crystalline bridge," "tarnished wonder," "fruit with a tarnished wonder, glowing dimly"—but remain postcard backdrops. The bridge's arches "spanning the groves below like frozen music" is a strong image, yet the setting does not constrain Elara's choices or shape tactics. The locust shell caught in the railing provides one micro-setting touch that seeds the plan, lifting the score slightly above pure ornamentation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reawaken beauty—is signaled early but never tightens through protagonist cost or tactical adjustment. Elara descends, plays, and the statues respond; no reversal forces her to adapt or forfeit. The "gap between knowing and understanding" is recited but never dramatized as a lived constraint. The crystal's death is spectacle without visible price: she simply "poured her soul" (label-only intensity) and the mechanical order collapses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Breaking free," "gap between knowing and understanding," "heart rhythms," "uproot," "tarnished wonder," and "resonantly soft" are recycled as prompt labels rather than earned through scene particulars. The locust shell crumbles "its purpose complete" in a mechanical thematic payoff. The final paragraph summarizes theme ("true understanding had come…") instead of trusting the image. One small credit: the locust shell's early-to-final reprise attempts resonance, though the explicit moralizing in the closing lines undercuts it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction oscillates between lyric elevation ("resonantly soft melodies," "suspended moment") and template phrasing ("poured her soul," "light with freedom"). Interiority relies on filter verbs and summary—"she felt despair," "she recalled legends"—rather than immediate perception. Dialogue is absent. The perceptual signature is generic; Elara's noticing does not carry character-specific bias or idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "breaking free from old constraints" / "break free fully" / "breaking free from the mechanical will" / "testament to breaking free." Template cadence: "The orchard breathed… the trees straightened… the fruit brightened." Stock metaphors: "poured her soul," "heart light with freedom." Figurative density in closure beats—"sky-bridge stood as a testament," "seeds of beauty anew"—muddies rather than sharpens. Repeated phrase stems and synonym churn across adjacent lines trigger cumulative penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—musician vs. mechanical order—follows a familiar template without transformation. "Signaling through heart rhythms" is named but never made specific; "resonantly soft" music does the work without defined constraint. The locust shell as symbol of transformation is convenient rather than inevitable. Turns arise from declared effects ("the heart rhythm amplified") rather than grounded choice. No bold risk elevates the material beyond its median genre execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's role is present across the arc: she descends, plays, and the statues respond. Setup is clear by the opening; development includes the decision to play heartbeat rhythm; closure shows her lowering the violin. However, her choices do not meaningfully narrow options or create visible cost—statues awaken as external response, not earned through protagonist sacrifice. Causal pressure is weak; the element is functional but her agency does not drive key reversals with felt tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The locust shell appears early (caught in railing), returns at the clearing ("clutched… drawing courage"), and crumbles at closure ("purpose complete"). Three-beat presence across setup/development/payoff. However, its use is symbolic convenience rather than tactical constraint: it inspires a plan but does not enable or block an action with cost. The "relic of transformation" label does thematic work without altering on-page options. Lyric reprise with modest causal role places it mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Breaking free" is named repeatedly—"breaking free from old constraints," "break free fully," "breaking free from the mechanical will," "testament to breaking free"—but functions as theme label rather than on-page constraint. The concept shapes the declared stakes (liberate the orchard) and the Warden "began to uproot its own feet," but the protagonist does not face a cost tied to this concept. Present in setup (motivation), middle (Warden's shift), and closure (statues unbound), earning all three gates, yet causal pressure remains assertion-based.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" is used as adjective for Elara's music in the opening, the vibrations mid-scene, and "resonantly soft peace" at closure. Label-only presence without dramatized constraint: the music's softness does not force a tactical tradeoff (e.g., limited range, risk of being unheard). No beat shows the attribute enabling or blocking an action with visible cost. Closure participation is ornamental—mentioned in final-paragraph summary rather than charged in the decisive image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Uproot" appears in the plan ("uproot the control"), the Warden's action ("uproot its own feet from the soil"), the other statues ("uprooting themselves"), and closure ("uprooted the old order"). Setup and development are clear; the Warden's physical uprooting provides the story's visual climax. However, Elara herself does not perform the uprooting—music triggers it—so protagonist agency is indirect. The action defines the key reversal (statues breaking free) but swappability is moderate; "break" or "shatter" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Signaling through heart rhythms" is seeded as legend ("recalled legends of signaling through heart rhythms"), used in the central clearing (mimics heartbeat, "the method of signaling through heart rhythms," "heart rhythm amplified"), and echoed at closure ("signal of heart rhythms harmonizing"). All three gates present. Yet the method's mechanics are label-only: how heartbeat vibrations reach stone, why the Warden responds, and what cost the signaling imposes on Elara remain unexplained. Causal pressure is asserted rather than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard and living statues are established early and frame the entire conflict. The statues patrol, track Elara, and the Warden guards the crystal—providing spatial opposition. Development: Elara enters the orchard, reaches the clearing. Closure: statues awaken and gather around her. However, the setting supplies obstacles that dissolve on cue rather than forcing tactical adaptation; Elara does not navigate patrol paths or use orchard features to her advantage. Functional across all three gates but pressure remains static backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"The gap between knowing and understanding" is declared three times: opening ("In the gap between knowing… Elara felt despair"), climax ("in the gap between knowing the risk and understanding the outcome"), and closure ("the gap… finally closed"). Setup and closure gates are met; middle development is weak—no on-page beat shows Elara navigating this gap with a micro-choice that alters tactics. The timeframe is conceptual rather than lived constraint; it does not tighten decisions or impose visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to reawaken beauty in this world" is stated in paragraph three, pursued through the music plan, and fulfilled at closure ("beauty reawakened," "mechanical world had been reenchanted"). All three gates present. However, the desire is told rather than tested: no scene shows Elara weighing beauty against personal cost, safety, or competing need. The orchard's renewal happens as external spectacle without dramatized friction between want and price. Functional but one-dimensional.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Tarnished wonder" appears as orchard descriptor ("fruit with a tarnished wonder"), recurs mid-scene ("tarnished hue"), and at closure ("tarnished wonder… now gleamed"). The tone label is present across beats but does not modulate with pressure—no shift from despair to hope is felt through image or rhythm, only declared. The ending lists renewed beauty ("trees straightened, fruit brightened, whisper of wind") in summary rather than charging a single image with tonal cost. Ornamental recurrence without tonal deepening.</comment>
