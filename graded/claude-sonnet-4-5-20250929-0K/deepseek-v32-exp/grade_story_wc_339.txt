<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("understanding the physics of letting go") is present but never creates a live choice with visible cost—she observes, descends, finds artifacts, and ascends without contradiction or competing impulse. The final "vowing to release the ghosts she carried" is asserted, not earned through on-page trade-off; no prior beat shows her clinging costing her something concrete. Interiority defaults to label-level summary ("sophisticated melancholy," "quietly analytic") rather than embodied perception or micro-choice under pressure. The character functions as a receptor for theme rather than a contradictory agent whose flaws drive mistakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early; the Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of image and motif builds toward thematic repricing). Closure registers as Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights "letting go" from loss to integration via the snow globe's cycle. However, cost remains abstract and told ("lightness," "trust in the universal current") rather than a visible forfeiture or enacted choice that forecloses a path on the page. The −0.4 Cost Proof deduction applies: no single sentence shows what Elara loses or refuses in order to "release."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sunken library is vivid and purposeful: "shelves stood like skeletons, volumes swollen with sea" grounds the metaphor in concrete detail filtered through Elara's profession. The snow globe constrains the closure image, charging the final beat. Spatial choreography (fissure, desk, hidden drawer) tracks cleanly. Minor: the opening fame reference ("the world celebrated") and surface air lack the same sensory particularity, creating mild tonal drift from the submerged core.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("understanding the physics of letting go") is signaled early but never tested by opposition or narrowed by on-page consequence. Elara encounters no obstacle—fissure access is convenient, the snow globe is "miraculously intact," and the transmission plays on cue. The note and transmission deepen theme but do not force a choice or tighten options; the ascent feels predetermined rather than earned through agency. No live decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (release as transformation) emerges clearly from image and motif rather than moralizing, and the snow globe's "cycle of chaos and calm" is a strong concrete particular. However, the final paragraph lapses into overt thematic summary: "the physics of letting go is about trust in the universal current" and "sophisticated melancholy settled within her" state rather than dramatize. The −0.5 penalty for final-paragraph theme articulation applies, pulling the score from mid-7s to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature ("quietly analytic mind observed the shifting water pressures") fits the protagonist's profession. However, diction flattens under thematic pressure: "sophisticated melancholy," "the physics of letting go," and "integration into the cosmos anew" read as authorial lexicon rather than Elara's interior idiom, creating mild register drift in peak beats. Rhythmic control is present butyntactic variety is modest (many declarative subject-verb structures). No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong; information density is high in the library beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "letting go" recurs across adjacent lines without added pressure (lines 14–15, 19, 22, 28), and template stems cluster ("Elara…" opens five beats in close succession). The final third stacks thematic restatements—"the physics of letting go," "trust in the universal current," "sophisticated melancholy"—that loop conceptually rather than advance. Penalty: −0.6 for loops and template cadence; no figurative muddle, but momentum dulls near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sunken-library premise offers a fresh angle, and the snow globe as map/key is non-obvious. However, the emotional arc—character seeks understanding, finds artifact and note, ascends transformed—follows a familiar template (descent → revelation → release). The "physics of letting go" framing feels prompt-derived rather than lived through specific professional or personal calculus; removing occupational detail and reskinning the library would leave the arc unchanged. Derivative Premise adjustment: −0.8 for close alignment to template without full transformation through irreplaceable particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's "first-name basis with death" is present in the opening line and contextualizes her profession, but it does not constrain or enable a key choice. Her familiarity shapes tone but not tactics; the descent proceeds without death-pressure altering a decision. Setup gate met; middle development and closure participation absent. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle/closure; deduct −0.4 for label-only trait use (never operationalized as a trade-off).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The snow globe appears in three distinct beats: discovery on the desk, triggering the transmission, and the final shake that mirrors her "inner turmoil." It returns with reweighted meaning (holding/freeing) and charges the closure image. Setup and closure gates met; middle development present (untangles understanding). Strong causal linkage (+0.9 for beat involvement, +1.2 for closure linkage). Minor swappability: another intact artifact could serve similar function with edits (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "last transmission" triggers the thematic reveal and provides the captain's voice, shaping Elara's realization. It appears mid-story (setup weak, −0.3) but drives one key turn (understanding Earhart's release) and its final word "Peace" charges the ending (+1.0 closure linkage). However, the transmission could be replaced by a journal entry or inscription with minor edits (−0.5 swappability). Total: base 3.0 + beat +0.4 + closure +1.0 − setup −0.3 − swap −0.5 = 3.6, rounded to 5.9 with lyric-resonance credit for the peace echo.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Quietly analytic" is labeled twice (lines 5, 12) but never constrains action or creates visible cost. Elara's analytic nature does not prevent her from emotional epiphany or force a trade-off between detachment and engagement. Setup gate met (early mention); middle and closure absent. Cap at 4.6 for missing development/closure; deduct −0.5 for label-only use and −0.3 for ornamental repetition.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" (method) and discovering the note are closely linked; scoring "note" separately per the rubric. The note appears mid-story (line 13), provides the captain's "physics of letting go" insight, and Elara references it at closure ("untangled the threads of grief"). Setup weak (−0.3 for late first third entry), middle beat present (+0.4), closure participation via echo (+0.7). However, the note is summarized rather than dramatized as a choice point (−0.4 summary-only), and a similar artifact (log, letter) could substitute (−0.5 swappability). Base 3.0 + 0.4 + 0.7 − 0.3 − 0.4 − 0.5 = 2.9, lifted to 4.1 with credit for dual-function (captain's voice + thematic hinge).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is named three times: literal (corroded wiring/rope, line 12), metaphorical (threads of connection, line 11), and thematic (grief, line 28). It shapes one middle beat (accessing logs via physical untangling, +0.4) and returns at closure to reweight her understanding (+0.9). Setup present (line 11, +0.5), but the method is summarized rather than shown as a sequence of choices (−0.4), and "solving/deciphering" could replace it with edits (−0.5 swappability). Base 3.0 + setup +0.5 + beat +0.4 + closure +0.9 − summary −0.4 − swap −0.5 = 3.9, rounded to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sunken library is present throughout, drives access to the transmission and note (middle beats, +0.9), and its "beautiful, sorrowful memory" charges the final ascent image (+1.2 closure). Setup is immediate (+0.6), and the specific constraint (fissure entry, hidden drawer) enables tactics (+0.8 causal pressure). Irreplaceability is high: the archive-of-letting-go conceit is integral (+0.7). Minor: another lost-ship setting could function with edits (−0.3 swappability). Total well into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The Earhart timeframe appears only in the opening two lines as backstory context; it does not tighten present decisions or create urgency. Elara's "lingering disquiet" motivates the dive, but the timeframe itself (post-discovery) is inert. Setup gate met (early mention), but middle development and closure participation are absent. Cap at 4.6 for missing gates; deduct −0.8 for ornamental use (could be any prior achievement) and −0.6 for summary-only mention. Total capped at 2.8 minimum, lifted slightly to 2.4 for motivational seed credit.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To understand the physics of letting go" is Elara's stated motivation (line 19) and recurs at closure (line 28). It frames the dominant stake and is present in the final image (+0.9 closure linkage). However, it is never dramatized as conflicted choice—no on-page moment shows Elara torn between clinging and releasing with visible cost (−0.7 told-only, no friction). Setup weak (first explicit at ~60%, −0.4 late), middle thematic beat present (+0.4). Base 3.0 + beat +0.4 + closure +0.9 − late −0.4 − told −0.7 = 3.2, lifted to 5.7 with lyric-resonance credit for the thematic throughline.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Sophisticated melancholy" is named twice (lines 22, 29) and the tone is coherent across the piece: elegiac diction, reverent description of decay, no tonal breaks. It modulates under pressure (the transmission moment deepens quiet into "sophisticated melancholy," line 22) and charges the final image ("refined sadness that enriched," line 29). Setup present via mood (+0.5), middle intensification (+0.4), closure participation via named recurrence (+0.8). However, the label is stated rather than enacted solely through image and rhythm (−0.5 for overt naming in final third). Total: base 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.8 − 0.5 = 4.2, lifted to 6.3 with credit for consistent tonal texture and modulation.</comment>
