<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly established—preserve forgotten names—but her interior life remains largely one-note reverence without contradictory impulses. The "foxglove regret" label recurs without embodied tension or micro-choices that reveal competing values. Her actions follow a gently systematic path with no visible struggle or genuine flaws that complicate the resolution; the crack is mended through discovery and application without cost to her person or stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes who, where, and when early enough (opal library, Elara, caretaker ritual). Causality is mostly clean: crack threatens echoes → search for tablet → song heals chime. However, the closure lacks felt cost; Elara's "foxglove regret" is stated but not dramatically altered or deepened by the success. The ending restates her vigil without a decisive change in her stance or a visible price paid, landing as summary rather than a moment that reweights prior material. Lens reads Causal with a weak RR attempt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The opal library, glass orchids, and wind chime are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (translucent petals, shifting light, frozen milk clouds). Spatial choreography is clear through the ascent and descent. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in a meaningful way—Elara's path is determined by knowledge (the tablet) rather than by spatial or material friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the sound of forgotten names—is signaled early and the crack introduces urgency. The search for the tablet provides a single tightening, but the resolution is frictionless: she finds "Aria's Farewell," holds it aloft, and the crack seals itself. No trade-off, loss, or visible price alters her tactics or forecloses a path. The ending returns to her vigil with summary language rather than a moment of transformed pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of preservation and loss is coherent but remains abstract. "Museum of extinct feelings" and "deserted marvels" are evocative labels that recur without shifting meaning through action. The ending offers no non-literal answer to the central question; instead, it repeats the initial premise ("foxglove regret," "timeless vigil") without reweighting prior material or introducing conceptual friction. The tablet glows and sings, but the mechanics feel ornamental rather than thematically earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, though occasionally drifts into abstract register ("vesper's longing," "axiom's joy") that reads more like atmospheric catalog than character-specific perception. No dialogue is present. The voice is controlled but not distinctly particular to Elara's lived experience; it could belong to any caretaker of wonders.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is mostly clear, but several artifacts drag momentum. "Foxglove regret" is repeated three times with identical phrasing and no evolving meaning. The phrase "museum of extinct feelings" and "deserted marvels" loop across the text as labels rather than active images. Template cadence appears in the tablet-search sequence: "She moved with a gently systematic precision, scanning rows…After what felt like an age, she found it." The final paragraph summarizes rather than propels, restating the opening vigil without fresh pressure. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and label-stack; −0.3 for template cadence in non-closure beat; total −0.9 within Q7 per artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—floating library of extinct emotions, caretaker, magical wind chime—assembles familiar fantasy tropes without a fresh synthesis. The crack-and-song-cure follows a predictable path with no turn that reinterprets the material. Emotional specificity is low; "foxglove regret" and "forgotten names" remain abstractions. The transformation test fails: swap "opal library" for any other magical repository and the arc remains unchanged. No bold risk or non-obvious angle distinguishes the piece from template high-fantasy caretaker tales.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her goal drives the search. She makes one key decision—to descend and search for the tablet—but the choice is obvious and uncontested. No visible cost or trade-off attaches to her actions; she succeeds without friction. She is the protagonist but functions more as a conduit than as an agent whose choices reshape stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo tube is introduced early, examined in the spire, and healed at closure. It appears in at least three distinct beats and its repair is the story's focal event. However, its properties are generic (a crack that threatens echoes) and the healing occurs passively—the song does the work. The object could be swapped for any magical artifact in need of restoration with minor edits. Present across beats and closure-linked, but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" is named twice but functions as thematic backdrop rather than an on-page force. It does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics; the library is described as abandoned, yet no isolation cost or encounter with absence shapes the plot. The concept echoes in atmosphere but does not drive a turn or closure moment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is stated early and appears again in the tablet-search paragraph ("gently systematic precision"). However, it describes method rather than imposing a visible trade-off or cost. No moment shows this trait constraining an impulse or enabling a specific tactic that another approach would miss. It is present as a label, not as a lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Light" appears in two forms: Elara must "light the way toward a solution" (metaphorical spark) and the tablet glows with "soft, internal light" that heals the crack. The second instance drives the closure beat and is causally necessary. However, the metaphorical "light" in paragraph two is ornamental, and the tablet's glow could function via sound alone with minimal rewrite. Strong closure participation but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The method—"echo of a long-forgotten song"—is foreshadowed ("old tale stating that the chime's fracture could be mended only by the same forgotten song") and enacted at closure when the tablet emits the melody that seals the crack. It appears in setup and payoff, driving the resolution. No middle beat tests or complicates the method; the song works on first use without cost or friction, lowering necessity slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The opal library is vividly described and provides the tablet archive that supplies the solution. The ascent to the spire and descent to the archives structure the sequence. However, the setting does not impose physical constraint or resource scarcity that alters Elara's tactics; she moves freely and finds what she seeks. The library is essential as a repository but does not pressure choices in the moment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" names the setting but does not function as a timeframe. No clock, deadline, or duration shapes Elara's decisions. The text notes "what felt like an age" but this is vague interiority, not a tightening pressure. Time is ornamental; removing it would not alter the plot.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to preserve the sound of forgotten names"—is stated early and drives her goal. The crack threatens this preservation, making the motive causally relevant. However, the motivation is told and repeated rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. She acts on duty without friction between desire and price, lowering the score from high integration to solid middle ground.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret" is named three times with identical phrasing. It colors Elara's interiority but does not modulate with pressure or evolve through the turns. The tone is static—bittersweet throughout—and the final paragraph restates it without charging the closure image with a new weight. Present but ornamental, not integrated into the emotional arc.</comment>
