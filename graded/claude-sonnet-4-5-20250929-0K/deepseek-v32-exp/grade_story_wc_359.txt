<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "certify wonder as essential" remains abstract throughout; her choices are ceremonial rather than conflicted. Synesthesia is label-only—colors and textures are declared but never constrain a beat or reveal internal contradiction. The climactic bell-ringing unfolds without struggle, cost, or renunciation; the amber simply dissolves on cue. No embodied emotion or micro-choice under pressure earns the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural intended, but the piece never teaches its pattern or imposes cost. The "unfettering" happens because the aurora appears and the bells are rung—coincidence resolves rather than complicates. The parallel sculptor's chisel is pure simultaneity without causal linkage or impact on Elara's options. Closure is a declared success ("wonder was no longer a hidden treasure") with no visible forfeiture or reweighted stake; RR/CR requires undeniable cost, which is absent here.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ice cavern anchors early and sensory details (refracted light, natural ice window) are vivid. However, the space never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Elara positions herself beneath the window without friction. The amber music sheet and bells float as props rather than tools with mechanical consequence. Atmosphere is thickly described but passive—no object or environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("unfetter wonder") is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or trade-off narrows Elara's options; she waits for the aurora, rings bells, and succeeds without complication. The sculptor's chisel creates no friction for Elara—it is parallel decoration. Agency is ceremonial performance, not choice with cost; the ending declares triumph without on-page price or forfeited path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Wonder as essential" is asserted in exposition and again at closure without emergent particulars. The amber music sheet and aurora are symbolic conveniences introduced to illustrate theme rather than complicate it. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "wonder was no longer a hidden treasure but a living, essential force"—theme summary replacing scene pressure. No counter-reading or ambiguity; the piece toggles between silence and song without friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and no head-hopping. Lexicon is elevated throughout ("oscillating repose," "sculpted hush"), consistent but occasionally drifts into prompt-echo rather than character-specific perception. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. The perceptual signature (synesthesia) is claimed but not enacted through micro-choices or filtered detail that would distinguish Elara's noticing under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "sculpted hush" appears seven times with decorative variation; "unfetter" and synonyms recur without new pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "The sculpted hush... / Elara knew... / The amber music sheet... / She rang... / The sculpted hush... / And so, Elara..." Stock metaphors (rainbow imprisoned, river of audible color) and elevated diction ("prism-song," "oscillating repose") are stacked without embodied action. Density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise (synesthetic musician frees trapped music via aurora) is a familiar magical-realism template. The parallel sculptor chisel is a forced symbolic gesture without narrative function. Execution is safe: no risk in choice architecture, no fresh moral calculus, no surprising embodiment of synesthesia that would make removal of the premise break the arc. The ending delivers the promise without complication—transformation test fails.</comment>
