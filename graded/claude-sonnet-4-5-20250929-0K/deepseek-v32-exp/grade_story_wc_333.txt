<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elian remains a cipher throughout—motivation is stated ("to free an idea trapped behind fear") but never internalized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The "unassumingly bold" trait is label-only; no on-page moment shows him negotiating risk versus caution with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("improbable longing," "pure, unshackled truth") rather than embodied sensation or character-particular thought. No meaningful change occurs; he walks away unchanged, already "turning toward the next hidden prison."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is withheld past 120 words (−0.4). The closure unit—"idea freed, now spreading its wings"—lands as summary assertion rather than on-page decisive change or felt cost; the lock of hair becomes "inert" off-stage, and Elian's internal state is unchanged. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or density break reweights the stake at closure. The "wave of disorientation" and archway beat offer potential escalation, yet the resolution ("whispered words of release") bypasses dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "shadowed nexus under starlight" anchors place, and sensory fragments (shadows shifting, starlight piercing) recur. However, the environment does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The lock of hair and archway function as props in sequence but lack micro-setting pressure. No body, tool, or recurring object charges the final image, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (free the idea) is declared early, but escalation is thin: the "wave of disorientation" could narrow options, yet Elian "held fast" without visible trade-off or cost. The resolution—"whispered words of release"—arrives without a prior tightening that foreclosed a live option. Coincidence (starlight hint, hidden keyhole) complicates setup but agency at closure is minimal; no felt price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (ideas versus fear, liberation) emerges from events, but the final image—"idea he freed began to grow, spreading its wings"—delivers a stated moral rather than resonant particulars. Motifs (lock of hair, first star, shadows) recur but do not constrain choice or charge the closure with non-literal weight. The protagonist's arc is asserted ("improbable longing") rather than dramatized through contradictory choices, and the ending philosophizes ("legacy was not in locks opened, but in ideas set free") instead of trusting scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable, and diction ("enveloped secrets," "shapeless sentinels") maintains a lyric register. However, perceptual signature is generic—Elian's way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. Sentence openings recycle stems ("He knew," "He felt," "He walked"), and peak beats rely on filter verbs ("felt a pull," "felt a surge") that dull immediacy. Psychic distance remains constant without purposeful modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "enveloped secrets" appears four times with synonym churn ("coiled like serpents," "bonds loosened," "seemed to sigh"), and multiple sentences restate Elian's longing without added pressure (−0.6). Template cadence runs across the middle third ("His heart held," "His story was," "His legacy was") flatten rhythm (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("ideas...spreading its wings," "secrets coiled like serpents") and elevated diction ("improbable longing," "hush of cosmic possibility") clash with the task-driven locksmith frame, creating register drift (−0.4). Information density is low; several beats narrate micro-movements (tracing ribbon, inserting lock) without advancing goal or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Core premise—metaphysical locksmith frees abstract idea—leans on familiar "liberator of potential" and "artist versus fear" templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8). The lock-of-hair mechanism and starlight hint remain ornamental rather than grounded in world logic. Prose gestures at profundity ("across the hush of cosmic possibility") but offers no fresh inflection or earned reversal; emotional arc could transfer unchanged to another mystic-craftsperson frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and performs the climactic insertion/release action, but his choices are reactive (awaits star, traces ribbon, inserts lock) rather than creating key turns. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is thin—no on-page decision that narrows options or faces competing costs. Swappable with a generic "solver" archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lock of hair tied with ribbon appears in setup (given by traveler), mid-beat (Elian traces it for courage), and climax (inserted into keyhole), satisfying all three gates. It enables the final action and becomes "inert" at closure, signaling cost. However, its unique properties (why hair, why this ribbon) are not irreplaceable—any symbolic token could serve the same function with minor edits. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is present but mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Enveloped secrets" are mentioned throughout but function as thematic label rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page. The protagonist's goal is to "free an idea," yet the mechanics of how secrets constrain or guard that idea remain abstract. No on-page moment shows Elian navigating or negotiating the "enveloped" quality; it decorates description ("secrets coiled," "bonds loosened") without altering options. Present in setup and payoff, absent from middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Unassumingly bold" is asserted twice ("His demeanor was unassumingly bold"; "Unassumingly bold, he traced the ribbon") but never dramatized through a choice that trades caution for risk with visible cost. The trait does not constrain or enable a specific action—Elian's approach reads as generic determination. Label-only use; no on-page tradeoff or escalation tied to this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Disorient" governs the climactic beat: "A wave of disorientation swept over Elian, twisting his senses." This action is signaled (he plans to "disorient the guardians of fear") and enacted, providing one major turn. However, the resolution bypasses the disorientation's cost—Elian "held fast" and whispers release without visible struggle or price paid. Present in setup (goal stated), middle (enacted), and payoff (overcome), but swappable with another obstacle type. Causal role is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The hint from the first star—"Seek the echo where silence screams"—is given and guides Elian to the archway, satisfying setup and middle development. However, the mechanics are thin: the hint points rather than constrains attempts or shapes tactical choices with cost. It arrives passively (he awaits the star) and the cryptic phrasing does not reappear or reweight at closure. Functional but replaceable with any clue device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Shadowed nexus under starlight" anchors place in setup and recurs through the piece ("the nexus itself seemed to breathe," "aftermath, the shadowed nexus felt lighter"). It provides atmosphere and houses the archway, satisfying setup, middle presence, and payoff. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elian's actions would proceed identically in any mystical workspace. Postcard description rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across the hush of cosmic possibility" recurs as a phrase and frames the piece's temporal span ("Each night," "as twilight deepened," "Under the canopy of stars"). Time is vague and elastic—no live clock tightens decisions. The "hush" functions as tone/atmosphere rather than a constraint on tactics. Present in setup and payoff as a lyric anchor, but does not shape middle escalation or cost. Swappable with "in the timeless moment" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Motivation—"to free an idea trapped behind fear"—is stated early and drives Elian's goal throughout, satisfying setup and payoff. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted or tested: no on-page moment shows friction between his desire and a competing cost or doubt. The motivation is told-only rather than embodied in micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Middle development is thin; the goal remains static and abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Improbable longing" is named four times and colors the piece's register with elevated, yearning diction ("pure, unshackled truth," "timeless ache for the possibilities"). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly at closure (longing persists, now directed toward "the next hidden prison"). However, it remains one static mood rather than charging the final image with new pressure or reweighting prior material. Lyric consistency is present; purposeful shift is not.</comment>
