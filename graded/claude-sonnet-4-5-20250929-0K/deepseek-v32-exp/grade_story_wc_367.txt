<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael remains opaque throughout; his motivation is declared ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The "laughing storm herald" descriptor is recycled without revealing character-specific perceptual filters or micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is absent—he moves through an "otherworldly routine" with robotic precision, no friction between wants and costs. The ending offers no earned change or credible endurance; he simply completes the task as foretold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No legible closure: the piece loops through atmospheric description without a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that makes before/after visible with cost. Kael begins at the lighthouse, performs his routine, and ends having performed it; nothing forecloses a path or reweights options. The "accidentally prophetic visions" arrive without altering his stance or tactics. Orientation is present (who/where/when by ~120 words), but causality is non-existent—each paragraph restates the same thematic claim in synonym loops rather than advancing pressure. Drive lens ambiguity persists: is this causal, accumulative, or situational? The ending cannot answer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and glass wick anchor setting early and recur, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image—Kael manipulates the wick without friction or cost. Spatial choreography inside the tower is vague (spiral stairs, chamber, lenses float without clear layout). The post-newspaper timeframe is mentioned once and never pressures tactics. Sensory detail skews visual and generic ("green stone glowing," "verdant patterns") without POV filter or urgency modulation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows"—is declared but never tested; no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. Kael adjusts lenses and "steers" light in a series of interchangeable moves with no escalation or visible cost. The storm arrives on schedule, the visions appear, and he completes the task as if reading a checklist. No agency, no price, no tightening—just ornamental atmosphere cycling through the same thematic claim.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is over-articulated in nearly every paragraph: "ancient shadows," "accidentally prophetic," "shadowed elation," "destruction precedes creation." No concrete particular constrains the moralizing. The glass wick and lighthouse could be swapped for any mystical apparatus without altering the thematic sermon. The ending ("the world felt poised on the edge of something new") summarizes rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is absent; every symbol shouts its meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable, but the voice is generic literary-fantasy register without perceptual signature—Kael notices in the same elevated diction whether adjusting lenses or recalling stories. Phrase recycling flattens texture: "otherworldly routine" (3×), "ancient shadows" (5×), "accidentally prophetic" (3×), "shadowed elation" (3×), "through total internal reflection" (4×). No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance never modulates; peak moments ("the storm reached its peak") sound identical to transit beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence across most paragraphs: adjacent lines restate "the light functions as metaphor/prophecy/transformation" without added pressure. Sentence stems repeat mechanically ("Kael [verb]," "The glass wick [verb]," "This was..."). Stock metaphors cluster without tension ("spear of emerald," "dance of precision," "bridge the mundane and mystical"). Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (storm arrival, vision sequence) without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring rather than sharpening the moment. Information density is low; most lines do one job poorly. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "saw," "knew") dull immediacy in the vision sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse-keeper mystic performing a symbolic ritual is a familiar template executed without fresh inflection. "Accidentally prophetic visions," "ancient shadows," and "shape a new dawn" are stock phrases from fantasy/mysticism prompts. The post-newspaper timeframe is mentioned once and ignored thereafter—no lived detail transforms it. Emotional specificity is absent; "shadowed elation" is a label recycled five times without embodiment. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight because no prior particular earns it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout but makes no key turn; his actions (climb, place wick, adjust lenses, steer light) are sequential steps in a routine, not decisions that alter tactics or foreclose options. "Laughing storm herald" is a descriptor without causal pressure. Closure does not hinge on his choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The glass wick appears in multiple beats (placement, light pulse, visions, final glow) but its use is static description rather than evolving pressure. It does not constrain Kael's options or return with reweighted meaning at closure—merely present as a prop throughout.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "otherworldly routine" is named three times and described as "a dance of precision" and "nightly vigil," but it does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. Kael performs the routine without friction, alteration, or visible cost; it functions as theme-claim rather than narrative engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is labeled three times and visions appear mid-story, but the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The visions are ornamental glimpses that do not alter Kael's stance or tactics; he continues the routine unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Steer" appears in six beats (steering the beacon, steering through fog, steering through mist, steering with vigor, steering light into narratives). One beat ("he steered the beam through the swirling mist, each adjustment a deliberate act of guidance") frames a micro-turn, meeting the 5.0–6.9 threshold, but the action is largely interchangeable with "adjust" or "guide" and does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through total internal reflection" is named four times. The method is signaled early (paragraph 6) and mechanics are mentioned (bending light within prisms, refracting into images), but it does not shape attempts or constrain tactics—Kael uses it as described without friction. Present and functional but replaceable with any light-manipulation term.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse appears in the opening and closing lines and recurs in middle beats ("emerald structure," "lighthouse's heart," "under the emerald lighthouse and the stars"). It anchors location but does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome. The stars are postcard description. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the last print newspaper" appears once (paragraph 4) as a time marker but never tightens decisions or tactics. No live clock alters moves; the storm arrives on an unstated schedule. The timeframe is ornamental world-building unconnected to pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated twice (paragraphs 8, 29) and echoed in several beats, but the desire is never dramatized through conflicted choices or visible cost. Kael's actions align with the goal without friction; no want-versus-fear tension. Told-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Shadowed elation" is named three times and the tone aims for mystical-melancholy throughout, but it remains static—neither modulating with pressure nor charging the final image. The ending ("the world felt poised on the edge of something new") is generic anticipation rather than a tonal crystallization.</comment>
