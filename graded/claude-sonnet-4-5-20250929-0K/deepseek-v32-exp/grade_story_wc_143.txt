<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (preserving Cassini's Tear) is clear and sustained, but her interior remains static across the vigil—no contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The "purposefully curious" trait is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting actions. Embodied emotion is present (warm grain against palm, breathing focus) but the final act—pressing the shutter—carries no visible cost or foreclosed path; she simply completes her mission as planned. The nightwatch grain functions as a symbolic anchor rather than a choice-forcing object.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (crater inspector, Mons Huygens summit, lunar night). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through vials, grain, and dawn approach, culminating in the photograph. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Elara achieves her goal without sacrifice or renunciation; the "dawnlit melancholy" is asserted mood rather than a dramatized price. The chemical vials provide a countdown mechanism but no reversal or deepening alters her stance. One meaningful tightening (dawn's arrival) occurs, but the ending resolves to completion rather than reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail: low gravity affects movement, the terminator line advances, the crater's bowl-shaped depression is framed. Sensory detail (suit hum, silence, first sliver of sunlight) is selective and POV-filtered. The hourglass grain and camera constrain the final act, and the environment's dawn progression drives the timed sequence. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, meeting the micro-setting standard for this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—photographing Cassini's Tear before obliteration—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is purely temporal: the vials change color, dawn arrives, Elara presses the shutter. No reversal, complication, or trade-off narrows her options; the mining operation never materializes as on-page pressure. The ending delivers completion without visible cost—she seals the data, mission fulfilled. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is present but the cost remains asserted rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation vs. exploitation, the relentless flow of time, legacy. The nightwatch grain and chemical vials function as motifs that accumulate meaning. The final image—grain catching new light, "a single grain outlasting empires, now a part of her own timed message"—reconfigures prior material without overt moralizing. However, the thematic answer is more lyric assertion than earned pressure; the photograph's emotional weight is told ("profound sadness," "quiet pride") rather than shown through a consequential choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present: Elara notes the vial's exact azure shade, correlates it with her chronometer, feels the grain's warmth. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("a scientist to the last"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, emotional labels in the final third ("dawnlit melancholy washed over her," "profound sadness," "quiet pride") flatten immediacy rather than embodying the state through action or perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentences advance scene momentum cleanly. No loops, scaffolding, or contradictory metaphors. Information density is solid: most lines do double duty (setting, mood, character). However, stock phrasing appears in peak beats: "wave of dawnlit melancholy washed over her," "sea of change," "last whisper of a Moon." The template stem "She [verb]" recurs in the final paragraph without pattern-teaching. Figurative language in high-pressure moments (dawn arrival, shutter press) dilutes specificity rather than sharpening it, triggering −0.5 for density and −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in closure vicinity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The crater-inspector premise and lunar-vigil frame are fresh, and the chemical-vial countdown is a specific invention. However, the core arc—documenting something precious before its destruction—is a widely used template, and the story does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived complication. The ending delivers the expected photograph without surprise or cost-driven turn. Elara's mission succeeds as planned; no risk materializes to test her values. Derivative premise friction applies: −0.8 for template reliance without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role (crater inspector on a documentation mission) frames the premise. However, her choices do not create key turns—she executes a pre-planned sequence (check equipment, wait for vials, press shutter). Setup and closure participation are clear, but middle development lacks a decision that alters tactics. Functional but replaceable: another observer could perform the same acts.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The nightwatch grain appears early, recurs in three beats (clutched in hand, felt warm against palm, catching new light at the end), and is charged with legacy meaning. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure—it functions as symbolic anchor rather than causal lever. The final reprise reweights its significance (outlasting empires, part of her timed message), lifting it into mid-band, but the absence of causal involvement caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" is seeded early as atmosphere ("tone of her vigil was one of dawnlit melancholy") and returns in the final third ("dawning hush deepened," "dawning hush was absolute"). It shapes the emotional frame and the timing constraint (dawn's arrival is the deadline), but it does not alter tactics or force a choice. Present across setup and closure with thematic resonance, but it remains primarily tonal rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is stated in the opening ("driven not just by duty but by a deep, insatiable need to understand") and restated later ("Her purposefully curious nature made her note the exact shade"). However, the trait is label-only—no on-page action demonstrates curiosity constraining or enabling a choice with cost. She performs her assigned task without deviation. Functional mention without dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Outlast" is woven throughout: outlasting the cold and loneliness, outlasting physical night and despair, the grain outlasting empires, the photograph outlasting the physical crater. It frames the vigil's structure and is present in the closure unit ("a photograph that would have to outlast the physical reality soon to be erased"). The action shapes two beats (chemical-vial countdown to outlast the night, sealing data to outlast the mining operation) and participates in the ending. However, it does not drive a reversal or force a trade-off; Elara succeeds without sacrifice. Setup, development, and closure participation present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The chemical-reaction vials are introduced early and their mechanics matter: photosensitive compounds shift color to signal pre-dawn hours, providing a countdown. They appear in three beats (prepared vials, first azure vial at one hour, second gold vial at dawn). However, they do not constrain a choice—Elara simply waits for their signals and acts on schedule. The method shapes the vigil's structure but does not alter tactics under pressure. Setup, development, and closure participation present; causal involvement limited.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The moonlit summit (Mons Huygens) is anchored early with specific detail: tallest peak on the Moon, low gravity affecting movement, terminator line advancing, crater in shadow. It provides resources (camera tripod placement, framing the crater) and constraints (bitter cold, crushing loneliness, timing tied to sunrise). The setting participates in all three gates and directly shapes the photograph's execution. The summit's dawn progression drives the timed sequence, and the final image ("first sliver of sunlight illuminated its eastern edge") depends on the locale. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"During the space age" is stated in the opening and implied by the corporate mining operation, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics. Elara's vigil unfolds on a countdown to dawn, not shaped by era-specific constraints. The space-age setting provides context (exploitation of the Moon) but remains backdrop rather than pressure. Functional presence without causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation—photographing the last untouched crater before its obliteration—is stated early, sustained throughout, and drives Elara's presence on the summit. It appears in setup, middle beats (focus on breathing, checking equipment), and closure (pressing the shutter, sealing the photograph). However, the desire is never conflicted or tested by competing costs; Elara succeeds without friction. Dramatized in actions (equipment check, camera activation) but lacks want-versus-fear tension or trade-off. Setup, development, and closure participation present; friction between wants and costs absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Dawnlit melancholy" is seeded early ("tone of her vigil was one of dawnlit melancholy") and recurs in the closure unit ("wave of dawnlit melancholy washed over her"). The tone is coherent across the vigil and modulates slightly as dawn approaches (silence deepening, final absolute pause). However, it remains a static mood rather than a dynamic charge—Elara's emotional state does not shift under pressure. The tone supports the final image but does not escalate or transform with the story's turns. Setup and closure participation present; modulation under pressure minimal.</comment>
