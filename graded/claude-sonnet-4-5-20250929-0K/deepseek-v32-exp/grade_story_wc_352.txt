<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but her choices feel passive and inevitable rather than conflicted. The "prism-minded archivist" trait remains a label without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Internal experience is summarized through abstract concepts ("seeds of vigilance," "latent blaze") rather than specific sensory embodiment under pressure. The final transformation is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors land clearly, but the drive lens remains ambiguous—oscillating between accumulative texture and causal problem-solving without teaching a stable pattern by midpoint. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she becomes the guardian), but the cost is told rather than shown on the page; no concrete sentence demonstrates what she forfeited or what specific option closed. The "reenter" beat is set up early but the threshold crossing lacks a decisive consequence that narrows tactics. Per Orientation Test, cap applied where relevant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto's inverted gravity and mist supply vivid sensory anchors and constrain Elara's movement across multiple beats. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the climb and final vault entry. The manuscript doodle functions as a micro-setting object that guides navigation, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or tool constrain choice. Sensory hierarchy is consistent but some details (stalactites as floors, mirrored clouds) read decorative rather than tactically consequential at peak moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding forgotten combinations—is signaled early and pursued throughout, but escalation feels linear rather than tightening through trade-offs. The threshold effects complicate her path yet she overcomes them without visible cost or lost resource; "she was prepared, her vigilance unshakable" deflates tension. One meaningful deepening occurs when she reenters the vault she once fled, but no on-page choice demonstrates what she forfeited to succeed. Agency reads as endurance rather than decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Theme of vigilance and memory emerges through the quest structure, but the final image asserts rather than earns resonance: "her path clear, the blaze no longer latent" tells the theme rather than letting it land through particulars. The "seeds of vigilance" remain abstract throughout, never embodied in a concrete micro-choice that reweights prior material. Epiphanies are claimed ("felt knowledge flood into her") without dramatized struggle. The manuscript doodle returns at the end but fades without charging the closure image with fresh meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices patterns, layers, luminous lines—but diction drifts into elevated register ("clandestinely luminous," "latent blaze") that sits uneasily with urgent action beats, creating mild distance inconsistency. Free indirect style is clean and tense remains stable. Vocabulary choices ("prism-minded," "threshold effects") feel more decorative than character-particular, and rhythmic control flattens under peak pressure rather than modulating with urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Numerous prose artifacts cluster in high-pressure beats: paraphrase loops ("The threshold effects were like passing through veils of thought, each one altering her sense of self. But she held fast..."), template cadence ("She stepped...She took...She approached...She reached"), and synonym churn around "combinations" and "vigilance." Filter-verb stacks appear in the vault entry sequence. Stock metaphors ("latent blaze," "seeds of vigilance") recur without fresh embodiment. These patterns touch the closure beat, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is moderate but momentum drag from repetitive stems lowers propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—inverted gravity unlocking hidden patterns—offers a fresh physical constraint, but execution relies on stock fantasy quest beats: the reluctant return, the manuscript map, the final vault. Emotional arc could transplant to any quest narrative with minimal edits. "Prism-minded archivist" and "seeds of vigilance" read as prompt-fulfillment labels rather than lived-in specifics. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece follows a predictable hero's-journey template without transforming it through character particulars or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her goal frames all beats, but her choices are reactive—she follows the manuscript, endures threshold effects, and reaches out at the end. No on-page decision forces a trade-off or alters tactics under pressure. Observation dominates over agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The manuscript doodle appears in three beats: initial study, guidance through tunnels, and fading at closure. It enables navigation (middle development) and returns at the end, but its final disappearance is told rather than charged with consequence. Setup and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Seeds of vigilance" are mentioned repeatedly but remain abstract. They are claimed to "root in her consciousness" and "sharpen her sight," yet no on-page action demonstrates their constraint or cost. The concept functions as theme label rather than a mechanic that alters choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Clandestinely luminous" describes the manuscript doodle and reappears in the final vault, but the luminosity serves only as description—it does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. Present and functional but swappable with "glowing" or "radiant."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reenter" is signaled early (she fled once before), drives the middle vault crossing, and structures the closure when she reenters the central vault. The action is essential to the quest arc and shapes two major beats. However, the mechanics of reentry (what changes, what cost) are told rather than shown, capping the score below high integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Threshold effects are introduced early, recur at archway crossings and the vault entry, and are described as warping perception. They complicate her path (middle development) and intensify at closure. However, their mechanics remain vague—"veils of thought," "twist around her"—and she overcomes them without visible trade-off, reducing causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is present throughout, its mist and inverted gravity constrain Elara's movement across multiple beats, and the final vault is the closure location. The setting drives spatial tactics (ceiling becomes floor, stalactites as precarious footing) and supplies the threshold effects. Essential across beats and ending; removing the grotto would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hour-long gravity inversion is introduced early and triggers the quest, but the timeframe is not tracked or used to tighten decisions. Elara proceeds without visible clock pressure; we never feel the hour running out. Present in setup and implicit at closure (gravity rights itself), but the constraint does not shape tactics in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Finding forgotten combinations is declared as her singular motivation and frames all action, but it is never dramatized as conflicted—no want-versus-fear tension or cost that tests commitment. The motivation is told and pursued linearly without friction. Present across beats but lacks the on-page struggle that would elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Latent blaze" appears in the opening and ending, describing her determination and final understanding. The tone is consistent but static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with fresh meaning. The phrase reads as decorative labeling rather than a tonal shift that reweights the stake.</comment>
