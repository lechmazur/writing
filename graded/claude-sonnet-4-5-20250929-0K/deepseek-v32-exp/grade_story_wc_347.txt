<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—stubborn need to guide vs. resentment—is clearly established and drives her rescue choices. Internal conflict is present but often stated rather than embodied; "motivation flared within her" and "feeling less like a burden" lean toward summary. The shift from reluctance to acceptance at closure is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Micro-choices under pressure (timing the projections, ducking the bird) are present but emotional embodiment remains thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as causal with some accumulative texture. Orientation anchors arrive by ~60 words (Elara, orchard, labyrinth). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (shift from reluctance to acceptance), but the cost is largely told—"feeling less like chains"—rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible sacrifice on the page. The rescue sequence follows motivated steps (blueprint → assembly → projection → safe exit), but the final "quiet acceptance" lacks the sharp, legible price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and cursed orchard are vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (bronze wings whirring, frost forming, nut's shell "intricately carved"). Spatial choreography is mostly clear; Elara's movements along the cliffside and the travelers' path are trackable. The nut and device constrain her assembly choices, and the frost deadline adds urgency. The mechanical birds' patrols shape her evasion tactics, lifting the setting above postcard description and grounding pressure in the environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the travelers before frost—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through the mechanical birds' aggression and the frost's approach, creating a meaningful escalation. However, the resolution lacks a visible trade-off or loss: Elara succeeds cleanly, dismantles the device, and stands watch with no forfeited path or felt cost. The tension is coherent but the closure doesn't test commitment or force a hard choice, capping the score despite solid escalation mechanics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of "graceless beauty" and reluctant duty emerges through the orchard's curse, the mechanical birds, and Elara's shifting stance. The final image—"broken, beautiful song"—attempts resonance but leans on abstract metaphor rather than concrete particulars. "Offhandedly exact nature of her actions" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward overt thematic summary. The story invites reflection on duty and acceptance, but the ending's answer is stated ("feeling less like chains") rather than shown through a non-literal image or renunciation with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent psychic distance. Narrative voice carries a distinct texture—"graceless beauty," "clumsy, desperate rescue"—that reflects Elara's dual resentment and care. Perceptual filtering is mostly clean; Elara notices the nut's hum, the birds' gears, the frost's crystals. Some diction ("offhandedly exact," "forged the path") elevates into abstraction during peak pressure, and the final paragraph's theme articulation ("offhandedly exact nature of her actions") shifts toward commentary. No dialogue to assess. Overall, voice is controlled and purposeful with minor register drift at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and mostly propulsive with varied sentence structure. Information density is solid; beats advance character and action. Minor issues: "its instructions were offhandedly exact, casually detailing" is a paraphrase loop; "graceless beauty" recurs three times, twice in the final paragraph, with the last instance reading as thematic reinforcement rather than earned resonance. Template cadence appears in the assembly sequence ("She plucked… According to the blueprint, she needed… Her movements were…"). No major loops or scaffolding, but these patterns and the abstract phrasing at closure ("forged the path," "offhandedly exact nature") accumulate to −0.8 within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The cursed orchard, mechanical bird patrols, and projection device offer a fresh synthesis. The blueprint's "offhandedly exact" instructions and the nut's latent energy are specific details that avoid stock fantasy. However, the core arc—reluctant guardian saves travelers, finds purpose—follows a recognizable template without a sharp turn or non-obvious moral calculus. The ending's shift to acceptance is earned but predictable. "Graceless beauty" as a tonal anchor is conceptually interesting but relies on abstraction in execution. Solid freshness in setting and method; arc transformation is functional but not bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara as reluctant caretaker is established in the opening line and drives every beat: she hears the cries, retrieves the blueprint, assembles the device, evades birds, projects the lights, and watches the travelers escape. Her final stance shift (reluctance → acceptance) is the closure unit. The trait is indispensable; without her dual resentment and duty, the rescue and thematic arc collapse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The nut appears in three distinct beats: plucked from the orchard (paragraph 3), assembled with quartz and wire (paragraph 3), and dismantled after the rescue (paragraph 7). Its "latent energy" and "intricately carved" shell are specific properties that enable the device and constrain Elara's assembly. It returns dormant in her palm at closure, reweighting the orchard's curse. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability combine for strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten blueprint, found "years ago" in a hollow tree, provides the instructions for the projection device. It is remembered in paragraph 2, determines the assembly steps in paragraph 3, and its "offhandedly exact" nature is explicitly credited in the penultimate paragraph. The blueprint shapes tactics (what to assemble, how to project) and is essential to the rescue; removing it would break the plot. Not physically handled, but its memory drives causal action across beats and is thematically charged at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Offhandedly exact" is introduced as the blueprint's attribute in paragraph 2 ("offhandedly exact, casually detailing"), then reappears in paragraph 7 as "the offhandedly exact nature of her actions." The trait describes Elara's assembly precision under pressure and shapes the rescue's success, but it reads more as thematic labeling than a constraining property with visible cost. It lacks a specific on-page trade-off or friction. Functional but not indispensable; the rescue could succeed with "careful" or "focused" assembly with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Assembly is the central action: paragraph 3 details plucking the nut, gathering quartz and wire, and piecing them together ("her fingers working with a focus born of necessity"); the device's glow and light-arrows emerge from this assembly. Paragraph 7 dismantles it after the rescue. The assembly enables the projection method, drives the middle beats, and bookends the rescue arc. Without this exact action, the plot cannot function. Early signal, causal pressure, closure participation, and irreplaceability are all met.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method—"leaving impressions without touching"—is introduced in paragraph 2 as the blueprint's technique, executed in paragraph 4 ("creating ethereal markers that would shimmer"), and deployed across paragraphs 5–6 ("projecting the impressions," "light-arrows flickered," "leaving them at intervals"). The contactless projection is the tactical means that enables the rescue while avoiding direct interaction with the travelers or drawing the birds' attention. Its mechanics shape every beat from assembly to success. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds are established in paragraph 2 and pressure every subsequent beat: the labyrinth's "narrow ledges and dead-ends" trap the travelers; the bronze birds' patrols force Elara to duck behind a rocky outcrop (paragraph 4) and time her projections carefully (paragraph 6). The setting supplies the constraint (maze) and opposition (birds) that alter tactics and escalate danger. Removing this exact setting would collapse the rescue's stakes and spatial logic. Early signal, causal pressure across beats, and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The night frost is introduced in paragraph 1 ("before the night frost formed, a deadly chill") and returns in paragraphs 6 ("approach of the night frost") and 7 ("first crystals of frost began to form"). It tightens Elara's decisions (she "quickened her pace") and provides the live clock that raises cost. The travelers reach safety "as the first crystals… began to form," making the deadline indispensable to escalation and closure timing. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage are all present.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to guide the travelers is introduced in paragraph 1 ("stubborn need to guide them to safety"), tested against her resentment of the orchard's binding, and drives every choice from retrieving the blueprint to projecting the lights. Paragraph 5 reflects on her role "feeling less like a burden and more like a purpose," and paragraph 8 confirms she "would do it all again." The motivation is dramatized through the rescue sequence and conflicted with her reluctance, creating friction. The final acceptance is the closure unit, making this motivation indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Graceless beauty" is introduced in paragraph 2 ("bronze wings whirred with a graceless beauty, both awkward and mesmerizing"), recurs in paragraph 7 ("The graceless beauty of the moment struck her"), and anchors the final line ("a world of graceless beauty"). The tone modulates from the orchard's malevolence to the rescue's clumsy desperation to the ending's acceptance. However, the final two uses lean on abstract restatement rather than charging the image through concrete particulars. The tone is coherent and purposeful but not fully integrated into the closure's felt cost; it reads as thematic overlay in the last paragraph.</comment>
