<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("closure seeker who only opened wounds"), with embodied emotion in his restless picking at the bandage. The telepathic-plant trait generates micro-choices (using roots to tunnel) that reveal priorities under pressure. However, the final acceptance ("he found the closure he had always sought") reads as a tidy epiphany without the contradictory impulses or visible cost that would earn higher bands; the arc feels declared rather than dramatized in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows a causal chain: coffee-ring observation → root-guided tunnel → crystal discovery → acceptance. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of his wound as gateway), but the cost remains abstract—"accepting the narrative woven into his flesh" tells rather than showing a path foreclosed. The inferred lens is Causal with accumulative texture; it holds, but the final image ("frosted hourglass...gave a soft click") feels staged rather than earned by prior pressure, preventing entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tower setting is vivid and purposeful: ivy whispers provide information, the loose flagstone becomes a tactical choice, and the crystalline chamber charges the closure. Sensory details (cold stone, wet clay scent, frosted hourglass) are filtered through Aris's urgency. The recurring hourglass constrains his sense of stalled time and reappears at closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the final "soft click" feels ornamental rather than a choice-driver, capping the score at high-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to read scars and find closure—is signaled early and drives the tunneling action. One meaningful tightening occurs when the plants reveal the void and Aris commits to digging, narrowing his options. The crystal discovery offers a reversal (understanding his accident as beginning, not end), but the resolution lacks visible cost: no stamina drain, no social or tactical forfeiture shown on the page. Agency is present but the price remains conceptual, limiting high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—wound as gateway, pain as origin of sight—emerges from concrete action (tunneling, touching the crystal) and avoids overt moralizing until the final beat. The hourglass and scar motifs recur with shifted meaning, and the "displaced miracle" conceit integrates well. However, "he found the closure he had always sought" in the penultimate sentence edges into summary and robs the final image of its resonance, preventing the non-literal answer the 9+ gate requires.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Aris notices root-thoughts, pressure in coffee rings, and scar texture. Diction remains consistent ("leafy sigh," "meteor hush") and purposeful compression ("displacement, a miracle of architecture") reads voice-motivated. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The final paragraph's "he understood now" and "he had always sought" slip into summary mode during the closure beat, a minor lapse that keeps the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., "frosted hourglass" anchors both miracle and stalled time). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("meteor hush," "leafy sigh," "root-lights of sympathetic flora") across high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching, and "the narrative woven into his flesh" is a stock phrase in the closure zone. These issues total roughly −0.5 in this category, preventing 8+ entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Accidentally telepathic with plants" is fresh, and the coffee-ring divination method offers a non-obvious angle. However, the emotional arc—seeker finds what he seeks via underground relic—follows a familiar template without sufficient transformation. The "displaced miracle" and crystalline shard feel like genre furniture rather than lived-in particulars. The piece commits to its premise but lacks a bold choice or synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight, keeping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris as "closure seeker who opens wounds" frames the opening and his decision to tunnel constitutes one key turn. The trait shapes his method (examining scars, coffee rings) and his final acceptance. However, the acceptance is told rather than shown through a difficult on-page choice, limiting causal pressure. Present in all three gates (setup, middle tunnel decision, ending insight) but swappable with "obsessive investigator" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears twice: on the table at the start and clicking at the end. Its "utterly still" sand mirrors Aris's stalled state, and the final click signals time resuming. This is a purposeful early-to-final reprise that reweights meaning, eligible for ~6.3 under the lyric-resonance allowance. However, the hourglass does not constrain any middle choice or enable a tactic; it remains observational. The cameo in the ending does not demonstrate causal activity, capping the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Displaced miracle" anchors the premise: the crystal is literally displaced underground, and Aris's telepathy is a miraculous accident. The concept shapes his quest (find the source of the void) and the resolution (accepting his gift). It appears early, drives the middle tunnel decision, and charges the ending. The crystal's discovery is the climax, making the concept indispensable. Causal pressure is strong, but the conceptual cost (accepting his wound) is told rather than shown with a visible forfeiture, keeping the score in the 6–7 range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Telepathy with plants enables the core action: ivy whispers reveal the void, roots show the way, and plant-thoughts guide the tunnel. The trait constrains his method (he cannot use tools) and provides information at multiple beats. Visible cost appears when he "urge[s] the roots to push" (effort, focused intent). Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but the trait could be replaced with another sense-extension ability (stone-reading, echo-location) with moderate edits, capping irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tunneling is the central action: Aris decides to tunnel, uses plants to dig, and the passage leads to the crystal chamber. The action defines the middle escalation and delivers the climax. Removing it collapses the plot. Present early ("He would tunnel"), drives two beats (prying the flagstone, moving through the passage), and shapes the ending. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Not quite indispensable (he could descend via existing stairs or a trapdoor with major rewrites), but close.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Examining coffee rings appears once: Aris leans close, sees "contours and pathways," and interprets pressure and hollow space beneath. This reading triggers his decision to tunnel. The method is signaled early and enables the key turn. However, it does not recur or face friction; any other divination method (reading cracks, listening to echoes) could replace it. One strong beat involvement and closure setup, but swappability and single use limit the score to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "quiet tower at dawn" provides atmosphere (meteor hush, chill air) and resources (ivy on walls, loose flagstone). The setting's vertical structure (tower above, chamber below) is integral to the plot. The cold stone floor and narrow passage constrain his movement. Present in all three gates and shapes two beats (ivy whispers, flagstone entry), but the tower itself is somewhat generic—any isolated structure with access to underground could serve. Causal role is solid but irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening and explains Aris's raw mental state. Time of day (dawn, early morning) sets mood. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the narrative progresses at a contemplative pace without a live clock. The anesthesia framing does not recur or alter tactics. Setup gate met, but missing middle development and closure participation. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To learn to read the stories in scars" is stated early and drives his coffee-ring examination and tunnel quest. The motivation shapes his interaction with the crystal (seeing his accident's story) and his acceptance at closure. However, the desire is mostly told; we do not see him struggle with conflicting wants or pay a visible cost to pursue it. Present in all three gates with moderate causal pressure, but lacks the friction and on-page trade-off required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears twice: the opening ("meteor hush of the early morning") and near the end ("meteor hush returned, absolute and forgiving"). The tone is quiet, contemplative, and charged with waiting. It modulates slightly (from tense to forgiving) and charges the final acceptance. This is a purposeful reprise that reweights the stake. However, the tone does not guide middle choices or escalate under pressure; it remains a static atmospheric layer. Lyric-resonance allowance applies, lifting the score into mid-5s.</comment>
