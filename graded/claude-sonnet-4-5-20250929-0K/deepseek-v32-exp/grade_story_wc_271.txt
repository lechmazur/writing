<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her somatic-awareness method is consistent, but interiority leans heavily on therapeutic vocabulary ("somatic markers," "pearl of stillness") that reads diagnostic rather than embodied. The final grafting action offers symbolic closure, yet the path from freeze to thaw feels more told than dramatically compelled by contradictory impulses in scene. Micro-choices (pruning, smoothing the photograph, whispering names) are present but lack visible cost that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (arboretum, cliff, Elara tending plants). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: somatic cues and botanical motifs layer toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis—Elara integrates grief rather than erasing it—but the cost is asserted ("released its grip," "no longer a chain") rather than demonstrated through a concrete forfeiture or altered tactic. The lens holds, yet the final image lacks the undeniable pressure required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The arboretum setting is vivid (junipers, flowering cherries, cliff edge, automated lighthouse beam) and filters through Elara's horticultural expertise. Sensory detail (brine, blooms, wind) supports tone. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or directly charge the closure image; the grafting occurs without spatial pressure. Meets baseline specificity but remains slightly ornamental at the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—navigating grief without paralysis—is signaled early. The aircraft hum triggers tension, and Elara's breathing exercise offers one tightening moment. Yet escalation is minimal: the external pressure (sound) passes quickly, and the grafting resolution feels preordained rather than earned by a choice that narrows live options. Cost is conceptual (accepting pain) but not legible as a trade-off in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—anchoring optimism in realism, integrating scars—emerges through botanical metaphor (grafting, resilient plants). The final paragraph, however, over-articulates the premise ("anchored optimism… not a denial of reality") in near-prompt language, replacing scene pressure with thematic summary. The photograph shifts meaning (chain → testament) but the reconfiguration is stated rather than shown through a non-literal image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filters sensory detail through Elara's horticultural lens. Diction is generally controlled, though therapeutic terms ("somatic markers," "pearl of stillness") recur without embodied variation under peak stress. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature (botanist's attention to grafting, resilience) is consistent, but the voice does not modulate rhythm or syntax as pressure rises and falls.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean. However, paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "somatic markers" is repeated four times, "pearl of stillness" three times, often in similar syntactic frames without fresh inflection. The final third stacks summary statements ("This was her anchored optimism," "she had built a sanctuary") that deflate momentum rather than propelling through image. Mixed metaphor: "seeded new life" in ruins jars against botanical specificity established earlier. Information density suffers in the closing paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—drone strike survivor tending an arboretum—offers initial freshness, and the botanical-grief synthesis is purposeful. Yet the story leans on familiar recovery-through-nature and healing-garden tropes without a non-obvious turn. The final grafting image is apt but predictable given the setup. Therapeutic vocabulary and the "pearl of stillness" phrase read more like writing-prompt tokens than lived idiom, reducing authenticity of vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes micro-choices (pruning, smoothing photograph, grafting), but none decisively alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her "survivor" identity frames backstory yet does not drive a key reversal on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The photograph appears in three beats (carried, unfolded/smoothed, tucked away) with shifting emotional weight (trigger → testament). It participates in closure's conceptual shift but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; its role remains symbolic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" is mentioned three times as an internal state Elara seeks and finds, but it does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. The concept remains abstract and label-only, echoing theme without driving action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" is demonstrated via nurturing saplings and grafting skill, appearing in early and final beats. However, the talent does not face a cost or trade-off; it enables resolution without friction, rendering it functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Freeze" recurs as bodily response (aircraft hum triggers it, Elara resists paralysis) and ties to the central conflict. It appears in setup and middle beats but does not redefine options at closure; the grafting resolution bypasses rather than transforms the freeze state.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Somatic markers" is named and described (chill, tightness, breath) in multiple beats, establishing the method early. Yet the mechanics do not alter tactics or constrain choices; Elara's use of bodily cues feels more ornamental than decisive at key moments.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The arboretum (cliff, wind, plants) is established immediately and provides sensory anchors throughout. It mirrors Elara's resilience thematically and hosts the final grafting act, but the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that shifts outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper" establishes historical succession and the automated beam recurs as image. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; it remains atmospheric backdrop without causal force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To anchor optimism in realism" is stated early and repeated near closure. It frames Elara's internal goal and the grafting symbolizes integration, but the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicted choices with visible friction or cost.</comment>
