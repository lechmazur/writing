<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist's backwards-walking habit is embodied and recurring, but her interior reasoning for mentoring remains abstract rather than rooted in contradictory impulses. Elian's arc from anger to vulnerability follows a credible path, though the epiphany ("it's not about geography, but perception") arrives with minimal internal resistance. The final choice—leaving—feels earned by the lesson structure but lacks visible cost or foreclosed options on the page. Interiority relies on some stock phrasing ("heart a mix of stern duty and deep care") that dilutes character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern of annotations and shadows builds toward understanding). Orientation anchors are present early (forgotten library, archivist, Elian by table). One meaningful deepening occurs when Elian sees the connection between tea leaves and shadow, shifting his stance from frustration to readiness. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: Elian leaves "ready," the archivist walks forward with calm nerves, but the cost is more asserted than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture or visible price paid in the final image. The ending reconfigures the archivist's nervousness (she now walks forward), but the weight of what she or Elian sacrificed remains implied rather than legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The forgotten library anchors the scene with sensory detail (dusty floor, distant swing creak, tea cups on table, afternoon light). The swing sound functions as a recurring environmental cue that triggers the archivist's backwards walking, constraining her movement twice. Spatial choreography is clear (she moves away, Elian bends over the shard). The swing falls silent at closure, marking the session's end, but the environment does not visibly constrain Elian's final choice or alter the archivist's tactics beyond the nervous-walk trigger. Setting supports atmosphere but remains somewhat passive in the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Elian's reversible exile and his learning to "bend without breaking." Pressure accumulates through the lesson sequence (tea leaves, shard annotation, pattern recognition). One meaningful tightening occurs when Elian asks "Why must we use such obscure methods?" and the archivist replies by shifting his perception. The resolution ("You're ready") is earned by his demonstrated understanding, but the cost of readiness—what he forfeits by leaving or what the archivist loses by releasing him—is not legible on the page. Agency is present (Elian's annotations become confident), yet the final departure lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilience through oblique methods and reading crooked lines emerges through the tea-leaf geometry and shadow annotation without overt moralizing. The final exchange ("retreat can be a form of advance") offers insight earned by the archivist's habit, not mere assertion. The shadow in glass deepens meaning at closure ("seemed to shift, a promise of change"), reweighting the opening image. However, the thematic answer—exile as perception, not geography—arrives as a stated realization rather than a non-literal final image that embodies the shift. Subtext operates in the backwards-walking habit and the swing's silence, but the ending leans slightly toward articulation over resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single POV (archivist) is stable; psychic distance remains consistent. Voice carries some distinct texture ("combative tenderness," "steel and silk"), but perceptual signature is generic at peaks ("heart a mix," "surge of pride"). Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext (Elian's frustration, the archivist's evasive answers), though register occasionally drifts into prompt-like phrasing ("reversible exile," "mentor resilience quietly"). Free indirect style is clean. The archivist's backwards-walking serves as a character-specific tic, but syntax and rhythm do not tighten under pressure in the climactic beats. No head-hopping; tense is stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate; sentences mostly advance. However, several paraphrase loops dull momentum: "resilience had been mentored, and exile reversed" recaps rather than showing the ending cost. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("She lifted a shard... She handed him the shard... She guided him"). Stock metaphors and therapy-speak labels ("combative tenderness," "mentor resilience quietly") in peak beats reduce immediacy. Some figurative language is effective (shadow "caught in glass"), but density sags when scaffold ("Together, they analyzed more leaves") replaces concrete action. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but cumulative line-level debt lowers propulsion. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2) and template-cadence (−0.5) penalties plus stock phrasing (−0.3) totals −1.0 within Q7 band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archive, tea-leaf geometry, and backwards-walking habit offer specific details, but the core premise (mentor uses symbolic objects to teach emotional lesson) follows a familiar template without a sharp transformation. The reversible-exile concept and the archivist's backwards habit are fresh inflections, yet the emotional arc (anger → vulnerability → readiness) and the lesson structure (obscure method → resistance → epiphany) read conventional. The final image (archivist walks forward, nerves calm) is purposeful but not non-obvious. Risk-taking in structure or moral calculus is minimal; the story commits to its premise but does not subvert or deepen it beyond surface execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist is present throughout, signals early (first sentence), and her decision to guide Elian through the lesson drives the middle beats. She makes two key choices: spacing herself when nervous and declaring Elian ready at the end. However, her decisions do not create sharp reversals or foreclose visible options—Elian's readiness is asserted rather than tested by a high-cost choice. The archivist's backwards-walking habit constrains her movement but does not alter the lesson's outcome. She is functional and shapes the arc, but could be replaced by a similar mentor figure with minimal structural impact. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (moderate) +0.8, closure linkage (declares readiness) +0.9, but swappability −0.6 and ornamental final beat (walks forward, smiles) −0.3 yield ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The afternoon shadow caught in glass is introduced early ("a particular shard where an afternoon shadow was caught"), handled in two distinct beats (lifted and shown to Elian; Elian annotates it), and returns at closure ("last light caught the shard, the shadow seemed to shift"). The object enables Elian's lesson and charges the final image with a "promise of change." Its specific property (trapped shadow) matters to the theme of reading signs. However, the closure reprise is somewhat passive (the shadow "seemed to shift" rather than Elian or the archivist acting on it), and a similar trapped image could substitute with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, but swappability −0.4 and passive final mention −0.2 yield ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Reversible exile is named early ("Elian's exile was reversible") and shapes the dominant stake throughout. It drives Elian's frustration and the archivist's teaching method, and the resolution ("exile reverses when you stop fighting yourself") hinges on it. The concept constrains tactics (obscure methods to teach perception shift) and is causally active in the middle beat when Elian sees the tea-leaf gate. At closure, Elian leaves, presumably to reverse his exile. However, the reversal is stated ("You're ready... Go back") rather than dramatized with visible cost or obstacle. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, but summary-only resolution −0.7 yields ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The backwards-walking habit is introduced early ("she began to walk backwards, a habit she could never break") and recurs in two beats (mid-lesson when the swing creaks, final paragraph when she walks forward). It constrains her movement and embodies her nervousness, and the final reversal (walking forward) signals her calm. However, the trait does not alter the lesson's outcome or Elian's readiness; it functions as character flavor rather than causal lever. The closure mention carries symbolic weight but no visible tradeoff. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but ornamental use −0.5 and low causal pressure −0.3 yield ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Annotation is introduced early ("We annotate the past") and drives two distinct beats: the archivist instructs Elian to annotate the shard, and Elian's annotations become confident as he understands. The action is causally linked to Elian's readiness ("each mark a step toward understanding"). At closure, the completed annotations signal his transformation. However, the annotation itself is not irreplaceable—a similar interpretive task (drawing, mapping) could substitute with minor edits. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability −0.6 and moderate specificity −0.5 yield ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry is introduced early ("analyzing the geometry of tea leaves") and used in two beats: the archivist traces patterns in Elian's cup and later they "analyzed more leaves." The method shapes the middle beat (Elian sees the leaf-gate mapping his exile) and is compared to the shadow's curve. However, the mechanics are vague—how does geometry reveal the key?—and a similar symbolic reading (runes, cards) could replace it. The method does not reappear at closure; the final image focuses on the shard, not the leaves. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (moderate) +0.7, but swappability −0.5, ornamental second use −0.3, and missing closure linkage −0.6 yield ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library is named in the first sentence and anchors the scene throughout. It supplies the shards and tea cups (resources) and the distant swing sound (pressure trigger for the archivist's nervousness). However, the library itself does not constrain Elian's choice or alter the lesson's outcome—the scene could occur in any private study with similar props. At closure, the library is mentioned ("this library, and the shadows that taught you") as a memory prompt, not a causal force. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (swing triggers nervousness twice) +0.4, but postcard-level description −0.5, swappability −0.5, and ornamental closure mention −0.3 yield ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze" is evoked through the swing's recurring creak, which triggers the archivist's nervousness in two beats and falls silent at closure. The "afternoon waned" marks temporal progression. However, time does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline; the lesson proceeds at a leisurely pace. The swing's silence at closure marks completion but does not alter tactics or cost. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than causal. Ornamental use −0.7, missing causal pressure −0.6, closure linkage (swing silent) +0.5, but no clock constraint −0.5 yield ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to mentor resilience quietly is signaled early ("here to mentor resilience quietly") and drives the archivist's lesson structure and her "combative tenderness." It shapes two beats: her initial instruction and her final declaration of Elian's readiness. At closure, "resilience had been mentored" confirms the goal. However, the motivation is more told than dramatized; the archivist's internal conflict (why quietly? what does she risk?) is absent. The desire is functional but not deeply conflicted on the page. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but told-only friction −0.8 and low dramatized tension −0.4 yield ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Combative tenderness is named early ("her tone edged with combative tenderness") and modulates through the lesson: stern instruction, soft replies, rare smile. The tone is coherent and purposeful, blending challenge with care. However, it remains somewhat static—no sharp tonal shift under peak pressure—and the label itself is prompt-like rather than emergent from voice. At closure, the tone softens ("words quiet but resonant") but does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure. Early signal +0.6, coherent modulation +0.7, closure linkage (moderate) +0.6, but static mood −0.4 and label-reliance −0.3 yield ~5.6.</comment>
