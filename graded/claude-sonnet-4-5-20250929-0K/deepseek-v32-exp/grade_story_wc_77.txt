<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is told rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The core fear—being "just an echo of a person"—arrives abruptly at the climax without prior dramatization of that internal split. Interiority leans on abstract labels ("foreign rhythm," "hollow space") and diagnostic language ("paradoxical," "embodiment") instead of character-specific perception. The final peace feels unearned; no visible cost forecloses a prior path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: the resuscitation context and Elara's baseline state remain vague past the opening, creating a floating quality. The closure unit—throwing the clasp to seal the shadow—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("strange peace," "whole") rather than shown through a forfeited option or altered stance. The drive lens wavers between Causal (clasp action) and Accumulative (paradox notes), settling weakly on Causal at the end without sustained because/therefore linkage in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The funhouse setting is vivid in texture ("rust and rotten cotton candy," "cracked and distorted" mirrors) and the clasp is handled across multiple beats, constraining her final choice. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the hall-of-mirrors sequence. However, the "lingering luminance" remains a floating abstraction—its source and mechanics are never anchored, weakening the micro-setting's causal grip on the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tricking fear to survive—is declared but never tested by a live on-page trade-off. The middle beats (reading the dictionary, confronting the mirror) unfold sequentially without a meaningful reversal or narrowing of options. The climax (throwing the clasp) resolves the problem via an object action rather than protagonist agency; luck and timing replace earned escalation. No visible price paid after the turn alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of fear-as-paradox is stated overtly in dialogue ("Fear is a paradox," "emptiness" paired with "potential") rather than emerging from particulars. The dream-dictionary mechanism feels like a prompt artifact rather than an organic discovery tool. The final image ("inner light") asserts resolution with a stock metaphor instead of offering a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. The ending explains the moral rather than dramatizing thematic cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The advisor's voice is distinct (soft, slithering, directive), and Elara's perceptual register is consistent. However, the advisor's disembodied status creates POV leakage—Elara narrates its "purpose fulfilled" at the end with knowledge she cannot possess. Free indirect style is clean in the funhouse beats, but elevated diction ("malevolent darkness," "manufactured light") clashes with the urgency of peak moments. No head-hopping, but the final paragraph's summary voice ("she had tricked fear") dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose carries several template patterns: repeated "a [noun] that [verb]" constructions ("allure that both sickened," "rhythm in her chest," "weight she knew"), filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats ("seemed to drink," "felt more than saw"), and paraphrase loops ("fear is a paradox" / "your weakness is that you cannot exist"). The climax beat ("absorbed the object, the cursed darkness within it meeting the manufactured light") muddles vehicle logic—how does absorption create explosion? Clarity holds in spatial choreography, but information density drops in the final third as summary replaces scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—confronting a personified fear via paradox notes—closely echoes therapy-quest templates without transformation through specific lived detail. The dream-dictionary method is introduced but never demonstrated on the page in a way that reveals unique properties. The funhouse setting, while atmospheric, remains postcard gothic; no world rule or micro-detail surprises. The final twist (clasp seals shadow) lacks groundwork in prior beats—no earlier hint that the cursed object could absorb rather than project darkness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Present throughout and provides directional cues, but the advisor's guidance is purely instructional—"This way," "Show it to the light," "Now!"—without decision pressure that alters Elara's tactics. Its disappearance at the end is noted, not dramatized. Swappable with any disembodied guide archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The clasp is signaled early, handled in three beats (held up, grows hot, thrown), and participates in the closure action. Its "photographically cursed" trait is described but not leveraged—no photograph is taken, so the curse remains ornamental. The throwing action resolves the shadow, but the clasp's unique properties (drinking luminance, warmth shift) could describe any charged object. Present in closure but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The luminance appears as atmospheric description ("faint, lingering luminance," "brightened," "flared") but its source, mechanics, and meaning remain vague. It does not constrain choice or enable a tactic; Elara never manipulates it directly. The concept is invoked at closure ("lingering luminance replaced by a steady, inner light") as metaphor, not dramatized pressure. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The "photographically cursed" trait is explained in exposition ("any picture taken of it showed only a swirling, malevolent darkness") but never demonstrated on the page—no one takes a photograph. At closure, the trait is asserted to seal the shadow without visible mechanics linking curse to shadow absorption. Label-only mention; no on-page cost or enablement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's confession ("I am afraid that coming back from death left a hollow space") occurs in the climax beat and draws the shadow's interest, shaping the confrontation. However, the unbosoming is a single speech act rather than a layered, conflicted revelation across beats. The action could be replaced with any form of honesty ("confess," "admit") without structural loss. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The dream dictionary is introduced early and read once ("void" paired with "potential"), providing the insight that fear "cannot exist without a host." The method's mechanics—how contradictory notes decode fear—are asserted, not shown through trial or error. It appears in two beats (carried, consulted) but does not shape middle tactics or constrain the climax. Swappable with any symbolic guide.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The funhouse setting provides vivid texture and spatial anchors (entrance, hall of mirrors, final mirror) that guide Elara's progression. The cracked mirrors and luminance create atmosphere, but the environment does not constrain her final choice—she could confront the shadow anywhere. Micro-setting (the clasp in her hand) participates in closure, elevating the score slightly. Present across beats but not indispensable to tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "after the resuscitation" timeframe is mentioned in the opening and referenced once ("coming back from death"), but it imposes no urgency or ticking clock on Elara's choices. The resuscitation's effects—"fragile, foreign rhythm," "hollow space"—are told labels rather than lived constraints that alter her actions. The timeframe is static backdrop, not active pressure. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation to "trick fear into revealing its weakness" is declared early and frames the goal. Elara's tactics (entering the funhouse, consulting the dictionary, confronting the shadow) align with this desire. However, the motivation is pursued without visible friction—no moment where self-preservation conflicts with the plan, no cost to attempting the trick. Functional but told rather than dramatized through competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "repulsive allure" tone is signaled in the opening ("scent of rust and rotten cotton candy, a repulsive allure that both sickened and drew her in") and sustained through atmospheric details (decay, sickly hues, shadows). The tone modulates slightly at closure ("strange peace," "inner light"), but the shift is asserted rather than charged by image. Coherent through turns but does not reweight the final moment with undeniable pressure.</comment>
