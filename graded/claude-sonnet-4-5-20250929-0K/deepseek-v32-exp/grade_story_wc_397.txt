<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's transformation is asserted in the opening but her on-page choices feel contemplative rather than pressured by contradictory impulses. The parasol tip functions more as talisman than active constraint on her behavior. The shift from euthanasia tourist to disaster volunteer is told rather than dramatized through concrete micro-choices that reveal competing motives under stress. Interiority leans toward lyric reflection without the embodied friction that would ground her internal conflict in the trawling action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with recurring images (parasol, ice, trawling) building toward the final realization. However, closure arrives as articulated insight ("endings have a sound—a soft, almost imperceptible rustle") rather than a decisive image or action that reweights prior material with undeniable cost. The piece teaches its meditative pattern early, but the ending tells the thematic arrival instead of charging it through a final concrete moment. Orientation is clear; causality under this lens is gentle but present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina supplies vivid sensory anchors (groaning wood, misting breath, ice slurry) and the parasol tip is handled across multiple beats. The setting shapes Elara's meditative state and the trawling action, though it does not force a pivotal tactical choice. The parasol tip's return in the penultimate beat charges the final image, lifting the score into mid-6s under the micro-setting allowance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—remains abstract and contemplative throughout. Trawling provides repetitive action without a meaningful narrowing of options or visible cost that forecloses a path. The piece deepens Elara's acceptance but does not dramatize a pressure point where her choice or renunciation alters tactics or consequences on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification is expected; here the accumulation stays level.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme (acceptance of endings, continuity within loss) emerges organically from the parasol, trawling rhythm, and ice imagery. The final articulation of theme ("endings have a sound") is stated rather than offered through a non-literal image, lowering the score. The parasol's shift from "relic of loss" to "promise of continuity" provides a clear thematic arc, but the closure Beat leans toward summary wisdom rather than resonant implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (meditative, attuned to texture and sound). Diction occasionally elevates into lyric register ("gripped reality loosely," "fold in patience") that reads as authorial rather than arising from Elara's idiom under stress. No dialogue present. The prose rhythm supports the contemplative tone, though some phrases ("woke changed," "windborne solace") feel coined rather than inhabited.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid. However, several phrases recur as conceptual loops: "grips reality loosely" appears three times, "fold in patience" thrice, "waking changed" twice, "learn the sound of approaching endings" twice. These function as motif anchors but also create a templated cadence that flattens momentum in the middle third. No clarity breaks, but information density dips during reflective stretches. The parasol beat and ice imagery propel well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The euthanasia-tourist premise offers a fresh entry point, and the parasol tip as heirloom fragment is specific. However, the narrative arc—despair to acceptance through volunteer labor—follows a familiar recovery template. The transformation is largely asserted in the opening rather than earned through conflict. The trawling metaphor (sifting wreckage for understanding) is clear but not surprising. Windborne solace and lace-brushing-ice provide texture without fundamentally reweighting the familiar trajectory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her status as euthanasia tourist is established in paragraph two and does not constrain or enable later choices. The shift away from that intention is told as complete before the trawling begins. No on-page decision turns on this identity; it frames backstory rather than driving beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The parasol tip appears in three beats: tucked in pocket (paragraph 6), as pulsing guide (paragraph 23), and examined in hand (paragraph 31), where it yields the sound-of-endings realization. It shifts from passive token to active symbol at closure, but the final beat tells the meaning rather than charging it through action. Early signal present; closure linkage clear but summary-inflected.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is named three times as a meditative state (paragraphs 12, 18, 28) but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. It functions as thematic echo rather than causal pressure. No on-page moment shows patience bending into a decision with visible cost. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" recurs three times (paragraphs 3, 17, 27) as descriptive state. It colors Elara's perception but does not enable or constrain an on-page action. The trait is label-only; no scene shows a tradeoff or consequence arising from this loose grip. Mentioned without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Trawling anchors the central action across paragraphs 10, 18, 29, and supplies the debris metaphor. It shapes the meditative rhythm and the parasol discovery beat. Removing trawling would require substituting another repetitive action, but the specifics (net, slurry, hauls) charge the setting and pace. Essential to structure; does not drive a pivotal turn but accumulates meaning across beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is named in paragraphs 5, 19, 29 and frames Elara's presence at the marina. It justifies the setting and trawling but does not shape a tactical choice or impose a constraint. The method is context rather than causal lever. Present across beats but swappable with similar motivations (grief work, retreat, penance).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina anchors all action, supplies vivid sensory pressure (cold, ice, wind), and enables the trawling metaphor. It appears in paragraphs 1, 8, 20, 30. The setting does not force a pivotal choice but its stark beauty and wreckage charge the thematic question and final image. Micro-setting (boat, net, ice) alters Elara's perception and pace, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After waking changed" is signaled in paragraph 2 and referenced in paragraph 35 but does not impose a ticking clock or shape tactical decisions across the middle. The transformation is complete before the story's present action begins. Timeframe provides framing distance but no urgency or compression.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The motivation to learn the sound of endings is stated in paragraph 7 and recurs in paragraphs 25, 32. It drives Elara's attention and anchors the thematic question, but is not dramatized through a conflicted choice with visible cost. The sound is discovered in the parasol beat (paragraph 32) as insight rather than through friction between competing desires. Thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Windborne solace is named in paragraphs 13, 26, 34 and the tone is consistent: meditative, elegiac, quietly hopeful. The tone modulates slightly at closure (fear carried away, heart light) without breaking coherence. It charges the final image and supports the Accumulative lens. Cohesive across beats and legible at closure, though not dynamic.</comment>
