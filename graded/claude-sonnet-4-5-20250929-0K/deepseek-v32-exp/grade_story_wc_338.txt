<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation remains declarative rather than embodied—her "methodically curious nature" and "empathy for silence" are asserted labels that never constrain a choice. The story tells us she "felt a pull" and "allowed herself to feel the stories," but no on-page micro-choice reveals competing impulses or a hierarchy of values. Interior contradiction is absent; she moves through beats in smooth analytical mode without ambiguity or genuine struggle. The final discovery feels convenient rather than earned by prior characterization under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers details (map tear, video comparison, fissure) toward a final discovery. Orientation anchors arrive by ~80 words (ancient henge, map framer), within tolerance. However, the closure unit—finding the whole map in the chapel—lacks visible cost; Elara "felt the divide soften" and "empathy forever deepened" are asserted emotions without a forfeited path or felt price. The narrative arc functions, but the ending reconfiguration is conceptual claim rather than on-page image that reweights prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setting details (mossy stones, rain-scoured vault, fissure) are visually present and anchor space adequately. The fissure's widening over decades offers one purposeful detail that enables the reopening action. However, the environment never constrains a choice or complicates tactics—Elara's work proceeds unimpeded. The final chapel interior supplies atmospheric description but does not charge the closure image; she simply "stepped in" and observed. Micro-setting allowance partially met but without pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (bridge known and unknown via reopening the chapel) is signaled early. Yet escalation is absent: Elara studies, compares footage, finds the fissure, and opens it in a linear sequence without reversal, complication, or narrowing options. The stone "give[s] way under her touch" with no resistance. No on-page cost accompanies the achievement—she "left the chapel" with emotions declared but no visible price paid. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should tighten via density increase or cadence shift; here it remains flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of bridging silence and known/unknown is stated overtly ("interpreting silence not as absence but as a language of care"; "some truths are only heard when we dare to reopen") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The map tear functions as transparent symbol with one-to-one correspondence. The final paragraph moralizes directly, replacing scene pressure with thesis summary: "woven the threads of silence into a map of understanding." No non-literal answer arises from image; the story tells its own meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction leans heavily on elevated, abstract register ("methodically curious," "shielded openness," "profound silence") that reads generic rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is minimal; Elara notices in catalog mode (frescoes, shadows, ivy) without selective bias. Psychic distance stays uniform—no modulation under pressure. Prose rhythm is steady but lacks stress-driven compression or variation. Internal voice reads as committee consensus rather than singular perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe template-cadence and paraphrase-loop issues pervade. Examples: "The tone of her quest was one of shielded openness; she guarded her heart but remained alert" is immediate synonym churn. Paragraph 2 opens "The henge's mossy stones loomed" then paragraph 4 echoes "She approached the rain-scoured fresco vault"—identical stem structure. "Methodically curious" appears four times as label-only modifier. Stock metaphors ("divide between known and unknown," "whispers of the past") cluster in final beats. Information density is low; many lines restate prior content without advancement. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed to sigh") stack without voice motivation. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.4 baseline, touching closure beats warrants −1.7 total and disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise (archaeologist/map framer uses video comparison to rediscover hidden chapel) is functional but derivative—closely matches investigative-discovery templates without fresh transformation. Prompt elements (whispered chapel, map tear as metaphor, empathy for silence) are deployed literally with no surprising synthesis. Turns feel predictable: fissure widens over time, she opens it, finds answers inside. Emotional truth is replaced by abstract declarations. The piece hedges toward the safety middle, choosing median options (patient scholar, gradual discovery, affirming closure) that avoid bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation (map framer) is mentioned, but her choices do not create turns. She observes, studies, traces, and works at the fissure in linear sequence; no decision alters tactics or forecloses an option. Perceptive quality is label-only. Missing middle development: no choice under pressure. Missing closure participation: the ending describes her emotional state, not a decision that reweights prior material. Late penalty does not apply (present early), but ornamental use and swappability (could be "archaeologist" or "historian" with minor edits) cap score. Apply −0.5 ornamental, −0.4 swappability within low band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Ancient henge appears in paragraphs 1, 2, 4, and 6—four distinct mentions. Setup clear by first paragraph. However, it functions as static backdrop: "loomed in the mist," "seemed to guard this vault," "was a marker for this chapel." No handling or use; no evolving meaning. The henge's alignment shift (paragraph 3) enables discovery but is told via video comparison, not dramatized interaction. Missing middle development: no on-page constraint. Closure participation weak: mentioned as retrospective marker, not causally active. Caps for missing development (3.4) and no closure participation (2.8); lowest cap 2.8, but lyric reprise (first → last mention) with slight reweighting allows nudge to 4.2 within band. Apply −0.5 ornamental, −0.3 summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Whispered chapel frames the quest from paragraph 1, appears as goal in paragraphs 2–3, and is reopened/entered in paragraphs 5–6. Setup and closure gates met. Development: the chapel's location (beyond fissure) shapes Elara's middle action (working at the fissure), providing causal pressure in one beat. Closure participation strong: she enters it and the interior discovery (whole map) delivers the ending image. Specificity moderate: "whispered" as modifier is atmospheric but the chapel's unique properties (frescoes, air thick with history) do not constrain choices beyond access. Two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability concern (could be "hidden chamber" or "sealed sanctuary") −0.6. Net ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Methodically curious appears as label in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6—five mentions. Setup clear. However, the trait never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It describes Elara's approach ("her methodically curious mind had led her here," "her methodically curious drive made her examine") but does not create friction or tradeoff. No visible consequence of being methodical versus impulsive. Missing development gate: no middle choice where the trait alters tactics. Missing closure gate: the trait is mentioned in the final paragraph but does not shape the ending. Ornamental use −0.8, label-only −0.3, cumulative −1.0 max. Cap for missing development 3.4; score trends low within that ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Reopen is the central action: signaled in paragraph 1 ("would reopen the whispered chapel"), pursued in paragraph 4 ("to reopen the hidden passage"), executed in paragraph 5 ("worked at the fissure...entrance appeared"), and reflected at closure ("by her methodical curiosity...had woven"). Setup and closure gates met. Development: the action of working the fissure is one on-page beat that narrows options (physical barrier overcome). The action structures the arc: prior investigation enables reopening, reopening enables discovery. Causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, two-beat involvement +0.9. However, swappability concern: "unlock," "unseal," "access" would serve similar function −0.5. Irreplaceability moderate; the gerund form and symbolic weight (reopen vs. unknown) add specificity +0.4. Net ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Silent video footage introduced in paragraph 1 ("carried silent video footage from decades apart, planning to compare"), used in paragraph 2 (playing old/recent recordings, noticing shadow shift), and referenced in paragraphs 3 and 6 ("comparing footage," "by comparing the silent footage"). Setup and closure gates met (reflected at end). Development: the comparison reveals fissure widening (paragraph 3), enabling the reopening action—one causal beat. Method mechanics are on the page (tablet, side-by-side playback, shadow/ivy changes). Two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, specificity (decades apart, silent, shadow patterns) +0.5. However, the method is told/summarized rather than dramatized in real-time problem-solving −0.5. Net ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rain-scoured fresco vault appears in paragraphs 1, 2, 4, and 6. Setup clear. The vault houses the fissure that Elara works at (paragraph 4), supplying the physical obstacle and access point—one causal beat. Closure: she leaves it "renewed" (paragraph 6), though this is assertion rather than image. The vault's rain-scoured state and faded frescoes provide atmospheric texture but do not alter tactics. Micro-setting allowance: the fissure (vault feature) constrains choice by requiring tool use. Two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage weak +0.4. Swappability moderate ("ancient archive," "sealed chamber") −0.5. Net ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Map tear dividing known/unknown is introduced in paragraph 1, aligned with altar in paragraph 2, felt as "pull" in paragraph 3, mirrored by vault crack in paragraph 4, and resolved (whole map found) in paragraphs 5–6. Setup and closure gates met. The tear as symbol structures the quest, but timeframe (when decisions must occur) is absent—no clock, no urgency. The "spot" is spatial anchor, not temporal pressure. The element functions thematically (division/wholeness) rather than as a deadline. Development gate weak: no middle choice where time tightens tactics. Lyric reprise (first → final mention with reweighting) partially compensates. Closure linkage +1.0, symbolic coherence +0.6, but missing temporal constraint −0.8, no cost connection −0.4. Net ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Motivation to interpret silence with empathy appears in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. Setup clear. However, it is consistently told rather than dramatized: "Her motivation was to interpret," "Elara's empathy for the silence grew," "listened with empathy." No on-page friction between this desire and a competing want or cost. The motivation does not constrain choices—Elara pursues it unimpeded. Missing development gate: no middle beat where empathy creates a tradeoff. Closure: the motivation is asserted as fulfilled ("empathy forever deepened") without visible consequence. Ornamental use −0.8, told-only −0.5, no cost connection −0.4, cumulative −1.0 max. Cap for missing development 3.4, but closure mention allows nudge within band to ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Shielded openness stated in paragraphs 1, 2, and 6: "tone of shielded openness; she guarded her heart but remained alert." Tone label recurs but does not modulate with pressure—Elara's narrative voice stays uniform (elevated, abstract) across discovery beats. No shift in sentence rhythm, diction, or psychic distance as stakes rise. The tone is asserted as character trait rather than enacted through prose modulation. Missing development: no middle beat where shielding versus openness creates friction. Closure: tone is referenced ("guided her") but the final image does not charge it. Static mood throughout trends mid-low. Told-only −0.5, no modulation −0.6, ornamental −0.5, cumulative −1.0 max. Net ~3.9.</comment>
