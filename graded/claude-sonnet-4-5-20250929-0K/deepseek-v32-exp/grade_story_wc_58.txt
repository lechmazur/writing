<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior world is abstract and label-driven ("intimate act," "lonesome splendor") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The projection of Kael's family offers vivid images, but Elara's own emotional stakes remain summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her final realization about healing is told in therapeutic abstractions ("spaces where love once lived") without visible cost or a forfeited path. The piece gestures toward self-recovery in the final section but never dramatizes a choice that narrows options or reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story provides orientation (traveler, garden, autumn, post-departure timeframe) early enough to avoid penalty. However, closure relies on summary epiphany rather than a decisive on-page change: "she understood that healing was a journey" and similar reflective statements replace a dramatized shift in stance or options. The weft thread projection creates vivid images but does not narrow Elara's choices or foreclose a path with felt cost. The ending offers thematic recapitulation rather than a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior material through image or action. No single moment crystallizes cost or alters what Elara can or will do next.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden supplies recurring atmospheric detail (skeletal trees, damp bench, fallen leaves, chill) and the palace carpet thread is handled twice with warm tactile specificity. Sensory selection serves mood well, though the spatial grounding remains somewhat static. The thread's glow and the projection images provide purposeful micro-setting effects that charge key beats, and the final sea vista reweights the garden's enclosure. The environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics, capping the score below 7.0, but it contributes meaningfully to tone and closure's affective texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the geography of healing—is announced early but remains abstract and never faces a concrete test. Elara projects Kael's memories and arrives at insight without reversals, escalation, or visible tradeoffs. The thread ritual succeeds without friction, and no on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path. Pressure is asserted rather than built through linked complications. The story offers a single reflective deepening rather than a tightening that raises cost or forces agency, and coincidence does not complicate because external opposition is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring imagery of the weft thread, absences, and the autumn garden, and the closing lines resist overt moralizing. However, several lines veer into direct thematic statement ("absences are not voids but spaces where love once lived," "healing was a journey through the landscapes of memory") rather than earning insight through image or event. The projection scenes offer vivid particulars, but the final paragraph summarizes the thematic question instead of answering it through a resonant non-literal image. The concept of explained absences is more asserted than dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and perceptual signature is consistent in its lyric, melancholy register. Diction is controlled and matches the focalizer's contemplative stance. However, the voice occasionally slips into elevated abstractions ("geography of healing," "lonesome splendor," "intimate act") that read as thematic scaffolding rather than lived perception under pressure. Psychic distance is consistent but somewhat static; no dialogue appears to test subtext or voice distinction. Filter verbs and contemplative phrasing fit the reflective mode, though peak moments lack rhythmic acceleration or compression that would sharpen pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and free of major grammatical errors, with controlled vocabulary and no obvious typos. However, repetitive thematic stems recur ("lonesome splendor" appears three times, "geography of healing" twice, "shadowed" and "intimate" multiple times) creating minor loops. Several sentences paraphrase adjacent content without adding pressure: "the garden shimmered with vividly descriptive scenes" is immediately followed by descriptions of those scenes, and the final two paragraphs restate Elara's mission in slightly varied language. Stock metaphors ("leaves fell like forgotten memories," "gentle ghost") and elevated abstractions in peak reflective beats dull immediacy. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere without advancing plot or choice. Template cadence and paraphrase loops trigger cumulative penalties within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—writing obituaries for the living via a palace thread that projects presence—offers an unusual synthesis, but the execution relies on familiar lyric-contemplative templates: the lone traveler, the autumn garden as metaphor, the journey-of-healing epiphany. Emotional progression and thematic insights unfold predictably without surprising turns or cost. The weft thread's mechanics are asserted rather than grounded in specific world logic or character-specific use. The story commits to its reflective mode but does not transform the material through risk-taking choices or a non-obvious moral calculus. Removing the exact occupation or thread and substituting a different metaphor vehicle would leave the emotional arc largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation (obituary writer for the living) frames the narrative. However, her choices are minimal: she sits, coils the thread, projects images, and reflects. None of these actions narrow options or alter tactics under pressure. She is an observer of Kael's projection rather than an agent whose decisions create turns. The final realization is summarized rather than enacted through choice. Present and logically consistent, but largely passive and replaceable with a generic contemplative traveler.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The weft thread from a palace carpet is introduced early, handled twice (coiled in her palm, glowing during projection, uncurled at the end), and linked to the projection method. Its warm tactile quality and palace-carpet origin supply specificity, and the thread's dimming after use suggests cost. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a turn; it functions as a ritual prop whose mechanics are asserted rather than tested. The thread participates in the closure image but does not reweight prior material or alter Elara's options. Functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Explained absences is stated as Elara's purpose and method, and the projection of Kael's departed family exemplifies it. The concept shapes the story's thematic frame but does not alter on-page tactics or force a choice with cost. It remains more a descriptive label than a dramatized stake that narrows options. The story illustrates the concept through one ritual but does not test or complicate it. Functional as theme but not as a driver of escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Vividly descriptive appears in the projection scenes (Kael's wife and children, carpet patterns) and in atmospheric rendering of the garden. However, the trait is more an execution quality than a character attribute or object property that constrains action. The vivid images serve mood and illustrate the method but do not enable or foreclose a path with visible cost. Descriptive richness is present but ornamental relative to stakes and choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Intimate appears as a modifier for Elara's task ("intimate act of calling forth," "intimate connection," "intimate moment") but is not enacted through specific, irreplaceable action. The intimacy is asserted in summary rather than dramatized through gesture, dialogue, or a choice that carries relational cost. The descriptor could be replaced with "profound" or "personal" without structural impact. Present as a thematic claim but not as a driver of turns.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Projecting presence is named as Elara's method and enacted once when she weaves the thread into the air to summon Kael's memories. The projection supplies vivid images but its mechanics are not tested, constrained, or varied across beats. It succeeds without friction or cost, and the story does not explore what happens if the method fails or what price it extracts. The method is illustrated but not used to shape escalation or tactics. Functional demonstration but replaceable with a generic ritual.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is introduced early and supplies recurring sensory detail (skeletal trees, damp bench, fallen leaves, chill, distant sea). It frames the entire scene and contributes to tone, and its autumn decay mirrors the theme of endings. However, the garden does not constrain a choice or supply resources that alter Elara's tactics; it remains backdrop rather than active pressure. The sea vista at closure reweights the garden's enclosure but does not change what Elara can do. Essential to atmosphere, less so to causality.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>After the last ship sails is stated as the opening context and explains Kael's isolation, but the timeframe does not impose a ticking clock or constrain Elara's choices. The departure is past; no deadline or temporal pressure shapes her ritual or decision-making. The element supplies backstory stakes for Kael but does not function as an active force in Elara's present. Present in setup, absent in development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Understanding the geography of healing is Elara's declared purpose, framing the story thematically. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between desire and cost. Elara's own need for healing is mentioned late and in summary, and no on-page moment tests her commitment or forces a trade-off. The motivation shapes the reflective arc but does not drive escalation or closure with visible stakes. Functional as theme, weak as dramatized want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lonesome splendor is named three times and operationalized through the shadowed garden's melancholy beauty and Elara's solitary ritual. The tone is coherent across beats, supporting the reflective register and autumn imagery. It modulates subtly (the projection's warmth, the final sea's calm) without breaking mood. The tone charges the final image and reinforces theme, though it remains somewhat static rather than escalating with pressure. Consistent and purposeful, contributing meaningfully to closure's affective resonance.</comment>
