<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical claims ("to transform the enigma of existence into a tangible path") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The mechanical arm is gestural furniture—described via scorpion simile and gear-twitching—but never constrains a choice or reveals character through micro-decisions. The opponent arrives as pure shadow, speaks one line, and the "duel" dissolves into metaphor ("each strike a syllogism") without dramatized stakes or visible cost that forecloses a path. The final "disarmament" via scroll revelation reads as convenient plot resolution rather than earned character change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is prompt: philosopher, atrium, mechanical arm, sundial puzzle by ~100 words. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration ("we seek the same truth") but the shift from rivalry to collaboration is told rather than shown—no on-page cost, no foreclosed path, no tactical trade-off. The scroll's content ("philosophical accord") is summary, and the fencing becomes pure metaphor without causal escalation. The inferred lens wavers between Causal (sundial puzzle solving) and Accumulative/Textural (philosophical debate motifs), landing weakly on neither; the ending asserts harmony without dramatizing the price or crystallizing new options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glass atrium, brook, sundial, and needle card are vividly named and recur across the text. However, setting remains postcard: the atrium's "prismatic shards" and "dignified chaos" are declared rather than constraining movement or choice. The sundial's hidden compartment clicks open conveniently, and the brook's murmur is atmospheric rather than tactical. Micro-setting credit: the needle card is handled twice (traced, inserted into sundial groove), but its measurement function is expository rather than a live constraint that alters an on-page decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the sundial to determine duel terms—is signaled early but resolved via convenient mechanism (needle insertion → compartment opens) rather than protagonist struggle. The fencing itself is pure metaphor ("each strike a syllogism") with no tactical escalation, traded blows, or visible cost. The final "disarmament" via scroll revelation tells us the true destination was "understanding," but this is asserted rather than earned through narrowed options or a choice that forecloses a path. Under a Causal lens, the sundial puzzle lacks because/therefore linkage to the duel; under Accumulative, the philosophical motifs do not tighten or deepen with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Questions into destinations" recurs as label rather than emerging from dramatized struggle. The final image—stepping beside the brook, sundial standing witness, needle card "lighter"—offers lyric closure but the thematic shift from rivalry to collaboration is told in summary ("we seek the same truth") rather than paid for through specific loss or renunciation. The "dignified chaos → harmony" arc is declared without on-page friction, and the scroll's "hidden overture" proposing collaboration arrives as convenient plot device rather than resonant reconfiguration of prior material. Prompt language ("turn questions into destinations," "diplomatically fierce") echoes undigested in the text.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("geometric sonata," "syllogism," "testament to the power of a mind in motion") and occasionally slips into abstraction that distances the reader from Kaelen's lived experience. The opponent's single line of dialogue ("Shall we begin?") and Kaelen's reply are functional but generic. Filter verbs ("seemed to mock," "felt lighter") cluster in reflective beats without adding urgency. Perceptual signature is thin—Kaelen notices philosophical abstractions more than tactile, embodied detail under pressure. Syntactic variety is present, but metaphor-heavy passages in the fencing beat dilute immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates adequately. However, loop and scaffold debt accumulates: "Kaelen's mechanical arm… twitched as he calculated" / "His mechanical arm… raising the sword" repeat the arm-as-gesture without new information; "dignified chaos" appears thrice without evolving meaning; "the questions of yesterday now charting a course for tomorrow" and "turn questions into destinations" are near-synonyms. Metaphor density in the fencing beat ("each strike a syllogism, each parry a counterargument") stacks without causal linkage, reducing clarity. The final paragraph lists resolutions ("lighter," "journey ahead gleamed," "testament") rather than advancing through image. Copy is clean; no typos or tense errors. Deduction for paraphrase loops and metaphor stacking in peak beat: −0.6 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The philosopher-duelist premise and mechanical-arm detail are genre-familiar; the story does not transform them through specific lived consequence or non-obvious moral calculus. The sundial puzzle, needle card as cipher tool, and "hidden overture" scroll are inventive props, but their resolution is mechanical rather than character-driven. The fencing-as-philosophical-debate conceit is vivid but remains metaphor without fresh tactical or emotional stakes. The ending's harmony ("we seek the same truth") opts for the safety middle, avoiding bold cost or stance crystallization. Transformation test: swap names and shift setting to a monastery with a coded manuscript, and the arc holds unchanged—freshness is surface-level.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Kaelen appears throughout and makes decisions (traces sundial, inserts needle, offers scroll, disarms opponent). However, these are plot-service moves rather than choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. The mechanical arm is described but never constrains a tactic or reveals character through micro-choice under pressure. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but replaceable with a standard able-bodied philosopher without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The needle card appears in three beats: pocket mention (setup), traced with the sundial (middle), and "felt lighter" (ending reprise). Its measurement function enables the sundial puzzle solution, shaping one key turn. However, the middle use is more summary than dramatized action, and the ending weight-change is told rather than tied to visible cost. Two-gate minimum met (setup, payoff); middle development is present but weak. Swappability: a generic lockpick or stylus could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "hidden overture" is named early, drives the sundial puzzle (middle), and the scroll's proposal of philosophical accord shapes the ending revelation. It alters tactics (Kaelen must decode before the duel) and redefines the rivalry's stakes at closure. All three gates met. However, the concept is more plot device than lived pressure—its "hidden" nature is convenient rather than costly, and the collaboration offer resolves conflict via summary rather than forcing a choice with felt cost. Specificity is moderate; "secret proposal" could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Diplomatically fierce" is declared in exposition ("a trait honed in courts") and mentioned at the opponent's arrival ("his diplomatically fierce nature emerging"), but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. No middle beat where the trait forces a trade-off or tactical choice. Setup present, ending cameo, but no development gate. Label-only use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fencing is signaled early, occupies the climactic beat, and the final "disarmament" is the story's closure action. The duel bridges the puzzle resolution and the philosophical accord reveal, driving two beats (middle, ending). However, the fencing itself is abstract metaphor ("each strike a syllogism") rather than tactile blow-by-blow that narrows options. Swappability: a debate or chess match could replace it with modest rewrites. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The sundial and its coded angles are introduced early, traced in the puzzle-solving beat (middle), and the hidden compartment mechanism delivers the scroll that shapes the ending. The method enables the key turn and is specific to this story's logic. All three gates met. However, the mechanics are told ("each needle a tiny gauge") rather than dramatized with trial-and-error or cost, and the solution (needle insertion → click) is convenient. Irreplaceability is moderate; a coded manuscript or cipher wheel could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The atrium and brook are named early and recur (prismatic light, final walk beside the brook). However, the setting supplies atmosphere rather than constraining choices or altering tactics. The glass walls and sundial pedestal are stage dressing; no spatial choreography where proximity, access, or environment pressure a decision. Setup and ending reprise present, but no middle development gate where setting enables or blocks an action. Postcard description without tactical role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"While waiting" frames the opening and the opponent's arrival marks the shift to action. However, time is vague—no clock tightens Kaelen's decoding urgency, and the phrase "time slipping away" is atmospheric rather than a live constraint that alters tactics. The timeframe signals setup and loosely brackets the plot, but does not shape middle choices or charge the ending. Setup gate met weakly; development and payoff gates missing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn questions into destinations" is declared early, repeated mid-story ("He aimed to do the same with thought"), and restated at the ending ("had turned questions into destinations"). It frames Kaelen's puzzle-solving and the final revelation. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—no moment where the pursuit of this goal forces a sacrifice or trade-off. Setup, middle label, and ending reprise present, but friction between want and cost is absent. Lyric recurrence reweights moderately but lacks on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Dignified chaos" is named early ("a place of dignified chaos where order and tumult danced"), recurs mid-story ("the dignified chaos of their clash"), and resolves at closure ("dignified chaos had given birth to order"). The tone labels the atrium's atmosphere and modulates with the duel's intensity, then settles into harmony. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. However, the phrase is more thematic label than felt texture—diction and rhythm do not enact "chaos" in syntax or imagery; instead, the prose remains measured throughout. The tone charges the final image moderately but is told rather than embodied in sentence-level urgency.</comment>
