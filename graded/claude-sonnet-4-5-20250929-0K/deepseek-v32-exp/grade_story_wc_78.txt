<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prophet remains a conceptual vessel rather than a contradictory human under pressure. His motivation "to turn obstacles into instruments" is stated and demonstrated but never tested by failure or internal friction—he succeeds smoothly at every turn. Embodied emotion is absent; we see technical actions (striking, drawing, naming) without visceral cost or genuine struggle. The wave encounter offers no felt stakes because we never doubt his mastery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through layered sound-making actions toward a final protective sphere. Orientation anchors who and where early enough, though "the one known as" delays proper grounding. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the wave harmonized into the symphony), but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt—the prophet "stands panting" yet the orchard was never truly threatened, undercutting stakes. The "restless energy" and "uneasy harmony" are asserted rather than earned through dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The floating orchard and blue-hour setting are vivid and specific, anchoring who/where/when early. However, the driftwood raft and crystalline resonator remain decorative; neither constrains a choice or evolves under pressure. The wave is described but its threat feels rhetorical—spatial choreography of the "fragile circle" never translates into tactical limits. Sensory detail skews heavily visual ("indigo expanse," "swirling nimbus") without embodied immediacy during peak action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting the orchard from the wave—is signaled but never feels urgent because the prophet's gift ensures success without trade-off. The "silence predicted by the clouds" is transformed but that obstacle vanishes before applying pressure. No live option is foreclosed; the wave encounter adds complexity to the music without altering the prophet's trajectory or costing him anything legible on the page. Agency defaults to competence display rather than hard choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme of transmuting obstacles into instruments emerges through repeated demonstration (silence, wave) but remains conceptual rather than tested by failure or moral friction. The final image—prophet smiling, work never done—states the thematic loop without reweighting prior material or introducing ambiguity. "Restless euphony" is named multiple times yet the prose itself maintains steady lyricism without modulating under stress, creating a tonal mismatch with declared unease.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout. However, diction frequently exceeds the immediate perceptual frame: "fractal generating method he had perfected," "sympathetic resonance," "nimbus" read as external vocabulary rather than the prophet's lived idiom. Psychic distance stays remote even during the wave climax—"he felt a surge of purpose" tells rather than inhabiting the moment. No dialogue; the act of "dubbing" layers could have offered voice texture but remains summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting throughout: "fragile, luminous dome," "shifting greys of the horizon," "ever-evolving lattice of harmony," "million ringing droplets" stack modifiers and abstract metaphors without propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: the prophet's gift to "interpret cloud movements" is restated multiple times without new detail. Template cadence: "He stood…," "He moved…," "He continued…," "He raised…" across five sentences in the final third. Register drifts into technical jargon ("fractal generator," "sympathetic resonance," "sketched resonance") that flattens voice. The closure beat—"knowing his work was never done"—summarizes rather than imaging cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The floating orchard and sound-based magic offer surface novelty, but the plot defaults to competence demonstration without risk. The prophet encounters obstacles (silence, wave) and transmutes them flawlessly; the transformation test fails because stakes and emotional arc could be preserved with any magical craftsman and any medium. "Sketched resonance" and "fractal generating" read as prompt-label ornament rather than grounded systems with limits. No proximity to famous work, but the safe execution and wish-fulfillment resolution undercut originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; he interprets clouds, strikes the resonator, names layers, and meets the wave. However, no choice alters his trajectory—each action succeeds as planned. Missing middle development: between setup and wave climax, his decisions are procedural rather than under contested pressure. At closure he smiles and tucks away the mallet, a summary gesture rather than a causal turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Signaled in the first third ("drew a single, worn xylophone mallet"), used in two distinct beats (striking the resonator mid-story, striking it again for the wave), and present in the final image ("tucked the xylophone mallet back into his pouch"). The "worn" and "smooth from use" details suggest history, and the final strike with "all his strength" differentiates intensity. Swappable with any percussion tool without major revision; the mallet's unique properties do not constrain choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sketched resonance" is introduced mid-first-third ("the concept of sketched resonance") and demonstrated once: charcoal lines capture silence, slate touched to resonator. The slate "seemed to glow" and is noted "fading" at the end, but the concept does not recur or shape a second beat. The mechanics—drawing absence, transferring it—are told rather than tested under pressure. Functional but replaceable with any symbolic capture method.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Introduced early ("his unique gift was to interpret cloud movements") and used twice: reading the coming silence and mapping the wave's energy in the nimbus. Both instances enable action (building the protective sphere), providing causal pressure. However, the attribute never fails or costs him—it functions as reliable exposition rather than a constrained tool. No visible trade-off or price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Dub" appears mid-story when the prophet names emerging sound layers ("Zephyr's Hum," "Root Thrum," "Tide's Pulse"), granting them "identity and power through his voice." This single beat does not recur or shape the wave climax. The naming is procedural; the layers do not resist or require sacrifice. Mentioned again in closure reflection ("dubbing the emerging layers") as summary. Swappable with any act of intentional shaping.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Signaled early ("the fractal generating method he had perfected") and invoked in two beats: the initial resonator strike and the wave encounter. The method's mechanics—"self-repeating patterns of vibration from a single strike"—remain abstract; we do not see how it shapes his choices or imposes limits. It amplifies his success without friction. Present at closure in the ongoing "euphony" but not causally active in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Introduced immediately ("vast circle of lashed driftwood… afloat on the open seas") and the orchard's "fragile circle" is noted during the wave. However, the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics. The driftwood trunks and sea-shells are tapped for sound but any environment could provide percussion. The raft's fragility is declared but not tested; the wave "harmonizes" without structural cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"The blue hour settled" opens the piece and "the blue hour deepened" marks the wave approach. Time does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure is felt. The transition from "luminous dome between day and night" to "indigo expanse" is atmospheric rather than tactical. The timeframe could be any dusk without altering the prophet's actions or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Stated early ("his purpose, carved into his soul… was to turn obstacles into instruments") and demonstrated twice (silence, wave). The motivation drives all action but is never conflicted or tested by failure. No friction between want and cost—he succeeds at each transformation. The final smile and "knowing his work was never done" restate the motivation without reweighting it through sacrifice or doubt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Restless euphony" is named twice in the second half ("fueled by a restless euphony," "The euphony continued, restless and beautiful") and described as "uneasy harmony." However, the prose rhythm remains consistently lyrical and elevated without modulating under pressure. The wave climax sustains the same ornate diction as the opening, creating tonal flatness. The asserted restlessness does not charge the final image or deepen through turns.</comment>
