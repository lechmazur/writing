<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (fold grief into cranes) is declared but never tested by competing impulses or meaningful sacrifice. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves through prescribed actions (polish, fold, reunite) without genuine struggle or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The shadow reunion at the end feels unmotivated by prior escalation; no on-page tension forces her toward or away from reattachment. Interiority relies on abstract labels ("hollow ache," "luminous torment") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed and murky; who/where/when remain vague through the opening third, requiring reader assembly from scattered fantasy nouns. The closure—shadow merging with her feet—arrives without causal linkage to prior gem-polishing or crane-folding beats; the piece declares the ritual complete but does not dramatize a choice, renunciation, or cost that makes the reunion legible as earned change. Drive lens wavers between accumulative (polishing, folding repetition) and causal (ritual completion) without teaching a coherent pattern or paying off the ambiguity at closure. No visible price or option foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating island, glass basilica, and tea garden are vividly described with sensory detail (transparent walls refracting rainbows, tea leaves rustling). However, setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Elara's movements through garden and basilica do not meaningfully narrow options or charge the final image. The shadow's spatial position (garden's edge, mimicking her) does not alter her tactics or force a choice. Spatial choreography inside the basilica (climbing to higher chamber, selecting orbs) remains clear but ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reunite with detached shadow—is signaled early but never escalates through genuine pressure. Elara experiences no setback, competing obligation, or resource limit; she completes each step (polish, fold) in linear succession without resistance. The "descends while ascending" sensation is told as torment but does not constrain her movement or force a tactical choice. No reversal or deepening alters options; the shadow simply drifts back when the final crane is folded, a coincidental resolution rather than protagonist-driven closure with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (transmuting grief into hope/art) is stated directly rather than earned through scene particulars. The cranes glow and stir as symbolic payoff but do not reweight prior material—the transformation is asserted, not dramatized through choices or trade-offs that reveal complexity. The final line ("luminous memory of love enduring beyond loss") moralizes rather than offering a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext is minimal; the gem-polishing and origami operate as transparent metaphors without ambiguity or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent but generic ("brilliant, painful clarity that seared her soul," "wave of release washed over her"), lacking character-particular perceptual signature. Sentence openings and syntactic patterns vary adequately. Psychic distance is constant; no purposeful modulation under stress. The narrator's way of noticing feels interchangeable rather than selective or biased in Elara-specific ways. No dialogue present to assess voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "transmute sorrow into hope" / "grief into art"; "polished gem" / "polishing method" / "gem polishing" recur without functional variation. Template cadence clusters in the middle third ("She polished… She felt… She finished…"). Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching ("luminous torment," "captive fireflies," "paper wings glowing," "fleet of luminous cranes")—metaphors stack without coherent vehicle logic. Register drifts into abstraction ("luminous torment defined her existence") during peak beats. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content or narrate insignificant micro-movements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise (crafting origami to heal loss) follows a familiar template: symbolic ritual as grief therapy. Fantasy trappings (floating island, dream orbs, detached shadow) function as ornamental reskins rather than constraints that force non-obvious choices. The "descends while ascending" attribute is told but not integrated into action logic. Emotional arc (loss → ritual → restoration) is predictable and resolved without complication. No turn or final reconfiguration surprises in hindsight; removal of the glass basilica or gem polishing would leave the emotional sequence unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her choices do not create turns—she executes a preordained ritual without deviation, setback, or competing desire that alters tactics. Early setup present; beats involve her polishing and folding; closure shows shadow reuniting. However, swappable with "determined healer" or similar archetype; craftiness is asserted ("crafty lantern maker") but not demonstrated through ingenuity under pressure. No specific cost tied to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The glass basilica is described vividly in the opening third and Elara enters it to work with dream orbs. Two distinct beats (entering, climbing to higher chamber) involve the structure. However, it functions as static venue rather than evolving constraint—its properties (transparent walls, dream storage) do not narrow options or charge the closure image. The shadow reunion occurs outside; the basilica is absent from the ending. Swappable with any sanctuary setting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Dream recording is mentioned (orbs hold dreams, Elara refines them via polishing) but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. The ritual's success does not depend on the dream content; polishing is described but its mechanics do not constrain or enable choices. The concept appears as world-building detail rather than active pressure. Present in setup and middle beats but ornamental; closure (shadow reunion) does not hinge on dream work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Descends while ascending" is told twice ("descending while ascending the basilica's steps," "ascending in skill… descending deeper into emotional vulnerability") but never constrains on-page action—Elara continues to climb and work without tactical adjustment or visible cost tied to the paradox. The attribute functions as poetic description rather than dramatized pressure. No closure linkage; the shadow reunion does not depend on this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Transform" appears in the action element and is invoked multiple times: transforming dreams into narratives, grief into cranes, turbulent to serene. Setup is early; middle beats involve polishing and folding as transformation acts. The final crane triggers the shadow's return, providing closure participation. However, the mechanism is vague—polishing smooths facets and folding absorbs pain without specific cost or constraint. Functional across beats but the transformation could be replaced by "heal" or "channel" with minor wording edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Gem polishing is signaled early (opening line) and described in middle beats ("rubbing the gem with soft cloth," "smoothing the gem's facets," "meticulous process"). Two distinct beats show her polishing different gems. However, the method's mechanics do not meaningfully constrain her—she completes each polish without setback, resource limit, or tactical choice. Closure mentions polishing the final gem but the shadow reunion is triggered by the final crane, not the gem work. Swappable with "refining" or "purifying."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden is described with sensory detail (perfumed earth, tea shrubs rustling, leaves shimmering) and appears in setup and as backdrop throughout. The shadow lingers at the garden's edge. However, the garden does not constrain Elara's choices or provide resources that affect outcome—she moves freely between garden and basilica. Closure occurs outside the basilica with no garden element shaping the reunion. Present but ornamental; postcard-level description without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the shadow detaches" is established in the opening third and the narrative remains in that window. However, time is elastic and untracked—no clock or deadline tightens decisions. The text notes "time had become elastic, stretching moments into eternities" but this does not constrain her pace or force trade-offs. Dusk falls as a scenic marker, not a tactical pressure. The reunion timing is arbitrary; nothing indicates why it happens after this specific number of cranes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation to fold one thousand origami cranes is stated early and drives Elara's on-page actions (polishing gems, folding cranes). Multiple beats show her folding, and the final crane triggers closure. However, the desire is not dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible cost—she never hesitates, questions the ritual, or sacrifices a competing goal. The number "one thousand" is declared but not tracked; the final crane is unnumbered. Functional desire without friction; told motivation that shapes action but lacks on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" is invoked explicitly ("This luminous torment defined her existence," "luminous torment intensified") and the tone blends beauty (rainbows, glowing cranes, luminous orbs) with pain (ache, searing, agony). Coherent across beats. However, the tone does not modulate meaningfully under pressure—Elara's perception remains equally ornate during polishing, folding, and reunion. The final image shifts to relief ("torment faded, leaving only the luminous memory") but the tonal charge at closure is soft; the paradox resolves rather than deepening.</comment>
