<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated clearly (free the echoes) but her internal contradiction or struggle never materializes on the page—she executes her plan without genuine cost or hesitation. The "borrowed time aged her slightly" arrives as告知 summary rather than embodied consequence that alters a subsequent choice. Her occupation as illustrator is ornamental; it never constrains a decision or filters perception in a character-specific way. Interiority remains generic ("peace in her heart") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers poetic images and echoes "born" as a thematic motif. However, closure lacks visible cost—Elara completes her task, smiles, returns home with "peace," and the world "resolves into harmony." The "aged her slightly" is summary-only and does not foreclose a path or reweight prior stakes on the page. Orientation is present early (rooftop canals, giant's nap timeframe, infinity pendant) so the Orientation Test is waived, but the ending offers Conceptual Repricing without undeniable pressure or felt price, failing the closure gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system and infinity pendant are named repeatedly and anchor the spatial frame. The canals "stretch like taffy," "waver like a mirage," and provide transit, but they do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara rows unhindered. The pendant glows and hums at key beats (beginning, middle, end), charging the final image with its "promise of cycles yet to be sculpted," which creates a lyric reprise. Micro-setting (boat, oar, water) appears but remains largely decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncage the echoes—is signaled early, but escalation is absent. Elara dips an oar, borrows time, sculpts a key, and succeeds without complication, friction, or trade-off that narrows live options. The "giant's snore" timer never triggers consequences, and "borrowed time demanded repayment" arrives as a micro lurch with no dramatized price. The piece lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening; no reversal alters tactics or forecloses a path with on-page cost. Agency at closure is completion, not renunciation or endurance with felt stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Theme—cycles, time's fluidity, liberation—emerges from the infinity symbol and echo imagery, avoiding overt thesis. The final image ("echoes would carry her tale through time") attempts resonance but is weakened by the absence of cost or complication. "She had borrowed time to uncage beauty, and in doing so, found peace" edges toward a stated moral rather than letting the particulars speak. The ending offers lyric recurrence (pendant, echoes, infinity) but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure, missing the non-literal answer test.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries some texture ("taffy in the sun," "threads of fate") but frequently slips into generic lyricism ("peace in her heart," "testament to time's fluid nature") that could apply to any mystical quest. Perceptual signature is weak—Elara's illustrator background does not shape what she notices or how she frames observations. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") cluster without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in several beats. No dialogue is present to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The place where echoes are born was no longer a mystery but a memory" restates prior content without added pressure; "echoes burst forth" / "echoes settled" / "echoes sang" cycles through synonym churn. Template cadence appears in runs: "She [verb]" and "Elara [verb]" openings repeat across at least eight sentences. Stock metaphors ("threads of fate," "like taffy in the sun") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew," "she reflected") dull line-level momentum. Applying −0.6 for loops/cadence and −0.4 for filter stacks in peak beats, plus −0.3 for stock phrasing, totaling approximately −1.3 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Core premise—time-sculptor frees mystical echoes during a giant's nap—combines fantasy tropes without a fresh angle or non-obvious synthesis. The rooftop canals and infinity pendant feel ornamental rather than integral to causality. Emotional arc (seek, find, succeed, return with peace) follows a template quest structure with median "safe" choices that avoid risk. The giant wakes unaware, echoes are free, and Elara gains fulfillment without complication—no friction, ambiguity, or bold perspectival choice heightens stakes or transforms the familiar material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and her occupation is named, but "natural history illustrator" never constrains a choice or filters perception in a character-specific way. The trait is ornamental; she could be any mystical practitioner with minor edits. Introduced early (setup ✓), absent in middle pressure (development ✗), returns in final paragraph as "Her illustrations would depict this miracle" (weak payoff). Two gates met but no causal pressure; cap ~6.0 per gate model, then apply −0.5 ornamental, −0.8 swappability, and −0.3 summary-only, landing ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Appears in opening beat (cold, hummed with power), middle beat (glowed, pulling hours), and ending beat (cooled, resting, hummed softly). Three touches across setup/development/payoff; all three gates met. However, the pendant enables time-sculpting without visible trade-off or cost tied specifically to its use—no choice is narrowed by its properties. Applying +0.8 early signal, +1.4 three beats, +0.7 closure linkage, then −0.5 ornamental (description without constraint), −0.4 swappability (any magical focus could serve), totaling ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Signaled in opening ("duration of a giant's nap"), referenced at middle ("interrupted cadence made the world stutter"), and ending ("interrupted cadence resolved into harmony"). Present across setup/development/payoff (all three gates). The concept shapes atmosphere but not on-page tactics—Elara's choices do not shift because the cadence is interrupted; it is a thematic label for the time distortion. Applying +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats, +0.7 closure, then −0.7 ornamental (theme claim without action pressure), −0.3 label-only, totaling ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph 5 (~20% mark; setup ✓), used in middle beats to sculpt time and "borrow hours" (development ✓), and closure references "cycles yet to be sculpted" (payoff ✓). All three gates met. The attribute enables the plot but does not impose visible cost or constrain a choice—she sculpts time successfully without trade-off until a summary "aged her slightly." Applying +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats, +0.5 causal pressure (enables but minimal constraint), +0.7 closure, then −0.8 summary-only cost, −0.4 swappability (any time-magic label could replace), totaling ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Goal stated early (setup ✓), executed in climax beat ("unleashed the sculpted time, aiming to uncage them… Echoes burst forth"; development ✓), and ending confirms "uncaged echoes sang" (payoff ✓). All three gates met. The action drives the central beat and shapes closure, but it is executed without complication or friction—she uncages, they burst free, done. Applying +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats, +1.0 causal pressure (central act), +1.2 closure linkage, then −0.7 swappability (could be "free" or "release" with minor edits), −0.8 resolves problem without cost, totaling ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 10 (~40% mark; late setup −0.3), method is named and used in middle beats ("dipped an oar… feeling the seconds ripple away," "borrowing time from the stagnant air," "borrowed time was finite"), and ending states "borrowed time demanded repayment" (all three gates met). The mechanics appear but remain vague—how borrowing works or what it costs is summary-only. Applying +0.4 late setup, +1.4 three beats, +0.5 causal (enables but opaque), +0.7 closure, then −0.8 summary-only, −0.4 swappability, totaling ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Named in opening and mentioned across multiple beats ("navigated," "canals stretching," "rooftop canals gleamed," "passed through the towers"). Setup ✓, weak development (Elara rows without obstacle), payoff ✓ (she passes back through). The canals provide transit but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—they are postcard backdrop. Applying +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats (transit out/back), +0.4 closure (mentioned in final third), then −0.8 ornamental, −0.6 swappability (any mystical city transit), totaling ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Introduced early ("duration of a giant's nap"), referenced at middle ("giant's snore rumbled distantly, a timer"), and ending ("giant, now awake"). Setup ✓, weak development (timer mentioned but never tightens choices), payoff ✓ (giant wakes). The timeframe labels duration but does not create urgency or alter tactics—Elara completes her task and the giant wakes after, with no consequence. Applying +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats, +0.4 closure mention, then −0.8 ornamental (label without pressure), −0.6 swappability (any duration marker), totaling ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Goal stated in opening ("sought the place where echoes are born"), pursued across middle beats, and fulfilled at ending ("place where echoes are born was no longer a mystery"). Setup ✓, development ✓ (drives action), payoff ✓ (achieved). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through friction—Elara wants this "purely" and succeeds without conflicting impulse or cost that tests her commitment. Applying +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats, +0.9 causal (drives pursuit), +1.0 closure, then −0.8 told-only (no friction between want and cost), −0.5 swappability (generic quest goal), totaling ~5.6.</comment>
