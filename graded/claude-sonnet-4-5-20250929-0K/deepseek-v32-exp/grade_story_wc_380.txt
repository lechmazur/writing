<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find deleted memories is clear and sustained, driving her choices from coffee-grounds divination through exhumation to acceptance. Interiority relies heavily on summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene: "she made peace with the pain" tells resolution instead of showing conflicting desires clash. The letters reveal a deliberate self-forgetting, which adds complexity, but the final emotional arc resolves too tidily without visible struggle in the closure moment. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feelings are labeled rather than enacted through specific physical or perceptual detail.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: coffee grounds motivate the journey, whale catalyzes gravity shifts, exhumation reveals letters that restore memory. Orientation anchors quickly (Elara, docks, dawn, whale-beaching). The closure—memory restoration and peace-making—lands on the page, but felt cost is diffuse: "she felt lighter" and placing wildflowers are gestures, not a foreclosed path or visible sacrifice that reweights prior stakes. The because/therefore chain holds through the middle but the ending drifts toward summary ("her journey was complete") rather than a decisive image or renunciation with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting detail is vivid and integrated: fluctuating gravity pools anchor action (boots sinking, floating with the jar), the salt-crystal chamber's halite walls and falling shards create atmosphere, and gravity's erratic pull constrains movement throughout. Micro-setting—the jar buried near a salt cube—drives the exhumation beat. Sensory selection is strong (bitter coffee, gleaming walls, thick air), though some passages lean decorative ("leviathan of gleaming silence"). The salt chamber participates in closure by supplying the physical site where memory-objects wait, satisfying the constraint test for higher band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where deleted memories go—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when coffee grounds map the path inland, and a second when the jar is unearthed, revealing letters that restore memory. However, escalation is largely linear: each step (brew coffee, read grounds, walk to chamber, dig, read letters) proceeds without genuine reversals or competing pressures. The resolution hinges on discovery rather than a choice under pressure; Elara does not sacrifice or foreclose an alternative path. Cost is conceptual (confronting forgotten grief) but not dramatized as a trade-off or visible loss in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory's persistence and the body's gravity—emerges through concrete images: whale, gravity pockets, salt preservation, pressed flowers. The ending offers a resonant answer: "deleted memories go nowhere, they simply are, waiting to be rediscovered," which reweights prior material. However, the final two paragraphs veer toward thematic summary and moralizing ("the elements of her world once again in harmony"), diluting the image-driven resonance. The wildflower-at-each-lamp gesture is evocative but arrives as coda rather than charged choice, and "gleaming silence" recurs as atmospherics without shifting meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature (lantern-lighter noticing gravity through boot-feel, reading coffee grounds) is character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("leviathan of gleaming silence," "cathedral for her sorrow") that sits uneasily with a dock-worker's immediate sensory world. Psychic distance widens in the final third, moving from embodied action to abstract summary ("the journey was complete"). No dialogue on the page. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "understood") cluster in reflective passages but remain voice-consistent; overall clarity holds despite some tonal unevenness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong; spatial choreography tracks through docks, fields, cavern. Overwriting appears in stacked metaphors and elevated phrasing: "leviathan of gleaming silence," "cathedral for her sorrow," "tiny, steady gravity in the vast, fluctuating dark." Several paraphrase loops: "gleaming silence" recurs four times without functional variation; "fluctuating gravity" and "pockets of gravity" alternate as synonyms across adjacent beats. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "The whale would return… Elara would continue… knowing where…" creates rhythmic monotony. Information density is moderate; some sentences do double duty (gravity constrains movement while advancing plot) but reflective passages summarize rather than propel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-as-gravity and salt-crystal preservation offers a fresh angle, and coffee-ground divination as method is specific. However, the core arc—character unearths forgotten past, confronts grief, achieves peace—follows a familiar template without bold transformation. The whale catalyst and gravity fluctuations are vivid but function primarily as atmospheric enablers rather than driving irreversible choices. Emotional resolution is tidy and affirming, avoiding the moral ambiguity or risky stakes that would elevate originality. Specificity (lantern-lighter, halite chamber) adds texture but does not fundamentally transform the memory-recovery premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara (dock-side lantern lighter) anchors every beat: she reads coffee grounds, walks inland, exhumes the jar, reads letters, places wildflowers at lamps. Her occupation matters early (lighting lamps amid gravity shifts) and returns at closure (placing wildflowers at lamp bases), creating a purposeful frame. However, key decisions—brew coffee, follow map, dig—are linear responses to discovered information rather than agonized choices under conflicting pressures. She is present across all three gates (setup, middle, closure) and her final action reweights the opening image, but agency tilts toward discovery rather than transformative choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressed wildflowers appear in the opening (carried in Elara's pocket), midpoint (found in the buried jar alongside letters), and closure (placed at each lamp as memorial). The object's meaning evolves: first a relic from missing time, then proof of deliberate forgetting, finally a peace-offering memorial. Specificity is high—colors faded, form intact, from cliffs where ashes were scattered. The flowers shape the emotional arc and charge the final image, though they do not constrain a tactical choice or alter agency. Strong causal and lyric presence across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Pockets of gravity constrain movement throughout (boots sinking, floating in the chamber, lanterns swinging), shaping tactics and atmosphere. Gravity fluctuations are tied causally to the whale's beaching and thematically mirror memory's hidden/revealed pattern. The concept participates in closure by enabling Elara's float when she holds the jar, a physical manifestation of release. However, gravity does not force a binary choice or foreclose an alternative path; it complicates action without creating irreversible stakes. Present across setup, middle, and ending; essential to world logic and theme but not indispensable to plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Gravity "fluctuates mysteriously" throughout, constraining Elara's movement and making the journey "a clumsy dance." The trait is signaled early (lanterns swing, boots sink/lighten) and recurs in the chamber (pinned down, released into float). It adds atmosphere and mild physical challenge but does not force a trade-off or create visible cost: Elara adapts without losing resources or facing danger. The fluctuation enables her symbolic float at the moment of memory restoration, a poetic touch, but the mystery itself is not resolved or leveraged for escalation. Functional across beats but replaceable with another environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Exhumation is the story's structural hinge: setup (coffee grounds map the buried object), middle (digging near the salt cube under fluctuating gravity), and closure (unearthed jar triggers memory restoration and peace). The action is irreplaceable—without the dig, no letters, no resolution. The exhumation involves specific physical struggle (trowel striking the jar, gravity making dirt heavy then light) and carries thematic weight (unearthing history, not just objects). The word "exhume" itself recurs, reinforcing its centrality. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; cost is emotional rather than tactical, keeping it below the indispensable band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Coffee-ground divination (Elara's secret practice, tied to "old tales") is signaled in the first third, executed on-page mid-story (bitter cup, swirling lines, map inland), and its result—the chamber location—shapes the entire second half. The method is character-specific and world-integrated. However, the mechanics are straightforward (read, follow map) without complication or failure that would raise stakes. The grounds do not reappear at closure; their role is purely instrumental. Present across setup and middle, enabling the exhumation, but swappable with another divination method (tarot, dreams) without major revision. Solid functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The salt-crystal growing chamber is introduced at midpoint, supplies the site for exhumation, and its properties (halite preservation, intense gravity pockets) constrain action and support theme. The chamber is irreplaceable: salt preservation justifies why memory-objects survive intact, and the cavern's gravity enables Elara's symbolic float. Sensory detail (glittering walls, falling shards, thick air) is vivid and integrated. The chamber shapes two key beats (approach, dig) and its "gleaming silence" charges the final reflection. Strong causal and thematic presence; falls short of indispensable because the exhumation itself could occur in another pressurized location with minor rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The whale beaching occurs at dawn in the opening sentence and is revisited at closure ("The whale would return to the sea with the tide"). The timeframe anchors the inciting event—gravity shifts begin after the whale beaches—and provides a gentle clock (the whale will leave with the tide). However, elapsed time is vague: Elara lights lamps, brews coffee "that evening," digs "for what felt like hours," returns to docks at "night," with no urgency or deadline shaping choices. The whale functions more as catalyst and bookend than active pressure. Present across setup and closure but does not tighten tactics or escalate stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to find where deleted memories go—is established early ("a private, gnawing thing") and drives every major choice: practicing divination, following the map, exhuming the jar, reading the letters. The motivation is specific (a storm stole part of her past) and conflicted (she discovers she chose to forget). Friction emerges when the letters reveal deliberate self-erasure rather than theft, adding complexity. The motivation resolves at closure when Elara understands and accepts the answer. However, the final peace-making feels summarized rather than tested; no scene forces her to choose between remembering and forgetting again. Strong causal work across all beats; cost is more reflective than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Gleaming silence" recurs four times (whale, chamber twice, final lantern), establishing a consistent tonal layer. The phrase anchors atmosphere and modulates subtly: initially eerie (beached whale), then reverent (chamber as cathedral), finally peaceful (steady lantern flame). However, the tone is largely static—contemplative throughout—without sharp contrast or pressure-driven shift. The final image uses "gleaming silence" to close the frame, reweighting the opening, but the repetition feels more decorative than causally charged. The tone supports theme and setting but does not constrain choice or escalate stakes. Purposeful reprise with lyric function but limited causal force.</comment>
