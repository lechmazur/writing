<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("deep-seated need to discover meaning in the margins") but never generates an on-page contradiction or cost. Her actions—tracing, chalking, checking—read as competent task completion without visible struggle or trade-off. The "carefully inventive grace" and "carefully inventive approach" are label-only repetitions that do not constrain a choice. No internal conflict dramatizes competing impulses; she simply executes her process and feels "accomplishment."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Situational (clandestine resistance work under surveillance pressure), but no on-page reversal or tightening occurs—Elara discovers no obstruction, makes no adaptation, and seals the letter as planned. The ending ("ready for the next challenge") is pure momentum statement without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; no felt cost appears on the page. The single mention of a suspected compromise ("Orion's identity might be compromised") is told in reflection and does not alter present tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The golden arcade is vividly described with selective sensory detail (brass arches, smooth tiles, dawn light) and the ebony clipboard recurs as a tactile anchor. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—it functions as atmospheric backdrop. Spatial choreography is clear. The micro-setting (arcade, clipboard, chalk) is present but does not pressure tactics or charge the closure image beyond decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ensuring safe passage of the letter—is signaled early but never tested. No obstacle, near-miss, or complication appears; Elara completes each step without friction. The told reference to Orion's potential compromise does not generate an on-page choice or visible price. The resolution is a planned action (dropping the letter) with no agency, renunciation, or cost dramatized. Pressure remains flat across the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of resistance through tactile communication versus digital surveillance is coherent and emerges through concrete detail (surface mail, chalk codes, wax seal). "Futuristic nostalgia" and "meaning in the margins" are asserted but not dramatized through character conflict or a resonant final image that reweights prior material. The ending pivots to a generic readiness claim rather than a non-literal answer to the thematic question. No epiphany is earned; insights are told.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (Elara notices codes, margins, and symbols) but syntactic variety is low—many sentences open with subject-verb or prepositional phrases in template cadence. Diction remains consistent within her professional register. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "recalled") are frequent but voice-motivated. Psychic distance is controlled. The voice is functional but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "carefully inventive grace" / "carefully inventive approach," "ebony clipboard" appears four times with identical phrasing, and "meaning in the margins" recurs as a label. Sentence openings converge on subject-verb and prepositional stems ("She was," "She carefully," "She checked," "She dropped," "She smiled"). Template cadence across the middle third flattens momentum. Stock metaphors ("corridor of gold," "silent war") and a thesaurus-inflated phrase ("juxtapose the overt message with the hidden one") dilute clarity. Artifacts touch multiple beats; applying combined deductions yields −1.4 in Q7 and disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—clandestine pseudonym work using chalk codes to safeguard surface mail in a surveillance state—is a recognizable espionage-resistance template. The piece does not transform it through lived detail, moral calculus, or a non-obvious turn. Elara's flawless execution, the absence of friction, and the generic "ready for the next challenge" ending avoid bold risk. "Futuristic nostalgia" is asserted but not embodied in a specific inflection that grows from prior particulars. Derivative premise and safety-hedging warrant −0.8 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara (pseudonym creator) is present throughout and performs actions, but her choices do not create key turns—she executes a plan without obstacle or adaptation. Present and functional but replaceable with "code specialist" or similar role; swappability and lack of decision-driven turns cap integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in four distinct mentions (opening, checking notes, walking to dropbox, tucked under arm) across the arc. Its texture is noted ("solid," "cool surface") but it never constrains a choice or returns with reweighted meaning—it remains a prop for note-holding. Functional across beats but not causal or charged at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Surface mail is the central vehicle and shapes the premise (slow, tangible, ideal for sensitive communications). It is mentioned early and recurs, and the final action (dropping the letter) depends on it. However, it does not force a tactical dilemma or appear with altered cost at closure—it is the static medium rather than a constraint that narrows options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Carefully inventive" appears twice as a label ("carefully inventive grace," "carefully inventive approach") without constraining an on-page action or enabling a visible trade-off. Ornamental; no cost or friction tied to the trait. Late first appearance as a named trait and label-only use combine to cap at 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Juxtapose" is named explicitly as Elara's task (juxtapose overt and hidden messages, chalk symbols with letter margins). It is present in setup and middle but does not drive a reversal or redefine options—her juxtaposition succeeds without friction. Functional but swappable with "compare," "align," or "correlate."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Codes in children's sidewalk chalk are introduced early, demonstrated in the middle (chalking symbols on tiles), and their mechanics are explained (will be read by contacts as instructions or warnings). The method shapes two beats and the premise, but no on-page complication or cost arises from choosing chalk over another medium. Present across beats; functional but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The golden arcade at dawn is described in detail (brass arches, smooth tiles, dawn light) and provides the surface for chalk codes. It frames the opening and closing images and supplies a resource (tile surface), but it does not pressure a choice or alter tactics—it is backdrop. Functional participation without constraint or closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Before the day's first surface mail pickup" and "before mailing it" frame the timeframe. The deadline is mentioned early and recurs at closure (dropping the letter), creating a light tightening effect. However, no on-page urgency or trade-off arises from the clock; Elara completes all tasks within the window. Functional framing with mild pressure but no dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To discover meaning in the margins" is stated in the opening and repeated mid-story ("discovering...meaning in the margins"). It labels Elara's motivation but is never dramatized through a friction between wants and costs or a micro-choice under pressure. Told-only; no on-page conflict tied to this desire. Label repetition and lack of dramatized conflict limit integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Futuristic nostalgia" is named twice ("pervasive sense of nostalgia," "futuristic nostalgia for a time she had never known," "futuristic nostalgia for a simpler past") but remains a static label rather than a modulating tone that charges the final image. The descriptor does not shift with pressure or reweight the closure moment—it is asserted rather than felt through diction, rhythm, or image. Present but ornamental.</comment>
