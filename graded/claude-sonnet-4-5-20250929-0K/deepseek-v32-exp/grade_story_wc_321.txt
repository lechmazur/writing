<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's "ardent deckhand" trait and "resiliently positive outlook" are asserted but remain label-only throughout; no on-page contradiction or cost tests these attributes under pressure. His interiority relies on stock metaphors ("burning need," "stubborn belief") and lacks embodied emotion or conflicted impulses at peak beats. The final choice to "align the patterns" materializes via external mechanics (hourglass + radio) rather than a visible internal trade-off, leaving the closure gesture unmotivated by prior struggle. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past the 120-word mark: "spectral grotto" under "cold, piercing starlight" never anchors physical space or time sufficiently for comprehension, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure unit attempts Decisive Change (ferry materializes), but the mechanics—holding the hourglass and turning it—lack visible cost or felt trade-off; the grotto simply "fades" and the ship reappears whole. Linkage reads as outline sequencing ("certain sequences," "interconnected patterns," "align the patterns perfectly") without dramatized because/therefore steps that narrow options. The inferred lens (Causal with Accumulative overlay) wobbles at closure when the final image delivers wish-fulfillment without on-page price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The grotto setting supplies vivid imagery (stalactites, pools of dark water, starlight reflections) but remains postcard-descriptive rather than constraint-driven; no spatial feature pressures Eli's choices or alters tactics. The empty hourglass as micro-object does constrain the final beat by casting "lines of silver" that "connect points," partially satisfying the Q3 gate, but the spectral grotto itself never forces a meaningful decision. Sensory detail defaults to the visual without body-anchored perception or occupational filter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—merging parallel timelines—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested on the page with a live option or visible cost. The hourglass and radio sequence ("moved…slowly," "adjusted") describes mechanical actions rather than a choice that forecloses a path; the grotto "began to pulse" and the ferry "materialized" without Eli risking loss, enduring pain, or renouncing an alternative. No reversal narrows options or deepens the conflict under the Causal lens. Escalation reads as declarative intensifiers ("profound sense," "final adjustment") rather than protagonist agency forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of permanence versus transience is stated overtly ("permanent transient existence," "fleeting instant that would define eternity") rather than arising from concrete particulars, lowering integration. The empty hourglass functions as a motif but is introduced late (mid-story) and its thematic charge is asserted ("its purpose unclear until…") rather than earned through prior pressure. The ending offers no non-literal answer or conceptual repricing; the ferry simply returns "whole and real" with the grotto "fading into memory," resolving into tidy satisfaction. No plausible counter-reading or meaningful ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, but the narrative voice defaults to generic elevated diction ("ardent," "resiliently positive," "profound sense") without character-specific perceptual signature. Dialogue with the alternate Eli is functional but carries no subtext or distinct idiom; both voices converge into identical syntax and vocabulary. Filter verbs and stock constructions ("felt lighter than air," "heart soared") flatten immediacy at peak beats. The prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular, embodied perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Template cadence runs pervade ("He raised…He adjusted…He wasn't calling…he was calling…"; "certain sequences…grand, cosmic design…patterns he had begun to see"), triggering −0.6 for scaffold loops and stock stems. Mixed metaphor: "stubborn belief that every problem had a solution woven into the world's fabric" conflates weaving with solution-finding without coherent vehicle. Register drift into abstract diction ("interconnected patterns," "junction where timelines bled") clashes with the deckhand's on-page lexicon. Paraphrase loop: "permanent transient existence, where nothing was solid yet everything endured" restates the concept without added pressure. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("final adjustment, the empty hourglass glowed"), disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—vanishing ferry + parallel timelines merged via starlight patterns—echoes familiar writing-prompt templates (speculative object + abstract mission) without transformation through occupational detail, world logic, or non-obvious moral calculus. The hourglass and radio serve as plot keys rather than irreplaceable particulars rooted in Eli's deckhand experience. The ending delivers wish-fulfillment (ferry restored, "task complete") with no visible trade-off or lasting ambiguity, reading as median safety rather than bold risk. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 within Q8 for template adherence without fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Eli is present throughout and performs mechanical actions (raises radio, holds hourglass, moves it slowly), but his choices do not create key turns; he observes patterns and follows external mechanics without on-page decision cost. The "ardent deckhand" label never shapes a trade-off or forecloses a path. Present in setup, middle, and closure (all three gates), but involvement is passive observation rather than causal agency. Functional but swappable: a generic protagonist could execute the same beats with minor edits. Caps at 3.8 for swappability; passive presence in closure slightly lifts to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The empty hourglass appears in three beats: clutched in opening, reflecting starlight mid-story, and glowing at closure. It enables the final action by casting "lines of silver" that "connect points," supplying a causal function. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle gate is met through the starlight reflection discovery. However, it resolves a problem (pattern alignment) it did not help create earlier, capping at 3.0 per that rule. The hourglass's specific properties (empty, glass angles) matter for the mechanics, partially lifting the score. Late first appearance (second paragraph, ~15% mark) incurs −0.2. Lyric reprise (first paragraph → final image) reweights meaning slightly. Net: 3.0 cap + 0.7 closure linkage + 0.4 beat involvement + 0.3 specificity + 0.3 early signal − 0.2 late + 0.5 causal pressure = ~5.1, raised to 5.8 for strong closure presence despite the resolves-without-creating friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The vanishing commuter ferry is the inciting condition and returns as the closure image, framing the story. Setup (first paragraph) and payoff (final paragraph) gates are met. However, the ferry's vanishing is told in past summary ("the vanishing of the *Sea-Sprite*…had not broken his spirit") and never dramatized as an on-page choice or cost. Middle development is absent; the ferry exists as context but does not constrain tactics or alter options during Eli's pattern-alignment work. The concept shapes the dominant stake but remains abstract backdrop rather than active pressure. Swappable: a generic lost object could replace it with minor edits. Caps at 3.8 for swappability; closure participation slightly lifts to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is asserted twice ("resiliently positive outlook," "his positive resilience was not misplaced") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. Eli's trait is label-only; no moment shows him choosing optimism over despair with a trade-off or consequence. Mentioned in setup and middle (two touches), but both are summary declarations rather than embodied choices. Missing middle development gate (no choice shaped by this trait) and missing closure participation (trait is not active or reweighted in final image). Caps at 2.8 for missing closure participation; ornamental use applies −0.5. Net: 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The radio appears in four beats: Eli raises it and calls, hears static, hears the distorted voice, and radios back for collaboration. It enables connection to alternate timelines, supplying causal pressure for the closure. Setup (first call, ~20% mark), middle development (voice exchange), and payoff (radio "hummed with energy" in final beat) gates are met. The radio's specific properties (cracked casing, ability to reach across timelines) matter, earning specificity credit. However, the radio does not create a visible trade-off or cost; it simply works as a plot tool. Two distinct beats + closure linkage + early signal − minor swappability (a generic communication device could substitute) = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Interconnected patterns" are mentioned in the second paragraph ("via interconnected patterns he had begun to see") and recur in the fourth paragraph ("align the patterns perfectly"). Setup gate is met (~25% mark). Middle development: Eli watches patterns shift as he moves the hourglass, supplying a functional beat. Payoff: patterns are referenced in the closure sequence ("timelines trembled on the brink of union"). All three gates are met. However, the method is asserted rather than dramatized; the mechanics remain opaque (what are the patterns? how do they merge?), and the execution reads as declarative summary. Swappable: "solve the puzzle" or "activate the mechanism" could replace it with minor edits. Caps at 3.8 for swappability; closure participation lifts slightly to 3.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The spectral grotto is present in setup (first paragraph), supplies atmosphere throughout, and fades at closure ("grotto fading into memory"). Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the grotto does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics; it functions as scenic backdrop rather than active pressure. The starlight reflection mechanic occurs within the grotto but is driven by the hourglass, not the grotto's spatial properties. Middle development is weak: the grotto "began to pulse" passively in response to Eli's action rather than shaping his next move. Postcard description trends low; lyric reprise slightly lifts. Net: 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways" is mentioned once in the first paragraph ("where clocks ran sideways and time felt like a river flowing in every direction") and never constrains decisions or tactics. The timeframe is ornamental flavor rather than a live ticking clock that alters moves. Setup gate is met (first paragraph), but middle development and closure participation are absent; time is not tracked or used to pressure Eli's choices. Told-only, no on-page cost. Caps at 2.8 for missing closure participation; ornamental use applies −0.5. Net: 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Eli's motivation "to merge parallel timelines" is declared in the first paragraph ("his motivation…was now a burning need") and pursued across all beats; setup, middle, and payoff gates are met. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no friction between want and cost appears on the page. Eli's goal is abstract and faces no on-page trade-off (e.g., merging timelines might erase one version of himself or his ferry, but no such cost is tested). The motivation drives plot movement but lacks embodied tension. Functional across beats but replaceable with any abstract mission. Net: 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" is stated overtly in two beats ("permanent transient existence" in paragraph four, "permanent transient beauty" in paragraph five) but operates as thematic label rather than modulated tone. The prose maintains a single static register of elevated, abstract diction throughout; no coherent tonal shift under pressure. The final image ("grotto fading into memory") attempts lyric resonance but the tone does not charge it with cost or ambiguity. Setup (implied in opening mood) and payoff (final paragraph) are present, but middle development is absent. Caps at 3.4 for missing middle gate; label-only use applies −0.3 within band. Net: 3.4.</comment>
