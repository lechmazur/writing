<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian remains a stock "wandering artist" with stated rather than embodied motivation. His interior consists of declarative mood labels ("serious playfulness," "defiance") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The climactic choice—lighting the fireworks—feels inevitable from the outset rather than earned through on-page pressure that forecloses another path. No visible cost or renunciation shapes the ending; he simply executes a plan and walks away lighter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when coalesces only after ~150 words of chant and metaphor, triggering a −0.4 penalty and the Q3=7.0 cap. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (chant → mosaic → fireworks), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; Elian encounters no resistance, makes no adjustment, and the fireworks simply execute as planned. Closure lacks felt cost: the "gravity of hopelessness" lifts off-page for "unseen watchers," and Elian's own stakes remain abstract. The mosaic note "reveals itself" without prior groundwork that made discovery conditional on his choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fortress anchors vividly (jasmine, cereus, phoenix mosaic), and the kerosene rag's scent and weight are specific. The starless night and blooming petals charge the final image with purposeful contrast. However, the setting does not constrain choice—Elian moves through it unopposed, and no environmental feature alters his tactics or imposes cost. The mosaic's glow is descriptive payoff rather than a lever that changes options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to defy the gravity of hopelessness"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or internal conflict. Elian executes a pre-laid plan (secreted gunpowder trails) without reversal, adaptation, or visible price. No tightening narrows options; the fortress offers no resistance, and the "hopelessness" lifts off-page for others rather than through a choice that forecloses a path for Elian himself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly throughout: "defying the void," "creation persists," "filtering despair through fire." The mosaic note and phoenix tiles are introduced as ready-made symbols rather than earned through particulars. The final paragraph moralizes ("the world was full of hopelessness, but he was a master of serious play"), replacing scene pressure with thesis summary. The ending gestures toward "elsewhere, another soul," but no on-page particulars support this claim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature (chant, ambient awareness, fire-as-instruction) is distinct. However, diction drifts into elevated metaphor ("alchemical," "incantation of renewal," "ephemeral flower") that feels imposed rather than character-grounded. Syntax is repetitive: "His chant…," "He [verb]…," "The [noun]…" across most beats. Filter verbs stack in high-pressure moments ("he sensed," "he felt," "he saw"), dulling immediacy when the climax warrants directness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "filter the despair" / "filtering essence of sorrow," "defying the void" / "defiance for those who see," "blooming fortress" / "cradle of radiance." Template cadence runs dominate ("He [verb], his [noun]…" × 8 lines). Stock metaphors cluster without specificity: "transient flower," "cascade of azure and gold," "symphony of light." The final third is thick with synonym churn ("serious playfulness" × 3, "ambient awareness" × 4), triggering −1.2 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—wandering artist uses fireworks to lift communal despair—follows a common template (lone creator transforms place through performance). The "mosaic note" and pre-laid gunpowder read as convenient rather than earned constraints. Specificity is absent: we never learn what the fortress guards, why hopelessness clings here, or what cost Elian pays beyond narrative assertion. The phoenix mosaic and "serious playfulness" label arrive as decorative rather than integral.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elian observes, chants, and executes a plan; no choice alters tactics. His "decision" to light the rag is predetermined, and the fireworks are secreted off-page before the story begins.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The kerosene rag appears in three beats: belt mention, ignition, and final ash. It enables the fire but does not constrain choice or return with reweighted meaning; any ignition source would serve the same function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The mosaic note is described as "hidden message" and "harmonic resonance" but never defines stakes or alters options. It glows in response to fire rather than driving a choice. Easily swappable with "ancient riddle" or "secret symbol."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Chanting frames the opening and recurs at closure, but it does not constrain action or impose cost. Elian chants throughout without friction; removing it would leave the plot intact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Filter" is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as a physical or tactical process. The text asserts filtering happens ("drawing it into the flame's core") without showing mechanism, resistance, or cost. Any thematic verb ("transform," "purify") could replace it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Ambient awareness" is invoked four times but remains a label. It does not shape how Elian discovers the mosaic, adjusts to setbacks, or pays a price. The method is told, not shown in mechanics that matter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The blooming fortress anchors all action and provides the phoenix mosaic for the climax. Petals unfurling at dusk and the starless sky charge the final image. However, the setting does not constrain choice—Elian moves unopposed, and no feature alters his tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The starless night and dusk are present in description but do not tighten decisions. Time remains untracked; the "hush" is atmospheric rather than a clock that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The motivation is declared in paragraph one and restated at closure but never dramatized through conflicted choice. "Defying hopelessness" operates as theme claim rather than stake that forces a trade-off with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The text labels "serious playfulness" and "playful yet solemn" but tone reads uniformly elevated and declarative. Modulation under pressure is absent; the climax maintains the same register as the opening. The label is told rather than embodied in rhythm or choice.</comment>
