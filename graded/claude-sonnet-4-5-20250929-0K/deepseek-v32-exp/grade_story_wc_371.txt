<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal stance is consistently rendered through sensory and embodied detail (the bread as touchstone, heuristically gentle movements). The journal's discovery creates a meaningful external pressure, and her response—recognizing the gardener's parallel journey—feels earned. However, the final shift remains largely conceptual rather than enacted through a decisive micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interior voice is strong but the arc reads more as recognition than transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final paragraph crystallizes Elara's stance—"her work was just beginning"—and reweights the opening void (geese departed, bakery vanished) as "a space filled with potential." Cost is conceptual and felt (acceptance of ongoing care vs. despair) but not enacted in a decisive on-page action. Orientation is clear by ~80 words; one meaningful deepening (journal discovery) tightens the thematic question. The lens holds, but the cost remains oblique rather than undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The courtyard is vividly anchored (mossy stones, ivy curtain, dormant fountain) and the fountain's hidden compartment directly enables the climactic discovery. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's noticer lens (scent of old paper, cold carved stone). The setting constrains her actions (guerrilla gardening, the physical effort of shifting marble) and charges the final image of the tea house as sanctuary. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding absolution through uncovering the courtyard's history—is signaled early and remains coherent. The journal discovery serves as the single meaningful tightening, reframing her quest from personal to intergenerational. However, the resolution is largely internal realization without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; Elara's "work was just beginning" suggests continuity rather than a choice that narrows options. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens but lacks a felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (the sacred in the ordinary, memory vs. erasure) emerges organically through concrete particulars: the bread, the journal, the guerrilla gardening. The final image—emptiness as "a space filled with potential"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The gardener's parallel journey avoids easy sentiment and the ending resists tidy closure. Minor deduction for "tenuous absolution" feeling somewhat told rather than fully dramatized, but the thematic interlocking is strong.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "noticer of creeping normalities," "heuristically gentle," "archaeological love." Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("a thousand tiny surrenders," "the divine whisper in a fallen leaf"). No dialogue to assess. Brief instances of elevated register ("tenuous absolution," "uncloak") feel intentional but occasionally drift from embodied perception. Psychic distance modulates purposefully; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean and propulsive with varied syntax. Strong specificity in key beats (wax-paper parcel, brittle pages, cold carved stone). However, several phrases loop conceptually: "creeping normality" echoed in "his own creeping normality"; "tenuous absolution" introduced early and restated late without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "She believed...," "She began...," "She watered...," "She read..." Figurative language occasionally stacks ("guerrilla gardening," "archaeological love," "sacred artifact") without pattern-teaching. Deductions for paraphrase loops and stem repetition; no causality harm but momentum sags slightly mid-story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise (noticer uncovering a parallel predecessor's work through guerrilla gardening) offers a fresh angle on memory and decay themes. The bread from the vanished bakery and the hidden journal are specific, grounded choices. However, the emotional arc—solitary woman finding meaning in restoration—follows a recognizable template, and the final realization (emptiness as potential) feels anticipated rather than surprising. The piece executes its concept competently but does not transform familiar material into something indelible.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's "noticer of creeping normalities" trait is signaled early and shapes her perception throughout (noticing the geese's absence, the slow fade of summer, the bakery's disappearance). It enables her discovery of the fountain's seam and drives her reading of the journal. However, her noticing does not create a key turn that alters tactics or forecloses an option; it primarily frames her stance. The trait is essential to voice and theme but lacks decisive causal pressure at a turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The bread appears in three beats: she carries it (early), places it on the table (mid), and reflects on it as "sacred artifact of impermanence" (end). The final reprise reweights it thematically, linking memory and loss. However, its use is static—placement and contemplation—without altering a choice or tactic. It is thematically resonant but not causally active; swappable with another vanished-world relic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is introduced early as Elara's goal and directly shapes the stakes: she seeks forgiveness for "her own past blindness." The journal's final entry—describing the gardener's shame and hope for continuation—provides the absolution, and Elara recognizes it as "contingent on her own actions now." The concept drives the arc and the closure reframes it from personal to intergenerational. However, the absolution remains conceptual rather than enacted through a decisive on-page choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" is introduced mid-story as "a hard-won skill born from accidentally breaking a fledgling vine or startling a nesting bird." It shapes her tending actions (watering mint, untangling morning glory) and reflects her method. However, no on-page moment shows the trait constraining a choice or creating a trade-off; it is demonstrated but not tested. The trait enriches voice and world but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Uncloak" is signaled early as her goal ("to uncloak the full history of this courtyard") and the action is dramatized when she shifts the fountain's base to reveal the hidden compartment. This discovery is the story's major turn, enabling the journal and reframing her quest. The verb recurs at the closure beat, tying the action to the thematic resolution. The action is irreplaceable and drives the arc, though the second use is more metaphorical than causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is introduced early as both method and philosophy ("an act of archaeological love") and shown concretely in her tending of mint and morning glory. It shapes her means of engagement with the courtyard and links her work to the journal gardener's "early, desperate form." The method is integral to the story's texture and stakes, though the specific mechanics (unauthorized plantings) do not alter a tactical choice at a turn. Present across beats and closure but slightly ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tea house and courtyard are anchored early (ivy curtain, wild roses, mossy stones, dormant fountain) and the setting supplies the key resource: the hidden compartment in the fountain's base. The overgrown, neglected state motivates Elara's guerrilla gardening and her quest to uncover history. The setting shapes her tactics (clearing soil and roots to find the seam) and charges the final image (sanctuary reframed as potential). The setting is indispensable to the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" is introduced in the opening line and echoed when Elara reads the gardener's lament that "the birds no longer returned to the courtyard." The timeframe establishes seasonal melancholy and thematic resonance (departure, loss) but does not tighten decisions or tactics. The closure reframes the "emptiness after the birds' departure" as potential, providing lyric reprise. Present in setup and closure but functionally ornamental; no live clock or seasonal pressure alters her moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to find the sacred in the ordinary"—is stated early and dramatized through her actions: treating the bread as "sacred artifact," seeing the journal as "something far more precious" than gold, and recognizing "the sacred bloomed in the ordinary" at closure. The desire drives her tending and quest, though it is not visibly conflicted or tested by a competing want. The motivation shapes the arc and closure but lacks friction or cost; it is more philosophy than dramatized need.</comment>
