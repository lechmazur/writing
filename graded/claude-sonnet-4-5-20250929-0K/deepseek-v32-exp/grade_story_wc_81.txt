<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her perceptive trait is consistently shown through tactile navigation and pattern recognition. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") rather than embodied contradiction. The final discovery feels more like intellectual satisfaction than a choice with visible emotional cost—she smiles in triumph rather than grappling with what honest complexity demands of her. Micro-choices exist (probing seams, stamping pages) but they advance method more than they reveal internal conflict or foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening lines. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elara builds a tactile map in darkness, and the discovery of contradictory scrolls reconfigures her understanding of the codex. Closure lands on the page—she finds fragmented origins and stamps them as a claim of rediscovery—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("her very definition of truth") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical sacrifice. The escalation is methodical but the final image ("smiled") undercuts the felt weight of what she has overturned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library and sunken setting are vividly established with sensory anchors (carved wood, salt scent, warped cabinet). The blackout creates spatial constraint—navigation by memory and touch—and the antique stamp functions as a recurring micro-setting object that charges the final beat. However, much of the setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a live pressure that alters her tactics mid-scene; the hidden drawer discovery is the one moment where environment meaningfully shapes choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tracing honest origins—is signaled early and sustained throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the alternative hypothesis (palimpsest theory) narrows her search and the hidden drawer opens to reveal contradictory scrolls. Agency is present in her readjustment and methodical stamping, but the escalation is cognitive and accumulative rather than a live trade-off or visible sacrifice. The resolution is earned by her shift in method, yet the cost (rejecting the official narrative) is told more than shown; no immediate price or foreclosed relationship appears on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the investigation: truth as plural, messy, and human versus curated order. The antique stamp shifts from indexing tool to claim of rediscovery, and "reclaimed stillness" evolves from absence of light to deliberate analytical peace. The final image—stamp pressed to newly found scrolls, smile in darkness—attempts to reweight the premise, but explicit thematic statements ("tracing honest origins had required her to readjust…her very definition of truth") in the closing paragraph drift toward summary rather than resonant implication. Subtext operates well in the tactile methodology; the conceptual repricing is present but slightly over-articulated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and the perceptual signature (tactile, memory-driven navigation) is consistent and character-specific. Diction is generally controlled, though phrases like "tranquilly perceptive" and "dappled resolve" recur as labels rather than earned descriptors. The prose modulates with pressure—terse action during probing, reflection during hypothesis adjustment—but some register drift into elevated abstraction ("profound reclaimed stillness," "tranquilly aligned with the recovered past") intrudes in peak beats. No dialogue is present; internal voice remains coherent but occasionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is clear and generally rhythmic, but scaffold and label-repetition accumulate: "tranquilly perceptive" appears twice, "reclaimed stillness" three times, "dappled resolve" twice, and "antique ink stamp" four times, often as isolated descriptors rather than integrated action. Synonym churn is visible in adjacent lines: "profound dark" / "abyssal hush," "calm lake" / "total blindness," "forgotten library" / "sunken silence." Several sentences begin with similar stems ("She [verb]," "The [noun]"), creating template cadence in the middle third. Figurative language ("light filtering through deep water," "shadows of uncertainty") occasionally stacks without advancing concrete pressure. Information density is moderate; some beats ("using the stamp's edge, she gently probed") do multiple jobs, but others paraphrase prior content ("This tactile feedback was her new data point" restates the function of the stamp mark). The loop and scaffold issues do not obscure causality but they dull momentum and introduce a slightly mechanical texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The premise—indexer investigates founding myth during blackout, discovers palimpsest truth—synthesizes familiar elements (library mystery, hidden history) with specific tactile methodology (stamping in darkness as data-mapping). The shift from visual to tactile indexing and the use of an antique stamp as both anchor and tool offer fresh inflection. However, the emotional arc (intellectual to intuitive analysis) and the thematic conclusion (messy human truth vs. curated order) follow a well-worn template without sharp counter-pressure or moral ambiguity. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids gimmickry, but the transformation test is borderline: swap "ink stamp" for another tactile tool and "library" for another archive, and the beats function nearly unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara as logical page indexer is present throughout and her indexing background motivates her systematic approach. She makes two key choices: applying the alternative hypothesis (palimpsest theory) and probing the warped cabinet seam. However, "logical" and "indexer" function more as labels than constraints—her perceptiveness and memory drive the action more than any specific indexing skill or logical framework. The trait is signaled early, shapes her method in the middle, and is referenced at closure ("not with a neat index"), crossing all three gates but without irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The antique ink stamp appears in at least five beats: anchor during blackout, pressing into dry inkpad, stamping vellum margins for tactile feedback, using its edge to probe the cabinet seam, stamping the newly found scrolls as a claim. It evolves from verification tool to assertion in the void to discovery instrument to symbolic claim. Early signal is strong, middle use is varied and causal (the edge-probing unlocks the drawer), and closure participation is direct (stamping the scroll charges the final act). Swappability is low—the tactile, raised symbol and physical edge are integral to her method in darkness—but the cost connection is conceptual rather than visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is introduced early as both literal (blackout darkness) and thematic (deliberate peace for investigation). It reappears at closure ("profound reclaimed stillness…born from uncovering truth") to reweight the premise. However, it functions primarily as thematic echo rather than tactical constraint; the darkness limits her to tactile work, but "reclaimed stillness" as a concept does not alter her options mid-scene. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is absent. The element is more label than lever.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is introduced early and referenced throughout: she navigates by memory and touch, notes subtle warping in wood, correlates stamp patterns with half-remembered phrases. The trait enables her tactile methodology and discovery of the hidden compartment. However, it is presented mostly as an asset without visible trade-off or cost—there is no moment where heightened perception burdens her or forces a sacrifice. Setup and middle gates are met; closure gate is indirect (her perception aligns with the recovered past). The attribute shapes method but lacks constraint or friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Readjust" drives two major beats: Elara readjusts her indexing approach to apply the alternative hypothesis (palimpsest theory), and later readjusts her stance physically to move to the earlier-drafts cabinet. The first readjustment breaks the logical deadlock and redefines her search; the second leads directly to the hidden drawer discovery. The action is signaled early, recurs with distinct consequences, and the final paragraph reflects that "tracing honest origins had required her to readjust…her very definition of truth." All three gates are met; causal pressure is moderate. Minor swappability issue: "reconsider" or "shift" could substitute with small edits, lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" is introduced early (codex as palimpsest, not single-authored work) and explicitly shapes her middle tactics: she stamps suspect pages to map hidden connections and tests faint impressions beneath the main text. The hypothesis is validated at closure when fragmented scrolls contradict the official codex. Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. However, the mechanics are somewhat generic—any investigative reframe could serve similarly—and the method does not impose a visible cost or constraint that differentiates it from standard archive investigation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a sunken city is anchored early with vivid details (carved wood, salt scent, water-damaged cabinet). The setting supplies the hidden drawer that holds the contradictory scrolls, and the sunken/water-damage detail directly enables discovery. Spatial choreography is clear (shelves, cabinet, drawer). However, much of the setting operates as atmospheric backdrop; beyond the drawer mechanism, the library does not constrain her choices or alter tactics under pressure. Setup and closure gates are met; middle development is functional but not deeply causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blackout is established immediately and persists throughout, forcing Elara to rely on tactile and memory-driven methods rather than visual indexing. It tightens her decisions by removing her primary sense and creating a live constraint that shapes every beat. The timeframe is continuous and coherent; the story ends with "the blackout persisted" and "the enduring dark," anchoring closure. Setup, middle constraint, and closure presence are all strong. Minor ceiling: the blackout does not escalate or introduce a ticking clock beyond the initial condition, so urgency remains steady rather than mounting.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To trace honest origins" is her stated motivation from the opening and drives every choice: applying the alternative hypothesis, stamping pages to map connections, probing the cabinet, claiming the contradictory scrolls. The desire is dramatized through on-page action and the final paragraph reflects that the goal required her to "readjust…her very definition of truth." Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the motivation is presented as singular and uncontested—there is no visible friction between her want for truth and a competing need or fear, limiting the sense of internal cost or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" is introduced early ("her resolve was dappled, like light filtering through deep water, sometimes clear and sometimes obscured by doubt") and recurs at closure ("her dappled resolve had burned away the shadows of uncertainty"). The tone attempts to modulate—uncertainty at the start, solidification through discovery—but the metaphor remains static and ornamental rather than charging the final image with new meaning. The phrasing is more label than lived texture; the ending's tone (smile, peace, fulfillment) does not reflect residual dappling or ambiguity. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle modulation is weak.</comment>
