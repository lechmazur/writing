<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's pacifist stance is declared but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. Her "senselessly perceptive nature" and ability to "feel the emotions of the plants" read as label-only magic rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The wanderers arrive and depart without forcing any decision that would foreclose a path or reveal hierarchy of values. Internal conflict is summarized ("she rejected his violence") rather than dramatized through simultaneous, contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No decisive change, earned stasis, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page with visible cost. The story summarizes Elara's ongoing work across an indeterminate span ("days passed," "one evening") without a single causal turn that narrows options or alters knowledge. The wanderers' arrival could provide pressure, but they are welcomed, rest, receive cuttings, and leave without complication—coincidence decorates rather than tests. The ending asserts legacy and continuity but offers no before/after moment where cost is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert rose farm are described vividly but function as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is minimal—Elara moves from perimeter to dome interior, but distances and physical layout never shape a tactical choice. The airship scrap is handled (sheathed, placed at the root) but its physical presence does not alter an on-page decision. Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("tranquil blaze," "colors more vibrant") without filtering through urgency or professional priority.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to weave continuity through chaos"—is declared but never dramatized as a live dilemma with competing costs. No reversal or tightening occurs; the roses grow more robust, the wanderers arrive peacefully, and the farm becomes "a symbol of hope" without opposition. Elara's pacifism is stated as past refusal of her father's methods but faces no present test that would force a trade-off or reveal the price of her choice. Escalation is absent; the chaos beyond the glass "intensifies" in summary but never intrudes to complicate her work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated rather than emergent: "weaving continuity through chaos" and "sheathe the world's violence in peace" are declared in the final paragraph, replacing scene pressure with thesis. The airship scrap's "engraved quiet" could serve as a charged image but is introduced, placed, and left static—no shift in meaning across the arc. The ending moralizes ("continuity was woven through chaos, in a tranquil blaze that would never fade") instead of offering a non-literal answer rooted in particulars. Subtext is minimal; gesture, silence, and implication are absent from the wanderers' visit, which proceeds without friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic—Elara "could feel the emotions of the plants" without character-specific idiom or bias shaping what she notices. Diction drifts into elevated register ("inculcated," "embodying the engraved quiet") that does not anchor in her lived idiom or emotional state. The wanderers speak no dialogue; their interaction is summarized, so no voice distinction can be assessed. Psychic distance remains flat across emotional beats; no modulation reflects the claimed "tranquil blaze" or the chaos beyond.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "inculcating plants with values" appears six times with minor synonym variation (inculcate, inculcated, inculcating) but no added pressure. Template cadence runs across multiple sentences: "She was...," "She remembered...," "She spent...," "She explained..." Stock metaphors ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet") repeat without evolving meaning. The final paragraph stacks summary claims ("the legacy would endure," "continuity was woven," "would never fade") that restate the premise rather than advance it. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "began to") dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—pacifist daughter cultivates hope amid post-apocalyptic chaos—follows a familiar redemption-through-nurture template without transformation. The airship scrap as talisman and the glass dome as sanctuary are genre-conventional choices executed without fresh inflection. The wanderers arrive, are comforted, and leave with cuttings in a pattern that closely mirrors seed-of-hope parables. No risk-taking complicates the arc; the roses succeed, the chaos remains external, and the ending affirms the premise without interrogation or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no key turn or on-page decision. She "chose pacifism" (past), "decided to incorporate" the scrap (summary), and "welcomed" wanderers (no friction). Her choices are narrated rather than dramatized, and none foreclose a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The scrap is found (beat one), sheathed (beat two), and placed at the root (beat three). It influences the roses' growth in summary but is not handled or reweighted at closure. It appears in the final third ("remained sheathed at the root") as a static guardian rather than a causally active element.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" is described as symbols on the scrap and said to "radiate a calming influence" on visitors, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. It functions as thematic echo rather than shaping on-page stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is labeled twice (paragraphs 6 and 15) as a trait allowing Elara to "feel the emotions of the plants" and "see the connections between all things," but no on-page action demonstrates a cost or tradeoff arising from this perception.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Sheathe" is used physically (sheathing the scrap in cloth) and metaphorically in the final line ("sheathe the world's violence in peace"). The physical act enables placement at the root, and the metaphor charges the ending image. However, the action does not drive a major turn; it is preparatory and decorative.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Inculcating plants with values" is signaled early (paragraph 4), repeated across multiple beats, and demonstrated in Elara's practice (whispering to plants, using the scrap). It shapes the wanderers' interaction when she "showed how she inculcated plants." However, the mechanics never face a test or complication; the method succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The desert rose farm and glass dome are introduced early and frame the entire narrative. The dome provides "sanctuary" and the roses spread influence, but the setting does not pressure a choice—chaos remains beyond the glass without intruding. It supplies resources (plants, shelter) but does not constrain Elara's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the tower fell" is repeated as a refrain but does not function as a tightening clock. Time is vague ("days passed," "one evening") and does not alter Elara's decisions. The timeframe establishes post-collapse atmosphere but does not create urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To weave continuity through chaos" is stated as Elara's motivation (paragraph 3) and repeated in the ending. It is told rather than dramatized through a choice where competing costs are visible. No friction arises between this want and another need or fear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is used in the opening, midpoint ("The tranquil blaze of her efforts grew"), and ending. It establishes an oxymoronic tone but does not modulate with pressure—the tone remains static across beats without reflecting escalation or the wanderers' arrival.</comment>
