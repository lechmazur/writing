<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's initial unease and yearning for change feel genuine, but her transformation reads primarily through summary reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final state ("befriended uncertainty") is told rather than shown through a choice with visible cost at closure. Interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("heart full of questions," "uncertainly certain") without sufficient embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure that foreclose paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—the workshop, unease, and admiral's compass exposition consume the opening third without clear spatial or temporal grounding. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara returns transformed, hangs the compass), but the cost is conceptual and stated ("beneath the ashes of her old self") rather than dramatized through a foreclosed option or visible sacrifice. Causal linkage from greenhouse key to cave to grotto reads as conveniences aligning rather than because/therefore pressure, and the compass "pointing into shadows" as guide feels like mechanical plot service rather than motivated escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The neglected greenhouse, subterranean waterfall, and grotto are vividly rendered with sensory detail (perfume of rot, mist rainbows, glowing moss). However, these settings function primarily as stages for discovery rather than constraining Elara's choices—she navigates them without spatial friction or resource limitation that alters tactics. The compass and key enable rather than complicate, so the micro-setting credit remains mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara seeking the compass to embrace uncertainty—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure does not meaningfully escalate; each location yields its clue without resistance or cost (key found easily, box unlocked smoothly, compass points the way). The grotto revelation is contemplative summary rather than a choice that narrows options. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path appears on the page at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme ("befriend uncertainty") is stated repeatedly in reflection rather than emerging from concrete action. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "she had befriended uncertainty," "valued flow over fixation," "patterns emerge only when we stop forcing them." The compass rose as symbol and the "beneath the ashes" motif recur but operate as decorative recurrence rather than charging the final image with fresh pressure or non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and literary, with a stable third-person limited POV anchored to Elara. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction ("fate's hidden currents," "tapestry of revelation") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices clues but her way of noticing does not feel distinct to a clock tinkerer. No head-hopping, and the POV remains controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "uncertainly certain" appears twice with similar phrasing; "befriend uncertainty" recurs four times in near-identical constructions; "state of being," "patterns emerge," and "flow over fixation" echo across the final third. Template cadence in the resolution ("She realized that," "She understood that," "She had learned") flattens momentum. Mixed metaphor: "swirling leaves" seed the compass discovery but reappear arbitrarily in the final line without dramatized connection. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for metaphor muddle in closure zone, totaling −1.1 in Q7; additionally disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—tinkerer seeks mystical artifact to learn life lesson—follows a familiar template (reluctant hero, scavenger hunt, epiphany) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious stakes. The compass rose, greenhouse, and waterfall function as generic fantasy-quest waypoints. The "uncertainly certain" oxymoron and "ashes" motif gesture at freshness but remain ornamental. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the arc resolves into tidy self-actualization summary.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and drives the quest, but Elara's choices are passive receptacles for clues rather than decisions that alter tactics or foreclose paths. She gathers tools, follows the compass, and emerges transformed—setup and payoff gates met, but middle development is observational rather than agentic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The compass appears in rumor (setup), is found in the locked box (middle beat), and points Elara through the tunnels (development), then hangs in her workshop at closure (payoff). Three gates met, but the compass's needle "pointing steadfastly into shadows" serves as convenient plot guide rather than imposing cost or reweighting meaning. Its presence at closure is descriptive rather than causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Beneath the ashes" is engraved on the key (setup), literalized when Elara finds the box under ash (middle beat), and metaphorically reprised at closure ("beneath the ashes of her old self"). All three gates met and the concept charges the final image thematically, though the conceptual cost remains stated rather than dramatized through a foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Uncertainly certain" is named twice—once at the greenhouse discovery, once in the grotto reflection—but functions as a label rather than constraining or enabling action with visible cost. No on-page moment where this trait forces a trade-off or alters Elara's tactics. Swappable with "cautiously confident" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Elara decides to "improvise" and steps into the world without itinerary (setup); she navigates tunnels "improvising her route" around obstacles (middle beat). The action is present but not causal—removing "improvise" and substituting "explore" or "adapt" would not break the story logic. Does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse appears early (setup), and Elara brushes aside "swirling leaves" to find the key (middle beat). The leaves return in the final line ("swirling leaves outside her window seemed to dance"), creating a lyric reprise that reweights the opening image. Two gates met and a charged callback, but the method itself—discovery through leaves—does not shape subsequent attempts or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall dominates the cave sequence: Elara slips on wet stone, the thunder echoes, mist paints rainbows, and she finds the ashes behind the falls. Setup, development (wet stone affects movement), and payoff (she emerges, roar fades) all present. The setting supplies atmosphere and minor physical friction, pushing into the 6+ band, but does not impose a choice-altering constraint or resource limit.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When coincidence becomes pattern" is named once in the opening third as Elara's recognition moment (setup). The concept is not tracked or dramatized in real time; instead, the resolution summarizes "the pattern of coincidences unfolded like a map." Timeframe is conceptual rather than a live clock that tightens decisions. Missing middle and closure participation as a pressure device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to befriend uncertainty in planning" is declared early (setup) and restated at closure ("she had befriended uncertainty"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—she never faces a moment where certainty and uncertainty pull her in opposite directions with visible cost. Functional but not embodied in friction.</comment>
