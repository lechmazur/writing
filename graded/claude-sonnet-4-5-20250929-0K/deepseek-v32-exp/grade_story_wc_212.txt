<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to discover the texture of borrowed time") reads as label-only poetry rather than a felt need that drives concrete choices. Her interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("wild serenity," "furious tranquility") that never lands in embodied sensation or contradiction under pressure. The peak choice—placing the acorn cap on the vortex—lacks internal conflict or visible cost; she simply executes a predetermined ritual. The "texture" epiphany ("smooth, cool silk overlaying rough, urgent stone") arrives as convenient fulfillment rather than earned discovery through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece anchors who, where, and when early (icebound atrium, starlight, egg about to hatch). Lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through ritual imagery and recurring phrases toward a portal-opening climax. Closure unit: Elara steps through the reopened gateway (Decisive Change), but the cost is abstract ("journey had only just begun") rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off that reweights prior material. The causal chain (egg hatches → vortex emerges → acorn cap stabilizes → portal opens) functions mechanically but lacks a tightening that narrows options or forces a price on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The icebound atrium under starlight is signaled early and maintained consistently; the frozen flora, frosted dome, and silver glow create a coherent sensory frame. The setting constrains the action (cold vigils, egg-hatching ritual) and the starlight motif bookends the piece, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (Elara holds the egg, places the cap, seeds in orbits, portal on far wall). Micro-setting (the acorn cap as tool) shapes the central ritual, satisfying the 9+ gate. However, the atrium's ice and cold do not constrain a choice or alter tactics in a felt way—description remains somewhat postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reopen the gateway) is signaled early and pursued throughout. One tightening occurs: the vortex is unstable and "fading fast," forcing Elara to "focus all her will" and draw on heirloom seeds to stabilize it. However, this pressure reads as cosmetic urgency ("incomplete and fading") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No on-page cost is legible—Elara succeeds without sacrifice, error, or visible trade-off. The resolution is agency-driven (her ritual actions) but lacks the visible price or narrowed options required to enter the 8+ band under Accumulative/Textural.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme ("texture of borrowed time," order vs. chaos, preservation) is stated repeatedly ("wild serenity," "furiously tranquil," "decreasing entropy") rather than emerging from concrete events. The final lines recycle prompt language ("furiously tranquil, into the unknown") as a thematic summary instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The acorn cap and heirloom seeds function as symbolic conveniences introduced to solve the puzzle without prior friction or cost. Recurrence is ornamental (starlight, seeds, "wild serenity") rather than reweighting prior material at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic high-fantasy register ("breath misting," "serene, silver glow," "whispered incantations") without character-specific idiom or bias. Diction relies on abstract compound phrases ("wild serenity," "furious tranquility," "borrowed time") that recur as verbal tics rather than modulating under pressure. The piece teaches a pattern (lyric recurrence, patterned diction) but voice remains committee-consensus rather than singular. Peak stress (vortex stabilization) shows no compression or rhythm shift; syntax stays uniform throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "wild serenity" / "furious tranquility" / "furiously tranquil" recur without added meaning; "vortex inheritance" / "inherited power" / "vortex's energy" cycle across adjacent lines. Template cadence: "She had prepared… She placed… She focused… She had succeeded…" runs through the second half without variation. Figurative language is stacked ("smooth, cool silk overlaying rough, urgent stone") but mixed and abstract. Repeated sentence stems ("The atrium's…," "The egg…," "The oak acorn cap…") create drumbeat monotony. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("furiously tranquil" in the final paragraph), triggering the −1.7 and 9+ global disallowance per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise (ritual to reopen a time-gateway using entropy reversal and heirloom seeds) is a composite of familiar fantasy elements without a fresh angle. "Vortex inheritance," "borrowed time," "decreasing entropy" function as prompt labels rather than grounded systems with cost. Elara's role as "heirloom seed saver" is stated but not integrated into a lived profession or worldview—seeds appear as symbolic tokens. The texture epiphany and portal-opening follow a checklist path without an unexpected turn or synthesis. Transformation test: swap "seeds" for "runes" and "acorn cap" for "crystal" and the arc is unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Character present throughout. Setup: Elara introduced as heirloom seed saver, holds the egg (first paragraph). Development: she performs the ritual (places cap, sows seeds). Payoff: she steps through the portal. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is execution without a constrained choice. She makes no decision that alters tactics—she follows a predetermined plan without friction. Causal pressure is low; her choices are ritual steps, not dilemmas. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but no visible cost or irreplaceability. Swappable: another arcanist could perform the same role. Band guidance: functional but replaceable. Late penalty waived (present early). Artifact: label-only trait ("heirloom seed saver") −0.3. 3.0 base +2.4 positives −0.3 artifact −0.8 swappability −0.2 no cost = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Object present in three beats: prepared (paragraph 6), placed on vortex to focus energy (paragraph 12), glows and channels beam (paragraph 18), held at closure (paragraph 27). Setup, development, payoff all met. Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.5, causal pressure (focuses vortex, stabilizes portal) +1.0, closure linkage (held, shapes destiny) +1.0, specificity ("no larger than her thumbnail," "simple shape") +0.4. No felt cost tied specifically to the cap. Swappability: "ancient focus object" could replace it −0.5. 3.0 base +4.3 positives −0.5 swap = 6.8, rounded 6.2 after band limiter (lyric object, not irreplaceable causal lynchpin).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Concept present: "vortex lineage" (paragraph 1), "vortex inheritance" (paragraphs 4, 10, 11, 25, 30), miniature vortex emerges from egg (paragraph 10), unstable (paragraph 11), stabilized by cap (paragraph 12), portal opens (paragraph 22). Setup, development, payoff met. Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.7, causal pressure (must stabilize to open portal) +1.2, closure linkage (flows through her, she embraces it) +1.2. Cost: abstracted ("must learn to control") rather than felt on the page −0.4. Swappability: "inherited power" or "legacy magic" could replace with minor edits −0.6. 3.0 base +4.5 positives −1.0 frictions = 6.5, band-limited to 5.8 (label recurrence without unique mechanics).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Attribute mentioned five times: "wild serenity" (paragraphs 3, 17, 28), "furious tranquility" (paragraphs 3, 23), "furiously tranquil" (paragraph 34). Setup met (paragraph 3). No development beat where the trait constrains or enables a choice with cost. Payoff: recurs in final paragraph as label. Lyric reprise without mid-scene causal work. One beat (label introduction) +0.4, early signal +0.4, closure linkage (recurs in last line) +0.7. No causal pressure, no cost, purely ornamental. Label-only trait −0.3, swappability (any poetic compound) −0.7. 3.0 base +1.5 positives −1.0 frictions −0.1 no middle gate = 2.4 (cap 4.6 missing development, final 2.4).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Action signaled early ("must be ready to reopen the gateway," paragraph 4) and executed across multiple beats: attempts to stabilize vortex (paragraphs 11–20), portal flickers (paragraph 19), fully reopens (paragraph 22), Elara steps through (paragraph 23). Setup, development, payoff all met. Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.8, causal pressure (all tactics serve reopening) +1.4, closure linkage (stepping through is the climax) +1.5, cost (embraces vortex, journey begun) +0.4. Swappability: "activate" or "unlock" could replace with edits −0.5. 3.0 base +5.5 positives −0.5 swap = 8.0, band-limited to 7.3 (major turn but abstract cost).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Method mentioned: "by decreasing entropy could she prevent its collapse" (paragraph 11), "by imposing order on chaos, she would decrease entropy" (paragraph 13), "to decrease entropy further" (paragraph 20). Setup and development in method statement. Payoff: vortex stabilizes (paragraph 22) but "decreasing entropy" is not shown—seeds in orbits and the cap's "simple shape" are proxies. Early signal waived (appears ~40% mark) → cap 4.6. One beat (method stated) +0.4, causal claim (method is the how) +0.6, closure linkage (stabilization result) +0.8. Summary-only (stated, not dramatized as reversible process) −0.8. 3.0 base +1.8 positives −0.8 friction = 4.0, cap 4.6, final 4.0 rounded to 4.7 by late intro limiter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setting signaled in first paragraph (icebound atrium, starlight) and maintained throughout. Setup, development (ritual occurs there), payoff (portal on far wall, starlight watches over shell). Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.7, causal pressure (setting frames ritual, cold vigils) +0.8, closure linkage (final image in atrium) +1.0, specificity (frosted dome, frozen flora) +0.5. No constraint that alters tactics (ice/cold described but not limiting) −0.6. 3.0 base +4.4 positives −0.6 no micro-constraint = 6.8, band-limited to 5.9 (postcard description without choice pressure).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Timeframe signaled: "After the egg hatches, the inheritance would awaken" (paragraph 4), egg hatches (paragraph 9), then steps unfold. Setup met. Development: hatching triggers the sequence. Payoff: "The egg had hatched, and a new chapter unfolded" (paragraph 31). Two gates (setup, payoff). One beat (hatching as trigger) +0.4, early signal +0.6, causal linkage (hatching starts ritual) +0.8, closure mention +0.6. No live clock or time pressure that tightens decisions; "fading fast" (paragraph 19) is cosmetic urgency. Missing middle development (no tracked elapsed time or deadline) → cap 3.4. 3.0 base +2.4 positives = 5.4, cap 3.4, final 3.2 after missing-gate limiter.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Motivation stated: "to discover the texture of borrowed time" (paragraph 8), "texture of borrowed time revealed itself" (paragraph 21), guide forward (paragraph 26), "textures of time she had borrowed" (paragraph 30). Setup, development (pursuit during ritual), payoff (discovery claimed). Three mentions across beats +1.0, early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8. No friction between want and cost; the discovery is granted as epiphany ("smooth, cool silk overlaying rough, urgent stone") without struggle. Told-only desire −0.8, no dramatized conflict −0.6. 3.0 base +2.3 positives −1.4 frictions = 3.9, rounded 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Tone phrases recur: "wild serenity" (paragraphs 3, 17, 28), "furious tranquility" / "furiously tranquil" (paragraphs 3, 23, 34). Setup met (paragraph 3). Payoff: final line. No development where tone modulates with pressure; diction stays uniform across calm preparation and climax. Lyric reprise without charged shift. Two beats (intro, ending) +0.9, early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.7. Static mood (label recurrence) −0.7, label-only −0.3. 3.0 base +2.1 positives −1.0 frictions = 4.1, band-limited to 3.6 (label without tonal shift under pressure).</comment>
