<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but never tested through conflicting impulses. Her "steadily curious" nature remains a label rather than a trait that constrains choices under pressure. The confiding to Leo is pure exposition dump—"I've seen a pattern emerging"—without embodied tension or micro-choices that alter present options. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending declares transformation without dramatizing the struggle that would earn it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who/where/when emerge slowly), triggering −0.4. The piece attempts an Accumulative lens but provides no meaningful tightening or deepening; the card readings never narrow options or change knowledge on the page. Closure is asserted in summary ("had woven a new narrative") rather than landing as a visible Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing. The final image—measuring tape lying still, light breaking—gestures at resonance but lacks dramatized cost or a before/after legible through action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft anchors the scene early and recurs with atmospheric consistency. Sensory detail (rain patter, onyx ink drinking light, metallic gleam of tape) is vivid but primarily decorative; the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The measuring tape's physical use to mark card distances is described but remains metaphorical rather than tactile. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the loft's mood supports tone, lifting the score into mid-band despite the lack of choice-pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; Elara's work unfolds as summary rather than escalating pressure. The climactic insight ("humanity's patterns were cyclical") is told to Leo in exposition, not earned through a dramatized choice with visible cost. Agency is absent; coincidence (the rain easing, light breaking) provides the resolution beat without protagonist transformation or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (cultural collapse as cyclical pattern) is stated rather than emerging from concrete beats. The measuring tape and card spreads are invoked repeatedly but remain symbolic placeholders without constraining choice or shifting meaning at closure. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "mapped a way forward, one that honored past wisdom while embracing change"—textbook Thematic Echo in the ending. The grandmother's journals gesture at inherited mystery but serve as exposition rather than lived friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent atmospheric register (onyx-ink, rain-beaded, inherited mystery) but lacks perceptual specificity tied to Elara's professional lens. Dialogue with Leo is functional but generic—"I've seen a pattern emerging"—and could belong to any character. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "seemed") stack without voice motivation. The prose maintains coherence but never sharpens into a distinct perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "reverse engineering" appears three times in near-identical constructions; "by multiplying paths" is repeated mechanically across four paragraphs without variation. Template cadence dominates—"Her motivation... was a compulsion"; "The measuring tape... was not for physical dimensions"—stacking identical stems. Stock metaphors ("drink the dim light," "whispered secrets") and synonym churn ("probing, always questioning") flatten momentum. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("woven a new narrative from the threads"), triggering −1.7 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—cartomancer reverse-engineering societal collapse via tarot—lands in a well-worn template (mystic decodes chaos post-disaster). The cryptocurrency-crash frame is topical but underexplored; no specific detail distinguishes this collapse from generic apocalypse. "Inherited mystery" and "cultural fingerprint" are abstract placeholders. The measuring-tape-as-metaphor device is stated rather than transformed through specific, non-obvious use. Middle-ground hedging avoids bold choices; the ending resolves into safe affirmation without risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or narrows options. She lays cards, describes patterns to Leo, and declares insights—all observation and summary. The "onyx-ink cartomancer" label is ornamental; her profession does not constrain action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The measuring tape appears in three beats (coiled beside her; marking distances; lying still at closure) but remains metaphorical. It is described rather than handled with tactile specificity, and its role is stated ("not for physical dimensions") rather than demonstrated through action that shapes a choice. The closure reprise adds no reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Reverse engineering" is invoked three times as a thematic label but never operationalized. The text does not show Elara deconstructing symbols back to origin or using a specific method that alters her approach. It remains echo-only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" is declared twice ("steadily curious nature," "steadily curious approach") but never constrains an on-page action with cost. The trait is told, not embodied in a trade-off or choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara confides in Leo across multiple beats, serving as the primary vehicle for exposition. The action shapes one turn (sharing the grandmother's journals deepens context) but does not redefine options or force a consequential choice. It is functional but replaceable with internal monologue.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"By multiplying paths" is stated four times as a method label but its mechanics are never shown. The text does not dramatize how creating multiple card spreads alters Elara's tactics or forecloses an option. It is ornamental repetition.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft anchors the scene early and recurs in every major beat. The rain intensifies in parallel with Elara's insight, and the final image (rain easing, light breaking) charges the closure moment. While the loft does not constrain a physical choice, it shapes atmosphere and the ending's emotional weight, reaching mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the cryptocurrency crashes" frames the premise and is referenced four times, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The collapse is backdrop rather than live pressure that changes Elara's moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To map cultural patterns" is stated as Elara's motivation and recurs, but it remains abstract. No on-page friction between this desire and a competing cost dramatizes the motivation. The text tells us it is "both urgent and profound" without showing a choice shaped by that urgency.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Inherited mystery" is signaled early (grandmother's journals, secrets passed down) and modulates with the rain-beaded atmosphere. The tone coheres across beats and charges the final image (loft as launchpad, mystery as guide). It does not force a stance crystallization but supports the accumulative design, reaching mid-band.</comment>
