<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (understanding the architecture of lies) is established but her interiority remains abstract and label-heavy. The "training instincts" method is asserted repeatedly without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The closure moment—closing the sundial after accepting that it's a trigger for remembering—reads as summary rather than a lived renunciation with visible cost. Diagnostic phrasing like "serene upheaval," "thoughtfully clear," and "hindsight clarity" appears frequently in narration without grounding in concrete perception or action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers reflection and insight around the sundial until Elara concludes the architecture of lies was designed to misdirect. However, the closure effect—her realization and the act of closing the sundial—lacks a legible felt cost on the page; she "feels a peace settle" and "no longer wandered," which reads as emotional summary rather than a visible forfeiture or charged crystallization. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where a price is paid or an option foreclosed at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal is described with selective sensory detail (damp edge, mossy stones, still water, silent barges) that fits POV and tone. The sundial's shadow falling on a crack in the stone where water seeps through is a micro-setting moment that charges the final realization. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting does not constrain a choice but does participate in the closure image, placing the score in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why the Sunken Bell legend exists—is signaled early and shapes the arc. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens as Elara pieces together insight. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options; the arc is one continuous deepening without a visible tradeoff. The resolution is largely introspective summary ("she understood," "she felt a peace settle") rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path with cost. Agency remains passive observation rather than choice under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—truth beneath constructed lies, salvaging understanding rather than artifacts—emerges from the sundial and the layered reflections. The final image (closing the sundial, "its purpose fulfilled") gestures toward a resonant answer but does not reweight prior material non-literally; the realization is stated rather than shown through a charged particular. Subtext operates in the shadow-on-crack moment but elsewhere the piece leans on prompt-language abstractions ("architecture of lies," "hindsight clarity") that reduce thematic resonance. No overt moralizing in the final paragraph, which preserves some band position.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and consistent but leans on repeated thematic phrases ("training instincts," "architecture of lies," "serene upheaval," "thoughtfully clear") that read as imposed labels rather than emergent voice. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara's noticing does not carry character-specific bias. Psychic distance is uniform without purposeful modulation. Filter verbs are sparse and acceptable. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Heavy template-cadence and paraphrase-loop issues compound across the piece. Multiple paragraph openings recycle prompt phrases ("training instincts" appears four times, "architecture of lies" three times, "hindsight clarity" twice, "serene upheaval" twice, "thoughtfully clear" twice, "silence of morning radio" three times). Adjacent sentences restate the same content without added pressure: "She aimed to salvage not the bell itself, but the reason it was lost, the core truth buried beneath generations of lies. / By training instincts, she had learned to feel the weight of untruths…" Figurative language is sparse and clear where present, avoiding muddle. Apply cumulative artifact penalty: −1.4 for template cadence, paraphrase loops, and prompt-label recycling touching multiple beats including closure vicinity. Additionally disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Core premise—seeker uses inherited tool to uncover family secret—is familiar and executed without a fresh angle. The "sundial as metaphor not map" turn is predictable and the emotional resolution (peaceful acceptance) avoids specificity. Prompt-element recycling in narration reduces voice authenticity. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece occupies the safety middle. Transformation test: plot and arc could function unchanged with different names and tool, indicating insufficient particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her observation drives the arc, but her choices are largely internal realizations rather than decisions that alter tactics. The closure act—closing the sundial—does not foreclose a live option with cost; it confirms an insight already reached. Setup early, development via reflection mid-piece, and present at closure meet the gate model for two-of-three. Causal pressure is weak; her method ("training instincts") is asserted not shown. Score: setup +0.5, beat involvement (reflective beats) +0.4, closure linkage +0.4, minus ornamental use −0.6, minus summary-only development −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sundial appears early (paragraph 2), is handled multiple times (tracing brass, opening it, adjusting angle, closing it), and the shadow-on-crack moment enables the central realization. Present in the final image as the act of closing it signals acceptance. Setup +0.7, beat involvement (three touches) +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (gears, gnomon, shadow) +0.5, minus late causal insertion −0.3 (the crack discovery at ~85% feels convenient). Total ~6.8, rounding down to nearest 0.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Hindsight clarity is named explicitly twice in narration as a thematic label but does not constrain or enable an on-page choice. It describes Elara's process retrospectively rather than shaping her tactics in scene. Setup oblique (first explicit mention paragraph 12), no middle development that alters a move, and closure participation is summary-only ("hindsight clarity washed over her"). Gate model: missing development cap at 3.4. Setup token +0.2, closure mention +0.3, minus label-only −0.3, minus summary-only −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" appears twice as a narration label describing Elara's method but does not constrain or enable any action with visible cost. No middle beat where the trait alters tactics. Setup mention (paragraph 10), no development, weak closure participation (paragraph 20 summary). Gate model: missing development cap at 3.4, missing meaningful closure participation cap at 2.8 (lowest wins). Setup token +0.2, closure mention +0.2, minus label-only −0.3, minus no causal work −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Salvage is the stated motivation and frames expectation early (paragraphs 4, 5, 13, 22, 33, 34). It shapes the arc's goal but does not drive a distinct on-page turn or tightening; Elara's realization is that salvage means accepting truth rather than finding an artifact, but this insight is told rather than dramatized through a choice with cost. Setup +0.7, beat involvement (repeated framing) +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, minus swappability (could be "uncover" or "reclaim") −0.6, minus summary-only resolution −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"By training instincts" is asserted four times across the piece as Elara's method but its mechanics are never shown; the text tells us she honed her senses and trusts prickling intuition without dramatizing these actions in scene. Setup (paragraph 6), repeated mentions mid-piece, closure vicinity mention (paragraph 29, 35). Gate model: setup present, development is label-only (no choice altered by the method), closure participation is summary-only. Setup +0.4, beat mentions +0.4, minus label-only −0.6, minus summary-only −0.5, minus template recycling on this element −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Twilight barge canal is anchored early (paragraph 1) with recurring sensory detail (water, barges, mossy stones, industrial edges). The crack in the stone where the sundial's shadow falls (paragraph 27) is a micro-setting element that enables the key realization. Setup +0.8, beat involvement (multiple grounding touches) +0.9, closure linkage via the crack +1.0, specificity (mossy stones, seeping water) +0.5, causal participation (crack enables insight) +0.8, minus does not constrain a choice −0.4. Total ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Silence of morning radio" appears three times as atmospheric detail but does not track elapsed time or tighten decisions. No live clock; the dawn setting is static backdrop. Setup mention (paragraph 3), mid-piece echoes (paragraphs 16, 24, 35), but no causal role in tactics or closure. Gate model: setup present, no middle development that alters action, closure mention is ornamental. Setup +0.4, closure mention +0.2, minus ornamental −0.7, minus no time-pressure role −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to understand the architecture of lies around the Sunken Bell legend—is stated early (paragraph 4) and frames the arc. It is repeated and deepened (paragraphs 5, 13, 28, 33) and the closure realization addresses it. However, the desire is never dramatized in a conflicted choice with visible cost; the arc is contemplative insight rather than friction between wants and obstacles. Setup +0.7, beat involvement (recurring framing) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, minus told-only friction −0.8, minus no on-page cost −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is named twice in narration (paragraphs 7, 31) and the tone oscillates between calm description (still water, gentle light) and internal turmoil claims. The final image leans serene ("peace settle," "gentle light") without maintaining upheaval tension. Tone is somewhat coherent but does not modulate purposefully with pressure or charge the final image with both elements. Setup +0.5, closure participation (peace without upheaval) +0.4, minus static mood in final beat −0.5, minus label reliance −0.3.</comment>
