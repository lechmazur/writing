<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("to interpret silence as possibility") is asserted in the opening but never tested through contradictory impulses or genuine resistance. His transition from silent work to singing feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page friction. The "quietly persistent" trait manifests as smooth competence without blind spots or costs that would complicate his choices. Interior life reads as poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land by ~100 words. Closure registers as Resonant Reconfiguration—the singing and glowing fragment crystallize a new state—but the cost remains asserted rather than felt: what path has Elias foreclosed, what stamina spent, what vulnerability risked? The halo fragment's intensifying gleam and the horses' "straightening" read as convenient magic rather than pressure earned through prior constraint. One meaningful deepening occurs (work → song), satisfying length expectations, but the final image leans on whispering metaphor instead of a legible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The circus train setting provides vivid visual anchors (peeling murals, stacked horses, velvet rot) and the halo fragment constrains Elias's immediate goal. However, the environment never forces a tactical choice or supplies a resource Elias must work around; he lays out tools "with care" and proceeds without spatial friction. Wind bells recur purposefully, but their chime remains atmospheric rather than a constraint that alters a decision. The "misting hush" thickens mood but does not pressure the character's moves, keeping the score below the 7.0 gate for constraint-driven choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoration of the carousel—is clear and sustained. Elias's move from silent work to singing provides one meaningful tightening that narrows his approach (he risks voice after silence). However, the escalation lacks visible cost: no material runs short, no injury threatens, no social witness judges. The halo fragment's glow and the horses' shift feel like reward without tradeoff. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence deepens once, but the final reconfiguration asserts transformation ("no longer a tomb") without showing what Elias has relinquished or risked to earn it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of silence as possibility/canvas emerges through the opening assertion and the shift to song, but the final image restates the premise ("silence became a language of creation") rather than reweighting it through earned complexity. The halo fragment and wind bells recur, yet their return amplifies mood without introducing cost or counterpoint. No moral ambiguity or plausible counter-reading complicates the resolution; Elias's transformation lands as fulfillment without shadow. The ending offers a coherent emotional note but not a non-literal, resonant answer that recharges prior material with fresh pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Narrative distance modulates purposefully between close interiority ("his motivation clear only to himself") and lyric elevation ("misting hush clinging to his clothes"). Perceptual signature is carpenter-specific in the workshop beats (fitted gears, smoothed manes) but drifts toward generic lyricism at peak moments ("thread of sound that stitched the silence"). No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy in key beats. Diction stays largely consistent; minor register drift into abstract phrasing ("not broken, but fulfilled") at closure but does not fragment the voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure. However, repeated metaphoric phrasing ("whispering gleam," "misting hush," "wind bells chimed") across high-pressure beats creates template cadence without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.4). "Hours bled away" and "he stood there, complete" lean toward stock constructions. No paraphrase loops or major grammatical errors, but figurative density in the final third ("stitched the silence," "cradle of potential," "reclaimed wonder") stacks without advancing concrete causality (−0.3 for density without payoff). Closure beat carries elevated diction that slightly dulls immediacy. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty, but scaffolding phrases like "The action felt natural" summarize rather than show.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The silent craftsman finding voice is a familiar arc; the abandoned circus train and carousel restoration evoke well-worn magical-realism templates. Transformation test: swapping "carousel carpenter" for another artisan and "circus train" for another ruin would leave the emotional arc largely intact, signaling insufficient freshness. The halo fragment's glow and horses' animation trend toward convenient enchantment rather than a grounded, non-obvious synthesis. Specific details (brass fragment, velvet rot, grandfather's melody) add texture but do not fundamentally alter the template. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece executes competently within familiar territory without a distinctive angle or subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes the decision to sing, but his choices feel more like unfolding inevitability than pressure-tested turns. Setup: established in opening. Development: works steadily without tactical friction. Payoff: begins to sing at closure. Two gates met (setup, payoff), eligible to ~6.0, but the singing feels like natural extension rather than a choice that narrows prior options or imposes felt cost (−0.6 for low causal pressure, −0.4 for swappability—another silent artisan finding voice would function similarly). Observational mode dominates; decision-making is smooth rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Halo fragment appears in beat two (discovery), beat three (placed as guide on workbench, polished to intensify gleam), and beat four (glows brighter as Elias sings). Three beats, all three gates met. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0 (glows at the ending), specificity +0.4 (brass, curved, part of a sun assembly). However, it does not constrain a choice or narrow options; Elias simply polishes it and it responds magically without cost (−0.7 for low causal pressure). Starting anchor 3.0 + 2.6 = 5.6, rounded down to 5.6. Adjusting for closure participation strength: the glow charges the final image but Elias's song is the active force; the fragment is reactive. Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Misting hush" recurs as atmospheric descriptor (opening, beat two, beat four) but does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page. Setup: present in opening. Development: mentioned but passive. Payoff: "retreated, not broken, but fulfilled" in final paragraph—a thematic echo, not a causal force. Two gates (setup, payoff), eligible to ~6.0 under lyric-resonance allowance, but the concept remains ornamental rather than constraining (−1.0 for ornamental use, −0.5 for swappability—any mood term could replace it). Anchor 3.0 + early signal 0.3 = 3.3, minus frictions −1.5 = 1.8, rounded up slightly for thematic coherence to 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Quietly persistent" is mentioned in beat one ("His nature was quietly persistent") and demonstrated through steady, unrushed labor across beats two and three. Setup: present. Development: labor montage shows the trait in action. Payoff: no explicit callback at closure, but sustained effort culminates in the carousel's transformation. Two gates (setup, development), eligible to ~6.0. However, the trait is more label than constraint—Elias does not face a choice where persistence trades off against another need or imposes visible cost (−0.7 for low cost connection, −0.4 for summary-only articulation in beat one). Anchor 3.0 + early signal 0.4 + one beat 0.4 = 3.8, minus frictions −1.1 = 2.7. Adjusting for demonstrated (not merely told) trait across labor: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Singing appears in beat four as the pivotal action that shifts the scene from work to transformation. Setup: grandfather's melody surfaces from memory. Development: none—singing is introduced only at the climax. Payoff: singing triggers the halo fragment's intensified glow and the horses' shift. One gate (payoff), normally capping at 2.8, but the action is causally central to the ending (+1.6 for causal pressure, +1.8 for closure linkage). Late appearance (final third) −0.8. Anchor 3.0 + causal pressure 1.6 + closure linkage 1.8 + specificity 0.5 (grandfather's melody, "rough from disuse but true") = 6.9, minus late penalty −0.8 = 6.1. However, the song is the decisive act that redefines the scene's outcome; without it, no transformation occurs. Adjusting for indispensability: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"A wrong turn leads to a hidden oasis" is the inciting method, present in beat one ("taken a wrong turn on a dusty backroad"). Setup: established. Development: the oasis (circus train) provides the workspace but does not constrain later tactics. Payoff: Elias reflects "He had taken a wrong turn and found this oasis" in the final paragraph, reprising the method thematically. Two gates (setup, payoff), eligible to ~6.0 under lyric-resonance. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (inciting) +0.4, closure linkage (thematic callback) +0.5. However, the method is swappable—any discovery premise would function (−0.6), and it does not shape mid-story attempts or constrain choices (−0.5). Anchor 3.0 + 1.5 signals − 1.1 frictions = 3.4. Lyric reprise lifts slightly: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Abandoned circus train is present throughout. Setup: discovered in beat one. Development: provides the dismantled carousel and workspace in beat two, horses stacked against walls supply the restoration goal. Payoff: "no longer a tomb of memories, but a cradle of potential" in final paragraph. All three gates met. Early signal +0.7, two beats (discovery, workspace) +0.9, closure linkage (reweighted in final image) +1.0, specificity +0.5 (peeling murals, velvet rot). However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource Elias must work around; he has all needed tools and proceeds without spatial friction (−0.8 for low constraint). Anchor 3.0 + 3.1 signals − 0.8 = 5.3. The train's transformation from "tomb" to "cradle" charges the ending thematically, lifting to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Inside the chime of wind bells" frames the timeframe poetically. Setup: wind bells introduced in beat one. Development: "chimed again" in beat two, "occasional chime" marks labor in beat three, "chimed in sympathy" in beat four. Payoff: "a promise held inside the chime of wind bells" in final line. All three gates, four beats. Early signal +0.6, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9. However, the bells do not tighten decisions or impose a clock that alters tactics; they measure time atmospherically without consequence (−1.2 for vague/untracked pressure). Anchor 3.0 + 2.9 signals − 1.2 = 4.7. The final-line callback recharges the motif slightly, but it remains ornamental: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to interpret silence as possibility" is stated in beat one and demonstrated through Elias's choice to work (beat two–three) and sing (beat four). Setup: articulated early. Development: work embodies the motivation without friction. Payoff: "silence became a language of creation" reprises the motivation thematically. All three gates. Early signal +0.7, two beats (work, song) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs (−0.6 for low friction, −0.3 for summary-only in beat one). Anchor 3.0 + 2.4 signals − 0.9 frictions = 4.5. The shift to singing dramatizes the motivation partially, lifting to 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Whispering gleam" recurs across four beats: halo fragment in beat two, polishing in beat three, intensified glow in beat four, "steady, gentle light" in final paragraph. Setup: present. Development: gleam modulates from whisper to brightness as pressure builds. Payoff: settles into steady light at closure. All three gates, four beats. Early signal +0.6, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, modulation with pressure +0.5. However, tone remains uniform (hopeful, soft, reverent) without meaningful tension or shift that charges the stakes (−0.7 for static mood). Anchor 3.0 + 3.5 signals − 0.7 = 5.8. The gleam's intensification parallels emotional arc purposefully, lifting to 5.9.</comment>
