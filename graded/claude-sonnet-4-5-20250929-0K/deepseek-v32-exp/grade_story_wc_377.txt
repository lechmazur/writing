<comment>Elara is presented through labels rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her seasonal muteness is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost—she works in silence but would be tuning bells regardless. The "success" at the climax arrives without prior struggle or mistake; she simply fine-tunes and the symphony works, offering no earned transformation or renunciation. Interiority defaults to abstract claims ("her heart sang") rather than embodied, character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<comment>The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening lines and operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density and metaphor build toward a final image. However, the closure moment (the symphony restores wonder) lacks visible cost: no path is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized, only success affirmed. The iceberg fragment "glistens more brightly than ever" as acknowledgment, but this celebratory image carries no felt price or constraint, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration claim. Causality within the accumulative frame is clean, but the Cost Proof Test fails—no on-page sentence makes a sacrifice or limit legible at the ending beat.</comment>

<comment>The Whispering Bluff is vividly rendered with clouds, wind-whispers, and kinetic sculpture, and the iceberg fragment's glisten charges multiple beats including the final image. Spatial choreography (bluff, sculpture, bells, fragment) remains coherent and the sensory hierarchy (visual light, auditory chimes) supports the POV focus. However, the environment does not constrain a tactical choice—Elara adjusts bells without environmental friction—so the setting's role remains atmospheric rather than pressure-driven, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—preserving the color of wonder—is signaled early and accumulates through the sculpture's assembly. One tightening occurs when Elara notices the dimming and fine-tunes the largest bell, but this "focused intensity" moment is summary-only; no competing option, resource limit, or failed attempt dramatizes the cost of success. The symphony erupts and wonder blooms without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path, so escalation remains conceptual rather than earned by protagonist choice under constraint. Agency is present but unchallenged, and the resolution is declarative success without trade-off.</comment>

<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Theme (truth and wonder intertwined, sustained by action not words) emerges from the kinetic sculpture's function and Elara's seasonal muteness, and the final image of the iceberg fragment glistening "with a promise" offers a lyric reconfiguration. However, the piece edges toward overt statement—"truth and wonder were intertwined, preserved not by words, but by action and harmony"—in place of letting the sculptural act alone embody the insight. The closing lines ("not as long as there were hands to tune the bells and hearts to hear the truth") drift into moralizing, reducing ambiguity. Subtext in the glisten and the mute protagonist is strong, but the authored thesis competes with the image.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction carries a heightened, mythic register appropriate to the post-verbal world ("ethereal hue," "symphonies of truth"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices sound, light, and the wind's whispers—but narration drifts into abstract summary ("her heart sang with the success") and therapy-inflected insight ("a gift, allowing her to listen more deeply") that undercuts immediacy. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("she noticed," "she understood") are frequent but voice-motivated; still, the distance flattens peak moments when concrete perception would elevate pressure.</comment>

<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"color of wonder," "tapestry of sound," "prismatic lights that danced like visible music"—creating a lyric texture but also verging on overwriting without pattern-teaching or payoff. Several lines loop or paraphrase: "the symphonies of truth were not just melodies; they were narratives" restates rather than advances. Template cadence appears in the closing paragraph with repeated "she/her" sentence openers and stacked abstract claims. Propulsion stalls in the final third as exposition supplants scene pressure, and the Cost Proof gap in Q2 traces partly to line-level summary here. Clarity remains high, but information density drops when metaphor inflates without causal work.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The premise—post-verbal world, bell tuner, kinetic sculpture driven by iceberg fragment—combines several high-concept elements into a striking frame. However, the emotional and plot arc (artist completes grand work, restores fading beauty) follows a familiar template without transformative specificity: no lived detail, occupational friction, or moral calculus complicates the success. The seasonal muteness is a fresh attribute but remains ornamental, never shaping a choice. Risk is conceptual rather than executed; the piece hedges toward mythic distance and avoids the messy particulars that would make the synthesis feel inevitable rather than assembled.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Elara is present throughout and her goal (preserve wonder) frames all beats. She adjusts bells, crafts the sculpture, and fine-tunes the largest bell in the climax, so setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, her choices are uncontested—no failed attempt, competing option, or visible cost dramatized—so causal pressure is weak. The role is essential to closure participation but her agency does not narrow options or force trade-offs on the page, capping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The iceberg fragment appears early (salvaged from a melting glacier), is described as key to the bells' clarity, and returns in the climax and final image where it "glistened more brightly than ever" and later "with a promise." Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, and the object charges the closure image with reweighted meaning. However, its function remains static—glistening as response—rather than constraining a choice or imposing cost, so causal pressure is limited. The specificity (cold purity, melting glacier origin) and closure linkage lift the score into mid-6s, but indispensability is not achieved.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>Symphonies of truth are named early and described as revealing "hidden realities of existence," and the climax features "the purest symphony of truth yet." Setup and closure participation gates are met. However, the concept remains thematic claim rather than tactical constraint—truth does not create friction, limit options, or impose cost on Elara's actions. The symphony is outcome, not method under pressure. Swappability is high; "symphonies of beauty" or "resonance of clarity" would function identically with minor edits, indicating ornamental rather than structural integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>Seasonal muteness is introduced early and stated to deepen Elara's connection to the non-verbal world. It is present in the climax ("Though she could not speak, her heart sang") and closure ("her muteness was a gift"). Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the trait never constrains or enables a distinct on-page action—Elara tunes bells in silence, but her work is manual and would proceed identically if she were vocal. No cost, trade-off, or tactical shift is tied to the muteness; it functions as atmospheric label rather than pressure-creating attribute. Late first thematic payoff and lack of middle causal work cap the score below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Glisten appears early (iceberg fragment "eternally glistening"), recurs in mid-story ("the iceberg fragment would glisten in response"), and anchors the climax ("glistened more brightly than ever") and final image ("glisten with a promise"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, and the action charges the closure image with reweighted meaning. However, glistening is response rather than protagonist choice—it does not narrow options or create causal pressure; Elara does not handle, risk, or lose the glisten. The action is irreplaceable as final-image motif but passive as plot driver, placing it in upper-5s rather than 7+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The kinetic sculpture is introduced early ("her latest endeavor… crafting for years"), its mechanics detailed (polished stones, suspended bells, wind-driven movement triggering chimes), and it is activated in the climax where "the kinetic sculpture whirred to life" and produces the grand resonance. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, and the method shapes the climax's mechanism. However, no alternate method is attempted or ruled out—Elara does not face a constraint that makes the sculpture essential over hand-ringing or other means—so causal pressure is moderate. The specificity (wind-driven ballet, iceberg fragment at heart) and beat involvement across all three gates lift the score into mid-6s, but swappability and lack of visible cost prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>The Whispering Bluff is introduced in the opening line ("suspended above the clouds"), described with wind and air that "seemed to speak in hushed tones," and recurs in the climax ("The sound washed over the bluff") and epilogue ("On the whispering bluff above the clouds"). Setup and closure participation gates are met. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara's work proceeds without environmental friction, and the bluff functions as atmospheric stage rather than tactical pressure. The wind's whispers guide her work (label-only; no on-page decision shaped by a specific whisper), so causal linkage is weak. Vivid description and closure presence place it in low-5s, but lack of choice-constraint caps it below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>The timeframe "after words had become unnecessary" is established early and repeated in the final paragraph, and the seasonal cycle (autumn deepens, winter approaches, voice returns in spring) provides temporal structure. Setup and closure participation gates are met. However, time does not tighten decisions—no clock, deadline, or decaying resource forces Elara's hand. The seasonal muteness coincides with her work window but does not create urgency or trade-off; the climax could occur at any point in autumn without consequence. The timeframe is conceptual setting rather than tactical pressure, and swappability is high (any post-linguistic or mythic era would function identically), capping the score near the functional-but-replaceable threshold.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.5</grade>
<comment>Preserving the color of wonder is named as Elara's "singular" motivation in the opening paragraph, drives the entire plot (she notices dimming, acts to restore it), and the climax delivers success ("the color of wonder blooming back into existence"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice—no competing want (safety, rest, recognition) creates friction, and no cost (stamina, materials, risk of failure) is visible on the page. The desire shapes the plot's direction but not the protagonist's tactics under constraint, so causal pressure is moderate. Swappability is moderate (preserving "awe" or "magic" would function similarly), placing the score in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Muted vigor is introduced early ("muted vigor that belied her silence") and sustained through the piece with restrained, elevated diction ("focused intensity," "silent communion") that avoids overt emotion labels. The tone coheres through the climax (tears but no exclamation, the heart "sang" internally) and modulates in the epilogue toward reflective promise. However, the tone does not shift meaningfully under pressure—intensity remains declarative rather than embodied—and the final image's promise ("wonder would never fully fade") maintains the same register without cadence break or charged silence. Coherence is strong, but lack of tonal turn or pressure-driven modulation that reweights the final image caps the score in mid-5s rather than 7+.</comment>
