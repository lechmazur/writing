<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara and Leo read as functional archetypes (cryptic writer, ex-spy) rather than individuals with contradictory impulses. Motivation is declared ("transpose life into a new key") but not embodied through micro-choices under pressure; the meeting unfolds as scripted plan rather than through genuine struggle. The phrase "accidentally prophetic" remains a label without cost or friction—no on-page moment shows her wrestling with unintended consequences. Emotional states are asserted ("heart racing") rather than enacted through contradictory action or embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when are anchored early (lighthouse, Elara, after last orders), so no penalty applies. However, the piece offers outline-level sequencing—Elara encodes, Leo decodes, they meet, they expose secrets—without because/therefore linkage or motivated ellipsis. The closure unit is announced ("transposed their lives") rather than landing as a visible change in options or stance with felt cost on the page. Inferred lens is weakly Causal, but key turns (Leo's arrival, the decision to collaborate) are narrated as summary rather than dramatized beats that narrow options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse is named early and returns in the final third, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. No on-page moment shows the rocky island or lantern room altering a choice—spatial details (rowing, entering, sitting) are narrated but do not pressure tactics. The microdot films and fortune cookies are handled in multiple beats, which lifts the score slightly, yet the environment itself remains a static stage rather than a resource or obstacle that shapes the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("escape her lonely routine") is declared but never tested on the page; Elara's plan unfolds without reversal, complication, or visible cost. Leo's arrival is scripted rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure. The "delicate operation" and cache discovery are summarized in tell-mode, not dramatized as beats that foreclose options or force trade-offs. No on-page escalation tightens choices; the resolution is delivered as fait accompli rather than a constrained decision with legible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The theme of "open secrets" and transposition is stated repeatedly but not demonstrated through concrete particulars that evolve under pressure. The final paragraph ("she had finally transposed her life into a new key, full of meaning and light") is a thematic summary that replaces scene pressure with assertion. The microdot films and fortune cookies recur but do not shift meaning at the end; they remain static symbols. No ambiguity or counter-reading emerges—every thematic claim is tidily resolved and explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited through Elara, with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic—her way of noticing (the coast, the lantern room, Leo's arrival) could belong to any character. Dialogue, when present, is functional but lacks subtext or goal-driven indirection: "Your fortunes, they're open secrets, aren't they?" reads as thematic prompt rather than character-specific idiom. Psychic distance is consistent but does not modulate with pressure; peak beats are narrated at the same remove as exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops across adjacent lines: "transpose...into a new key" appears five times, "directing the flow" three times, "after last orders" five times, "orchestrate/orchestrated" four times, creating template cadence without taught pattern or payoff. The final third is dominated by synonym churn ("enigma," "cryptic," "mysterious") and summary scaffolding ("Over nights...they worked," "With this, they transposed"). Filter-verb stacks ("watch," "see," "feel") dull immediacy in peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the artifact penalty pack: −1.7 baseline, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise (fortune-cookie writer uses spy microdot to orchestrate connection) is high-concept but executed as template: lonely lighthouse keeper, mysterious encoded messages, ex-spy decoder. The emotional arc (isolation → empowerment) and plot beats (encode → decode → unite → expose) follow a familiar structure without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "accidentally prophetic" trait and "open secrets" remain ornamental labels rather than constraints that generate fresh turns. No moment feels inevitable in hindsight through character-specific choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara (cryptic fortune cookie writer) is present throughout and initiates the plan, but her decisions are narrated in summary rather than dramatized as on-page turns. She watches Leo arrive and explains the microdot scheme, but these are expository beats, not choices that alter tactics under pressure. Her occupation shapes the setup but does not constrain or enable a middle or closure action with visible cost. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The spycraft microdot film specs appear in three beats: Elara uses them to encode (setup), Leo decodes one (middle), and they "lay on the table" in the final paragraph. However, the middle beat is summary-only ("he decoded it"), and the closure mention is a static image without causal pressure or reweighted meaning. The object does not narrow options or enable a choice with cost at the end. Two gates (setup, closure cameo) with weak middle use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Open secrets is named four times but functions as thematic label rather than a stake that shapes on-page tactics. The "truths the islanders sensed but never acknowledged" are told, not shown; no scene dramatizes the friction between concealment and revelation. The concept does not constrain a choice or alter the closure beat—Leo's question "they're open secrets, aren't they?" is exposition. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is declared in the opening and mentioned once more ("Elara's fortunes remained accidentally prophetic") but never dramatized as a constraint or cost. No on-page moment shows her struggling with unintended consequences or a prophecy that constrains her plan. The trait is a label without visible tradeoff. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Orchestrate" and "orchestrated" appear five times, describing Elara's plan and their joint operation, but the action itself is summarized rather than shown through specific tactics that narrow options. The major turn (Leo's arrival) is not traced to orchestration on the page—it follows from decoding, not from Elara's directed influence. The action is swappable with "plan" or "arrange" without structural loss. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"By directing the flow" is named three times but the mechanics are never shown. How does Elara direct information flow through fortune cookies? How does this method shape Leo's decoding or their joint operation? The method is asserted in summary ("directing the flow of small, guided events") but not dramatized as a means that alters attempts or imposes cost. Told-only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The mysterious lighthouse on a rocky island is named early, returns in multiple beats (Elara rows there, Leo sails to it, they work in the lantern room), and anchors the final image. However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no on-page choice is altered by the rocky terrain, isolation, or lighthouse mechanics. The setting is present across the arc and appears in the ending, but does not pressure tactics or supply resources that shape outcome. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After last orders" is named five times and frames the temporal window, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics. No clock pressure; the phrase is a recurring anchor rather than a live constraint. The passage of time ("Over nights after last orders") is vague rather than tracked. Present and consistent but does not alter moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"To transpose life into a new key" is named five times as Elara's motivation, but it remains a metaphorical label without dramatized friction. No on-page beat shows her choosing between escape and another want, or paying a cost to achieve transposition. The desire is declared and then fulfilled in summary. Told-only; no friction between wants and costs on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Familiar enigma" is named twice and the tone aims for mystery, but it remains static rather than modulating with pressure. The mood does not shift between setup, middle tension, and closure—every beat is narrated at the same reflective distance. The final image ("familiar enigma...remained their base") echoes the opening without reweighting the stake or charging the closure. Present but does not evolve to support the ending.</comment>
