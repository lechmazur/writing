<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "end of history witness" remains a labeled abstraction throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses in scene, no micro-choices under pressure that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority consists entirely of thematic summary ("His motivation was to unravel cosmic illusions") rather than character-particular thought. The final "smile" arrives unearned by prior causality; no visible cost forecloses a path. The piece reads as allegorical tableau rather than dramatized human struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who/where anchored, but "when" remains abstract throughout), triggering the test penalty. No legible drive lens emerges by midpoint: the piece cycles through repeated synonym statements ("unraveling," "unifying," "dissolving") without causal linkage or accumulative deepening. The ending asserts transformation ("cosmic illusions were unraveled") but offers no on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost—only declarative summary that reality now "stood pure and bright."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is evoked with atmospheric detail ("dust of epochs," "scrolls and tomes," "ceiling lost to darkness") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography remains vague—"aisles," "chamber," "pedestal" appear without legible distances or obstacles. The mural and dictionary are handled, satisfying minimal micro-setting use, but neither pressures the witness's movement or options. The Q2 orientation penalty caps Q3 at 7.0; execution here reaches mid-5s on its own merits.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("unravel cosmic illusions") is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or tightening. The witness proceeds without reversal, obstacle, or trade-off; each paragraph restates intent in synonym loops rather than escalating pressure. No moment narrows options or forces a visible price. The ending declares success without demonstrating agency, renunciation, or endurance that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme ("illusion versus reality") is stated overtly in thematic summary ("cosmic illusions began to dissolve") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The dictionary and mural are invoked repeatedly but do not shift meaning across beats—they remain static symbols. The final image ("reality stood pure and bright") offers a moral assertion rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids the worst sermon-ending penalties because the last line gestures toward transformation, but thematic echo throughout the text ("unraveling illusions," "new beginnings") reads as prompt-label repetition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient distance is stable, no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and uniform throughout ("resounding hush," "wanderingly exact," "spiral arbitration"), creating a static ceremonial register that does not modulate with pressure. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; "he felt," "he knew," "he saw" filter every observation without idiosyncratic texture. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric accumulation of abstract terms) but the voice reads as thesis-essay rather than dramatized interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn dominate: "unravel/dissolve/unveil," "journeying inward/walking out" repeated across a dozen paragraphs without added pressure or detail. Template cadence pervades ("He [verb]. He [verb].") across three or more consecutive sentences in multiple passages. Stock metaphors ("mist under a rising sun," "beacon against shadows") appear without transformation. Filter-verb stacks ("he felt," "he knew," "he sought") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Artifacts touch the closure image ("reality stood pure and bright"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and global 9+ disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The core premise (seeker in mystical library achieving enlightenment) is a widely used template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "end of history witness" label suggests a fresh angle but remains ornamental—swappable with "truth-seeker" or "philosopher" with no structural impact. No bold risk-taking; the piece hedges into safe abstraction rather than committing to concrete stakes. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 in Q8 for template use without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The "end of history witness" character is named in the opening line and appears throughout, but makes no choice that alters tactics or creates a turn. Observation-only role; decisions are asserted in summary ("he unified," "he knew") rather than dramatized. Meets setup gate; missing development and closure gates. Late penalty does not apply (present from start), but swappability (−0.7) and ornamental use (−0.8) lower the score. No causal pressure or cost tied to this specific character trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The softcover dictionary appears in paragraph 2, is consulted in paragraph 10 ("opened...to 'illusion'"), used again in paragraph 25 ("decode the mural"), placed on a pedestal in paragraph 34, and dissolves in paragraph 46. Five distinct beats across setup, development, and closure gates. However, its specific properties (softcover, frayed, cracked spine) do not constrain choice—any reference text would serve the same function. Swappability (−0.7) and lack of causal pressure under stress (no narrowing of options tied to its physical state) prevent higher scoring. Closure linkage (pedestal, dissolution) adds +1.0, but the dictionary resolves a problem it did not help create (−1.0).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Spiral arbitration" is mentioned in paragraphs 7, 11, 15, 27, 35, and 47—six label-only references without mechanics or on-page demonstration. The concept is described as "conflicting truths coiling into resolution" but never shown altering tactics or narrowing options. Label-only trait (−0.3), ornamental use (−0.8), summary-only (−0.8). Appears early (setup gate met) and at closure (payoff gate met), but missing development gate. No causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Wanderingly exact" is introduced in paragraph 6 as a trait of the witness's path and recurs in paragraphs 16, 28, 40, and 49. The attribute is described ("deliberate yet seemingly meandering") but never constrains or enables a concrete action with visible cost. Label-only mentions; no on-page tradeoff where precision conflicts with exploration or vice versa. Setup, development (paragraph 28 reprise), and closure (paragraph 49) gates met, but ornamental use (−0.8) and label-only trait (−0.3) apply.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Unify" appears as goal statement in paragraph 8, action in paragraphs 20, 31, 37, and declarative success in paragraph 52. The action is stated rather than dramatized—no scene shows the witness choosing between fragmented understandings or paying a price to synthesize them. Summary-only use (−0.8), swappability with "understand" or "reconcile" (−0.7). Setup, development, and closure gates met; early signal (+0.5) and three beats (+1.4) cannot overcome the lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Journeying inward while walking out" is introduced in paragraph 5 and repeated in paragraphs 12, 21, 32, 43, and 51. The method is described but never shown with mechanics that matter—no scene where inward focus costs outward navigation or vice versa. Label-only repetition; the mechanics do not shape attempts or constrain choices. Setup, development, and closure gates met; five beats (+1.4) offset by ornamental use (−0.8) and label-only trait (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is present throughout as continuous location. It provides atmospheric anchors ("dust," "scrolls," "darkness," "chamber," "pedestal") but never pressures choices or supplies resources that affect outcome. The library "fades" in paragraph 44 as consequence, meeting closure gate. Setup and payoff gates met; missing development gate (no middle choice constrained by setting). Postcard description trends apply (−0.7); no causal pressure where spatial access or library rules alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"Across a universe's hiccup" appears in paragraphs 8, 21, 30, 47, and 50. The timeframe is poetic but vague—no live clock tightens decisions, no tracked duration alters tactics. The "hiccup" is described as "fleeting pause between cosmic breaths" but its mechanics never constrain action. Late first appearance (paragraph 8, second third; −0.3), ornamental use (−0.8), label-only (−0.3). Meets setup and closure gates; missing development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To unravel cosmic illusions" is stated as motivation in paragraph 3 and repeated in paragraphs 23, 32, 37, 51. The desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no scene where the witness faces friction between wanting clarity and fearing its cost. Told-only trends apply (−0.8). Setup, development (paragraph 32 reprise), and closure gates met; early signal (+0.6) and five beats (+1.4) partially offset the lack of on-page want-versus-cost friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Resounding hush" appears in paragraphs 9, 17, 28, 36, 43, 50, and is described as "silence so profound it seemed to whisper." The tone is asserted via repeated label rather than modulated through sentence rhythm or cadence shift under pressure. Static mood without tonal variation across turns; does not charge the final image with fresh resonance. Setup, development, and closure gates met; seven beats (+1.4) offset by label-only repetition (−0.3) and lack of modulation under pressure (mid-band limiter).</comment>
