<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's journey from grief to healing is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies on abstract label-speak ("subdued ardor," "quiet but fierce determination") without embodied contradiction or on-page struggle. The protagonist receives transformative objects passively (origami figures appear; she follows) rather than making choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. The ending woman's moment reads as testimony to Elara's success but lacks the protagonist's own contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story unfolds as a retrospective summary spanning an indeterminate period ("Days passed," "One evening") rather than a continuous scene or two-shard sequence with clear transitions. Orientation anchors who and where early, but the temporal scope remains vague past the 120-word mark and never tightens into a bounded window. Closure reads as a thematic declaration ("grief was not a full stop, but a comma") rather than an on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost in a final image or action. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) is signaled by recurring images (origami, rose stencil, curtains) but the ending delivers exposition about transformation rather than a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observatory is anchored early with sensory specificity (velvet curtains, dusty table, dome light) and provides a coherent spatial frame. The tattoo stencil on vellum and origami figures supply recurring objects that charge the protagonist's arc, and the final lamp placement shows environmental evolution. However, the observatory functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint (access, proximity, tool limitation) forces a mid-story choice or meaningfully alters tactics. The micro-setting (workbench, sealed room, telescope) is present but does not narrow options under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching grief to transform into growth—is signaled early but remains abstract and uncontested. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows live options; Elara follows coordinates without friction, and each clue confirms rather than complicates her path. The arrival of the grieving woman offers a secondary test but is resolved immediately with the bracelet gift, leaving no visible cost or trade-off. Escalation reads as accumulation of similar acts (more origami, more jewelry, more visitors) rather than a meaningful deepening or a turn that forecloses a path with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (transformation from grief) emerges consistently through recurring images—rose stencil, origami, curtains of intention—and the final image of open curtains offers a non-literal answer. However, the piece undermines subtext by stating its thesis explicitly in multiple beats: "grief was not a full stop, but a comma," "withering was merely the prelude to blooming," "curtains of intention...were frames to focus purpose on renewal." These thematic echo moments (especially in the final paragraphs) flatten earned resonance into prompt-like language. The woman's line "genuinely artificial comfort that made her feel genuinely seen" restates the concept rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice establishes a lyric register early ("her hands too heavy with grief to lift a hammer") and sustains it through closure. Diction is controlled, though occasional elevations ("subdued ardor," "illuminate," "philosophy") read as prompt-driven rather than character-particular. The piece uses purposeful compression and patterned recurrence (origami, coordinates, stencil) legibly. However, psychic distance stays uniform across beats without modulation under pressure, and the woman's dialogue in the final scene ("genuinely artificial comfort that made her feel genuinely seen") ventriloquizes the story's thesis rather than speaking in a distinct voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The prose suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and templated phrasing. Adjacent sentences restate the same content without added pressure: "She realized he had left this trail... a method to teach her how to make withering bloom again" echoes the motivation already established. Template cadence runs dominate: "Each piece a monument to loss... each piece an illumination... each origami figure she folded... And the curtains... And so... And Elara." Stock metaphor strings ("rock bottom," "steady star," "seed for new growth") accumulate without fresh specificity. The phrase "genuinely artificial" is repeated four times across four beats without reweighting, and "subdued ardor" appears three times as a label rather than embodied state. High-pressure beats lean on filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she learned," "she continued") that dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("her subdued ardor... now burned like a steady star"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—grief counselor through art and treasure-hunt origami—closely follows therapeutic-journey and scavenger-hunt templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The rose stencil (petals falling, buds forming) and phoenix imagery are stock grief-to-rebirth symbols without fresh particulars. The narrative voice and emotional arc could be transplanted to any healing story with minor name changes, failing the transformation test. The origami-coordinate method offers surface novelty but operates without friction or cost, reducing to a plot convenience rather than an organic synthesis of character and world.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her choices do not create key turns. She receives origami figures passively, follows coordinates without friction, and crafts jewelry in response to clues rather than through on-page decisions that narrow options. The woman's arrival in the final scene offers a test of Elara's transformation, but Elara's action (giving the bracelet) is a demonstration rather than a choice under pressure. Swappable with "healer" or "guide" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tattoo stencil on vellum appears in beats 2 (discovery behind curtains), 4 (used as jewelry template), 6 (woman receives bracelet engraved with rose stencil), and 7 (permanent lamp illuminates it). It is handled on the page (Elara crafts from it, places a lamp) and its meaning shifts from symbol of loss to renewal. However, it does not constrain a choice under pressure; Elara adopts it without friction. Closure linkage is indirect (the woman receives a derivative, not the stencil itself). Introduced at ~25%, functional across beats, but swappable with any transformative design without structural cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"Curtains of intention" appear in beats 2 (Elara parts them to enter the sealed room) and 8 (final image: "the curtains of intention remained open"). The concept is thematized explicitly ("not barriers to hide behind, but frames to focus one's purpose on renewal") but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. Parting the curtains is a physical act without on-page cost or consequence; the sealed room is already Elara's. The final image is symbolic recurrence without reweighting through choice. Label-only use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" is applied to the tattoo stencil, the origami figures, and the woman's comfort in beats 3, 6, and 7. It is thematized ("a man-made image that felt more truthful") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The attribute describes symbolic objects without altering Elara's tactics or the story's options. Swappable with "crafted" or "intentional" without structural impact. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears in beats 3 (shaft of light illuminates the stencil), 5 (jewelry as "illumination for those lost in grief"), 6 (Elara "continued to illuminate the path"), 7 (permanent lamp), and 8 (constellation naming, "illumination was always possible"). The action is present but mostly metaphorical; the literal illumination (lamp, dome light) does not trace to a major turn. The woman's telescope moment involves illumination but Elara's giving the bracelet drives that beat. Easily swappable with "reveal" or "guide" in most uses. Functional across beats but mid-band at best.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Leaving origami figures with coordinates inside is signaled in beat 1 (Elara finds crane), developed in beat 4 (more figures lead her to clues), and payoff in beat 5 (she begins leaving her own for visitors). The method shapes Elara's transformation arc and the narrative's structure. However, it does not constrain a choice under pressure; Elara follows coordinates without friction or cost, and leaving her own figures is a demonstration of success rather than a contested tactic. Present across all three gates with causal role in the middle turn (discovery of grandfather's trail), but swappable with any treasure-hunt method without altering the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The timeless observatory is anchored early and provides the spatial frame for most beats (workbench, sealed room, dome, telescope). It supplies the tattoo stencil, journals, and tools, affecting what Elara discovers. However, the setting does not pressure choices or alter tactics; no environmental constraint (access, tool limitation, proximity) forces a trade-off or narrows options under pressure. The observatory functions as a repository for symbols and a coherent backdrop but does not meaningfully shape the escalation or closure. Functional but replaceable with any isolated workspace.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After hitting rock bottom" is signaled in the opening line and frames the starting condition. The timeframe is retrospective and spans an indeterminate period ("Days passed," "One evening"), never tightening into a bounded window that pressures tactics. No live clock or temporal constraint alters Elara's moves; the passage of time measures recovery rather than forcing choices. The before/after is legible (grief to teaching) but the timeframe itself does not shape the escalation. Present but vague; low causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To teach withering to bloom again" is stated explicitly in beat 4 ("her motivation to teach withering to bloom again") and echoed in beats 5, 7, and 8. The desire is thematized and guides Elara's actions (crafting jewelry, leaving origami, helping the woman), but it is not dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction. Elara adopts the motivation after discovering her grandfather's trail without on-page cost or hesitation. The ending demonstrates fulfillment but does not test want against fear or need. Told-only with functional role across beats but no dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Subdued ardor" is named in beats 4, 5, 7, and 8 as a label for Elara's emotional state ("quiet but fierce determination," "a passion not loud but profound," "burned like a steady star"). Tone is coherent and matches the lyric register, but it remains static across turns without modulation under pressure. The phrase is a descriptor rather than an embodied progression that charges the final image. Present and consistent but one-note; does not escalate or shift cadence meaningfully at closure.</comment>
