<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is abstract and unembodied throughout; we never see contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. Lines like "his muse deepening with each passing moment" and "eloquently silent" remain label-only without grounding in concrete perception or micro-choice under pressure. The revelation that he was manipulated arrives via summary rather than dramatized discovery, and the final transformation ("dynasty ender had become a dynasty healer") is asserted without visible cost or foreclosed path. Therapy-speak pervades peak moments without earning the insight through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed and vague—who, where, and when remain unclear past 120 words (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0). The closure unit is told rather than shown: "hidden truth was now uncovered" summarizes rather than dramatizes the decisive change, and no visible cost appears on the page to validate the transformation. The gramophone's "standing waves" create a "bridge of intuition" through assertion, not causal progression. The lens is ambiguous (neither Causal linkage nor Accumulative pattern is legibly taught), and the ending declares change without proving it through action or image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or charges the final image—it remains postcard description. "Golden shadows" recur as ornament without tactical pressure. The gramophone is handled twice (wound, then still), meeting minimal micro-setting use, which lifts the score slightly. Spatial choreography is vague (the window's position, the table's distance), and no sensory detail beyond the visual appears to ground the protagonist's state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to uncover a hidden truth"—is declared but never tested on the page; the music simply "amplified his thoughts, guiding him toward clarity" without resistance or cost. No meaningful tightening occurs: the standing waves deliver the answer without a trade-off or foreclosed path. The protagonist's agency is passive (the gramophone does the work), and the final decision to "seek redemption, exposing the manipulators" is announced rather than dramatized. Coincidence (the record's content) resolves the problem it did not help create.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emerging: "dynasty ender was no more; he was now a seeker of justice, transformed by truth" reduces the arc to a moral summary. The gramophone and standing waves are introduced as symbolic conveniences without prior constraint or cost. No competing interpretation or ambiguity charges the ending; the piece declares its thesis ("truth had set him free") in the final third without earning resonance through particulars. The "bridge of intuition" is a metaphor that remains abstract rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with no head-hopping, which supports baseline clarity. However, diction repeatedly drifts into abstract elevation ("eloquently silent," "muse deepening," "bridge of intuition") that clashes with the concrete act of winding a gramophone. Perceptual signature is generic—no character-particular way of noticing emerges. Dialogue is absent. The prose reads as committee voice rather than a singular focalizer's idiom, and interiority summarizes state ("his motivation fulfilled") rather than showing thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dominate: "He remembered… Now, he sought… wondering if…" restates the same inquiry across adjacent lines (−0.2). Template cadence runs appear ("He reached… As he wound… He placed…") without variation (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("bridge of intuition," "golden shadows") and therapy-speak ("his muse deepening," "emotional introspective state") cluster in peak beats (−0.6). The final third is saturated with summary and synonym churn ("seeker of justice," "dynasty healer," "figure reborn"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8. Sentence openings repeat "He" and "The" mechanically. Information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—a man uses music to unlock repressed memories—is a widely used template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−1.0). The gramophone and standing waves serve as symbolic conveniences introduced to solve the problem they did not help create. The emotional arc (guilt → revelation → redemption) follows a predictable three-act structure with no fresh inflection. "Dynasty ender" and "golden shadows" gesture at specificity but remain abstractions; the protagonist's worldview and choice hierarchy are never particularized.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The "dynasty ender" character is mentioned throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics; the gramophone does the work, and the final choice to "seek redemption" is declared off-page without visible cost or foreclosed path. Setup and closure presence are met, but middle development is absent (cap 3.4). Swappable with "truth-seeker" or similar archetype (−0.7). Summary-only use at closure (−0.6). Late transformation asserted rather than dramatized (−0.4). Rounding down: 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The gramophone crank handle appears in two beats (wound, then "lay forgotten"), meeting minimal reprise. Setup and closure presence are met, but it does not constrain a middle choice (cap 3.4). It enables the revelation without cost or specificity—any music device would serve the same function (−0.6). The "forgotten" reprise is ornamental rather than reweighted (−0.3). No causal pressure or irreplaceability demonstrated. Rounding down: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The "bridge of intuition" is a metaphor introduced in the second third via "standing waves" without prior setup (−0.4 for late arrival; cap 4.6). It does not shape tactics or constrain choice—it simply delivers the answer via summary ("guiding him toward clarity"). Ornamental use without action pressure (−0.9). Swappable with "connection" or "insight" (−0.7). Label-only mention (−0.3). Rounding down: 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Eloquently silent" appears twice as a label ("his presence eloquently silent," "eloquently silent man") without constraining or enabling an on-page action. No visible trade-off or cost tied to silence versus speech. Setup and closure presence met, but middle development absent (cap 3.4). Label-only trait (−0.3). Swappable with "contemplative" or "quiet" (−0.6). Ornamental (−0.7). Rounding down: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Muse" appears repeatedly but as an abstraction ("driven by a deep need to muse," "his muse deepening") rather than a dramatized action. Setup and closure presence met, but it does not drive a middle turn (cap 3.4). Easily swappable with "reflect" or "contemplate" (−0.7). Summary-only (−0.6). No causal pressure or cost (−0.4). Rounding down: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Through standing waves" is introduced in the second third without prior setup (−0.4; cap 4.6). The mechanism is named but never demonstrated—how standing waves differ from ordinary sound is unclear, and they do not shape attempts or constrain tactics. Ornamental (−0.9). Swappable with "sound" or "music" (−0.7). Summary-only use (−0.6). Rounding down: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The "sepia reading room" is named in the first line (setup met) and recurs at closure ("stood empty"). It does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—it remains postcard description. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) allows eligibility to ~6.0, but middle development is absent (cap 3.4). Swappable with any quiet interior space (−0.7). Ornamental (−0.8). No causal work. Rounding down: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"First yawn of evening" appears in the opening and final lines, framing the piece, but time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—the protagonist has unlimited leisure to muse. Setup and closure met, but middle development absent (cap 3.4). No live clock or urgency (−0.5). Ornamental reprise (−0.6). Swappable with "dusk" or "twilight" (−0.5). Rounding down: 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"To uncover a hidden truth" is stated early and drives the surface arc, but desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Setup and closure met, but no middle friction between want and cost (cap 3.4). The truth arrives via convenience (the gramophone) rather than struggle (−0.8). Told-only stakes (−0.6). No visible trade-off on the page (−0.4). Rounding down: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" recur throughout but remain static mood decoration without modulating with pressure. Setup and closure met, but middle development absent (cap 3.4). Tone does not charge the final image—shadows "fading" is asserted rather than felt (−0.6). Swappable with any warm lighting cue (−0.6). Ornamental (−0.7). Rounding down: 3.4.</comment>
