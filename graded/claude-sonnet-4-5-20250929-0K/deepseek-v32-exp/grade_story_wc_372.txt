<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is stated ("to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") but never tested by conflicting wants or material cost. His "gently meticulous" trait appears as label and summary rather than driving a choice under pressure. The story provides a single continuous task without internal contradiction or a moment where his values force a trade-off. Emotional interiority remains abstract ("heart ached") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in the same beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The piece presents as Accumulative/Textural, yet no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—Elian works methodically from start to finish without a reversal, complication, or shift in options. The final paragraph asserts closure ("he had conjured meaning...his own vow to memory complete") but no on-page cost or decisive change is dramatized; the library "sighs," stakes dissolve, and the work is simply done. Under any lens, the ending lacks the felt or visible price required for valid closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The frozen library is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (frosted marble, ice-crusted books, quartz hush). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The magic lantern slide and projector are handled concretely, yet they enable Elian's work without imposing cost or complication. Micro-setting (body, tool) does not charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the luminous vows before they fade—is signaled early but never tightens or forces a trade-off. Elian proceeds without opposition, error, or reversal; he simply completes his task. The timeframe ("while illusions fade to memory") suggests urgency, yet the magic lantern slide "began to dim" prompts only faster data collection, not a meaningful narrowing of options. No on-page cost or sacrifice is legible; the ending asserts success without dramatizing what was risked or lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (the weight of fading promises, memory vs. oblivion) is coherent and arises from imagery rather than statement. The final paragraph, however, resorts to overt thematic summary: "meaning endured, etched into the records he so carefully kept" and "he had measured not just light, but the weight of promises." These declarations replace earned resonance with authorial assertion. The story invites reflection but does not earn it through a non-literal final image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct textural signature (formal, archaic diction: "conjure meaning," "quartz hush"). Psychic distance remains stable in close-third. However, pervasive elevated register ("luminous vows," "gently meticulous," "crystalline stillness") occasionally drifts into ornamental phrasing that slows rather than sharpens pressure. No dialogue appears. The prose modulates little under rising stakes; the same measured cadence persists from opening to close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is adequate. Clarity is strong; no grammar errors or spatial confusion. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "gently meticulous" recurs three times without added pressure; "luminous vows" and "radiant promises" function as near-synonyms. Template cadence: "He lifted...he slotted...He measured...He documented...He worked...He sampled...He continued...He stored." The final third stacks declarative summary sentences that dull momentum. Figurative language ("swirling patterns of luminescence," "tapestry from scattered light") remains legible but generic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise (records chief measuring fading magical vows in a sky library) combines elements in a fresh frame. Execution, however, leans on stock metaphors ("echoes of souls," "tapestry from scattered light") and a plot template: lone archivist documents vanishing knowledge without opposition. The "sampling frequencies" method is mentioned but not dramatized in specific, non-obvious detail. The emotional arc—dedicated work leading to preservation—feels familiar and resolved without risk or transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and performs all actions, but his choices do not create key turns; he executes a predetermined task without deviation or complication. Observation and measurement dominate; no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses an option. Introduced immediately (setup), present in many beats (development), named in the final paragraph (closure participation), yet his agency remains passive. Score reflects functional presence without causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide is handled in multiple beats: Elian lifts it, slots it into the projector, adjusts dials as it projects vows, probes deeper as it glows brighter, and stores it away at the end. Setup, development, and closure participation are clear. However, the object enables his work without imposing constraint or cost; it could be replaced with a similar artifact (crystal, lens, scroll) with minor edits. Its "runes responding to his gentle touch" and final dimming suggest reweighted meaning but do not drive a reversal or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Luminous vows are present from the opening and define the dominant stake. They shape Elian's goal (measure their remaining power) and are handled across beats (projected, sampled, observed fading). Setup and development are solid; the ending references them ("the weight of promises that outlasted their makers"). However, the concept does not constrain a tactic or narrow options on the page. Vows function as thematic backdrop rather than causal pressure; their fading is asserted but does not force Elian to choose between competing goods or risk failure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" appears three times as a label (opening, middle, near end) without demonstrating a tradeoff or enabling a specific on-page action with cost. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is weak—no beat shows this trait constraining speed, forcing error, or preventing a shortcut. The trait reads as mood rather than causal engine. Swappable with "careful," "precise," or "reverent" with negligible impact on tactics or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Measure" is signaled early ("here to measure the last traces"), drives multiple beats (adjusting dials, sampling frequencies, noting pulse rhythms, documenting data), and appears in the final image ("measured not just light, but the weight of promises"). Setup, development, and closure participation are solid. However, the action is descriptive rather than transformative; Elian completes his task without complication. Measuring does not redefine options or impose a visible sacrifice. Functional across the arc but does not create a key turn or felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Sampling frequencies" is mentioned twice: once in summary ("He would do this by sampling frequencies, using a delicate apparatus") and again in execution ("He began sampling frequencies, noting how the light pulsed"). The method appears in setup and middle beats, but its mechanics remain vague—dials are adjusted, oscillations captured, but no specific friction or constraint emerges from the technique. If swapped for "recording harmonics" or "tracing wavelengths," the story would proceed unchanged. The method does not shape the ending or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The frozen library above the clouds is introduced immediately (setup) and described across beats (frosted marble, ice-crusted shelves, vaulted ceiling, quartz hush). It frames the action and provides the projector plinth. Closure participation: "the library itself held its breath" and "seemed to sigh." However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Cold seeps into Elian's bones but does not slow him or force adaptation. Micro-setting (body, tool) does not charge the final image with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "while illusions fade to memory" is stated early and echoed throughout ("as the vows slipped into memory," "the last illusion faded"). Setup and development are present. However, the deadline does not tighten decisions or impose cost; Elian "quickened his pace" once but completes his work successfully without visible sacrifice or missed data. The timer is asserted rather than tracked; no beat demonstrates time pressure forcing a tactic change or loss. Closure participation is weak—the work finishes before time runs out.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elian's motivation "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is stated in the opening and repeated near the end. It drives his goal (preserve the vows' data) and is present across beats. Setup, development, and closure participation are clear. However, the desire is never dramatized in conflict—no moment shows competing wants, doubt, or cost. The motivation functions as thematic assertion rather than lived friction. The final line echoes it ("conjured meaning...meaning endured") but without on-page struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" is introduced early ("A quartz hush filled the air") and returns twice ("The quartz hush deepened" mid-story, "the quartz hush settling into a permanent, peaceful silence" at the end). The tone is coherent and atmospheric, modulating slightly as the library "holds its breath" and then "sighs." However, the mood remains static—hushed reverence throughout—without a tonal shift that charges the final image or reflects escalation. The ending's "peaceful silence" mirrors the opening's "crystalline stillness" without reweighting pressure or cost.</comment>
