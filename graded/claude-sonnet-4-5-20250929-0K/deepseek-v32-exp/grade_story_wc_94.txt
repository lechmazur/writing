<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "understand the cartography of scars" is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. Her "furiously tranquil" state is told as a label without embodied contradiction—no actions show rage and peace acting simultaneously. The stranger's redemption arc arrives unearned, with no prior characterization to make his turn credible. Internal states are summarized ("she felt a surge of storm-kissed wonder") rather than shown through perception and bodily response.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph, satisfying the test. However, the closure depends on a stranger materializing from shadows at the timer's ding—a coincidence that resolves rather than complicates, violating situational and causal lens rules. The "vigil in pause" premise is told but never shapes on-page tactics or choices; it remains thematic decoration. Cost at closure is asserted ("masks must slip for healing to begin") but not felt—no option is visibly foreclosed, no price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is visually vivid but functions as postcard backdrop; the storm never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The darkroom timer is mentioned but does not interact with the space—no detail of the observatory's tools, layout, or access pressures Elara's decisions. Spatial choreography is clean (Elara moves from console to telescope to the stranger), but the setting remains ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding scars into uncensored poetry—is declared but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elara writes a poem offstage (we see only "words began to flow"), so the central action lacks dramatization. The stranger's arrival is pure coincidence, resolving the vigil without protagonist agency. No visible price is paid; the ending asserts transformation ("she was silenced no more") without showing what Elara sacrificed or risked to earn it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The cartography-of-scars metaphor is repeated without accumulating fresh meaning; the final realization ("scars were like constellations") is a tidy epiphany delivered mid-story, not earned at closure. The "vigil in pause" concept is invoked as a label rather than explored through conflicting choices. The stranger's line "You have rarefied the truth" explicitly states the theme, replacing scene pressure with summary. The ending offers resolution without ambiguity or lingering cost, flattening thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Diction shifts between poetic elevation ("storm-kissed wonder," "cartography of scars") and flat summary ("She remembered the vigil she had kept for years") without voice-motivated reason. The stranger's dialogue ("Your poetry, it can heal the scars you map") sounds like thesis announcement rather than natural speech. Psychic distance wobbles—some lines show close embodiment ("her hands steady despite the storm"), others drift to omniscient assertion ("this was the time when masks slip"). POV remains single but the perceptual signature is generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "vigil was in pause" / "that vigil was in pause now" / "the vigil was no longer in pause" recur without added pressure. Synonym churn: "furiously tranquil" / "at peace with the rage" / "calm wonder" stack the same idea. Template cadence runs through multiple beats ("She had come… That envelope… Now, in this high place…"). Mixed metaphor: "rarefy" (gaseous) applied to thoughts and verses without coherent vehicle. These artifacts dull the closure image (−1.4 in Q7 per the pack, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high bands at 8.8).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—censored poet seeks redemption via metaphorical enlightenment—closely matches template workshop plots without transformation through specific lived detail. The stranger's appearance and instant redemption arc are stock beats. "Storm as inner turmoil" and "scars as maps" are familiar metaphors executed without fresh inflection. The timer functions as arbitrary countdown rather than organically integrated constraint. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the familiar material.</comment>
