<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clearly established (rewrite the past, surprise fate), but his agency in key moments is undermined by passive construction—he "found" the anomaly rather than hunting for it through strategic analysis. The "strategically creative" attribute is labeled repeatedly but never shown constraining a choice with visible cost; we're told his mind works "several steps ahead" without seeing those steps dramatized. Interiority relies on abstract phrases like "steely longing" and "cold fire that refused to be extinguished" rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice (stepping through the film) feels more like following a pre-set procedure than a wrenching decision that forecloses other paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains a causal chain: Elian theorizes escape → finds the frame → plays the chord → steps through. However, the closure—Elian remains in the ballroom with a "new time" on the clock—lacks visible cost; we see no dramatized price for this refuge, only assertion that "his fate successfully, if briefly, surprised." The phrase "if briefly" gestures toward cost but does not show it on the page. The drive lens reads as Causal with light Accumulative texture (the arbor's failing protection, the horizon inviting night), but the ending image ("peace he had carved for himself") tells rather than demonstrates what was sacrificed or transformed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tidal arbor is vividly anchored with pulsing flora, erratic compasses on brass pillars, and mist curtain as screen. Spatial choreography is clean (piano, film canister, projector, curtain of mist), and the shift from arbor to monochrome ballroom is legible. The arbor's failing protection does shape Elian's urgency ("he needed to act now"), and the film's black-and-white world becomes a micro-setting that constrains his final move. The compasses' shift from spinning to still in the film-world charges the transition, though the final ballroom's empty stage feels more postcard than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escape the collapsing arbor before the storm—is signaled early and tightens once when the compasses "flared bright, a warning that the equilibrium was shattering." That single reversal narrows options and forces the film-escape attempt. However, the escalation is thin: Elian executes his plan without friction, the film door swings open on cue, and he steps through without dramatized cost or competing pulls. The final performance in the ballroom is described as "wild, and unscripted," but we don't see what price that improvisation exacts or what concrete option it forecloses. Agency at closure is present but not tested by meaningful resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme—rewriting fate through creative defiance—emerges from concrete actions (threading the film, playing the chord sequence, stepping into memory). The broken clock's shift to "a new time" and the compasses going dark offer resonant images. Yet the final paragraph over-explains: "answered his own steely longing with an act of pure, unforeseen creation" edges into thesis statement. The piece resists tidy morals in that the refuge is temporary ("if briefly"), but the line "his fate successfully, if briefly, surprised" tells the thematic payoff rather than letting the image speak. The earned/provisional balance is promising but not fully trusted to inference.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elian; no head-hopping. Voice is consistent, with a formal, lyric register ("the vastness of the tidal arbor," "the steely longing that had become his constant companion"). The diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("desperate need," "pure, unforeseen creation") that dilutes the specificity of Elian's perceptual signature. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are inapplicable. Psychic distance is controlled, though the prose sometimes moves into summary ("His strategically creative mind had calculated") rather than showing thought in action. The rhythmic texture supports the wistful tone, and there are no filter-verb stacks or POV leaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and spatial choreography is clear. However, several loops and scaffold phrases reduce density: "strategically creative" appears twice in identical phrasing; "steely longing" recurs three times without reweighting; "the broken anniversary clock" is named twice in similar constructions. The phrase "His motivation was simple, yet immense" is expository scaffold. Mixed metaphor: "cold fire that refused to be extinguished by regret" contradicts itself (fire/cold, extinguish/regret). The final paragraph over-explains closure rather than trusting image, and the line "This was his refuge, a temporary sanctuary woven from memory and light" paraphrases the action just completed. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and synonym churn touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The core premise—escape through hidden frames in a film reel—offers a fresh synthesis of memory, artifact, and metaphysics. The tidal arbor above the clouds and flickering compasses are specific, non-generic details. However, the emotional arc (artist seeks to rewrite traumatic past) is familiar, and the resolution (refuge achieved through creative act) does not transform that template in hindsight. The "strategically creative" label promises ingenuity but is told rather than demonstrated through on-page problem-solving under constraint. The piece commits to its premise but does not take the bold risk of showing what Elian loses or leaves behind when he steps into the film.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and makes the key decision to step through the film. He is introduced early (by name in paragraph 8), and his final performance in the ballroom is the story's climax. However, his choices feel procedural rather than conflicted—he executes a pre-theorized plan without dramatized friction or competing pulls. The "wistful station pianist" identity shapes tone but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is thin. Within-band: early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, but low causal pressure and no felt cost. Cap at 6.0 for missing strong middle development; adjust down −0.6 for label-only "strategically creative" without on-page demonstration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The broken anniversary clock appears in paragraph 3 ("its hands frozen at the precise minute his life had fractured") and again in the final image ("the broken clock now showing a new time"). Two touches across distinct beats. However, the clock is never handled or used to constrain a choice—it rests on the piano lid, is passed by, and then shows a new time off-stage. The shift to "a new time" reweights meaning but is told rather than shown through interaction. Two gates met (setup, payoff); missing middle use. Within-band: early signal +0.4, closure linkage +0.7, but static description and no causal pressure. Cap at 6.0 for missing development; adjust down −0.8 for ornamental use and swappability (any time-frozen object could serve).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Flickering compasses appear in paragraph 7 ("mounted on brass pillars throughout the arbor, their needles spinning erratically"), recur when they "flared bright" as a warning (paragraph 14), and go dark at closure (final paragraph). Three touches. The compasses measure instability and signal the tightening crisis, shaping Elian's urgency to act. Inside the film, they are "still, their needles pointing steadily toward a single, distant point," which charges the refuge's stability. Three gates met (setup, development, payoff). Within-band: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (narrows timeline) +0.8, closure linkage +0.9. Adjust down −0.3 for the compasses' mechanics never constraining a tactical choice, and −0.5 for middling irreplaceability (any environmental gauge could serve). Total: ~5.4 baseline, round down to 4.8 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" is labeled in paragraph 8 ("The pianist, a man named Elian, was strategically creative, his mind always working several steps ahead") and again in paragraph 16 ("his strategically creative mind had calculated that these hidden sections were doorways"). No on-page demonstration of multi-step planning under constraint or visible tradeoff. The attribute does not enable or constrain a choice with cost—Elian's plan works exactly as theorized without friction. Two touches but both are label-only summary. Missing all three gates (no setup action, no middle constraint, no closure cost). Within-band: ornamental use −0.8, label-only −0.3, swappability −0.5. Cap at 3.8 for swappability; additional frictions push down to 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Refuge" is the story's central goal, named in paragraph 9 ("his plan for refuge hinged on a method") and again in paragraphs 11, 13, 18, and 19. The arbor is "a refuge of sorts, but its protection was failing"; the film-world becomes "his refuge, a temporary sanctuary." The final ballroom performance "solidifie[s] his refuge." The action drives all major beats: theorizing escape, finding the frame, stepping through, and securing the space with music. Three gates met (setup, development, payoff). Within-band: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.3, cost connection (temporary, "if briefly") +0.4. Total: ~7.9 baseline. Adjust down −0.6 for the final refuge's cost being told ("if briefly") rather than shown on the page, leaving 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "black-and-white film reel" is introduced in paragraph 9 as Elian's theorized method, handled in paragraph 10 ("lifted the film canister," "unspooling the film"), threaded into the projector (paragraph 12), and becomes the literal escape route (paragraphs 16–18). The film's mechanics matter: Elian searches for anomalies, finds a hidden frame, and plays a chord sequence to activate it. The film-world's monochrome corridors and ballroom form the refuge. Four distinct beats. Three gates met (setup, development, payoff). Within-band: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity (the film is a recording of Elian's own life) +0.6. Total: ~8.4 baseline. Adjust down −0.2 for the chord-sequence mechanics being asserted rather than shown with cost. Round to 6.8 after factoring irreplaceability friction (−0.4 for any memory-artifact could serve with minor edits). Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "tidal arbor above the clouds" is established in the opening line and anchors all action through paragraph 19. Its strange flora, erratic compasses, and failing protection shape Elian's urgency. The arbor supplies the mist curtain that serves as screen and the physical stage for the film-projection ritual. Inside the film, the setting shifts to monochrome corridors and a ballroom. Three gates met (setup, development, payoff). Within-band: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (failing protection forces action) +1.0, closure linkage (Elian remains in the film-ballroom) +1.0. Total: ~7.1 baseline. Adjust down −0.7 for the arbor's mechanics (why it's failing, what the tides are) being decorative rather than constraining a tactical choice. Final: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Until the horizon invites night" is introduced in paragraph 5 ("he had only until the horizon invited night, a process already beginning as the sky bled from silver to deep orange") and recurs in paragraph 20 ("the horizon was deepening, inviting night into the real world"). The timeframe tightens Elian's urgency ("He needed to act now, before the arbor was torn apart") and shapes pacing. Two touches across distinct beats. Three gates met (setup, development, payoff). Within-band: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.8. Total: ~6.9 baseline. Adjust down −0.5 for the clock being vague (we never see concrete time markers or a tracked countdown), and −0.5 for the night's arrival not altering final tactics. Final: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To surprise fate with an unplanned encore" is stated in paragraph 4 ("His motivation was simple, yet immense: to surprise fate with an unplanned encore") and echoed in paragraphs 15 ("This was his surprise for fate"), 18 ("his unplanned encore"), and 21 ("his fate successfully, if briefly, surprised"). The desire drives the film-escape and the wild ballroom performance. Three touches. Three gates met (setup, development, payoff). Within-band: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0. Total: ~7.3 baseline. Adjust down −0.9 for told-only motivation without dramatized internal conflict (want versus fear), and −0.8 for the final "surprise" being asserted rather than shown through a choice that forecloses a competing path. Final: 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Steely longing" is named in paragraph 4 ("the steely longing that had become his constant companion"), repeated in paragraph 19 ("The steely longing in his heart fueled him, a cold fire"), and implied in the opening's "wistful" and "aching melody." The tone is coherent and modulates from wistful to urgent to defiant. Three touches. Three gates met (setup, development, payoff). Within-band: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9. Total: ~6.4 baseline. Adjust down −0.3 for the phrase being repeated identically without reweighting, creating a static label rather than a tonal charge that evolves under pressure. Final: 6.1.</comment>
