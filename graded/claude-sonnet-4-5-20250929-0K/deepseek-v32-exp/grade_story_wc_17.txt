<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to discover what walls dream about") is present but remains abstract throughout; her interior reactions to the diary discovery are summarized ("felt that burden now") rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. The choice to carry the diaries forward lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives on the page—she simply places them in her satchel and continues. Her perceptive trait is asserted repeatedly ("sensitively perceptive," "perceptive nature," "perceptive heart") but never dramatized through a micro-choice constrained by that sensitivity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines and remain stable. The piece follows an Accumulative lens: density increases as Elara moves deeper, discovers the diaries, reads the negative strip, and pieces together the scientist's story. However, the closure unit—her decision to document and carry the burden—lacks a decisive turn or visible cost; she smiles and walks on with purpose but no path is foreclosed and no tactic altered. The inferred lens holds, but the ending offers declaration ("she would ensure") rather than a charged final image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, damp earth scent, moss-covered stone, and cold fireplace provide vivid sensory anchors filtered through Elara's professional lens. The corridor's physical details (ivy trembling, walls pulsing) appear but function as atmospheric markers rather than constraining choice or shaping tactics. The fireplace serves as a discovery site but does not pressure Elara's movements or options; spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping echoes to understand what walls dream—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful reversal or cost. Elara's progression is a steady reveal (scuffing the fireplace, extracting diaries, holding the negative, reading fragments) without a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ending declares deepened motivation ("no longer just a cartographer, but a keeper") but the shift is asserted rather than earned by an on-page choice that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—legacy's burden and the weight of past failures—emerges through the diary fragments and the scientist's misused weather technology. However, the final paragraph explicitly moralizes the lesson ("burden as both a duty and a gift," "what the walls dreamed would not be forgotten again") instead of allowing resonance to arise from image. The hopeful hum and mended future are told rather than shown, reducing thematic complexity to a tidy redemption arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature emphasizes echoes, whispers, and emotional weight, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("embodied regrets and unfulfilled dreams," "soul of places") that feel more authorial than character-bound. Purposeful compression in lyric passages ("walls whispered of dreams") is legible, but the final paragraph's didactic tone ("she would ensure") breaks the established reflective register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure and strong concrete nouns (ivy, moss, ash, fireplace). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "walls absorbed emotions...dreaming them back" in paragraph six echoes "walls dream" from the opening; "burden was now partly hers" repeats the burden motif three times in adjacent lines near the end. Template cadence runs ("She believed...She understood...She knew") across middle paragraphs create mild monotony. The closure beat includes scaffold phrasing ("ready to be part of a new map") that dulls propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—cartographer mapping emotional echoes in abandoned post-climate spaces—offers a fresh frame, but the execution follows a familiar discovery-and-burden template: lone explorer finds artifact, reads tragic backstory, vows to preserve memory. The scientist-misused-technology reveal and the hopeful-redemption ending are stock beats. Elara's profession is inventive but her choices never leverage corridor acoustics or mapping expertise in specific, irreplaceable ways that would transform the trope.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara as "corridor echo cartographer" is present throughout and frames the narrative, but her mapping work remains observational. She moves deeper, kneels, extracts, reads, and continues—no key turn hinges on a choice she makes as a cartographer. The role provides thematic texture but is swappable with any solitary researcher; her decisions (to take the diaries, to document) are generic archivist moves rather than cartographer-specific tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The film negative strip appears in one beat (mid-story discovery), is held to light, and described with vivid detail (family laughing, later faces marked by fear). It returns briefly in the satchel at the end but without reweighted meaning or causal pressure—it accompanies the diaries as evidence but does not shape Elara's final choice or charge the closure image independently. Two touches, but ornamental in the second.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" is the story's explicit theme: the diary writer speaks of "burden of a legacy," Elara "felt that burden now," and the ending declares she carries "the burden as both a duty and a gift." The concept shapes the dominant stake and is woven through multiple beats (reading the diaries, piecing the scientist's story, acknowledging the weight). However, it never constrains a tactical choice or forces a trade-off—Elara simply accepts and documents it, so the concept remains thematic rather than plot-driving.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is asserted three times in label form ("sensitively perceptive," "perceptive nature," "perceptive heart") but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. Elara's perceptions—feeling weight, sensing echoes, piecing together story—are described outcomes rather than tradeoffs; there is no moment where heightened sensitivity forces her to endure pain, miss a practical detail, or choose one interpretation over another.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Glimpse" is the turning action: Elara holds the film negative to light and "a glimpse of the past flooded her senses," revealing the family and later informing her understanding of the scientist's legacy. This beat drives her interpretive work in the second half. However, the glimpse could be replaced with reading a diary entry or examining a photograph without altering the plot structure—it is functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Half-burned diaries found in a fireplace" are signaled early (Elara's boot scuffs the metallic fireplace, she extracts pages from ash) and their fragmented, fire-damaged state matters: charred edges and gaps create the narrative's fractured quality and the irony that evidence meant to be erased survived. The method shapes two beats (discovery, reading) and the diaries accompany the ending. However, their mechanics (how burning affects legibility, what survives versus what is lost) are not leveraged to constrain Elara's interpretation or force a choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "ivy-veiled passage" is named in the opening, provides atmospheric anchors (damp earth, moss-covered stone, ivy trembling, shadows), and bookends the story (ivy veil rustles as Elara leaves). The setting supplies discovery space (the fireplace) but does not constrain Elara's movement or choices—she navigates without obstacle, extracts the diaries without difficulty, and departs freely. The passage is setting-as-backdrop rather than setting-as-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the climate shifts" anchors the world-state (abandoned halls, nature's reclamation, the scientist's weather-control failure) and provides thematic context. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Elara's work is solitary and unrushed, no clock pressures her exploration, and the shifts are historical backdrop rather than active constraint. Functional context, but swappable with any post-disaster setting.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To discover what walls dream about" is Elara's stated singular motivation and recurs explicitly ("what walls dream," "walls dreamed of that failure," "walls dreaming not just of loss"). The desire frames her profession and drives her to seek "the heart of this particular corridor." However, the motivation is never dramatized as conflicted—no cost, no competing want, no moment where discovering the dream demands sacrifice or endangers another goal. Told and consistent, but frictionless.</comment>
