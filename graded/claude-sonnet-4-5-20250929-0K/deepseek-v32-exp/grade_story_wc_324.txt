<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to protect vulnerable voices") is stated repeatedly but never tested by on-page conflict or internal contradiction. Her "persistently curious nature" and inherited role are told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The character executes a ritual without obstacles, embodied emotion, or any moment where her values compete. Eleanor's ghost appears and tells her story, but Elara's reaction is generic assurance rather than character-specific struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: the atrium's function, Elara's location before arrival, and the nature of her "contact tracer for hearts" role remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The piece accumulates atmospheric description but lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; Elara locates Eleanor, Eleanor tells her story, Eleanor departs—no option is foreclosed, no cost paid. The "closure" is a soft reassurance ("You will be remembered") without visible sacrifice, decisional turn, or conceptual repricing. Under a Causal lens, the linkage is weak; under Accumulative, no pattern breaks or cadence shifts at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium and twilight haze are evoked through sensory detail (glass dome, marble bench, cold seeping through clothes), and the hearing aid's glow adds purposeful texture. However, the environment does not constrain choice or alter tactics—Elara moves freely, the bench is simply where she sits. Spatial choreography is clean, but the setting remains backdrop rather than crucible, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving voice to Eleanor—is signaled early but never escalates or faces opposition. Elara's task unfolds as a ritual without friction: she tracks pulses, finds Eleanor, listens, assures her, and Eleanor fades peacefully. No reversal, no tightening, no visible cost or trade-off. The lack of agency-driven escalation under any lens keeps this in the low-mid band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of remembrance versus oblivion emerges through repeated phrases ("vulnerable voices," "incidental heroism," "silent war against oblivion") but is stated rather than earned through specific conflict. The photograph warms at the climax, a symbolic gesture that does not transform prior material or pose a non-literal question. The final image ("reeling hush now a blanket of calm") asserts resolution without thematic friction or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara, with consistent psychic distance. Voice is competent but lacks a perceptual signature—diction is elevated and neutral ("serene face," "ethereal light," "sacred quiet") without character-specific idiom. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Eleanor's speech is generic ghost-speak. No head-hopping, but the prose reads as authored rather than filtered through Elara's particular mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "assure" appears five times, "pulses" recur without variation, "vulnerable voices" and "reeling hush" are repeated verbatim. Template cadence runs through the opening third ("She was… Her motivation was… When the dead called…"). The closing paragraph stacks three near-synonyms for quiet ("reeling hush," "quiet," "calm and resolution"). Information density is low; many lines restate atmosphere without advancing situation. Applying −0.8 for loops and template cadence in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—contact tracer for dead hearts via hearing aid—reads as a prompt-driven concatenation rather than an organic synthesis. The ghost-listener trope is familiar, and the execution adds no fresh angle: Elara arrives, listens without obstacle, Eleanor departs at peace. The photograph, hearing aid, and atrium are present but ornamental. No bold risk or transformation that would distinguish this from template paranormal vignettes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is labeled "contact tracer for hearts" but her choices do not create turns—she tracks, arrives, listens, reassures. The role is setup without middle development or closure causality; she could be any empathetic listener with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The photograph appears early (setup gate), is held and compared to shadows (middle touch), and warms at the climax (closure participation). However, its warming is decorative—it does not alter Elara's action or Eleanor's fate. Swappable with any keepsake; the warming is told, not causally integrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is named twice but never dramatized as a constraint or choice. Elara's role is deliberate and inherited, not incidental. The concept is thematic window-dressing, not an on-page force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is stated once as a label. Elara's actions (adjusting the device, asking Eleanor's name, listening) are consistent with curiosity but do not show a visible cost or tradeoff tied to that trait. The attribute is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Assure" is the action Elara repeats five times across the arc: she speaks to assure Eleanor, promises remembrance, and assures her again at the end. It shapes the final beat (Eleanor fades "at peace") but is not tested by conflict or refusal. Setup, middle, and payoff gates are met, but swappability is high—comfort, promise, or listen would work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The hearing aid is introduced early, its pulses guide Elara to the bench, and it glows at the climax. However, its mechanics are vague ("faint pulses," "decades-old," "syncing with her heartbeat") and it never fails or constrains choice. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but replaceable with any tracking device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The atrium is anchored early (glass dome, mist, twilight, marble bench) and remains the single location throughout. The cold seeps through Elara's clothes and the mist parts for Eleanor's reveal, but these are atmospheric touches—the space does not alter tactics or impose cost. Setup and payoff gates met, but the setting is postcard backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"When the dead call" frames the premise and is repeated once mid-story, but no time pressure or clock shapes Elara's moves. The timeframe is a conceptual hook, not a dramatized constraint. Setup gate only; no middle development or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To protect vulnerable voices" is stated as Elara's motivation in the opening, repeated at midpoint, and echoed in her final promise to Eleanor. It drives her presence and her speech but is never conflicted or tested—no moment where protection costs her something or competes with another want. Setup, middle, and payoff gates met, but the motivation is told and static.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" appears in the opening line and closing line, framing the tone. The phrase is evocative but static—the mood does not modulate with pressure or charge the closure with cost. Lyric reprise present, but the tone is applied rather than earned through escalation.</comment>
