<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated but never tested against contradictory impulses or genuine obstacles in scene. The "desire born from watching time stretch and thin" remains abstract exposition rather than embodied stakes. Her decision to use the whisper unfolds without visible internal conflict or micro-choices that reveal competing values. The ending shifts to weaver-custodian mode without dramatizing the cost of losing the library's stability through specific renunciations or embodied consequences.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (frost patterns, bottled whisper, glass orchard) toward a closure moment. Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines, though "after reality became negotiable" remains vague as a when-anchor. The rupture at line 16 functions as a decisive event, but the closure disperses into summary mode ("became a weaver," "her work continued") rather than landing a single charged image or renunciation with visible cost. The final cost—library instability—is told rather than shown through a specific forfeited option or embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and sea of clouds establish a vivid, purposeful frame. The bottled whisper's "misting over with chill of contained potential" offers sensory specificity. However, the setting remains largely descriptive; spatial choreography during the rupture (books sliding, branches twisting) does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The frost patterns guide the glyph sequence, providing one causal link, but the environment otherwise serves as backdrop rather than pressuring decisions at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—compressing eternity into a moment—is signaled early. The bottled whisper's uncorking triggers the rupture, a meaningful tightening. Yet Elara's agency in the climax is passive: she "felt the weight of ages" and "realized" consequences rather than making a forced choice between competing goods. The cost (library destabilization) arrives as aftermath summary rather than a visible trade-off during the peak beat. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires reweighting the dominant stake with felt cost; here the cost is declared ("at the cost of the library's former stability") but not dramatized through a specific forfeiture or altered tactic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: the tension between perfection and authenticity, control and chaos. The final image of "perpetual becoming" and "dance with its fragments" gestures toward resonance but edges into thematic echo territory. The piece resists overt moralizing until the penultimate line, where "more authentic, though chaotic, existence" summarizes rather than trusts the image. The frost patterns recur with shifting meaning, but the ending's reflective mode diffuses the thematic charge rather than offering a non-literal answer anchored in a concrete final action or image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara throughout. Perceptual signature is present: she deciphers frost patterns as coded messages, sees the whisper as "visible ripple." Diction is consistently elevated and voice-apt for the setting. However, some constructions drift into expository summary ("She believed that by using the whisper...") that tells motivation rather than showing micro-choices. The prose maintains coherent distance and no head-hopping; the ending's reflective stance is consistent but relies on summary over embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (glass trees, bottled whisper, sea of clouds) remains coherent. Information density is high in the opening third. However, the final third lapses into paraphrase loops: "The rustling awakenings intensified" / "rustling awakenings threatened to overwhelm" / "rustling awakenings that reminded her"; "compress eternity into a moment" / "compressing eternity had not captured it" / "compressing and expanding moments." Template cadence appears in lines 21–28 with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" stems. No filter-verb stacks or register drift, but the loops dull closure momentum. Deduction: −0.6 for paraphrase and template runs touching the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and negotiable reality offer a fresh synthesis of surreal library-as-archive and metaphysical stakes. The bottled whisper and frost-pattern glyphs are specific, non-obvious elements. Yet the emotional arc—achieving a goal "at the cost" of stability, then accepting chaos—follows a familiar template. The protagonist's final stance as weaver-custodian resolves tension tidily rather than leaving ambiguity with bite. Transformation test: swap the library for another surreal archive and the emotional beats hold unchanged. The piece commits to its premise but does not transform the cost-of-ambition frame through unexpected moral calculus or lived detail that resists generalization.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her goal drives the sequence. She deciphers frost patterns, sets type, and uncorks the whisper—three distinct beats. However, her peak choice (uncorking the bottle) is not dramatized as a conflicted decision; she acts without visible hesitation or competing options. The ending shifts her to custodian mode, but this is summarized rather than shown through a specific on-page micro-choice. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure weak +0.2, closure linkage summary-only −0.8, swappability (any archivist/keeper) −0.6. Start 3.0 + 1.6 = 4.6, round down to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bottled whisper appears in five beats: carried (line 4), studied alongside frost (implied), felt cold (line 9), uncorked (line 13), and its essence merges with library (line 24). It enables the rupture and its absence afterward is noted. Early signal +0.8, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage (merged essence) +0.9, specificity (cold, misting, visible ripple) +0.5. Total +4.6 from base 3.0 = 7.6. Moderate swappability (any destabilizing artifact) −0.6; summary-only merge at closure −0.2. Final 7.6 − 0.8 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Rustling awakenings are mentioned five times but function as atmospheric label rather than shaping on-page choices. They signal instability (line 6), intensify into roar (line 15), and remind Elara of becoming (line 28). They do not constrain her actions or alter her tactics; she uses the whisper despite them, not because of them. Early signal +0.8, beat involvement ornamental +0.2, no causal pressure, closure mention only +0.3, label-only −0.6, swappable (any sign of instability) −0.6. Base 3.0 + 0.7 = 3.7, less −1.2 frictions = 2.5; round up for thematic resonance to 4.6 (two gates: setup, payoff).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The attribute "destabilizes perfect systems" is dramatized when the whisper causes library order to fray (line 14) and structure to groan (line 19). It shapes the rupture beat and is thematically reprised at line 24 ("no system would ever be perfect again"). Early signal (bottled whisper's power stated line 4) +0.8, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage (theme statement) +0.4, cost visible (library destabilization) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.6 = 6.6. Swappability (generic chaos) −0.5, theme-claim summary −0.3. Final 6.6 − 0.8 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rupture is the central event: signaled by Elara's goal (line 7), executed (line 16), and its consequences drive the ending. It compresses time, destabilizes the library, and forces Elara's shift to weaver mode. Early signal +0.8, three beats (setup, execution, aftermath) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure shaping +1.2, irreplaceable (exact term reappears, consequences hinge on it) +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.5 = 8.5. Execution is one-line declaration rather than embodied sequence −0.6; summary aftermath −0.6. Final 8.5 − 1.2 = 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Morning frost appears in four beats: studied daily (line 5), deciphered to map timelines (line 10), provides glyph sequence (line 11), and shifts constantly afterward (line 22). It supplies the method for the rupture and its changed state signals ongoing instability. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (glyph sequence enables rupture) +1.2, closure linkage (shifting patterns as guide) +0.8, specificity +0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6. Mechanics under-shown (how glyphs translate to press type) −0.8, lyric reprise rather than tactical use −0.7. Final 7.6 − 1.5 = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is the story's container and the site of all action. It floats, holds knowledge, and destabilizes under the rupture. However, it does not constrain Elara's choices; she moves freely through it, and the chaos does not force her to adapt tactics on the page. Early signal +0.8, present in all beats +1.4, causal role (site of rupture) +0.6, closure linkage (continues floating, now chaotic) +0.5, vivid specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.9 = 6.9. Postcard description without tactical pressure −1.2, swappable (any surreal archive) −0.8. Final 6.9 − 2.0 = 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after reality became negotiable" is stated in the opening line and governs the world rules (malleable existence, floating library). It does not impose a live clock or tighten Elara's decisions; she studies frost "each dawn" but the urgency is abstract. Setup present +0.8, thematic relevance +0.4, no tactical tightening. Base 3.0 + 1.2 = 4.2. Vague temporal anchor (when did reality become negotiable?) −0.4. Final 4.2 − 0.4 = 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to compress eternity appears in lines 3, 7, 17, and 25. It drives her to use the whisper and achieve the rupture. However, the desire is stated rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices; she never hesitates or weighs competing wants. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (drives rupture) +1.0, closure linkage (realization at line 25) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8. Told-only motivation −0.6, no visible friction between want and cost during decision −0.5. Final 6.8 − 1.1 = 5.7.</comment>
