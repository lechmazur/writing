<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian's interiority consists almost entirely of abstract philosophical positions ("rejected false comfort," "conceived a plan") without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The piece tells us he is motivated but never dramatizes a micro-choice that reveals competing desires under pressure. The final paragraph claims he "found his place," but no on-page moment shows him wrestling with solitude versus community; the arc is summarized rather than earned through scene-level decisions with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who/where/when anchors arrive early, waiving that penalty. However, the piece operates as extended summary rather than scene; the entire "revival" unfolds in past-tense narration ("He began gathering materials," "He taught the few returning settlers") with no single dramatized beat where Elian faces a concrete obstacle, makes a choice, and pays a price. The ending asserts that the town thrived and Elian found community, but no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs on the page with legible cost—only thematic summary. Drive lens is indeterminate; the text reads as summary-driven rather than Causal, Accumulative, or Situational.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The paper-lantern cove is named and revisited frequently, and the lanterns receive a purposeful reprise (decorations → solar collectors → glowing workshops). However, the setting remains postcard-level description; no spatial choreography or environmental constraint pressures a single on-page choice. The amber bottle is handled twice (carried, then placed as a centerpiece) but its "sealed nature" never materially alters Elian's tactics—it functions as thematic symbol only.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reimagining civilization—is signaled early but never tested in scene. No on-page reversal, tightening choice, or escalation narrows Elian's options; he conceives a plan, gathers materials, teaches settlers, and succeeds without visible friction or cost. The stated rejection of wishes and false comfort remains a label rather than a trade-off dramatized under pressure. The resolution is asserted in summary ("the cove thrived") rather than earned through protagonist agency with legible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—effort over entitlement, reason over magic—is stated repeatedly in abstract terms ("rejected false comfort," "wishes were unnecessary") rather than emerging from concrete scene particulars. The amber bottle as "lesson in patience" and the lanterns as dual-use collectors are purposeful motifs, but the final image restates the thesis ("the alchemy of human ingenuity and memory") rather than offering a non-literal, resonant answer. The piece moralizes in place of scene pressure, especially in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction throughout is abstract and essay-like ("conceive," "reimagine," "solidified," "fostering"), reading as committee voice rather than a singular, embodied perspective. Perceptual signature is absent; Elian's noticing lacks character-specific bias. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph's explanatory summary ("he had not sought another, but had instead conceived a world") exemplifies helpful-narrator syndrome, explaining the premise rather than trusting the reader.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "rejected false comfort" appears three times across paragraphs; "through working memory" recurs as a template anchor four times with identical function. Synonym churn is visible in "conceive/conceived" (five instances) and "reimagine/reimagined" (four instances). Stock metaphors ("skeleton of paper and dust," "beacon of what could be achieved") and therapy-speak interiority ("solidified," "clarity of purpose") flatten the prose. Sentence stems repeat: "He [verb]" opens eight consecutive beats in the middle third. Apply −1.2 cumulative for loops, templates, and stock phrases; final third contains artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—lone alchemist rebuilds ghost town through reason after magic fails—closely matches the "magic versus science" template and utopian-founder tropes without transformation. No specific, verifiable detail (chemistry, governance structure, resource scarcity) grounds the revival; the plan remains abstract. The amber bottle's sealed nature is mentioned but never solved or repurposed in a non-obvious way. Emotional and social friction are absent; the piece hedges risk by summarizing success rather than dramatizing failure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elian is on the page throughout and named as protagonist. However, he makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or stakes; all his "choices" (gathering materials, teaching settlers) are summarized in past tense without scene-level friction. He observes, recalls, and conceives but does not face a concrete pressure point where choice narrows options with cost. Missing middle development and closure participation; introduced early but functionally ornamental. Cap 4.6 for missing setup participation, apply −0.8 for summary-only use and −0.5 for swappability (any "lone visionary" could replace him), −0.7 for late problem-solving he did not help create (the revival succeeds without prior obstacle), landing ~2.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The amber bottle appears in three beats: carried at the start, held while Elian sits, and placed as a town-square centerpiece. However, its "no opening" property never constrains an action or shapes a tactic; it functions as thematic symbol ("lesson in patience") without mechanical consequence. It does not return with reweighted meaning at closure—merely mentioned as a reminder. Present in setup and payoff but missing middle development; swappable with any symbolic object. Cap 4.6, apply −0.8 for ornamental use and −0.5 for swappability, landing ~3.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the explicit premise and dominant stake, signaled in the opening and restated at closure ("the ghost town revived"). It shapes Elian's goal throughout and appears in all three gates (setup, middle plan, ending success). However, the revival itself is summarized rather than dramatized; no specific turn or choice depends on the "ghost town" status rather than generic community-building. The concept could be replaced with "founding a new settlement" with minor edits. Present across beats but lacks irreplaceability and causal pressure. All three gates met; apply +0.9 for beat involvement, +0.3 for setup, but −0.8 for swappability and −0.5 for summary-only execution, landing ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Rejects false comfort" is stated three times as a label but never constrains an on-page action with visible cost. Elian does not face a scene-level temptation (e.g., another wish-granter, an easy shortcut) that he must visibly refuse. The attribute is told rather than shown through choice under pressure. Present in setup and thematic summary but missing middle beat and closure causal work. Cap 4.6 for missing middle; apply −0.8 for label-only use and −0.5 for ornamental mention, landing ~2.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Conceive" and "conceived" appear six times, anchoring Elian's method: he conceives a plan, a governance model, and "a world where wishes were unnecessary." The action is signaled early and restated at closure. However, it remains abstract; no single beat dramatizes the act of conception as a turning point with cost. The story could replace "conceive" with "design" or "imagine" without structural change. Present in setup and payoff but missing middle causal beat where conception narrows options. Cap 4.6; apply −0.8 for swappability and −0.4 for summary-only use, landing ~3.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Through working memory" is stated four times as Elian's method for integrating knowledge. It appears in setup, middle reflection, and final summary. However, the mechanics are never shown; we do not see him recall a specific failure, test a hypothesis, or adjust tactics based on remembered detail. The phrase functions as a label rather than a dramatized process. Missing middle causal beat and closure participation (mentioned but not active in the ending). Cap 4.6; apply −0.8 for label-only use and −0.5 for ornamental mention, landing ~2.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paper-lantern cove is named in the opening and closing, and the lanterns receive a purposeful transformation (decorations → solar collectors). The setting appears in setup and payoff and is signaled early. However, no spatial constraint or environmental resource pressures a middle choice; the cove's "natural resources, the wind and sea" are mentioned but never used in a dramatized beat. The setting could be replaced with any ghost town without altering the plot. All three gates met but swappable and lacking causal pressure. Apply +0.9 for beat involvement, +0.3 for setup, +0.7 for closure linkage, −0.8 for swappability, −0.5 for ornamental description, landing ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the last wish was granted" frames the opening and closing as a temporal anchor. However, time does not tighten decisions; the revival unfolds over an unspecified, elastic duration ("gradually transformed") with no clock or deadline that alters tactics. The timeframe is present in setup and payoff but missing middle pressure. Cap 4.6; apply −0.5 for vague tracking and −0.3 for ornamental framing, landing ~3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To reimagine an entire civilization" is Elian's stated motivation, repeated in the opening, middle, and closing. It shapes the dominant stake and appears in all three gates. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice; no scene-level beat shows Elian weighing the cost of his ambition against a competing desire (rest, companionship, safety). The desire remains abstract and uncontested. All three gates met but lacking friction and cost. Apply +0.9 for beat involvement, +0.3 for setup, −0.8 for told-only execution, −0.4 for lack of conflict, landing ~3.9.</comment>
