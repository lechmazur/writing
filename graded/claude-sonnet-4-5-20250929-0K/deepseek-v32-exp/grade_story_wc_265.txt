<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("rediscover the wild frontier of her own mind") but never tested by contradictory impulses or visible trade-offs. Her emotions remain abstract—"the hum of insight," "promising revelation"—without embodied particulars or stress-specific degradation. The translocation and gear-finding are conveniences that advance plot without foreclosing paths or creating micro-choices under pressure. The final "unlocking" reads as a told epiphany rather than a decision earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: accumulative/textural (journey through symbolic forest toward enlightenment). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; no penalty. The closure unit—placing the gear to unlock consciousness—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("forever changed") rather than dramatized through a foreclosed option or felt sacrifice. The translocations function as scene-change devices without causal pressure or tactical constraint. One tightening occurs (the jammed machine), but it resolves instantly with no visible price, weakening the Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mechanical rainforest is vividly rendered with specific textures: "trees of interlocking brass plates," "mercury waterfall," "titanium tree." Sensory details are purposeful and layered across touch, sound, and sight. The gear constrains one choice—its directional pull guides Elara—and the jammed nexus shapes the final beat, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. However, spatial choreography across translocations is vague (leagues away, "elsewhere again"), and the forest's mechanical rules are ornamental rather than tactical constraints that limit her options mid-journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reaching the forest's core to unlock inner enlightenment—is signaled early but remains abstract. One tightening occurs when Elara finds the jammed nexus, yet the gear fits "perfectly" with no trade-off or tactical cost. The translocations disorient but never force a renunciation or alter her approach. Agency is present in placing the gear, but the act resolves the problem it did not help create, and no visible price (stamina, tool loss, social cost) alters later moves. Under the accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through constraint or cadence shift; instead, beats telescope from problem to solution without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme—inner expansion mirrored by external exploration—is declared rather than emergent from specific struggle. The final line ("she joined its song, forever changed") states transformation without a non-literal image that reweights prior material. "Probable miracles," "hum of insight," and "wild frontier" are prompt labels recycled without subtext or irony. The gear functions as a literal key rather than an object whose meaning shifts under pressure. No ambiguity or counter-reading is invited; the resolution is tidily affirmative, and the ending summarizes rather than charges the central question with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—"soundless sound, felt rather than heard"—but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("cognitive expansion," "cascade of probable miracles") that sits uneasily with the embodied journey. Purposeful compression in the translocation beats is legible, but filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt") and stock phrases ("promised revelation," "forever changed") flatten immediacy in peak moments. Rhythm varies adequately, yet syntactic stems repeat ("she began to walk," "she paused," "she approached") without voice-motivated purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate; no causality breaks. Paraphrase loops appear: "disorienting journeys common" / "unpredictable translocation" restate the same idea, and "the hum of insight" recurs without escalation (−0.2). Template cadence runs in the middle third ("She paused… she held it up… she was on the right path") with adjacent action beats sharing identical stems (−0.4). Stock metaphors—"wild frontier," "ancient truths"—appear in the final beats without transformation (−0.3). Figurative language ("trees sighed," "forest breathed") is coherent but dense across most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, nearing the overwriting threshold. Cumulative artifact penalty −0.9, plus minor drag from recycled openers, totaling roughly −1.2 within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The mechanical-forest-as-mind premise is vivid but derivative of widely used externalizing-interiority templates. The translocation device and symbolic gear follow genre convention without fresh inflection or non-obvious moral calculus. Sensory particulars (mercury waterfall, titanium roots) provide texture, yet the emotional arc—journey inward, place key object, unlock self—could transplant to any quest frame with minimal change, failing the transformation test. No bold structural risk; the piece follows a linear accumulation to affirmative resolution. Derivative premise adjustment −0.8 in Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Present throughout; Elara walks, pauses, places the gear. Setup clear, middle development (interpreting tree-sounds, following the gear's pull), and payoff (placing gear in slot). However, her choices are responses to environmental cues rather than conflicted decisions that narrow options. The final act—inserting the gear—is enabled by discovery, not a trade-off between competing goods. Two beats of involvement, but low causal pressure and swappable agency (any seeker could perform these moves). Caps: missing middle development as a forced choice → 3.4 ceiling; raised for closure participation and two beats, but capped by lack of cost-driven decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup (pocket comfort, first piece found), middle (spins to guide direction at mercury waterfall), payoff (placed in slot, machine starts). Three beats, causal pressure in navigation and resolution, and closure linkage. Cost connection is weak—no sacrifice or visible price tied to using the gear. Specificity moderate; the gear's directional pull and perfect fit are functional but not irreplaceable (a compass or other guide could serve). Strong beat involvement and closure participation lift the score; lack of felt cost and moderate swappability prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Present as atmosphere ("hum of insight") and theme claim throughout. Setup early, mentioned in middle beats, and appears at closure ("coalesced into a clear, bright tone"). However, it does not constrain a choice or change options—Elara never struggles to interpret it or pays a price for misreading it. Functional as mood and motif, but swappable with "pulse of knowledge" or similar. Ornamental use with lyric reprise; eligible for ~6.0 under resonance allowance, but absence of causal pressure and cost connection lower the score. Three-gate presence but no decision-shaping role.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Mentioned at opening and twice in resting beats; present at three moments. However, translocation never constrains a tactical choice or imposes visible cost—it simply relocates Elara closer to her goal without trade-off. No on-page struggle to control it, no sacrifice to endure it, no cost paid for its unpredictability. Label-only trait; the story would function identically if she walked between clearings. Ornamental mention (−0.3), label-only (−0.3), summary-only (−0.3). Present but no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup implicit (her quest to "unravel the mystery"), middle development (interpreting harmonics, following the gear's pull as steps toward unraveling), and payoff (placing gear unravels the jammed mechanism and her consciousness). The verb "unravel" frames her method and the climactic act. Two distinct beats of involvement, causal pressure in the ending, and closure linkage. Specificity moderate—"solve" or "unlock" could substitute with minor edits. Strong integration but not fully indispensable; swappability concern prevents top band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup early ("interpreting the sound of wind through different trees… a language, a map"), development (distinct harmonics guide her path, sequences align with hum), payoff (chorus from countless tree types at the nexus). Three beats, causal involvement in navigation, and closure participation. However, the mechanics are asserted, not demonstrated—no on-page struggle to decode contradictory signals or visible cost for misinterpretation. Functional and present at key turns, but lacks the specificity and pressure that would make it irreplaceable. Lyric reprise with cost-light execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup immediate and vivid; present in every beat. The forest supplies the mercury waterfall (navigation cue), titanium hollow (rest), bronze willow (orientation anchor), and the colossal nexus (final challenge). Micro-setting (gear's directional pull, jammed mechanism) constrains the climactic choice and charges the final image. Two beats of tactical involvement, strong closure linkage, and irreplaceability—the mechanical forest's specific properties drive both atmosphere and action. Persistent constraint shapes the ending; sensory hierarchy reflects POV. High integration with cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setup clear ("weeks ago"); present as framing context. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no countdown, no degradation of the sixth sense, no cost for delay. The "after" is a static backdrop rather than a live constraint. Swappable with "since the quest began" without structural impact. Functional framing but no causal pressure or tactical cost. Missing middle development as constraint → 3.4 cap; ornamental use and swappability lower further.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup explicit ("motivation was clear"), restated in middle reflection ("goal was to unravel the mystery"), and implicit at closure (consciousness unfolds). Three-gate presence. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible trade-offs. No friction between want (enlightenment) and cost (sacrifice, risk, doubt)—Elara's journey is unidirectional. Functional as narrative driver but label-reliant and uncontested. Lyric reprise without pressure; eligible for ~6.0 under resonance allowance, but lack of dramatized conflict and cost lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Present as descriptor ("probable miracles," translocations "she had come to accept") and in final beat ("dance of discovery"). Setup and payoff clear. Tone is consistent—wonder-inflected, affirming the magical-realist frame—but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with ambiguity or cost. Static mood rather than dynamic tonal shift. Swappable with "wondrous inevitability" or similar. Functional coherence but no escalation or closure reweighting. Missing middle development as pressure device → 3.4 cap; lyric reprise and closure cameo raise slightly, but lack of tonal cost or turn limits band.</comment>
