<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is signaled early but never tested by contradictory impulses—he moves through the story with unopposed clarity of purpose. The "discovery" at the cavern arrives as exposition via arrow-tip visions rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is largely absent; the stomach lurch is the only visceral marker in a journey that should carry physical and emotional cost. The ending secures knowledge without visible sacrifice or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Causal with light Accumulative coloring (water flow, arrow tip, echoes converge), but the closure effect is weak: Kaelen gains knowledge and departs with no dramatized cost or foreclosed option—he will "share this discovery" in a future scene. The arrow-tip visions deliver backstory that resolves the mystery off-stage, undercutting on-page agency. One tightening occurs when gravity inverts, but the reversal does not narrow options or impose a trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating arches, inverted water, and glowing cavern are vivid and consistent. Spatial choreography is clear across the skiff's path. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Kaelen drifts passively through set-pieces without the world imposing friction. Sensory detail is selective (quartz gleam, soft gurgle, pulsing moss) but remains decorative rather than pressure-bearing, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—find the source of resilience—is signaled early and pursued linearly. Gravity inversion provides one tightening that opens access to the cavern, but no subsequent reversal forces a trade-off or narrows options. The arrow tip hums and the echoes swirl, yet Kaelen never risks anything to secure the discovery; he observes, secures the tip, and exits. No visible price is paid, and the ending defers consequences to a future return, leaving escalation incomplete on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—resilience as a dynamic, nurtured process—emerges from the cavern's echo-archive and the ancient caretakers' legacy. The broken arrow as a symbol of connection is clear but stated rather than enacted through ambiguity or choice. The final paragraph moralizes with "resilience would flourish for generations" and "a symbol of connection between past and future," replacing scene pressure with thematic summary. No non-literal answer reweights prior material; the ending explains rather than resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; Kaelen's perceptual filter favors the visual (glint, gleam, shimmer) and remains consistent. Diction is generally controlled, though "coalescence of memories, of growth cycles, of life forces" drifts toward elevated abstraction. No head-hopping. The prose carries a mild adventure-register voice that modulates appropriately during the inversion. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he realized") appear but do not dull immediacy excessively. Voice is competent but not distinctive enough to elevate the score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence variety is adequate; paragraph lengths shift purposefully. Clarity is maintained throughout. However, template cadence appears in the cavern sequence: "It was not sound, but something more—a coalescence of…" / "The broken arrow tip in his hand grew warm…" / "He realized this was the core…" stacks exposition in parallel stems. Paraphrase loops are present: "gathering of echoes" recurs without added pressure; "resilience" and "source" cycle without deepening. Figurative language is sparse and functional. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance setting or knowledge but few do double duty under pressure. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The orchard-planet-with-gravity-inversion premise is fresh, and the arrow-as-key concept offers a non-obvious twist on ancient technology. However, the narrative arc—lone pilot uncovers ancient secret, gains artifact, vows to return—is a familiar template executed without transformation. The discovery sequence lacks friction or risk; the world yields its mystery without forcing Kaelen to sacrifice or change. The echoes-as-archive and accelerated growth remain intriguing ideas but are told rather than tested through choice. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 for template arc without lived friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kaelen frames the story and pursues the goal throughout, satisfying setup and development gates. However, his choices are largely navigational rather than stake-altering—he follows water, drifts, reaches, observes. The closure beat ("he had to document this") is an intention, not an on-page decision with cost. He is present across beats but passive in all key turns. Causal pressure is minimal; swappable with another pilot archetype. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, but passivity and swappability −0.8 each, late closure participation −0.3, lands mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The arrow tip appears in the upturned tree roots (beat one), hums and guides toward the basin (beat two), vibrates with the echoes and activates the visions (beat three), and is secured in the pack at closure (beat four). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. It enables discovery and is present at the ending. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a cost—Kaelen simply holds it and receives visions. Specificity is moderate (broken, metallic, ancient), but swappability is low; the visions could be triggered by another relic. Early +0.6, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but passivity and moderate specificity hold it in mid-7s; round to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The gathering of echoes is introduced late (cavern scene, past midpoint) and functions as the revelation rather than shaping prior tactics. Setup gate is missed (−0.5 late penalty). It defines the source Kaelen sought, satisfying thematic closure, but does not alter his choices—he observes and departs. Development gate is weak; payoff is present as explanation. Causal pressure is minimal; the echoes are described, not engaged. Late arrival −0.5, ornamental use −0.6, closure linkage (thematic only) +0.5, one beat +0.4, lands low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Accelerated plant growth is mentioned in exposition ("saplings sprout to maturity in days") and demonstrated once (seedling unfurls visibly in the cavern). Setup and payoff gates are met; development is absent—it does not enable or constrain a mid-story choice. It is framed as the mystery's effect rather than a trait Kaelen uses or pays for. Swappability is high; any anomalous growth rate would serve the same narrative function. Early +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure presence +0.4, but ornamental −0.6, swappable −0.6, summary-only −0.4, caps at 3.8 per swappability cap.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Discovery is the dominant action and stated motivation. Kaelen discovers the arrow tip, discovers the cavern, discovers the echo-archive, and the ending promises future sharing of the discovery. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the action is passive observation throughout—no turn traces to a discovery that redefines options on the page. The closure beat is "he had to document this," deferring consequence. Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but passivity −0.8, swappable (replace with "investigate" or "map") −0.6, lands mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Navigating by water flow is signaled early ("This was his chance; he would use the method…"), used in the approach to the cavern ("Following the upward-flowing water, Kaelen steered…"), and referenced at closure ("he navigated the returning currents"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the method is simple steering—no mechanics are shown, no cost or skill test occurs. Swappability is high; he could follow light, sound, or the arrow's pull with minimal edits. Early +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure +0.5, but ornamental −0.7, swappable −0.7, lands low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches are vividly described in the opening and frame the journey. Setup and light development gates are met; the arches guide Kaelen's path ("between two massive floating arches"). Payoff is weak—the ending mentions returning to the arches but does not use them causally. The setting is scenic but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Kaelen drifts without friction. Early +0.6, two beats +0.9, but ornamental −0.8, postcard description −0.6, no closure pressure −0.4, caps at 4.6 per missing-closure-participation cap.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The one-hour gravity inversion is signaled in the opening, triggers the midpoint turn (world flips, debris floats, water reverses), and is referenced at closure ("as the gravity inversion neared its end"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the clock is never tracked—no countdown pressures Kaelen, and he completes his discovery with vague "nearing its end" rather than a ticking constraint. The inversion opens access but does not tighten tactics. Early +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.5, but vague tracking −0.6, no tactical tightening −0.5, lands mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Finding the source of resilience is stated early and pursued consistently. Setup, development (arrow tip guides him), and payoff (echoes are the source) gates are met. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no competing want, no fear to overcome. The closure fulfills the goal without cost or friction; Kaelen is satisfied. Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure +0.9, but told-only −0.8, no friction −0.6, lands mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Whirling silence appears in the opening ("through the whirling silence of Veridia"), recurs mid-story ("The whirling silence deepened"), and modulates at closure ("The whirling silence gave way to the familiar hum of life"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The tone is consistent and modulates with the gravity shift. However, it remains atmospheric rather than charging the final image with pressure—it "gives way" without cost or irony. Early +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure presence +0.6, modulation +0.4, but static mood −0.5, no closure charge −0.6, lands mid-4s.</comment>
