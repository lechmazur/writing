<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to encrypt her own vulnerability as strength") is declared rather than dramatized through choice under pressure. Her competence is total—she dances, decodes, and liberates without visible struggle or cost—resulting in a functionally invincible protagonist. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves through the mission with serene confidence that never wavers or forces a trade-off. The subjects she liberates register no agency or complication, reducing them to inert props.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story follows a linear mission template without meaningful causality: Elara arrives, decodes journals, finds the key, opens the door, frees captives. No on-page reversal or deepening alters her options; each step is a success that leads to the next success. Closure reads as mission-complete satisfaction with no visible or felt cost—she stands "serene and defiant, her work complete, her heart unburdened." The orientation test is satisfied early (sunken lab, algae, viewports), but the absence of a stakes test or forecloses path disqualifies high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is vividly anchored with algae-streaked walls, fractured viewports, and green light filtering through deep ocean. Sensory detail is purposeful and integrated into action (placing dice on a rusted control panel, the stasis chamber irising open). However, the environment never constrains a choice or complicates tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure. The final image does not meaningfully charge the setting ("mysterious familiarity of the deep"), missing the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—liberating trapped subjects—is signaled early but never tested. Elara encounters no obstacles, dead ends, or trade-offs; each decoding step succeeds, and the final sequence unlocks on command. The journals detail dark history but impose no present threat or cost on Elara's mission. No agency-driven reversal or deepening narrows her options; coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of "encrypting vulnerability as strength" is declared repeatedly in abstract terms ("her vulnerability, once encrypted, had become her greatest asset") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The story's final paragraph moralizes directly: "By weaving her fears into her code, she had crafted a key that could not be forged by others." Subtext is minimal; the journals' dark history and Elara's personal vow coexist without friction. The ending offers a stated thesis instead of a resonant image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, and the perceptual filter ("lyrical code breaker") is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the transformation of fragility into an unassailable fortress") that does not match the physical immediacy of the setting. Elara's internal voice remains coherent but lacks specificity—her thoughts could belong to any competent protagonist. No dialogue is present, so that rubric does not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "She worked as a spider spins its web" recurs three times without pressure variation; "mysterious familiarity" is asserted twice in identical phrasing. Template cadence dominates sentence openings ("She began," "She remembered," "She felt," "She entered"). Stock metaphors ("spider spins its web," "chains of her own past") and therapy-speak ("encrypt her own vulnerability as strength") cluster in peak beats without embodied cost. The closure paragraph stacks abstract summarizations ("explained through dance, liberated through code, and encrypted vulnerability as strength"), triggering −0.6 for paraphrase loops, −0.5 for template cadence, and −0.4 for elevated register drift in final beats, totaling approximately −1.5 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—lone operative decodes encrypted records in a submerged facility to free captives—follows a familiar mission-template structure without transformation. "Explaining through dance" is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates tension (she could decode without dancing with no impact). The "hangman's dice" evoke atmosphere but function identically to any decoding tool. The ending resolves all threads symmetrically with no cost, avoiding bold risk. Swappability is high: replace "dance" with "song" or "diagram" and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as code breaker drives the mission structure. However, her choices do not create turns—each decoding step succeeds without complication. She observes journals, deciphers them, and proceeds; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present in setup, middle, and closure (all three gates), but causal pressure is absent and she is swappable with any skilled operative. Score: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure participation +0.7, minus swappability −0.7 and ornamental execution −0.8 = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The hangman's dice appear in three beats: placed on the control panel, rolled to point to cipher layers, and held still at the end. They are described with specificity (bone surfaces, ancient runes) and return in the final image. However, they never constrain a choice or impose cost—Elara could use any decoding method with identical results. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure mention +0.4, minus swappability −0.8 and ornamental middle use −0.6 = ~3.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Calm defiance" is declared multiple times ("with a calm defiance," "calm defiance solidify within her") but never tested. Elara faces no pressure that would require defiance; she moves serenely through unopposed tasks. The concept operates as thematic label rather than shaping stakes or tactics. Present as tone throughout but ornamental. Setup mention +0.3, thematic echo without action pressure −1.0, label-only −0.5 = ~2.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Explains through dance" is mentioned in four passages but never enables or constrains an on-page action with cost. The dance translates ciphers, but the story does not show how movement differs from thought or why dance is necessary. Swappable with "visualizes" or "diagrams" without altering outcomes. Setup +0.5, four beats +1.4, minus label-only trait −0.8, swappability −0.8, ornamental −0.7 = ~2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Liberate" is the stated mission goal and frames the climactic beat (opening the stasis chamber, freeing subjects). It shapes the ending's action and connects to theme. However, liberation is accomplished without cost or complication; Elara simply enters the final sequence and the door opens. Setup +0.6, two beats (journals mention subjects, final liberation) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, minus no causal pressure −0.6, no visible cost −0.7 = ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Coded journal entries are the primary method throughout: Elara decodes journals in the first third, they reveal dark history in the middle, and the master journal entry unlocks the final sequence. Mechanics matter (rhythmic patterns, encryption layers) and the method is irreplaceable. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal enabling +0.8, minus mid-scene summary-only revelation −0.5, swappability within decoding methods −0.8 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is anchored early (algae, fractured viewports, deep ocean) and remains present through rusted control panels and the stasis chamber. It supplies atmosphere and the final reveal location. However, it never constrains a choice—water pressure, limited air, or equipment failure are mentioned but do not alter tactics. Setup +0.7, three beats (descent, work, chamber) +1.4, closure setting +0.5, minus postcard description −0.8, no tactical constraint −1.1 = ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"As a spider spins its web" appears three times as a simile describing Elara's patience and method, but no timeframe is tracked or tightened. The story does not establish duration or impose a deadline; Elara works at her own pace without clock pressure. The metaphor functions as descriptive motif, not temporal constraint. Setup mention +0.3, ornamental recurrence −0.8, no time tracking −0.5 = ~2.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to encrypt vulnerability as strength" is declared in the opening third and restated in the final paragraph. It frames theme but is never dramatized through a choice that risks vulnerability or forces a trade-off. Elara's vow ("to hide her fears so well that they became the foundation of her power") operates as backstory assertion without present friction. Setup +0.5, thematic closure mention +0.4, minus told-only −1.0, no friction between want and cost −0.5 = ~3.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is declared twice in identical phrasing ("mysterious familiarity, as if she had always known its corridors" and "mysterious familiarity of the deep") without modulation. Tone remains static—serene, poetic, distanced—across all beats without pressure-driven shift. The final image does not charge or reweight the tone. Setup +0.3, closure mention +0.4, minus single static mood −0.6, label-only assertion −0.5 = ~3.6.</comment>
