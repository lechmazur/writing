<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The piece tells us she is "steadily adaptive" and molding "fear into focus," but these traits function as labels without forcing difficult trade-offs or micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. The rival artist reveal arrives as exposition rather than through dramatized recognition, and the final resolve to "create something new" reads as wish-fulfillment rather than earned renunciation with visible cost. Interior texture leans on stock phrasing ("drifting resonance," "harmonic emptiness") that could apply to any contemplative protagonist.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the canyon stillness, frost patterns, and ledger strip are meant to build density toward a reweighted stake. Orientation is anchored early (canyon, stars, Elara), satisfying the test. However, the closure unit lacks on-page cost: Elara "decides to use this knowledge not for revenge, but to create something new" without forfeiting a live option or facing a visible price. The ledger's reveal of the rival artist arrives as convenience rather than earned discovery, and the final image ("drifting resonance of her own soul") asserts thematic resonance without reweighting prior material through a concrete, costly act or image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The canyon under stars is established early and the frost patterns constrain her decipherment choice in one middle beat, meeting two gates. However, the setting functions primarily as a static backdrop for reflection rather than dynamically shaping tactics or the final image. The frost's disappearance at sunrise could have altered her options but instead remains ornamental. Sensory detail is present (cold stone, morning frost, waking sky) but lacks POV-specific selection that would reveal urgency or professional bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival and understanding the conspiracy—is signaled early, but escalation is thin. The ledger comparison to frost patterns offers one tightening beat, yet the rival artist's name appears as exposition rather than through a choice that forecloses an option. No visible cost accompanies the decision to "create something new"; revenge is rejected off-page without dramatizing the renunciation's price. The attempt on her life and the fire are recounted rather than pressuring present action, flattening the tension curve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of "purpose in the pauses" and transformation through stillness emerges from repeated images (frost, stars, scorched testament), but the final paragraph overtly states the theme rather than letting the image resonate: "she had discovered her path," "drifting resonance of her own soul." The frost-as-map device offers a concrete motif, yet its meaning is explained rather than enacted with cost. The piece opts for serene resolution over complexity, and the rival artist's jealousy reads as a simplistic moral binary without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice drifts into elevated abstraction ("drifting resonance," "harmonic emptiness," "scorched testament to her own strength") that feels authorial rather than anchored in Elara's glass-artist idiom. Diction under peak stress (discovering the conspiracy) remains uniform and ornate rather than compressing or sharpening. Purposeful elision is absent; all key facts are withheld for suspense rather than imposing cost, and the reveal arrives as summary rather than through perceptual shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "She retraced…" / "Retracing her path…" / "She had retraced…"; "steadily adaptive" appears twice; "drifting resonance" recurs as thematic marker without accruing new pressure. Stock metaphors ("blanket of stars," "balm after the chaos," "inner light") dull specificity. Repeated sentence stems ("She held…," "She realized…," "She decided…," "She stood…") create drumbeat monotony. The final third stacks these patterns without propulsion, triggering the artifact cap and disallowing 9+ globally. Several lines restate content without added pressure, e.g., "The frost formed intricate designs, like maps or codes" followed immediately by comparison to her glass art.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glass-artist-as-detective frame and the frost-as-cipher device offer a mildly fresh synthesis, but the execution leans on familiar beats: artist targeted by jealous rival, ledger reveals conspiracy, quiet canyon introspection leads to epiphany. The "scorched testament" label and "drifting resonance" tone feel prompt-derivative rather than emerging from lived detail. The final choice to "create something new" opts for the safety middle, avoiding bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus. No transformation of the core template is evident; the emotional arc would work unchanged with different occupations and props.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and frames the POV, meeting setup and payoff gates. She makes one middle choice (comparing ledger to frost), meeting development, so all three gates pass and eligibility reaches ≥6.1 baseline. However, her choices do not narrow options with visible cost: the decision to "create something new" is declared rather than dramatized, and the rival artist's unmasking happens through exposition rather than a costly action. Her profession colors description but does not constrain tactics under pressure. Swappability is moderate; a different artist type could fulfill the same beats with minor edits. Deduct for ornamental profession use (−0.5), late causal work (−0.4), and summary-only crisis resolution (−0.7). Starting at 6.1, total deductions −1.6 → 4.5, round down to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ledger strip appears in the opening (setup ✓), is used in the frost-comparison beat (development ✓), and is folded and pocketed at the end with stated thematic weight (payoff ✓). All three gates pass, so baseline eligibility is ≥6.1. It drives one distinct causal beat (+0.4) and recurs with stated resonance at closure (+0.3), but its mechanics are vague—how do "smudged numbers" map to frost lines?—and the rival's name is simply "recognized" rather than decoded through specific ledger detail. The object could be swapped for any evidence fragment (letter, photo) with minor edits (−0.6). Early signal (+0.5) and two-beat involvement (+0.9) yield +1.4 additive; swappability and vague mechanics yield −0.9 subtractive. Net from 6.1: +0.5 → 6.6, but the lack of unique causal necessity and the convenience reveal cap the ceiling; settle at 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" is named twice: once as descriptor of the ledger ("scorched at the edges, a testament to the fire") and once metaphorically ("The scorched testament wasn't just the paper; it was her own resolve, forged in fire"). Setup ✓, payoff via metaphor ✓, but no middle development beat where the concept constrains a choice; it functions as thematic label rather than shaping tactics. The metaphor is stated rather than enacted with cost, and the concept could be replaced with "proof of survival" or "evidence" without altering the plot. Ornamental use (−0.7), label-only trait (−0.3), missing development gate (cap 3.4). Starting at 3.4, deductions bring it to ~2.7, but the dual mention and thematic reprise lift slightly to 3.6 within cap tolerance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is declared twice: "Her nature was steadily adaptive; she had already begun to mold her fear into focus" and "Steadily adaptive, she decided to use this knowledge." Setup ✓ (first paragraph), payoff ✓ (final third), but no middle beat where the trait visibly constrains or enables an action with cost; it remains a label. The trait could be "resilient" or "determined" with no plot change (−0.7). Missing development gate caps at 3.4. Label-only use (−0.3) and ornamental mentions (−0.5) total −1.5 from a 5.0 baseline → 3.5, but the dual statement and thematic closure claim nudge slightly to 3.9 within cap.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Retrace" appears in three beats: Elara retraces events mentally, retraces her path to see ledger connections, and the narration states "She had retraced the past to find her future." Setup ✓ (early reflection), development ✓ (frost-ledger comparison), payoff ✓ (final summary). All three gates pass, baseline ≥6.1. The action is central to the plot structure and recurs with stated weight (+0.9 for two beats, +0.5 for early signal, +0.4 for closure linkage = +1.8 additive). However, the "retrace" is largely mental and summary-based rather than forcing a visible, costly choice; the rival reveal happens through convenient recognition rather than earned reconstruction. Swappability is moderate—"investigate" or "decode" would serve (−0.6), and summary-only use in key beats (−0.6) totals −1.2 subtractive. Net from 6.1: +1.8 −1.2 = +0.6 → 6.7, but ceiling limited by lack of dramatized cost; settle at 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Patterns in the morning frost" appear in one paragraph: Elara notices them, holds the ledger against them, and uses their "clarity to decipher the faded charcoal marks." Setup ✓ (dawn approached, she noticed), development ✓ (frost comparison enables ledger reading), but the patterns vanish ("the frost melted") without return at closure—missing payoff gate (cap 2.8). However, the final line "The patterns in the morning frost had shown her the way" reinstates them thematically, which counts as weak payoff; adjust cap to 4.6 for lyric reprise. The method enables one beat (+0.4) and is somewhat specific (+0.4), but its mechanics are vague—how do ice lines decode smudged names?—and it could be swapped for "sunlight through glass" with minor edits (−0.6). Net from 4.6 baseline: +0.8 −0.6 = +0.2 → 4.8, round down to 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The canyon is established in the opening (setup ✓) and provides the stillness and frost that frame Elara's reflection, meeting development loosely. The final paragraph states "The canyon remained quiet under the waking sky, a witness to her transformation" (payoff ✓). All three gates technically pass, baseline ≥6.1. However, the canyon functions as a static backdrop rather than constraining choice or supplying resources; the cold stone and frost are ambient rather than tactical. Early anchor (+0.5) and closure mention (+0.3) yield +0.8 additive, but ornamental use (−0.8) and high swappability—desert, forest, shore would serve equally (−0.7)—total −1.5 subtractive. Net from 6.1: +0.8 −1.5 = −0.7 → 5.4, but lack of choice-shaping pressure pulls to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after surviving the attempt" anchors the opening (setup ✓) and the memory of "flames and shouts" primes her motivation. "As dawn approached" marks progression (development ✓), and "As the sun rose, the frost melted" and "the waking sky" close the window (payoff ✓). All three gates pass, baseline ≥6.1. The dawn-to-sunrise arc provides a loose clock (+0.4 for structure) and early signal (+0.4), totaling +0.8 additive. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline; Elara's reflection is leisurely, and the sunrise arrival is convenient rather than pressuring. Generic time window, easily swappable with "night vigil" or "afternoon rest" (−0.7), and no tactical consequence (−0.6) total −1.3 subtractive. Net from 6.1: +0.8 −1.3 = −0.5 → 5.6, adjusted down to 5.1 for lack of urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To discover purpose in the pauses" is declared in the fourth paragraph (late setup, −0.3) and restated in the final lines: "she found the rhythm of her new purpose." Setup ✓, payoff ✓, but no middle beat where this desire conflicts with another want or incurs a visible cost—missing development gate (cap 3.4). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through friction. However, the pause-seeking frames the canyon stillness and the frost-reading beat loosely, so development is marginal; adjust cap to 4.6 for weak causal link. Label-only motivation (−0.3) and ornamental closure mention (−0.4) total −0.7 from 4.6 → 3.9, but thematic reprise and dual statement lift slightly to 4.4 within tolerance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" appears three times: "The drifting resonance of the canyon's silence," "a drifting resonance of hope," and "the drifting resonance of her own soul." Setup ✓ (mid-story), payoff ✓ (final line), but the phrase is ornamental rather than modulating with pressure—no development beat where tone shifts causally (missing gate, cap 3.4). The tone remains uniformly serene and abstract throughout, never tightening under the conspiracy reveal or frost decipherment. However, the triple recurrence and thematic charge at closure suggest purposeful pattern; adjust cap to 4.6 for lyric reprise. Ornamental use (−0.5), static mood (−0.4), and phrase repetition without earned intensification (−0.3) total −1.2 from 4.6 → 3.4, but the closure weight and triple mention lift to 4.3 within cap tolerance.</comment>
