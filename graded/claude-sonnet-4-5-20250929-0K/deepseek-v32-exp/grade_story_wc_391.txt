<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The collective at the end ("they began to unyoke themselves") diffuses agency into a faceless group without individual struggle. Interior life consists of label-only declarations ("her impatience was a old, sharp thing") rather than embodied tension. The piece describes her shaping patience but never shows her failing, hesitating, or paying a visible cost for this transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful escalation occurs; the piece moves in a steady declarative march toward a predetermined collective ritual without reversal or deepening. Orientation is present early (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake), satisfying that test. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (collective liberation), but the cost is asserted ("quiet decisions that had finally broken the old yoke") rather than dramatized—no specific renunciation, forfeiture, or visible price appears on the page. The "patient revolution" remains an abstract claim, not an earned transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly described and recur across the text. However, they function as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraints that shape choice—Elara's actions (laying hands on the viaduct, aligning a lodestone) proceed without environmental friction or resource scarcity. The viaduct "enhanced by the recent rain" is mentioned but never tested; no moment where its properties fail, complicate, or demand adaptation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful but does not pressure the protagonist's path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("unyoke her people from the frantic cycle") is signaled early but never tested or tightened. No reversal, complication, or cost appears; the moon convergence arrives on schedule, the group gathers without conflict, and the liberation proceeds exactly as planned. The piece describes "restrained wildness" and "latent energy held in check," but this potential never manifests as on-page friction or choice under pressure. Agency is collective and symbolic, not a protagonist-driven turn that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("patience as liberation") is stated repeatedly rather than earned through concrete struggle. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "The patient revolution was not an event, but a way of life... the impatience was now a tool, not a master." No complex counter-reading is invited; the piece resolves into tidy affirmation. The magnetic viaduct and moon paths function as symbolic props rather than particulars that complicate or deepen the thematic question. A Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6) applies for the penultimate and final paragraphs summarizing the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is stable and purposeful, with consistent elevated diction ("vigilant horizon mapper," "unyoke," "insurrection of the spirit"). However, the register remains uniformly declarative and abstract across all beats, showing no modulation under emotional pressure. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices the same poetic details (starry sky, damp metal) without character-specific bias. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose reads as narration about a character rather than filtered through her lived perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "unyoke" appears six times, "patient revolution" five times, "restrained wildness" three times, "softly purposeful" twice—each repetition adding decoration rather than new pressure. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]... Her [noun]... The [noun]..." across consecutive paragraphs. Figurative density is high ("sculpt patience," "quiet insurrection of the spirit," "ballet of necessity and grace") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.7). Synonym churn: "unyoke," "release," "set free," "liberation" cycle without advancing meaning. Patterned-artifact penalty pack applies: −1.4 total in Q7, and artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (collective ritual to slow time and embrace patience) reads as a familiar spiritual-transformation template without fresh synthesis. The "vigilant horizon mapper" role, magnetic viaduct, and moon-path tracking are window dressing—swap for another tool or method and the emotional arc (impatient woman leads group to collective stillness) remains unchanged. No risk-taking in structure, voice, or moral calculus. The piece avoids specificity that would ground the revolution in lived detail or consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes small gestures (lays hands on viaduct, aligns lodestone, gives a nod), but none of these choices create a turn or alter tactics. "Vigilant horizon mapper" functions as a label, not a role that constrains or enables decisions under pressure. Observation without decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct is mentioned in multiple beats (approached, hands laid on it, lodestone aligned), satisfying the two-beat test. However, its "enhanced" state after rain is described but never tested—no moment where its charge fails, fluctuates, or demands adaptation. It serves as a charged backdrop rather than a tool whose properties shape outcome. Present in the final paragraph as a "monument," granting closure participation, but causally passive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"A patient revolution" is declared and repeated across the text but never dramatized as a choice or tactic. It frames the thematic claim rather than shaping on-page stakes—swappable with "slow awakening" or "collective transformation" without structural change. Mentioned in the first third, final third, and throughout, but functions as a label rather than a constraint or enabler.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" is mentioned twice as a descriptor of Elara's demeanor and movement but never constrains or enables an action with cost. It colors tone without altering tactics or forcing a trade-off. Label-only trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Unyoke" appears in the first third (her goal), middle (she unyokes her satchel), and climax ("they began to unyoke themselves"). The middle use is literal (removing a satchel), the climax use is symbolic (collective liberation). The symbolic unyoking is the story's intended closure moment, granting all-three-gates participation. However, the action is summarized ("they began to unyoke themselves from their old fears") rather than shown through specific renunciation or visible cost, limiting causal force. Swappable with "release" or "free themselves" without rewriting the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"By tracking moon paths" is signaled in the first third and mentioned three times across the text. Elara withdraws charts and calculates a convergence point, and the moons' ascent triggers the climax. However, the method's mechanics are vague—what distinguishes this tracking from simple observation? The moons arrive on schedule without complication, so the method enables but does not constrain or test. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake are vividly described and recur in the opening, middle, and final paragraphs. However, they function as atmospheric anchors rather than constraints—no moment where the sanctuary's layout, the lake's ice, or the cold affects Elara's choices or complicates the group's gathering. Postcard description that frames rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the lake freezes over" anchors the story in a cold, post-freeze season, and the text notes "Tonight" at the start of the vigil. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no urgency, no countdown, no risk of missing the convergence. The moons arrive as expected. Time is present but does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to sculpt patience from impatience") is declared in the first third and repeated in the final paragraph. However, it is told rather than dramatized—no on-page moment where impatience flares and she visibly suppresses it at cost, nor any friction between her desire for patience and competing wants. The motivation frames the thematic claim without shaping conflicted choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>"Restrained wildness" is mentioned three times and describes the collective mood. The tone is stable and purposeful throughout, modulating slightly at the climax ("collective breath," "pulse with their collective resolve"). However, the "wildness" remains potential—never erupting, never requiring restraint that costs something. The tone charges the atmosphere but does not charge the final image with a visible shift or cost. Present across beats and at closure, granting eligibility above 4.0, but static and asserted rather than embodied.</comment>
