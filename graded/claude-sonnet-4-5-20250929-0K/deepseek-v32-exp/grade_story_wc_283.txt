<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The hourglass turner remains abstract throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under genuine pressure. Her "quiet inspiration" is declared but never dramatized as a trait that constrains action or creates cost. The cataloging work unfolds without struggle or mistake; she simply succeeds, flattening any sense of internal conflict. The final "transformation" is told rather than earned through visible stakes or felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece lacks a legible closure unit with cost. The prophecy shifts from red to gold, but no on-page choice, renunciation, or crystallized stance forecloses a path with visible consequence—the change simply happens as a result of cataloging. Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words, with "amber warehouse beneath cliffs" offering little spatial anchor and "hourglass turner" reading as a role rather than a grounded individual. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern is taught or held to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse and canyon echo jar are vivid in isolation but remain postcard details—no object or environment constrains a choice or charges the final image. The buttons, while cataloged extensively, do not alter tactics or impose spatial logic; they are shuffled without friction. "Unearthed silence" and "sourceless light" offer atmospheric texture but no pressure that the protagonist must navigate or resist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—altering the prophecy—is declared but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the protagonist encounters no failure, adaptation, or trade-off. The work proceeds smoothly from jar-opening to button-sorting to hourglass glow without opposition, mistake, or visible cost. The resolution is convenience: the prophecy dissolves because the cataloging is complete, with no agency or sacrifice dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Theme is asserted rather than emergent: "small actions accumulate into monumental change" and "lost buttons as unfulfilled destinies" are stated directly rather than rising from concrete particulars. The canyon echo functions as a wisdom-delivery device without friction or reinterpretation. The final image offers no resonant reconfiguration or non-literal answer—merely a declaration that "she had unlocked the power to shape it." The closing line's "her work had only just begun" deflates closure by deferring consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrator's perceptual signature is generic high-fantasy register—"unearthed silence," "liquid gold," "spectrum of potential futures"—without character-specific texture or rhythmic modulation under pressure. Free indirect style is absent; the prose reports rather than inhabits the protagonist's consciousness. Psychic distance remains static and distant throughout, never tightening during the supposed peak of transformation. Voice does not degrade or shift under the weight of the task.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dominate: "unscramble its meaning, to find the loose threads" / "unscrambling another piece of the prophetic code"; "shared wisdom" repeated without variation; "quietly inspired" echoed mechanically. Sentence stems recur: "She [verb]" opens five consecutive beats mid-story. Figurative language—"tangled knot," "branching rivers," "tapestry of interwoven fates"—stacks without adding pressure. The closing paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes, listing achievements instead of landing an image with cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—magical artisan alters fate through symbolic sorting—follows a template without fresh inflection. The cataloging method and amber-warehouse setting remain unexplored for their unique properties; buttons could be any symbolic object, the canyon echo any font of wisdom. No turn or final image arises from specific, non-obvious synthesis; the prophecy simply shifts color when the task is done. The piece hedges risk by keeping stakes abstract and resolution declarative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The hourglass turner is present throughout and her role is named, but her choices do not create turns—she opens the jar, catalogs buttons, and observes the hourglass glow. No decision narrows options or imposes cost; the work proceeds without adaptation or reversal. She is the protagonist by label, not by causal agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The canyon echo appears in two beats: opened early to provide "shared wisdom" and sealed at the end. Its function—guidance through "feelings and images"—is told rather than dramatized in a choice or constraint. It does not evolve or return with reweighted meaning; it serves the same role throughout and could be replaced by any wisdom-source with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Shared wisdom" is declared as the canyon echo's property and mentioned at closure, but it does not shape on-page tactics or create a trade-off. The protagonist receives guidance passively; no moment shows her applying or struggling with collective knowledge in a decision. It remains thematic ornament rather than a causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" is stated twice but never constrains or enables action with visible cost. No moment shows inspiration conflicting with caution, enabling a risky move, or foreclosing a safer path. It is a label applied to the character, not a trait that alters her choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Unscramble" is signaled early and recurs at midpoint and closure, but the method remains abstract—patterns emerge, threads fray, code is decoded—without specific mechanics that could fail or require adaptation. The action shapes the arc's frame but is functionally interchangeable with "interpret," "decode," or "untangle."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cataloging lost buttons is introduced early, demonstrated across multiple beats, and produces the prophecy's transformation at closure. The method is specific and recurs, but its mechanics—how noting shapes and sizes unscrambles fate—remain symbolic rather than causal. Removing it would require rewriting the method, so it clears essential integration, but swappability with "sorting relics" or "arranging shards" trends it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The amber warehouse is named early and returns in the penultimate paragraph, but it supplies no constraint or resource that alters tactics. The cliffs, shelves, and petrified-wood bench are described but do not pressure or enable; the work could unfold in any secluded archive. Setup and closure mention are present, but development involvement is absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" frames the timeframe poetically, and "hours" of work are mentioned, but no ticking clock tightens decisions. The protagonist works "slowly, meticulously" without deadline or interruption. Time does not escalate pressure or shape the ending; it is backdrop, not constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The motivation to "spin a prophecy into raw possibility" is stated in the opening and recurs at closure. It frames the goal but is never tested by competing desire, doubt, or cost. No moment dramatizes why this matters to her personally or what she risks by attempting it. Setup and closure mention earn functional credit, but dramatized friction is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Unearthed silence" is named three times and coheres with the meditative register, but tone remains static—no modulation with pressure, no cadence shift at the climax. The prose maintains the same elevated distance throughout; the "deepening" silence in the middle is asserted, not felt through rhythm or diction change. Coherence without dynamic range trends mid-low.</comment>
