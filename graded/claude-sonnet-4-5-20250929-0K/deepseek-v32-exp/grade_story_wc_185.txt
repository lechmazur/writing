<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—to find quiet in chaos—but her interior experience remains abstract and label-driven ("profound connection," "fulfilled"). The mapkeeper role shapes perception (reading ice cracks) but micro-choices under pressure lack embodied contradiction; she moves through the task smoothly without visible internal friction or cost until the end. The final kneeling moment ("exhausted but fulfilled") tells emotional state rather than showing degraded thought or conflicted relief. Competence is high, struggle is declared more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through expanding "bloom of hush" and cave harmonics stabilizing into new pattern. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: peace forged through struggle), but the cost remains vague ("exhausted but fulfilled") rather than a specific forfeiture or visible trade-off on the page. Orientation anchors promptly (who/where/stakes). One meaningful deepening occurs (energy beings shift from chaotic to cooperative), but the final image—Elara walking away, leaving the stone—lands softly without sharp conceptual or felt cost that the reader can point to in a single sentence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Harmonic caves provide vivid sensory anchors (chaotic resonance, frozen tears, ice patterns) and constrain Elara's method—she must read cracks to restore balance. The echo chamber stone functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (cave walls, niche, her kneeling position). The ice cracks enable her conjuring and their gleaming luminescence at the end reconfigures the space. Environment actively shapes tactics and the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore harmonic balance) is signaled early and pressure accumulates as Elara works through the conjuring. The energy beings' shift from chaotic to cooperative provides one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation is smooth and unopposed—no reversal tests her method or forces a trade-off. Cost at closure is asserted ("exhausted") but not dramatized through a visible forfeiture, injury, or foreclosed option. Agency is decision-driven (leaving the stone in the niche) yet the choice feels soft, more denouement than culmination with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of balance and integration (old/new harmonics) emerges through concrete action—ice-reading, conjuring, the bloom of hush. "Hammered repose" as earned peace is shown through struggle, not merely stated. The final image (Elara walking away, stone watching over) offers quiet resonance. Yet the ending includes mild moralizing ("found not just quiet, but a deeper understanding of harmony") and the ripple-marks line edges toward thesis statement. No sharp counter-reading is invited; the resolution feels complete and affirmed without ambiguity or conceptual cost that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Elara's sensory and professional lens (mapkeeper reading ice). Diction is consistent and elevated ("ethereal clarity," "silent poetry") without jarring register shifts. Perceptual signature is present (tracing cracks, sensing warmth in the stone). However, the prose occasionally over-explains ("This was the beginning of the bloom of hush, a gradual unfurling of silence that drank the noise like parched earth drinks rain") where image alone would suffice. No dialogue; interior voice is controlled but leans toward tell in emotional peaks ("profound connection," "fulfilled").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but multiple sentences open with similar structures ("Elara [verb]," "The [noun]," "She [verb]") creating mild template cadence. Paraphrase loops appear: "gently luminous" recurs five times without evolving function; "hammered repose" is stated twice in close succession (penultimate and final paragraphs) without new pressure. Stock metaphors ("parched earth drinks rain," "sleeping child") and label-heavy phrasing ("profound connection," "ethereal clarity") dull immediacy in peak beats. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff. Information density is moderate; some lines restate prior content (e.g., the echo chamber stone's glow is described multiple times). These artifacts touch the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally and applying −1.0 cumulative penalty in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise (mapkeeper restoring harmonic balance via ice-reading) offers a fresh synthesis of fantasy elements with craft-work specificity. "Bloom of hush" and "hammered repose" are memorable phrasings. However, the emotional arc—lone expert solves mystical problem through ancient method, achieves peace—follows a familiar template without subversion or moral ambiguity. Energy beings remain abstract entities without agency or resistance that would complicate the resolution. The ending grants symmetric satisfaction (harmony restored, beings calmed, Elara fulfilled) without visible cost or counter-reading. Transformation test: swapping names and setting would leave the arc largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara drives all major beats: examining ice cracks, conjuring the field of calm, murmuring old words, leaving the stone. Her choices (to read the ice, to weave rather than suppress energy, to place the stone in the niche) create the story's tightening and enable closure. Setup early, developed across multiple beats, present in the ending. Mid-high band: causal pressure is clear, closure participation is strong, but cost tied specifically to her mapkeeper identity (rather than generic effort) is understated.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Echo chamber stone is handled in multiple beats: clutched, growing warmer, glowing brighter, absorbing words, resting in her lap, placed in the niche. Its evolving state (coolness → warmth → bright glow → soft glow) mirrors and enables the conjuring. Setup immediate, developed across middle, present at closure (watching over the hush). Strong integration: beat involvement, causal enabling, closure linkage. Cost connection is implicit (leaving it behind signals relinquishment). Reaches 7+ band; irreplaceability is high but not absolute (another artifact could serve similar function with edits).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bloom of hush is named at midpoint, expanded as the conjuring's effect, and becomes "a permanent feature" by the end. It shapes the resolution (wave of quiet, stable pattern) and charges the final image. However, it appears late (second half) and mostly operates as metaphor/result rather than constraint that alters Elara's tactics. Setup delayed (−0.4), closure participation strong (+1.2), causal pressure moderate (+0.6). Lyric resonance is present but the concept does not narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" describes the echo chamber stone's state across five mentions but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. It signals the stone's presence and mood (soft, steady, brighter, dimmed) yet remains ornamental—the story's mechanics would function identically if the stone were warm, humming, or pulsing instead. Setup early (+0.5), beat involvement moderate (+0.4), but swappability is high (−0.7) and no cost is tied to this trait. Ornamental use (−0.8). Caps at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Conjuring drives the central turn: Elara focuses will, murmurs old words, the stone amplifies them into tranquility, the bloom expands, beings calm, balance is restored. Setup early (she "needed to conjure a solution"), developed across middle beats (conjuring a field of calm, conjuring reaches peak), causally decisive at closure. Beat involvement high (+1.2), causal pressure strong (+1.4), closure linkage clear (+1.0). Cost is implied (exhaustion) but not sharply tied to the act itself. Strong integration; irreplaceability is high—story would collapse without this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Examining ice-crack patterns is Elara's core method: signaled early ("ancient and precise"), executed on the page (tracing lines, cracks shift, revealing nodes), and the gleaming cracks at the end testify to her success. Setup immediate (+0.7), beat involvement across multiple moments (+1.2), causal enabling of the conjuring (+1.3), closure linkage (ice cracks gleam with luminescence) (+1.0). Specificity is high—the method is unique to her mapkeeper role and could not be easily swapped. Reaches high 7s: indispensable to her tactics and the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Harmonic caves provide the dominant pressure (chaotic resonance threatens collapse), supply the resource Elara uses (ice patterns on walls), and their response (harmonics settling into new pattern) constitutes the resolution. Setup immediate, developed continuously, closure is the caves' transformation. Beat involvement pervasive (+1.4), causal pressure high (setting creates the problem and enables the solution) (+1.5), closure linkage strong (+1.4), irreplaceability absolute (+0.8). The setting is the story's logic; remove it and nothing remains. Reaches 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Timeframe ("after the energy beings arrive") anchors the inciting disruption and is referenced in backstory ("tales of their coming") and present (beings drifting, calming). However, time does not tighten decisions—there is no urgency, countdown, or worsening condition that forces Elara's pace. Setup present (+0.5), thematic relevance moderate (+0.4), but no tactical pressure from the timeframe itself. The "after" orients causality but does not function as a live constraint. Mid-band: functional but replaceable with "during" or "as" without altering choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation (find quiet in storm) is stated immediately, dramatized through Elara's method (reading cracks, conjuring calm), tested by the chaotic resonance, and resolved ("found the quiet within it"). Setup early (+0.7), beat involvement high (every action pursues this goal) (+1.2), closure linkage direct (she achieves the quiet) (+1.2), cost implied (exhaustion, leaving stone) (+0.4). Friction between want (silence) and method (weaving, not suppressing) adds depth (+0.5). Strong integration; the desire shapes all tactics and the final stance. Reaches 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone of "hammered repose" (peace forged through effort) is introduced late (penultimate paragraph), repeated in the final paragraph, and retrospectively colors the resolution. The journey shows struggle (deafening storm, oppressive gloom, meticulous work) and the ending delivers calm, but the specific phrase "hammered repose" is declared rather than built incrementally through modulation. Setup delayed (−0.5), closure linkage strong (+1.2), coherence across turns is present (tone shifts from chaos to tranquility) (+0.8). However, the tonal charge at the final image is asserted via the label rather than felt through rhythm or diction shift. Reaches mid-6s: functional reprise but not indispensable to the story's pressure architecture.</comment>
