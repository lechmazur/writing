<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. His "stoic wonder" and "functionally creative nature" are labeled traits without embodied tension or micro-choices under pressure. The decision to "resurrect the heart of this place" arrives without internal conflict or visible cost—he moves from inspection to redemption without friction. The final satisfaction is asserted ("quiet satisfaction") rather than earned through a struggle that forecloses a competing desire.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is adequate (civil engineer intern, abandoned spaceport, post-carnival) by the opening. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the terminal hums with life, a new narrative crafted from broken pieces), but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no on-page forfeiture or foreclosed path is visible. The "equations he developed" and "blueprint for other derelict places" are told outcomes, not dramatized stakes that narrow options. The final image (sextant on a pedestal, terminal whispering possibilities) reweights prior material with thematic density but lacks a felt price that makes before/after legible with embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The spaceport setting is vivid and specific (soaring arches, dormant escalators, cracked domes, utility tunnels mimicking constellations). Sensory detail is selective and supports atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or charge the final image in a way that forecloses options—Kaelen navigates the space freely, and the resurrection proceeds without spatial friction. The sextant piece and solar reflectors function as tools but do not impose a cost tied to setting properties.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to puzzle out new equations for hope"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete obstacle or trade-off on the page. Kaelen's work (mapping tunnels, aligning reflectors, rerouting pipes) proceeds without reversal or meaningful tightening; each action succeeds in sequence. No live option is foreclosed, no competing pressure forces a hierarchy of values. The "resurrection" is a gradient accumulation without a moment where agency narrows possibilities or reveals cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the resurrection metaphor and "redirected flows," but the final paragraph ("hope wasn't a fixed point, but a dynamic flow") is a direct thematic statement rather than an image that allows reflection. The sextant's symbolic role (finding direction in chaos) is over-explained rather than charged through particulars. The ending offers conceptual resonance but leans toward thesis assertion: "it was all about redirecting flows toward hope, one equation at a time" is moralizing summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Kaelen. Diction is consistent and somewhat elevated ("stoic wonder," "maze of intentions," "symphony of renewal"), fitting an engineer-intern who romanticizes his work. However, voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—observations are generically poetic rather than character-specific. Phrases like "functionally creative nature" and "logic of resilience" feel imposed rather than organic to Kaelen's idiom under pressure. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean, with varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraph rhythm. However, multiple passages loop conceptually: "maze of intentions" appears three times; "redirected flows" recurs without added pressure; "stoic wonder" is restated. Template cadence is visible in repeated "He [verb]" constructions and thematic echo in the final paragraph ("it was all about redirecting flows toward hope, one equation at a time"). Figurative density is high but some metaphors are stock ("symphony of renewal," "beacon for any future wanderer"). Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and thematic summary in the closure beat, plus −0.3 for template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The core premise—abandoned spaceport as site of redemption through engineering—is functional but not fresh; the resurrection-from-decay arc is familiar. The sextant piece as celestial-navigation relic adds specificity, but its pivot to "symbol of finding direction in chaos" is predictable. "Equations for hope" and "maze of intentions" read as prompt-driven abstractions rather than earned particulars. The emotional truth of solitary repair work is present but does not transform the template into a singular vision. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kaelen is present throughout and his choices (mapping tunnels, aligning reflectors, rerouting pipes) drive the sequence. However, these are observation-plus-action beats without a key turn or trade-off—he decides to resurrect the terminal early and proceeds without friction. "Curious" and "intern" status do not constrain tactics or shape a closure choice. Present and functional, but replaceable with "determined engineer" or "resourceful student" with minimal edits. Mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sextant piece is discovered in the second paragraph, used as a calibration tool for solar reflectors in the third, and left on a pedestal in the final paragraph—three beats. However, its function as calibration tool is told rather than shown with specific mechanics, and the final pedestal placement is symbolic rather than causally necessary. The sextant shapes one action (alignment) but does not reweight prior material or impose a cost. Present across beats but not indispensable; swappable with another navigation relic. Upper end of functional-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" is named three times (original designers' layout, utility tunnels, final decoding) but functions as thematic gloss rather than on-page constraint. The labyrinthine tunnels are a setting feature Kaelen maps without getting lost or forced to choose between paths. The concept does not narrow options or alter tactics; it is an interpretive frame applied to the setting. Present and thematically consistent, but ornamental—removing it would not break the plot. Mid-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is labeled once ("This find ignited his functionally creative nature; he saw potential where others saw only scrap") but not dramatized through a trade-off or constraint. Kaelen's actions (repurposing conduits, aligning reflectors, rerouting pipes) are resourceful but do not show a cost of creativity versus another trait. The attribute is present and logically consistent with his behavior, but it could be replaced with "resourceful" or "innovative" without structural impact. Upper functional-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is signaled early ("decided to resurrect the heart of this place") and structures the middle sequence (rerouting, repairing, sprouting garden) and closure ("resurrection complete"). The action is central and distinct from "repair" or "renovate"—it implies transformation and new life. However, the execution is gradient accumulation without a single decisive turn tied to this action, and it could be replaced with "revive" or "restore" with similar effect. Present in closure with thematic charge but not mechanically indispensable. Lower end of shapes-one-key-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" is named early ("His method would be through redirected flows"), detailed in the middle (rerouting water pipes, channeling light, repairing energy wires), and restated at closure ("redirected flows of water, light, and data became a symphony of renewal"). The method shapes multiple beats and is mechanically specific to the setting's utility infrastructure. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown with friction or cost, and the method could be replaced with "repurposed systems" without breaking the plot. Present across beats and tied to closure image but not causally indispensable. Mid shapes-one-key-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is present throughout, supplies resources (utility tunnels, solar reflectors, hydroponic garden), and frames the stakes (structural decay as systemic failure). The setting's features (arches, escalators, domes, conduits) are specific and enable Kaelen's actions. However, the setting does not impose a constraint that forces a trade-off or alters the outcome—Kaelen navigates freely and the resurrection proceeds without spatial friction. The final image (terminal humming, less abandoned) charges the closure but the setting itself is a stage rather than an agent. Present in closure with thematic weight, upper shapes-one-key-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The carnival's departure is mentioned once in the opening line ("The carnival had packed up...leaving the abandoned spaceport...") and never revisited. No time pressure, deadline, or ticking clock shapes Kaelen's choices—he "spent days mapping" and proceeds at leisure. The timeframe is setup context only, not a constraint or closure element. Removing it would not alter the plot. Ornamental, low present-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated early ("his mind buzzed with a deeper purpose: to puzzle out new equations for hope") and restated at closure ("The equations he developed spoke of sustainable systems and psychological uplift"). The motivation frames the stakes and is thematically integrated, but it is never tested by a conflicting want or cost—Kaelen pursues it without friction or trade-off. The "equations" are told outcomes rather than dramatized struggles. Present and thematically consistent but not dramatized through contradictory impulses. Mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is named three times (opening, middle, closure: "stoic wonder at the sheer scale," "stoic wonder growing," "stoic wonder settled into quiet satisfaction") and modulates from awe to calm satisfaction, tracking emotional progression. The tone is coherent and charges the final image's quiet redemption. However, it is largely told through labels rather than embodied in perception or choice under pressure, and it does not constrain an action. Present across beats and tied to closure mood, but not indispensable to the plot. Mid shapes-one-key-turn band.</comment>
