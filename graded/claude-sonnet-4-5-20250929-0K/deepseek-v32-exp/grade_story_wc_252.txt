<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are established early—guarded heart, desire for freedom—but the internal contradiction needed for high scores is largely abstract. The "combative tenderness" is told more than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The walk to the island feels more like yielding to external summons than a choice forged from contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The scrimshaw dissolving registers as poetic closure but the cost of leaving behind her life feels asserted rather than dramatically tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara steps onto the island and achieves peace—but the cost remains largely conceptual and asserted ("the world she left behind seemed to fade"). The final image of the scrimshaw dissolving is evocative but the because/therefore linkage from call to island appearance to stepping ashore feels more accumulative than causally tightened. Under a hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural, one meaningful deepening occurs but the escalation is gentle and the felt cost at closure is not sharp on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is vividly rendered as a liminal space and the sensory details—dark wet stones, glistening rocks, cool shallow water—anchor the closing beats effectively. The scrimshaw's warming and glowing provides a tactile constraint that charges the final crossing. The docks and whalebone object function as micro-setting elements that shape Elara's final choice, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, though the island itself materializes late and is more backdrop than active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's need for freedom versus her tethered life—is signaled early. However, the tightening is more atmospheric than action-driven; the whale's call intensifies but Elara does not face a forced trade-off or visible friction. The step onto the island is framed as surrender rather than a decision that narrows options with on-page cost. The Great Pacification premise (violence impossible) is intriguing but does not constrain tactics in this beat; it functions as backdrop rather than live pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the imagery of locked hearts, liminal spaces, and the whale's call rather than direct statement. The final peace and dissolution of the scrimshaw offer a resonant answer to the question of finding one's true nature. However, the "combative tenderness" motif is more announced than dramatized in the particulars, and the phrase "surrendered to her true nature" edges toward thematic summary. The ending avoids overt moralizing but the epiphany feels gently asserted rather than fully earned through prior friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable and the narrative distance is consistent. The prose has a distinct lyric texture—"fluid contrast," "guarded heart locked tight," "tender, persistent yielding"—that suits the Accumulative/Textural mode. Elara's perceptual signature (focusing on weight, rhythm, hidden grace) is present. Some diction ("combative tenderness," "melancholic song from the abyssal plain") skews elevated and slightly outside a dock worker's natural idiom, but the voice is purposeful and the modulation through the call sequence is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening. However, several lines edge toward overwriting: "a vibration that resonated in the marrow of her bones," "a wave of combative tenderness washed over her," and the repeated "guarded heart" framing. The phrase "the world she left behind seemed to fade into a distant memory" is generic summary in a pivotal beat. No major loops or artifacts, but the figurative language clusters in key moments without always adding causal pressure. Clarity and propulsion remain strong overall.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The Great Pacification premise is fresh and the sublittoral fringe as liminal threshold is specific. The scrimshaw-as-key and whale-call summons are familiar fantasy tropes executed competently but not transformed. The emotional arc—laborer discovers true calling—follows a recognizable template; the specificity of dock work and whalebone detail adds texture but the progression from call to island to peace is largely expected once the premise is established. The piece commits fully to its vision but does not surprise in its final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decision to walk toward the surf is the key turn. However, her grace is described more than it shapes on-page choices under pressure; she moves crates, then walks away. The middle beat (feeling the call, clutching the scrimshaw) shows internal response but limited tactical decision-making. The final step onto the island is more yielding than active choice. Present in setup, middle, and payoff, but causal pressure is gentle.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scrimshaw appears early (setup), is clutched and grows warm in the middle beat (development), and dissolves at closure (payoff). It functions as both literal key and symbol, and its dissolution registers cost—purpose fulfilled. However, the scrimshaw does not constrain a choice so much as accompany Elara's decision. Its properties (warming, glowing) guide but do not force her hand. Strong lyric reprise with closure linkage, but the causal necessity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The disappearing island is seeded in the opening (pirate's story), materializes in the penultimate paragraph (development via the call), and Elara steps onto it at closure (payoff). It alters her options by existing, but the island itself is more destination than active constraint on her tactics. The conceptual work—sanctuary appearing for the summoned—is present, but the island does not introduce friction or cost beyond the walk. All three gates met; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The guarded heart is named repeatedly and the unlocking metaphor is explicit ("as if the bone in her hand was a literal key turning in a hidden lock"). However, this occurs primarily in reflection rather than through dramatized micro-choices with visible cost. The unlocking is described as process ("layers...begin to unlock") but the on-page manifestation is abstract. Setup present, closure linked thematically, but the trait does not constrain an action with felt tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Detachment is framed as the story's hinge: "she knew what she must do; she must detach." The walk away from the dock is the physical enactment and it leads directly to the island crossing. However, the action is more symbolic renunciation than a beat that redefines options through friction. It is not easily swappable—detachment is thematically core—but the dramatization is gentle and the prior life's pull is asserted rather than tested on the page. All three gates, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The whale's call is seeded in the opening (pirate's story of a summons), occurs on-page as the inciting beat ("It was the call of a whale"), and intensifies to materialize the island at closure. The call shapes Elara's decision to walk and the mechanics (vibration in bones, melancholic song) are specific. It does not solve a problem it failed to create; it is the mechanism throughout. Strong setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure is present but the call functions more as external gift than earned means.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is named, defined as liminal ("neither fully land nor sea"), and used actively: Elara walks on glistening rocks, wades into cool shallow water, and the threshold is where the island appears. The setting supplies the conceptual and physical space for transformation and is essential to the closure image. Early signal, constrains the final action, and charges the ending. High integration; the exact locale matters to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The Great Pacification is mentioned in the opening as backstory (violence now impossible, conflict is words and wounded pride). It establishes world context and Elara's frustration with a "safe world," but it does not constrain her tactics in this scene. The timeframe is setup only; no middle development or payoff in the island sequence. The concept is intriguing but ornamental to this particular narrative arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's desire to find freedom and embrace her true nature is named early ("guarded heart," "deeper need to be free") and the closure delivers on it (she steps onto the island, "finally home"). The combative tenderness and the walk reflect the motivation. However, the internal friction is more asserted than dramatized through competing micro-choices under pressure. Setup, thematic closure, and moderate development via the call sequence. Cost is implied but gentle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Combative tenderness is named explicitly in the third paragraph ("a wave of combative tenderness washed over her—a fierce, protective love for this world warring with a deeper need to be free of it"). The tone modulates from the rough docks to the tender final peace. However, the phrase is more label than texture in the line-level prose, and the "combative" element is soft—no sharp conflict charges the language rhythm. Present throughout with closure link, but the tonal effect is more contemplative than charged.</comment>
