<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's telepathy with plants and her central choice are present, but her internal conflict feels asserted rather than lived. The plants' "silent, green whispers" and "telepathic gratitude" remain atmospheric labels without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final decision to play the violin lacks embodied hesitation or visible cost in the moment; the "mulberry ache" is repeated as a poetic placeholder rather than a character-specific emotional signature that degrades under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (who, where, when), and a closure unit exists: Elara plays the violin, seeds burst forth, propagation begins. However, the cost remains abstract—"what was lost and gained" is told rather than shown in a specific forfeiture or consequence. The causal chain from coffee-stain divination to violin-playing feels convenient; the violin's propagation power is introduced and resolved in quick succession without prior constraint or tactical adjustment. The lens reads as Causal-Situational Hybrid, but the decisive change lacks a legible price beyond mood.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is anchored with sensory detail (dark fabrics swallowing sound, midsummer heat, weeping ice droplets), and the ice violin's cold seeping into Elara's palms provides tactile specificity. However, the setting does not constrain a key choice; the plants and violin exist in the space without spatial choreography affecting tactics. The micro-setting (her desk, the coffee cup) returns at the end but does not alter the closure action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—propagate freedom or control—is signaled early and lands at closure. Yet the escalation is weak: Elara moves from hesitation to playing the violin without a meaningful tightening or visible trade-off. The Empire's demand is mentioned but never tests her on the page; no live antagonist pressure forces adaptation. The "perforations in her destiny" widen as a metaphor, but no concrete option is foreclosed with felt cost until the violin melts, which reads more as atmospheric dissolution than earned sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—individual dream versus empire, autonomy versus control—emerges through the violin's dual potential and is not overstated. The coffee stains, melting violin, and "mulberry ache" recur with shifting valence, and the ending offers a non-literal answer (seeds propagate, empire loses unknowingly). However, the plants' "telepathic gratitude" and Elara's "new purpose, one that required no weighing, only listening" veer toward sentiment without ambiguity; the resolution feels tidy rather than resonant with lingering cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable, and perceptual bias is present ("mulberry ache," plant whispers). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("perforated destiny," "propagate their essence") that feels imposed rather than organic to Elara's interior voice under stress. The final paragraph's "And in their whispers, Elara found a new purpose" shifts into summary-epilogue mode, reducing immediacy. No dialogue is present to evaluate, but internal voice remains consistent if somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often mixed: "perforated destiny," "mulberry ache," "seeds bursting into flight on an unseen wind," "memory of cold and sound." Several phrases loop or paraphrase: "propagate their essence" / "propagation had begun" / "propagated seeds"; "the promise had held its glow just long enough" echoes earlier "before the promise...lost its glow." Template cadence appears in the final third ("The empire would never know... but the plants would remember. And in their whispers..."). These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure beat, triggering escalated penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The combination of telepathy, ice violin, and coffee-stain divination is specific, but the emotional arc—researcher chooses dream over empire—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The violin's dual-use premise (awaken seeds or solidify power) is functional but not deeply interrogated on the page. The piece commits to its lyrical mode, yet the synthesis feels more decorative than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara, the provenance researcher, makes the key choice to play the violin, but her professional skill (authentication) does not shape tactics or constraint. Her role could be swapped for "archivist" or "curator" with minimal edits. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but causal pressure is generic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The transparent ice violin appears early (setup), is handled and described in the middle (weeping droplets, cold seeping into palms), and is played at closure, melting afterward. It drives the ending action and its crystalline notes trigger propagation. Specificity is high, and it participates in closure, but the middle beat is largely atmospheric rather than a distinct tactical constraint. Two beats plus closure linkage, strong irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Perforated destiny" is mentioned twice as a metaphor ("her own perforated destiny made every choice feel like a step through a sieve"; "the perforations in her destiny widened") but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. It remains thematic decoration without causal work. Ornamental use, no closure participation beyond mood.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elara's accidental telepathy with plants is established early, provides the plants' collective voice urging her to act, and informs her motivation to propagate. It appears in setup, middle (plants sense turmoil, urge action), and closure (telepathic gratitude). However, the trait does not impose a visible tradeoff or constrain a choice; it enables motivation but without cost. Two beats, closure linkage, but no demonstrated price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Propagate" drives the central stakes (propagate freedom or control), the middle divination ("patterns showing tangled roots and shattering ice"), and the climax (seeds bursting into flight). The action redefines options and is causally active across beats. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement (two distinct), closure linkage, and thematic integration. Not fully indispensable (could substitute "spread" with edits), but close.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Coffee-stain reading is signaled early as "her old habit," used in the middle to form a map of possibilities, and the stains return at closure ("dried into permanent patterns, a record of the future she had chosen"). Present in setup, middle, and ending. However, the method's mechanics are vague, and it does not constrain the violin choice; it serves as atmospheric divination rather than a tactical gate. Two gates, but swappable with similar oracular methods.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The velvet observatory at midsummer is anchored early with sensory detail (dark fabrics, midsummer heat, thick air). The setting provides atmosphere and houses the plants and violin, but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The "midsummer night" frames the timeframe but does not pressure tactics independently. Setup and closure presence, but minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Before the promise loses its glow" and "until dawn" frame urgency. The promise's glow dims as dawn approaches, and at closure "the promise had held its glow just long enough." Present in setup and ending, and the approaching dawn tightens the window. However, elapsed time is not tracked beat-by-beat, and no tactical adjustment occurs because of the shrinking window. Two gates, moderate tightening effect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To weigh her dream of a quiet life among whispering leaves against the needs of an expanding empire" is stated early, tested in the middle (coffee stains show tangled roots vs. ice), and resolved at closure ("she had weighed the dream against them and found it heavier"). The motivation is present across all three gates and drives the final choice. However, the dramatization leans toward assertion; the friction between dream and empire is summarized more than enacted in conflicting micro-choices. Three gates, causal role, but limited embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Mulberry ache" appears early ("a burden that settled in her chest with a mulberry ache, deep and bruise-purple"), persists through the middle, and returns at closure ("the mulberry ache remained, a sweet sorrow"; "the mulberry ache softened into a gentle hum, the color of twilight on new leaves"). Present in setup and ending with tonal consistency. However, it functions as a repeated mood label rather than modulating with pressure or charging the final image with new meaning. Static recurrence without reweighting.</comment>
