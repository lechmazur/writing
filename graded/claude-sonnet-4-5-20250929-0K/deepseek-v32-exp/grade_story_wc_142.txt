<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior shows orderly planning layered with intuition, but her dual allegiance remains declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The foundation stone chip appears as a recurring object, yet its handling doesn't reveal character under pressure beyond symbolic attachment. Micro-choices exist (selecting wall, composing symbols) but feel illustrative of her role rather than foregrounding competing loyalties with visible cost. The final "weary accomplishment" reads as summary rather than embodied contradiction that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Aqualia, Elara, pre-privatization carnival) land early. The drive lens reads Situational: corporate encroachment pressures Elara's stance, crystallized through graffiti as coded resistance. However, closure lacks a decisive change or visible cost on the page; the story ends with her walking away to "paint again tomorrow," which announces continuation rather than foreclosing a path. The final image (raft cradling foundation stone) offers thematic resonance but no legible shift in options or felt consequence—Charged Poise requires undeniable pressure reweighting the moment, and that pressure dissipates into hopeful intention rather than a cost paid now.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The carnival setting is vivid and sensory (fried dough, salt, sea spray, magenta paint on damp wall), and the raft city's aesthetic becomes a tactical shield for coded messages. Spatial choreography (outer docks, main thoroughfare, carnival alleys) remains coherent throughout. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; while the wall's dampness and carnival's chaos enable Elara's method, no environmental constraint narrows her final choice or charges the closure image with tactical cost. Sensory detail reflects her priorities (culture shock absorber scanning for surfaces) but doesn't force a micro-decision at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve communal identity against privatization—signals early and remains coherent. Elara's graffiti reorganizes resistance through encoded messages, a meaningful tightening of scattered efforts. Yet the final beat deflates pressure: she steps back with "weary accomplishment," announces tomorrow's plan, and walks away without on-page cost or trade-off. The corporate ships' approach provides situational escalation, but Elara's agency at closure reads as延续 (continuation of method) rather than a choice that forecloses an option or imposes a visible price scaled to this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—communal memory versus corporate erasure—emerges through the foundation stone chip, graffiti as survival tool, and the carnival's chaotic beauty as shield. The final image (stylized raft cradling foundation stone) offers a plea for remembrance that reweights prior material. However, the thematic answer remains stated rather than dramatized: "a quiet reorganization had begun" and "Tomorrow, she would paint again" function as authorial reassurance rather than letting the image alone charge the question. Subtext operates in the dual allegiance tension, but the ending resolves into hopeful summary rather than resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during graffiti composition, wider during crowd observation). Diction reflects her orderly intuitive mind ("methodically planning," "trusting gut feelings"), and the carnival's sensory filter stays consistent. Perceptual signature shows her scanning for surfaces and encoding messages, character-specific awareness. However, some passages drift toward expository summary ("Her dual allegiance tore at her") rather than letting perception and micro-choice enact the split. Register remains within voice, and no head-hopping occurs, supporting mid-6s placement.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high; sensory anchors (magenta paint, damp wall, sea spray) integrate smoothly. However, paraphrase loops appear: "hopeful desperation" recurs three times, "foundation stone chip" five times with similar phrasing, and the dual allegiance concept is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the middle third: "She was using…" / "She was…" / "Her dual allegiance…" / "She believed…" runs flatten momentum. Figurative language (carnival as shield, graffiti as map) remains coherent but some lines overwrite: "weary accomplishment settled over her" could be tightened. Line-level clarity holds, preventing deeper penalty, but loops and scaffold keep this in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Applying artifact penalties: paraphrase loops (−0.2), template cadence in mid-section (−0.4), and repetitive key-phrase anchors without variance (−0.2) total roughly −0.8 in Q7. Base functionality around 6.9 minus accumulation yields 6.1. The closure beat itself remains clear, so heavier penalties do not apply.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The raft-city carnival premise offers a fresh spatial constraint, and graffiti as coded resistance tool feels specific to the setting. However, the core conflict—artist using subversive art to resist gentrification—closely echoes familiar templates (street art as activism, cultural memory versus corporate takeover). Elara's dual allegiance and orderly intuitive trait are declared but not transformed through non-obvious synthesis; the ending announces continuation rather than an earned, surprising turn. Emotional specificity (hopeful desperation, weary accomplishment) trends toward stock phrasing. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the piece; the story executes competently within recognizable grooves without achieving memorable particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara (culture shock absorber) frames the narrative and her choices—scanning for surfaces, composing graffiti, walking away—drive beats. However, her role functions more as lens than as causal agent forcing key turns; the corporate arrival and privatization deadline supply pressure externally. She is present throughout and makes micro-decisions, but removing the specific occupational title "culture shock absorber" would not fundamentally break story logic. Early setup +0.6, beat involvement (two: scanning, painting) +0.9, late-middle swappability penalty −0.6, ornamental title usage −0.3. Nets around 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Foundation stone chip appears in three beats: Elara rubs it in her pocket early, feels its weight mid-graffiti, and it appears in the final painted symbol (stylized raft cradling stone). Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (final image) +0.8, charged reprise (plea for remembrance) +0.4. However, its handling remains largely internalized description; it never constrains a physical choice or imposes cost—she never must choose whether to keep, use, or sacrifice it. Swappability modest (−0.3): any founder relic could serve. Nets around 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Dual allegiance (to lifelong friends and sustainable corporate future) is declared twice but never dramatizes contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. It shapes thematic subtext but doesn't alter on-page tactics or force a trade-off choice. Present by midpoint +0.3, thematic echo only −0.6, no causal pressure −0.0, no closure participation −0.0. Swappability high (−0.6): the conflict could be reframed as single-minded resistance with minor edits. Label-only trait penalty −0.2. Nets around 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Orderly intuitive trait appears in one line ("possessed an orderly intuitive mind, methodically planning her actions while trusting the gut feelings") and subtly colors her graffiti method (geometric shapes + instinctive symbol choices). Setup present +0.4, one beat involvement +0.4, no visible cost or constraint −0.0, ornamental label-only mention −0.4, swappability moderate (−0.4): "careful and creative" could replace without structural loss. Does not participate in closure. Nets around 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Reorganize drives the plot: Elara's mission is "to reorganize the community's resistance," and her graffiti encodes meeting time/location to "reorganize scattered efforts into a unified front." Early signal +0.7, two beats (mission statement, painting instructions) +0.9, causal pressure (graffiti as map and schedule) +0.9, closure linkage (final line "a quiet reorganization had begun") +0.7. However, specificity modest—generic activist goal—and no felt cost tied directly to the act of reorganizing itself (−0.3). Nets around 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Method (messages encoded in graffiti art) is signaled early ("messages encoded in graffiti art"), demonstrated in the central beat (magenta geometric shapes hiding meeting details), and confirmed at closure ("messages were now part of the city"). Early setup +0.7, two beats (declaration, execution) +0.9, causal pressure (graffiti as survival tool and communication) +1.0, closure linkage (final image of painted raft) +0.9, specificity (magenta, geometric patterns, stylized raft) +0.5. Mechanics matter and shape her tactics. Nets around 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Perpetual carnival on raft city supplies vivid setting (lights, music, laughter, fried dough, sea spray, lashed platforms) and the carnival's aesthetic becomes a tactical shield ("turning the carnival's aesthetic into a tool for survival"). Early signal +0.7, two beats (opening atmosphere, carnival as cover) +0.9, causal constraint (chaotic beauty as shield) +0.8, micro-setting (damp wall, main thoroughfare) alters tactics +0.5, closure image (carnival plays on) +0.4. However, the raft/carnival could be replaced by any layered, chaotic urban setting with minor edits (−0.5). Nets around 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Timeframe (before privatization) is declared in the subtitle and mentioned twice ("this era, before privatization" and "privatization deadline loomed"). It provides urgency and frames stakes but does not function as a live clock altering on-page moves or narrowing choices in a specific beat. Early signal +0.5, thematic presence +0.3, no beat-level constraint −0.0, no closure tightening −0.0, swappability high (−0.6): "before the corporate takeover" serves identically. Summary-only use −0.4. Nets around 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Motivation (navigate gentrification) is declared ("task was to soften the disorienting blow of change" and "navigate the coming upheaval") and underlies the graffiti mission. Early signal +0.6, two beats (mission framing, graffiti instructions) +0.9, friction between communal loyalty and corporate future belief +0.5, no visible cost forcing a trade-off at closure −0.0. The motivation is told more than dramatized in contradictory micro-choices (−0.4), and "navigate" reads as generic activist goal, swappable (−0.4). Nets around 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tone (hopeful desperation) is named three times and operationalized through imagery: "air charged with hopeful desperation," "collective breath held," "weary accomplishment," and "hopeful desperation a steady rhythm in her chest." Present throughout +0.6, modulates with pressure (tension rising, then weary accomplishment) +0.6, charges final image ("hopeful desperation" recurs in penultimate paragraph) +0.6. However, the phrase is repeated identically rather than shown through evolving perception, reducing specificity (−0.3), and the tonal label becomes ornamental scaffold (−0.3). Nets around 6.4.</comment>
