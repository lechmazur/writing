<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The final "luminous regret" arrives as abstract philosophizing ("she wondered if it could still be called hope at all") without embodied cost or a visible foreclosure of options. The river stone functions as symbolic décor rather than constraining choice. Internal conflict is summarized ("her heart full of a beautiful, sorrowful light") instead of shown through competing wants acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (who, where, when by ~80 words). The closure unit—Elara's regret that preserving hope erased authentic pain—reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains asserted rather than demonstrated: no on-page sentence shows what path is now foreclosed or what specific choice she can no longer make. The causal chain (compare footage → identify shadow → channel hope → metamorphose shadow) follows because/therefore linkage, but the final beat substitutes thematic summary for visible consequence, weakening closure legibility under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "blooming library suspended above clouds" and "crystalline shelves" are vivid but function as backdrop; the environment does not constrain Elara's choice or alter her tactics. The river stone is handled twice (placed on console, clutched at the end) but its solidity does not block an option or charge the closure image with new meaning—it remains symbolic. Spatial choreography is clear, and the "petals of light unfolding" image is striking, yet the setting does not pressure the final decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve hope's shape—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Elara initiates the untested metamorphosis process, raising immediate risk. However, the escalation lacks visible trade-off: she completes the process without on-page cost (no stamina drain, no price paid to the library, no foreclosed capability). The final regret is told rather than demonstrated through a lost option or irreversible consequence, leaving the pressure asserted instead of felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—the cost of sanitizing pain to preserve hope—emerges from the premise but is stated outright in the final paragraph ("she wondered if it could still be called hope at all") rather than embodied in image or action. The river stone recurs but does not reweight prior material; it remains a static talisman. Subtext is thin: the "shadow unbound" as "humanity's accumulating regrets" is explained rather than implied. The ending offers philosophizing instead of a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, no head-hopping. Voice carries elevated diction ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "luminous regret") that feels consistent, though the lexicon occasionally drifts into abstraction ("metamorphose in the shadow," "tapestry of reconciled memories") without grounding in Elara's particular perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains controlled. Peak-stress moments favor declaration over compression: "she felt a profound, luminous regret wash over her" tells rather than showing the sensation through body or micro-choice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity is generally high, and rhythm varies purposefully. However, several lines loop or paraphrase: "The comparison was stark; the vibrant colors had muted, and a creeping darkness moved at the edges" recaps what was just shown. The final paragraph stacks three abstract summary sentences ("knowing that some transformations come with the cost of forgetting what made them necessary. The dusk outside deepened... She had saved hope, but in its new, perfect shape, she wondered if it could still be called hope at all") that restate the same regret without added detail or pressure. Figurative language is dense but coherent; no mixed metaphors. Information density is moderate, with some scaffolding that could be trimmed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise—dream-sharing technology eroding collective hope—echoes familiar cautionary-tech templates (Black Mirror, shared-consciousness dystopias) without a sharp transformative angle. The "shadow unbound" and "preserve the shape of hope" read as high-concept abstractions rather than grounded, particular stakes. The climax (channeling hope-essence to metamorphose the shadow) resolves via a procedure introduced on the page without prior cost or dramatized struggle, substituting metaphysical explanation for earned causality. The river stone, a "grounded reality" talisman, does not constrain or enable the key choice in a non-obvious way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara observes and initiates the metamorphosis process, but her "sharp-eyed" noticing does not drive a key turn—she acts on a decision already made off-page. Present in setup, middle (comparing footage), and closure (clutching the stone), but observation remains passive description rather than a choice that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The river stone appears in three beats: pocket mention (paragraph 1), placed on console (paragraph 4), clutched at closure (paragraph 5). Its "symbol of permanence" is told rather than shown constraining a choice. Swappable with any grounding token. The final clutch does not reweight prior material with new meaning or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"A shadow unbound" is named, explained (humanity's regrets), drives the middle comparison (distorted grey dreamscapes), and is the object of the climactic metamorphosis. It shapes stakes and tactics on the page, though its properties are abstract. Removing it would break the conflict. Closure depends on transforming it, elevating integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" is mentioned twice as adverbial phrase ("softly deliberate grace," "softly deliberate attempt") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. No moment where deliberateness forecloses speed or softness limits force. Label-only trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is the climactic action: Elara channels hope-essence to transform the shadow (paragraph 4), the shadow changes (paragraph 5), and the final regret hinges on having "sealed away" pain through that metamorphosis. Present in setup (core concept termed), middle (theorized process), and closure (completed transformation with thematic cost). Essential; removing it collapses the conflict and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Comparing silent video footage is signaled early (paragraph 2), demonstrated in paragraph 3 (pulling two clips, stark comparison), and enables Elara to identify the shadow's growth. The method matters to escalation but does not return at closure; the final act (channeling hope-essence) bypasses the footage entirely. One clear beat of use; functional but not indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "blooming library above clouds" is vivid and present throughout, but it does not constrain Elara's choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The library "blooms" with light during the metamorphosis (paragraph 4), yet this is atmospheric response rather than causal pressure. Postcard description with one responsive moment; does not shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"After dreams become shareable" frames the premise and motivates the conflict (collective unconscious eroding). Present in setup (paragraph 1) and informs the middle (decades-apart footage). However, no clock or temporal pressure tightens decisions; Elara's attempt is described as "a race against time" without on-page urgency or deadline. Swappable with any collective-tech backstory.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To preserve the shape of hope" is stated as Elara's motivation (paragraph 1), drives her nightly work (paragraph 2), and the climactic metamorphosis explicitly pursues it (paragraph 4). The final regret reweights the goal: she achieved preservation but lost truth. Told rather than dramatized through competing wants under pressure, yet the closure reprices the motivation with conceptual cost, lifting integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is named once in the final paragraph and asserted as tone ("her heart full of a beautiful, sorrowful light"). The prose carries elevated, wistful diction throughout, but emotional modulation under pressure is thin—Elara's interior remains steady until the final declaration. The ending image (stars emerge, sorrowful light) attempts to charge closure with the tone, yet it arrives as summary rather than accumulating through embodied beats.</comment>
