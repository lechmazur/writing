<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's pacifism is declared but never tested on-page; no choice forces her to enact or compromise it. Her "gravitationally lighter when happy" attribute appears twice but only as exposition and a brief physical sensation, never constraining a choice. Interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("profound sadness," "immense effort of will") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses under pressure. The closure step feels unmotivated—nothing on the page dramatizes why *now* is the moment the dimension opens beyond her wishing it so.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive quickly (steward, recycled spaceship, photographs). The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara gathers shimmer-traces and attempts to "stitch" them into a key. However, the closure—a door that simply opens after prolonged effort—lacks visible cost or a clear before/after in her options or knowledge; she steps through without forfeiture, friction, or conceptual price. The final paragraph asserts "homecoming" and "healing" but does not reweight the prior material with undeniable pressure, reading more as declarative summary than earned reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is signaled early and its "ghostly resolve" hums through the piece. Sensory detail is selective—"worn metal grating," "faded photographs," "milky quartz"—and reflects Elara's archival focus. The quarters function as micro-setting, constraining her method (photographs require sanctuary), and the ship "groans" sympathetically during her work, charging the atmosphere. However, spatial choreography beyond the quarters is vague, and the environment does not meaningfully constrain the final beat; the door opens in her room without the ship's layout or hazards shaping the attempt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through repeated attempts (holding photographs, focusing shimmer through the tear), but no on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The piece presents a single long effort rather than a tightening choice; the door resists, then yields to her "final, immense effort of will" without visible sacrifice or tactics shift. Agency reads as endurance, yet the cost of that endurance (what path is foreclosed, what price paid) remains abstract. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification would suffice, but the climax delivers assertion over dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of confronting collective human grief emerges through shadow work, photographs, and the pacifist vow. Kwan Yin's tear as compassion-catalyst and the gravitational lightness as joy-burden create layered particulars. However, the final image—"leaving the shadows behind to heal in the new light"—tips toward overt resolution and moralizing rather than resonant ambiguity. The piece invites reflection on loss and integration but does not pose a difficult question that the ending reweights non-literally; instead, it asserts homecoming and healing, reading more like a thesis statement than an earned reconfiguration of prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Elara's perceptual signature (archival, empathic, gravitationally responsive) colors narration throughout. Diction remains within her register, balancing lyric elevation ("spectral glow," "incandescent light") with concrete action. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains free-indirect coherence. However, climax diction ("profound sadness," "immense effort of will," "serene, unshakeable happiness") drifts toward abstract summary when embodied rhythm would sharpen the pressure. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph's certainty ("its purpose finally fulfilled") asserts resolution rather than letting image alone carry weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Opening and midpoint lines are vivid and purposeful. Sentence rhythm varies, though several beats rely on template structures: "She had to [verb]" appears thrice, and "Her [noun] was [noun]" recurs. Figurative language is dense—"patchwork tomb," "ghostly resolve," "tapestry of shared human experience"—without muddle, but concentration in the climax ("blazing with incandescent light," "brilliant point," "golden light") approaches overwriting without matching embodied action. No major loops or scaffold, but the final beat summarizes emotional state ("weightlessness... of spirit," "serene, unshakeable happiness") where image alone would suffice. Clarity and grammar are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—last steward opening a grief-locked dimension via shadow work—synthesizes familiar post-apocalyptic and mystical elements without a sharp, non-obvious angle. The "gravitationally lighter when happy" attribute offers a fresh physiological metaphor but remains underdeveloped on-page. Shadow work and Kwan Yin's tear carry specificity, yet the resolution (door opens to golden light, protagonist crosses threshold) follows a well-worn template: solitary journey to transcendent homecoming. Emotional honesty in confronting collective sorrow is present, but the ending's tidy satisfaction and lack of trade-off or friction reduce risk and memorable distinctness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Steadfast pacifist is introduced early and recurs as a defining trait, but no on-page choice tests or enacts it. The climax involves non-violent invitation rather than force, which aligns thematically, yet the pacifism does not constrain a competing option or create visible cost. It functions as consistent characterization without altering tactics or stakes in a dramatized beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear appears early as catalyst, is held beside photographs mid-story, and glows fiercely during the climax. It shapes two beats (holding, focusing) and participates in closure. The object is not swappable—its compassion-charge and light-focusing properties are unique. However, its mechanics (why it amplifies shimmer, how it "pulses") remain asserted rather than earned through earlier constraint or cost, capping integration below indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Shadow work is named and described: acknowledging darkness, listening to whispers, integrating rather than banishing. It shapes Elara's method across multiple beats and appears in the climax. However, it functions more as thematic framing than an on-page stake; no moment dramatizes a concrete choice between shadow-work and an alternative tactic, nor does it impose visible friction or cost. Removing the label would not break the plot; the action is "stitch," not "shadow work."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Gravitationally lighter when happy appears twice: Elara feels buoyancy when hope flickers, requiring mental anchoring, and floats at closure with "serene, unshakeable happiness." It constrains one micro-action (pushing down joy to maintain connection) but does not alter a key turn or trade-off; she crosses the threshold floating, with no consequence or cost attached. The trait is unique but underdeveloped, closer to atmospheric color than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stitch is Elara's central action: she pulls at light strands, weaves tear-trails, and stitches fragments together to create a key. The verb appears early, recurs in the climax, and directly shapes the closure (the dimension opens after the final stitch). It is irreplaceable—the entire method depends on this binding metaphor. However, the mechanics remain vague (how does will and empathy physically stitch light?), and no prior failure or constraint tests the action, preventing top-band indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Via faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs is signaled early, recurs in multiple beats (holding photos, accumulating shimmer, focusing through the tear), and participates in closure. The method is specific and shapes her attempts. However, it lacks a middle constraint—no moment where the shimmer fails or requires adjustment—and the final focus ("accumulated shimmer from a dozen photographs") is summarized rather than dramatized with visible mechanics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Recycled spaceship is introduced immediately and provides atmosphere (worn grating, ghostly resolve, groaning hull). It houses Elara's quarters and contextualizes her mission as last steward. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the climax occurs in her room without the ship's layout, resources, or hazards mattering. At closure, she "did not look back," erasing its presence. The setting is consistent and atmospheric but swappable with any isolated post-human archive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>After the last human is born is stated early and frames the story's elegiac stakes. However, it functions as static backstory; no on-page time pressure or deadline tightens Elara's choices. The timeframe does not progress or constrain—her work proceeds at an untracked pace, and the climax arrives when she wills it, not because time runs out. It enriches context but does not shape tactics or turns.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>To push open a locked dimension is Elara's explicit, singular motivation, signaled early and pursued across all beats. Her attempts (holding photos, focusing shimmer, stitching fragments) are goal-driven. The dimension's resistance and her "final, immense effort" dramatize friction. However, the motivation is not conflicted—no want versus need or competing desire creates on-page tension—and the closure grants her wish without visible trade-off, limiting the felt cost that would elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Ghostly resolve is introduced early ("the ship... hummed with the ghostly resolve of her mission") and sustained through Elara's patient, unwavering shadow work. Tone is coherent—somber, elegiac, determined—and modulates slightly at closure with "serene, unshakeable happiness." The phrase recurs once more in the final paragraph, charging the threshold crossing. However, the tone does not tension or deepen under pressure; it remains a single static mood (quiet determination) that describes rather than dramatizes stakes, trending mid-band.</comment>
