<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to defy conformity is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The piece tells us she's moved by "defiance" and collects echoes, but we never witness an internal struggle between safety and liberation that would earn the transformation. The final state—"a woman composed of her own choices"—arrives as assertion rather than visible cost; no prior comfort or relationship is forfeited on the page. Interiority leans heavily on abstract poetry ("bodily poetic grace," "symphony of defiance") instead of character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear goal (unlock the sanctuary) and delivers an on-page Decisive Change (she steps back transformed), but causality is thin: untangling threads releases chimes and voices, then the sanctuary simply "materializes" without meaningful resistance or cost-bearing choice. The escalation from kneeling to tracing to pulling a final thread reads as procedural steps rather than because/therefore pressure. Orientation is prompt (courtyard, Elara, tonight) but the mechanics of the prism sanctuary remain metaphorical convenience rather than earned discovery. Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural, as the piece accumulates echoes and images toward a final reconfiguration, but the reconfiguration lacks felt cost—no on-page price paid for defiance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The silver courtyard under snow is established early and returns at closure, and the snowfall and starlight charge several beats. Spatial anchors are clear (courtyard, kneeling, frozen ground), and the final image—"silver courtyard lay behind her, silent and serene, but forever altered"—attempts to charge the setting with consequence. However, the environment never constrains a tactic or forces a trade-off; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (defy conformity, unlock sanctuary) is signaled early, but no meaningful tightening occurs: Elara encounters no resistance, makes no trade-off, and the final thread "gives way" without cost. The "alarming serenity" is declared rather than felt as pressure, and the "lullaby of conformity" fades passively rather than through agency. Agency is present (she pulls the thread) but the action does not foreclose a live option or reveal a price—transformation is awarded, not earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (defiance of conformity) is overtly stated rather than emerging from particulars: "defiance," "conformity," "lullaby," "revolution" are labeled repeatedly. The final image—"her story now her own to write"—is a direct thematic assertion rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The echoes of past courtesans could have charged the theme, but they remain abstract "voices" without specific regrets or wisdom that complicate Elara's choice. The piece gestures toward complexity (cost vs. reward, ruin vs. revelation) but resolves into tidy liberation without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, but the narrative voice drifts into elevated, prompt-like register ("bodily poetic grace," "choreography of will and intuition," "the poetry of her being") that does not read as Elara's lived perception. Perceptual signature is generic: she "feels" and "understands" in abstract terms rather than noticing through character-specific bias. No dialogue present. Diction remains consistently lyric but lacks the grit or idiosyncrasy that would anchor voice to this particular courtesan in this particular moment of crisis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dense figurative language in nearly every sentence ("pale ghosts," "spectral threads," "constellation of lost voices," "shimmering nexus of light and sound") without pattern-teaching or payoff, violating the overwriting density threshold. Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "her existence was a performance" / "her story now her own to write"; "defiance" / "defiant" / "defying" recycled across beats. Template cadence runs: "It was said to be… Her motivation was… Her goal was… The method… The harvest…" Synonym churn: "chaste," "serene," "alarming serenity," "oppressive silence." Filter-verb stack in the final third: "she understood," "she could feel," "she had come," "she began." Artifacts touch closure ("her story now her own to write"), triggering −1.7 baseline plus disallow-9+ globally and 8.8 cap per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—courtesan defying conformity through a mystical ritual—closely matches widely used fantasy templates (oppressed woman discovers hidden power, transforms through symbolic action). The prism sanctuary and "untangling threads" read as ornamental metaphor rather than specific world logic with trade-offs. No lived detail transforms the template: we learn nothing of her daily role, the citadel's rules, or what she risks by leaving. The final image—"her story now her own to write"—is a stock empowerment phrase. Derivative premise without transformation: −1.0 adjustment in Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes one decisive action (pulling the final thread), but "chaste courtesan" functions as background label only—her chastity never constrains a tactic or creates friction. She observes, kneels, traces, pulls; no choice that alters tactics under competing pressure. Swappable with "defiant sorceress" or "rebel priestess" with minor edits. Present after 40%: no. Middle development: gesture only. Closure: participates as actor but the trait "chaste courtesan" does not. Cap 3.8 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is seeded early ("she had come to the courtyard… to find the prism sanctuary"), developed in the middle (it "began to materialize"), and present at closure ("opened fully"). It appears in three beats and its "refracted starlight" charges the ending image. However, it is never handled or used—it materializes passively rather than through Elara's interaction with a physical object. The "sanctuary" functions as metaphorical destination rather than object with evolving states. Setup + development + closure gates met, but causal pressure weak (it appears rather than being unlocked through cost). 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Harvest of echoes" is named early ("to harvest the echoes was to gather these fragments") and structures the middle action (collecting echoes of past courtesans). It shapes the method (untangling threads releases echoes) and the ending integrates them ("the chorus of echoes she now carried within"). Present in all three gates; however, the concept remains metaphorical—what does it cost to harvest? What does she forfeit by collecting voices? The echoes empower her without trade-off, reducing causal pressure. One key turn shaped, but swappable with "absorb wisdom" or "gather strength." 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" appears twice as label ("bodily poetic grace," "her body became the instrument of this poetry") but never constrains or enables an action with cost. It describes her movement in abstract terms without showing how this trait differs from ordinary grace or why it matters to unlocking the sanctuary. Label-only, no on-page consequence. −0.3 for label-only. 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unlock" is the stated goal, signaled early ("Her goal was to unlock the sanctuary's secret"), attempted in the middle (untangling threads), and completed at closure ("The prism sanctuary opened fully"). It drives at least two beats (the untangling process and the final thread pull) and the ending depends on it. However, the unlock is not dramatized as a high-cost choice—she pulls, it gives way, the sanctuary opens—reducing irreplaceability. Setup + development + payoff, two beats, closure linkage. 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"By untangling threads" is seeded early ("by untangling the threads of perception"), executed in the middle ("she began the delicate work of untangling"), and completed at closure ("the final thread… give way, unraveling into a cascade of light"). It shapes the method across multiple beats and the final action hinges on pulling the last thread. However, the mechanics remain vague metaphor—what does it mean to "untangle threads of perception"? How does tracing a pattern on snow accomplish this? Method present but not grounded in specific cost or constraint. 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The silver courtyard under snow is established in the opening line, used throughout (she kneels in the snow, traces the frozen ground), and returned at closure ("The silver courtyard lay behind her"). It provides spatial anchor and sensory texture, and the final image reweights it ("forever altered by the harvest it had witnessed"). Setup + development + payoff gates met; lyric reprise that charges the ending. However, the setting never constrains a choice—she could perform this ritual anywhere. 6.3 for purposeful reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Between sigh and smile" appears as metaphor ("Between the sigh of resignation she had left behind and the smile of liberation she hoped to find, this moment hung suspended" and "In that space between a sigh and a smile, she understood"). It frames the emotional arc but does not function as a ticking clock or time constraint that alters tactics. No urgency, no deadline pressure. Ornamental framing, not causal. 2.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To defy the lullaby of conformity" is stated as motivation early ("to defy the lullaby, to shatter the serene surface") and referenced throughout ("the lullaby of conformity grew fainter," "its power broken"). It shapes the dominant stake and appears in the closure beat ("The lullaby was now a distant murmur"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses—no scene shows her torn between safety and risk. The "lullaby" remains abstract symbol rather than specific social pressure with a name or face. Functional across beats, told-only friction. 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Alarming serenity" is named repeatedly ("alarming serenity," "a place of alarming serenity," "The alarming serenity of the courtyard") and appears in the final third, but it functions as repeated label rather than modulating tone. The prose remains consistently elevated and lyric throughout; no tonal shift under pressure, no charge at the final image beyond restating the phrase. Present setup + payoff, but static mood without pressure modulation. Cap 4.6 for late arrival (final third naming) and ornamental repetition.</comment>
