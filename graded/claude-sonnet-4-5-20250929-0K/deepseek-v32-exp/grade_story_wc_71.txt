<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand alive vs. inert houses is declared but not embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her interior remains abstractly poetic ("hushed blaze within her," "quest") rather than character-particular; no visceral contradiction drives the sanctification scene. The cottage awakening reads as convenient vindication rather than earned through prior struggle or foreclosed paths. Backstory reflection exceeds 30% without anchoring to present micro-choices that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after multiple paragraphs of abstract description, violating the ~120-word anchor test (−0.4). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (discovery that displaced objects sanctify), but the cost is asserted rather than legible: Elara's "light heart" and confident continuation suggest no foreclosed path or felt price. The accumulative lens is chosen but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the orris root "remains" as a label, not a charged cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The quiet bay, cherry blossoms, cobblestone streets, and rusty gate provide sensory anchoring, but remain postcard descriptors that do not constrain choice. The orris root shard on the gate latch is the sole moment where setting detail (the latch) supplies a micro-constraint for the displaced-object method, narrowly satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Otherwise, the cottage interior and bay function as backdrop without altering tactics or charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elara places the orris root and the cottage immediately "wakes"; no resistance, cost, or turn appears. The resolution is delivered to her rather than earned through agency that forecloses a path. The displacement method succeeds on first attempt without complication, flattening escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the displaced-objects pattern and creeping-normality observations, avoiding overt statement until the penultimate line ("honor the inadvertently profound nature of her discoveries"). The final image of Elara walking with "quiet fire of purpose" offers no non-literal answer or resonant ambiguity; it summarizes intent rather than reweighting prior material. The orris root and "shard of hush" recur but remain ornamental rather than charging closure with earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable, no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated ("hushed blaze," "inadvertently profound") and voice-motivated, though it flirts with stock lyricism ("pink snow," "daydreaming glow"). The perceptual signature is poetic but generic; Elara's noticing lacks character-specific bias. Dialogue is absent, so no voice-distinction test applies. Under peak moments (cottage entry), syntax remains uniform without compression or rhythm shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear: "hushed blaze" recurs three times without evolving meaning; "inadvertently profound" and "displaced objects" are restated across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("pink snow," "daydream," "quiet fire") cluster in peak beats without transformation (−0.4). The orris-root explanation is told rather than dramatized, and "She realized" / "She knew" scaffold sentences dull momentum (−0.3). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("she knew," "the night embraced her"), triggering the final-third disallow-9+ rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The core premise—houses awakened by displaced objects—echoes common magical-realism and animism templates without a fresh angle grounded in specific world logic or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8). The orris-root fragment and "creeping normality" labels read as prompt-compliance tokens rather than inevitable synthesis. The cottage's immediate responsiveness avoids risk; no failed attempt or complication tests the method's limits. Emotional specificity (Elara's "light heart") is generic rather than lived-in particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara as creeping-normality noticer is signaled early (bay shoreline, oak tree) and frames her worldview, satisfying setup. The trait enables her to perceive gradual house vitality loss (middle development). However, at the closure beat she does not make a new observation-based choice; she summarizes past pattern recognition without on-page decision that alters tactics. Functional but the trait does not drive a turn with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The orris root shard is introduced early, handled on the rusty gate (beat 1), and its grounding scent is described as catalyst (beat 2). It appears in the final paragraph ("would remain") as permanent displacement, satisfying all three gates. It enables the sanctification action and is irreplaceable due to its perfumery fixative property. However, the ending cameo is passive label rather than causal force; the shard does not visibly reweight or impose cost at closure, capping score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>A shard of hush appears as metaphor ("shard of hush descended," "core of it all") but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics; Elara does not manipulate, pursue, or wrestle with "hush" as a legible force. The concept is echoed thematically without constraining choice. Present and logically consistent but swappable with other abstract mood labels, satisfying functional but replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" is declared twice as a label (paragraph 15, 27) but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. Elara's discovery is intentional, not inadvertent; the attribute does not create friction or tradeoff. Ornamental mention without causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sanctify is the verb of the core action: Elara sanctifies the cottage by placing the orris root. This action frames the middle beat and is summarized at closure ("had sanctified the cottage"). However, the sanctification succeeds immediately without complication or cost, and could be swapped for "restore" or "awaken" with minor edits. Present across setup, middle, and ending but lacks specificity that makes it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Through displaced objects is signaled early ("displaced objects, she aimed to sanctify"), demonstrated in the rusty-gate beat (middle), and restated at closure ("every displaced object held a story"). The method shapes the sanctification tactic and is irreplaceable; without displacement, the logic fails. However, the mechanics are told rather than tested—no failed displacement or adaptive attempt appears—limiting causal pressure to a single successful beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring is anchored early with cherry blossoms, salt scent, cobblestone streets. The bay frames the opening and closing, satisfying setup and closure participation. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The cottage's rusty gate provides a micro-constraint for the displacement, lifting the score into functional range but not essentiality.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>While the streetlights daydream appears as recurring motif (paragraphs 4, 12, 30) but does not tighten decisions or impose a time constraint. The timeframe is descriptive mood rather than a live clock that alters tactics. Present in setup and closure but ornamental; easily removable without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>To understand why some houses feel alive is stated early and frames Elara's quest, satisfying setup. The discovery at closure answers this motivation. However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost; Elara's single successful attempt grants immediate satisfaction without friction between want and obstacle. Functional causal role but lacks dramatized tension or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Hushed blaze is introduced as "hushed blaze" (streetlights), "shard of hush," and "hushed blaze within her." The tone is consistent—reverent, quiet intensity—across setup and closure. However, it does not modulate with pressure; the tone remains uniformly lyrical without cadence shift at the sanctification beat. Present and coherent but static, trending mid-functional band.</comment>
