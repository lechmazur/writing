<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to teach the encroaching darkness the value of stars") but never tested by a conflicting impulse or cost on the page. Her actions—adjusting shutters, angling a mirror—proceed without friction, mistake, or trade-off; the child's spirit softens offstage with no dramatized resistance. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels: "spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "silent empathy" repeat without embodied contradiction or specific sensory grounding. The final release ("a release of tension that left only a profound, spiraling calm") summarizes emotional change rather than showing a micro-choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece presents a Resonant Reconfiguration—the child's fear softens and the darkness "learns to cherish the stars"—but the cost is asserted, not shown: no on-page sentence reveals what Elara or the spirit forfeited. Causality is weak: the spirit's transformation follows directly from Elara's light-weaving without a reversal, complication, or moment when her method fails. The Orientation Test is satisfied (who/where/when anchor by the opening lines), and the accumulative lens is held, but the closure beat lacks the felt price required for credible Charged Poise. The final image ("the patterns remained, a testament to the calm") restates theme without reweighting prior material through a concrete action or choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rain-washed air, and warehouse shutters are vividly rendered and return at closure, but they do not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The dental mirror catches light, yet its physical properties (angle, reflection mechanics) never limit what she can do or force an adaptation. Sensory detail is selective—metallic sheen, black mirror water, muted grays—but remains postcard-descriptive; no environmental friction (a stuck shutter, a gust extinguishing reflected light) complicates the weaving. The setting charges the final image atmospherically but does not supply a resource or obstacle that affects outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the child's spirit—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens: Elara adjusts shutters and the spirit responds passively, with no reversal or moment when her method fails. No on-page cost or trade-off accompanies the resolution; the "release of tension" is summary, not a dramatized forfeiture. The piece operates under an accumulative lens, yet lacks the single meaningful deepening or pattern-break that would narrow options or raise felt stakes. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency; the spirit's shift occurs offstage without a visible trigger tied to Elara's choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme—light as memory, hope drawn from darkness—emerges through recurring star-pattern imagery and the final assertion that "darkness itself learned to cherish the stars." However, the child's shift is told rather than shown, and the ending supplies a direct thematic statement ("the value of stars now a living truth") instead of letting the image speak. The dental mirror and shutters constrain the protagonist's method but do not carry thematic irony or a non-obvious cost; the patterns function as straightforward symbols without contradiction. The half-spoken secret hovers as atmospheric texture but never crystallizes into a choice or revelation that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, but register drifts into elevated diction ("spiralingly calm," "profound, spiraling calm," "within the edge of a half-spoken secret") that sits uneasily with concrete action. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara notices light and water, but her way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. Repeated participial openers ("Her work existed," "Her silent empathy flowed," "She wove," "She adjusted," "She knew") create template cadence across high-pressure beats. The phrase "spiralingly calm" appears three times without modulation, flattening voice under stress. No dialogue is present; internal voice reads as committee consensus rather than an individual mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "spiralingly calm" / "stillwater tension" / "profound, spiraling calm" recycle the same abstract concept; "silent empathy" / "silent language" / "silent, empathetic play" repeat without added detail. Template cadence runs across multiple beats: "Her work existed… Her motivation was clear… Her silent empathy flowed… She adjusted… She knew…" Stock metaphors cluster in the final third: "weave hope into the fabric of the secret," "theater for this silent, empathetic play," "learned to cherish the stars." The dental mirror "became her conduit, reflecting not just light, but understanding" blurs vehicle and tenor. Figurative density in the closure paragraphs—"woven hope," "living truth," "testament to the calm"—obscures concrete action. Apply −1.4 for patterned artifacts touching closure; disallow 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—guardian uses reflected light to console a drowned spirit—is vivid but relies on familiar ghost-consolation and symbolic-light templates without a transformative twist. The dental mirror is a fresh prop choice, yet its use (angling light through shutters) does not impose a non-obvious constraint or tactical problem. The resolution follows a predictable arc: patterns cast, spirit responds, darkness learns. No risk-taking in structure, voice, or moral calculus; the story avoids ambiguity and delivers the thematic lesson ("value of stars") explicitly in the final paragraphs. Specificity in the cobalt dock and warehouse setting provides texture but does not alter the emotional template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her weaving drives all beats, but her decisions lack cost or friction. She adjusts shutters and the spirit responds; no choice narrows options or trades one good for another. The role of "silent canal guardian" is label-only; her guardianship manifests as patient activity without a moment when duty conflicts with another desire. She appears in the closure image ("her task complete") but as observer, not agent of a final turn. Functional but replaceable; observation without decision pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dental mirror is introduced early, handled in at least three beats (initial description, directing light through a shutter, catching the streetlamp glow), and returns at closure ("She lowered the mirror, her task complete"). Its mechanics—reflecting and angling light—enable the weaving, giving it causal involvement. However, its specific properties (small size, dental purpose repurposed) never constrain a choice or force an adaptation; a shard of glass or any reflective surface could substitute with minor edits. Present across setup, development, and payoff, but swappable; scores mid-band for beat involvement without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Silent empathy" is asserted repeatedly ("Her silent empathy flowed," "silent empathy between guardian and lost soul," "silent, empathetic play") but functions as thematic label rather than on-page tactic. No scene shows Elara choosing silence over speech with a cost, or her empathy enabling a move another approach would not. The concept echoes in closure ("teaching without a sound") yet does not shape a decision or narrow options. Present but ornamental; told, not dramatized as a constraint or method that alters stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" appears three times as descriptor ("spiralingly calm as the deep, slow currents," "Her spiralingly calm demeanor deepened," "a profound, spiraling calm in its wake") but never enables or constrains an action. No beat shows calmness costing her speed, preventing an emotional appeal, or allowing precision another state would not. The trait is label-only; removing it would not alter plot or closure. Cap at 2.8 for missing development and closure participation gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Weave" is signaled early ("she began to weave, not thread, but light and shadow"), structures the middle beats (forming constellation patterns), and charges the final image ("she had woven hope into the fabric of the secret"). The action is central to method and closure, giving it strong causal presence. However, the verb is generic enough that "cast," "draw," or "paint" could substitute with minimal rewrite; the specificity of weaving (interlacing, constraint from warp/weft) is not exploited. Present across all three gates with beat involvement and closure linkage, but moderate swappability prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Creating patterns with shutters is introduced early ("her method focused on creating patterns with the shutters"), executed in multiple beats (opening/closing slats, forming Weaver and Lyra shapes), and mentioned at closure ("The shutters, now still, had served their purpose"). The mechanics—each slat casts a stripe or dot—enable the constellation mimicry and supply the causal means. Specificity is moderate; shutters as adjustable light-blockers fit the warehouse setting and cannot easily swap for, say, a projector. Present across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure; beat involvement and closure participation justify mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The cobalt dock is vividly described (metallic sheen, rain-washed air) and returns in the final paragraph ("The cobalt dock returned to its quiet state"), but it does not constrain Elara's actions or supply a resource that alters her tactics. The water's reflective surface enables the patterns, yet any dark, still water would serve equally. No friction from the dock itself (unstable footing, poor angle, tidal change) complicates the weaving. Present at setup and closure with atmospheric charge, but swappable; postcard function without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" is invoked four times as atmospheric frame but never functions as a time constraint. No clock tightens Elara's moves; no before/after urgency tied to this phrase. The "secret" (the canal guards more than water, a lost child's fear) is thematic texture, not a deadline or window that alters tactics. The phrase appears in the opening and closure paragraphs but does not shape choices or escalate pressure. Ornamental; cap at 2.8 for missing development and closure participation, further reduced to 1.8 for vagueness and lack of temporal function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To teach darkness the value of stars" is stated in the opening ("Tonight, her motivation was clear") and restated at closure ("the value of stars now a living truth in the heart of the darkness"). The desire drives the light-weaving across all beats, giving it structural presence. However, no on-page friction tests this want against a conflicting need or cost; Elara never risks, sacrifices, or doubts. The motivation is told, not dramatized through a choice that forecloses an alternative path. Present at setup and payoff with thematic linkage, but lacks the conflict or visible price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is named twice ("She moved with a stillwater tension," "The stillwater tension held") and the tone of held quiet under pressure is sustained across the piece. Modulation occurs: initial calm, growing focus, release at closure. The tone charges the final image ("that stillwater moment") and coheres with the accumulative lens. However, the phrase itself is abstract and the tonal shift is subtle; removing the label would not break the atmospheric arc. Present across beats and ending with coherent modulation; lyric reprise and closure linkage justify mid-5s for resonance without strong causal necessity.</comment>
