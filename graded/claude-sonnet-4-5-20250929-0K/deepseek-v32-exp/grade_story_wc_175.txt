<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear—to honor overlooked histories—but his choices feel contemplative rather than pressured. The act of building the arch and tying the moth wing reads as ritual observation; no contradictory impulses or visible cost complicates the decision. Interiority leans toward stock phrasing ("heart ached," "tears pricking his eyes") rather than embodied emotion. The final act of releasing the wing arrives without a dramatized tradeoff that would foreclose a path with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elian prepares, builds, waits, witnesses, releases. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he completes his homage and descends—but the cost remains abstract ("transiently rooted no more"). The orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. One meaningful deepening occurs when the butterfly brushes the moth wing, reweighting the gesture, but the change in options or stance is faint; the piece accumulates atmosphere more than it tightens choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The verdant grotto is vividly rendered with moss, stone, mist, and cloud proximity. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Elian's reverence. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as a stage for contemplation rather than a pressure point. The moth wing and arch function as micro-setting objects, but their handling is ritualistic rather than choice-forcing, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring the last monarch's migration—is signaled early but remains external to Elian's agency. He waits, witnesses, and releases; coincidence (the butterfly's arrival) completes the event. No on-page reversal narrows his options or forces a trade-off; the structure is built without friction, and the butterfly's brush is atmospheric rather than a decision point. Pressure does not escalate under the Accumulative lens; it accumulates description and holds still.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—loss, remembrance, and transience—emerges through the moth wing, the last monarch, and Elian's temporary structure. The final image of releasing the wing carries quiet resonance, reweighting the homage with a gesture of letting go. However, the piece edges toward stated theme ("interrupted cadence," "transiently rooted," "blushing stillness") rather than letting particulars do the work. The ending offers a non-literal answer but the conceptual cost is implied rather than undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elian's perception. Diction is elevated and consistent ("verdant grotto," "esoteric realism"), though at peak beats the register risks ornament over immediacy. Phrases like "blushing stillness" and "knot this wing into a temporary signal" are striking but occasionally drift into poetic abstraction. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled. Voice is distinct but prioritizes lyric texture over urgency under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentences open diversely. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere more than dual function. "Blushing stillness" recurs, and "transiently rooted" is repeated verbatim, bordering on scaffold. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "He intended," "He began," "He tied," "He recalled"—a run of subject-verb stems that flattens propulsion. Mixed metaphor in "knot this wing into a temporary signal" (knot ≠ signal) briefly muddles sense. No major loops, but figurative density in non-peak beats (e.g., "time's relentless march," "great rhythm") leans stock.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—a collector witnessing the last monarch in a sky grotto—offers a fresh spatial frame, but the emotional arc (solitary witness performs ritual homage) follows a familiar template. Elian's esoteric realism and temporary structures provide specific vocabulary, yet the core beat (observe, honor, release) is predictable. The moth wing as relic and the knotting gesture add texture but do not transform the expected path. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the story prioritizes lyric atmosphere over narrative surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and his choices (building the arch, tying the wing, releasing it) structure the beats. However, these are ritual actions rather than pressured decisions that narrow options. He observes and honors; no turn traces to a choice that alters stakes or forecloses a path with cost. Functional but replaceable; another contemplative witness could perform the same beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The moth wing is handled in three beats: held at the start, tied to the arch mid-scene, and released at the end. Its meaning evolves from "relic" to "key" to "signal" to released offering. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the wing does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost; it is a charged symbol that Elian uses ritually. Its presence shapes atmosphere more than tactics, placing it in the high-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" is named early ("the interrupted cadence of natural cycles") and echoed at closure ("The interrupted cadence of life"). It frames theme but does not shape on-page stakes or alter options. The concept is told rather than dramatized through choice or friction. Functional label, swappable with "broken rhythm" or similar phrasing, without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" appears twice as a label: "Elian felt transiently rooted here" and "transiently rooted no more" at the end. It describes his stance but does not constrain an action or create a visible tradeoff. The trait is ornamental, reflecting theme without enabling or foreclosing a choice. Present but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The knot appears in one key beat: Elian ties the moth wing to the arch's apex with a vine, and later unties it to release the wing. The action is ritualistic and frames the homage, but it does not drive a turn or redefine options. Setup and payoff are present; the knot charges the gesture symbolically. However, it is easily swappable (a clasp, a thread) without altering story logic, capping the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Building temporary structures as signals" is stated as Elian's method early and enacted when he builds the arch. The method shapes his approach and is visible on the page. However, the mechanics do not create friction or a cost; he gathers twigs and petals without difficulty, and the structure stands without testing his skill or resources. Functional but not stressed under pressure, placing it in the functional-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The verdant grotto is described early (moss, stone, clouds, isolation) and provides a vantage for the butterfly's arrival. It anchors the scene spatially and tonally. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elian builds and waits unimpeded. The grotto is purposeful for atmosphere and proximity to the migration path, but it does not impose a resource limit or obstacle. One causal role (enables witnessing), but swappable with another elevated, isolated site.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The timeframe—"during the migration of the last monarch butterfly"—is signaled early and structures the narrative clock: Elian prepares, waits an hour, then the butterfly arrives. The migration creates urgency and a live deadline. However, the wait is passive; no tightening occurs as time passes, and the butterfly's arrival is coincidental rather than a result of Elian's agency. The timeframe shapes expectation and pays off at closure, meeting setup and payoff gates, but does not force a mid-scene choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elian's motivation—to honor overlooked histories—is stated early and frames every action: collecting the moth wing, building the arch, waiting for the butterfly. It is consistent and drives his ritual. However, the motivation is not tested by friction or cost on the page; no competing desire complicates his choice. It is told ("His motivation was pure") more than dramatized through a tradeoff. Functional and integral to his character, but static across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Blushing stillness" is named twice: "The air held a blushing stillness" early and "carrying the blushing stillness within him" at the end. The tone is consistent—reverent, quiet, elegiac—and modulates slightly when the butterfly appears ("tears pricking his eyes"). However, the tone does not charge the final image with new pressure or cost; it remains atmospheric. The phrase is evocative but functions as a label rather than a lived modulation under stress.</comment>
