<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to explore ethical storytelling is stated repeatedly but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. Internal conflict is summarized rather than dramatized—she "contemplates," "realizes," "decides" in exposition without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The micro-choice to "reverse" her approach is explained but not earned through on-page pressure; Marco's threat vanishes without forcing a trade-off. Therapy-speak ("half-lit epiphanies," "introspection," "inner resolve") replaces embodied emotion at every turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No decisive change occurs on the page; the piece ends with Elara packing materials and walking out with "peace" already achieved in reflection. The argument with Marco is backstory; the dome scene is static contemplation punctuated by summary intentions ("she would return," "she planned"). Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when emerge gradually across the first third without urgency, though the disorientation does not pay off at closure (−0.4). The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) is undercut by the absence of a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; the ending asserts readiness without on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dome is vividly sketched ("vast, curved structure," "metallic skin," "acoustic oddities") and recurs throughout, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental feature alters Elara's choices or tactics. The campfire story stick is handled multiple times and charges the final packing image, lifting the score slightly. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV ("grain," "ink pots," "stars visible through cracks"), though the setting never pressures a decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to respond to Marco's threat—is signaled early but never escalates; Elara resolves it internally without on-page cost or reversal. The "reversal" is announced as a shift from despair-to-hope but not dramatized in a beat where options narrow. No tightening occurs; she moves from upset to serene in unbroken summary. Agency is renunciation of defiance, but the choice forecloses no live option because Marco's threat is never re-engaged on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme (ethical storytelling, balance, complexity) is stated explicitly in multiple passages rather than emerging from dramatized events: "ethical storytelling, she realized, wasn't just about subversion but about honoring complexity." The campfire stick and puppet motifs recur but do not shift meaning at closure—they symbolize continuity without tension. The final image ("quiet victory," "mission refined") summarizes rather than offering a non-literal resonant answer. Thematic echo in the final third ("Ethical storytelling demanded nothing less") reads as prompt language, triggering a deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and carries an elevated, essayistic register ("urbane elegance," "kinship with past storytellers") that remains stable throughout. POV is clean single third-person with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (calligraphy tools, puppet movements) but does not degrade under stress—Elara's serenity never wavers, flattening interiority. Filter verbs ("felt," "recalled," "saw") cluster in several beats, dulling immediacy slightly. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade adjacent sentences: "The dome's interior… filled with her calligraphy scrolls" / "She moved to a small table"; "She decided to reverse" / "This shift felt radical"; "As she worked, the meteor hush deepened" / "She recalled how half-lit epiphanies often emerged." Template cadence runs dominate: "She [verb]" opens six consecutive sentences in the second half. Stock metaphors ("rising from ashes," "faint stars in a polluted sky") and prompt-phrase repetition ("half-lit epiphanies," "meteor hush," "uncommonly serene") recur without variation. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("her story was still being written"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 (−1.2 baseline in Q7, escalated to −1.7 for closure presence).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Core premise—artist contemplates how to respond to censorship via introspection—is a widely used template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−1.0 for derivative premise). The "reversal" is announced but generic: starting with hope instead of despair could apply to any narrative form. "Urbane calligrapher," "decommissioned radar dome," and "campfire story stick" are vivid details, yet the emotional arc (upset → serene resolution via reflection) would work unchanged with different objects and setting. No fresh inflection grows from prior particulars; the ending restates the opening intention without surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (to reverse her approach, to return to Marco's bar) are stated, but these decisions are reached via off-page reflection rather than on-page pressure. No choice alters tactics in scene; she packs and leaves with resolve intact. Present in setup, middle summary, and ending but ornamental—her role could be filled by any reflective artist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The campfire story stick appears in at least four beats: Elara clutches it after the argument, sets it beside ink pots, uses it to guide puppet movements, and it lies across the scroll in the final image. Its tactile and symbolic use is consistent (link to oral traditions, bridge not weapon), and it charges the packing beat. However, it does not constrain a choice or narrow options; its presence is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" is invoked four times as a thematic label ("half-lit epiphanies began to surface," "half-lit epiphanies would continue to guide her," "half-lit epiphanies bloomed in her mind") but never dramatized—no specific realization alters tactics or forecloses an option on the page. The concept frames expectation but remains decorative.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" is mentioned three times (opening, midpoint, final paragraph) but functions only as a character label. The attribute does not constrain action or create visible cost—Elara's serenity is unshaken throughout, preventing internal conflict. Label-only without tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reverse" is invoked repeatedly as Elara's decision to invert her narrative arc (despair-to-hope instead of hope-to-despair) and appears in the title of her new approach. However, the reversal is announced rather than enacted in a turn that redefines options; she could "adjust" or "refine" her method with identical plot effect. Present in setup (contemplation), middle (decision), and ending (resolve), but swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars are mentioned in the opening, recalled in the argument with Marco, and frame Elara's planned return. The method shapes her motivation and is signaled early, but its mechanics never appear on the page—no puppet is moved, no audience reaction is shown in present action. The piece recounts past shows and future intentions without dramatizing the method in scene.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is the story's sole location and recurs in nearly every paragraph (acoustic oddities, metallic skin, stars through cracks). It provides refuge and frames Elara's reflection, and the final paragraph positions it as "anchor in the chaos." However, the dome does not pressure choices or supply a resource that alters outcome—any quiet studio would serve the same function. Present in setup, middle, and ending; purposeful but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—hush after the argument—is signaled in the opening and the dome scene unfolds in its aftermath. However, time is untracked and does not tighten decisions; the narrative moves in unbroken contemplation from argument recall to packing without urgency or deadline. The hush is atmospheric rather than a live constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to explore ethical storytelling is stated in the opening, drives her reflection throughout, and reappears in the final paragraph ("Ethical storytelling demanded nothing less"). However, it is never dramatized in a choice with friction or cost—she contemplates balance and complexity in summary without testing competing goods on the page. Told and recurrent but not conflicted in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" recurs as both the dome's atmosphere and the story's tonal descriptor (opening, midpoint reflection, ending approval). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly from upset recall to creative fervor to peace, supporting the accumulative design. However, the hush remains a static mood rather than charging the final image with undeniable pressure; it wraps rather than reweights. Present across beats and ending but does not deepen cost.</comment>
