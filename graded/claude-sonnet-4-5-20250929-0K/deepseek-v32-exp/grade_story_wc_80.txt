<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is stated but never faces meaningful internal contradiction or on-page trade-off. His "stoically sensitive" nature functions as label rather than forcing competing impulses in scene—he wades, writes, and reflects without genuine struggle between granite exterior and silt core. The final confession of "abandoned dream of a quiet life" arrives as told backstory rather than dramatized cost that forecloses a live option. Embodied emotion is largely absent; the prose prefers abstract terms ("rising sorrow," "flood of futility") over physical sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of Elias waiting with his completed work, but the cost remains conceptual and told rather than felt—"interlaced absences" in himself is asserted, not shown through a choice that narrows future options. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layered images of submersion, notes, and the inkwell build density, yet the ending offers restatement rather than a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake with on-page consequence. The drawbridge framing promises situational pressure (locked in) but never tightens tactics or forces adaptation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail—"slimy tiles," "black, placid water," "gaunt ribs"—and the water constrains Elias's movement and chills his legs, meeting the micro-setting standard. The antique inkwell functions as tactile anchor across beats. However, the setting does not evolve causally or alter tactics; Elias's actions proceed unimpeded by the environment's decay, and the final placement underwater feels more symbolic than a forced adaptation. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cataloging abandoned dreams—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or tightening. Elias completes his method (placing notes) without friction, cost, or adaptation; no reversal or complication tests his commitment. The raised drawbridge is mentioned twice but imposes no time pressure or resource constraint that alters his tactics. Agency at closure reads as completion of a predetermined task rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The piece accumulates texture but lacks escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" recurs as motif but remains abstract—stated rather than dramatized through specific on-page loss or omission that changes a choice. The final image attempts resonance by linking pavilion and self, yet it restates the opening thesis ("archeologist of abandoned dreams") without non-literal transformation. Theme emerges from images and the inkwell's symbolic weight, avoiding overt moralizing. The particulars (architect's dream, lovers' promises) are told rather than enacted, limiting emotional aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and the perceptual signature—surveyor noting "precise angle of its decay"—marks Elias's lens. Diction is controlled and elevated ("aqueous twilight," "hushed blaze"), though register occasionally drifts into abstract grandeur ("repository of interlaced absences") that strains against a working surveyor's interior lexicon. Rhythm modulates appropriately between reflection and action. No dialogue appears; interior voice remains consistent. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "thought of") appear but do not flatten immediacy in this contemplative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: "hushed blaze" appears three times, "interlaced absence" twice, "wrest/wrested" four times, and "stoically sensitive" twice, creating synonym churn and template cadence without pattern-teaching or payoff. Metaphoric density is high ("granite hiding...silt," "aqueous twilight," "quiet ember") but several vehicles contradict (a "blaze" cannot be "hushed" without irony the text does not signal). Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph three restates Elias's method across adjacent sentences. Information density is moderate; lines often elaborate rather than advance. These artifacts do not obscure the closure image but dull momentum throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—solitary figure catalogs loss in a drowning ruin—is atmospheric but relies on familiar symbolic architecture (abandoned pavilion, antique vessel, message-in-bottle metaphor). The surveyor's precision and "archeologist of abandoned dreams" concept offer a fresh angle, yet execution leans on abstract phrasing and told interiority rather than specific, lived detail. The transformation test fails: swapping Elias for another contemplative archivist and the pavilion for a different ruin would leave plot and arc largely unchanged. No bold structural risk heightens stakes; the piece follows a linear, meditative track without surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his profession (surveyor) colors his perception ("precise angle of its decay"), satisfying setup. However, his choices do not create key turns—he arrives with a plan and executes it without adaptation or on-page decision that alters tactics. The final act (placing the last note) is the completion of his method rather than a reactive choice under pressure. Development beat is weak; closure participation is observational.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The inkwell appears in three beats: produced from his coat (paragraph 1), uncorked to write (paragraph 2), and corked at closure (paragraph 6). It functions as tactile anchor and symbolic tether but does not constrain choice or enable tactics—Elias could use any writing tool with minor edits. The final mention charges the ending image as "small, heavy anchor," offering modest reweighting. Early signal, multi-beat presence, and closure linkage elevate the score, but swappability and lack of causal pressure cap it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" is named twice and explained as "emptiness woven from countless forgotten ambitions" and later as existing "in him, the spaces where his own dreams had once lived." It frames the thematic question but does not shape on-page stakes or constrain tactics. The concept remains abstract and ornamental, never altering Elias's options or forcing a choice. Setup present; development and closure participation are thematic echo only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" is stated twice: in paragraph 1 ("his exterior granite hiding a core of deep-feeling silt") and paragraph 4 ("his stoically sensitive nature a dam against a flood of futility"). The trait is described but not dramatized—no on-page moment where stoicism costs him emotional access or sensitivity forces a tactical shift. Label-only use without visible tradeoff; development and payoff beats absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Wrest" recurs four times: wresting meaning from silence (paragraph 2), wresting stories from the void (paragraph 3 twice), and wresting fragile history from the deep (paragraph 6). It describes Elias's intent but the action itself—placing notes—proceeds without resistance or adaptation, making "wrest" more metaphorical flourish than causal verb. Early signal and closure linkage present, but the action could be replaced with "record" or "preserve" with minor edits. Mid-band for thematic consistency but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (paragraph 2: "secretly stuffing his written fragments into fresh mortar and packed seams") and depicted across multiple beats: he seals a note into a pillar crack (paragraph 4) and presses the final note into the lowest step (paragraph 5). Setup, development, and closure participation are clear. The mechanics matter—mortar and seams anchor the repair metaphor and the final underwater placement charges the ending. However, the method does not face friction or force adaptation; Elias executes his plan unimpeded. Strong presence and closure linkage elevate the score into upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is established immediately and pressures Elias physically: water chills his legs, tiles are slimy, columns rise from black water. Setup and development beats are strong—the environment is handled across paragraphs 1, 2, 4, and 5. Closure participation: the "lowest step, now permanently underwater" anchors the final act. The setting constrains movement but does not force tactical adaptation or resource scarcity that alters his choices. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the drawbridge rises" is mentioned in paragraph 1 ("drawbridge groaned shut") and paragraph 5 ("thought of the drawbridge, now raised, locking him in"), framing the window but not tightening decisions. The final line anticipates waiting "for the drawbridge to fall," suggesting future rather than present urgency. No on-page clock pressures tactics or forces pacing choices. Setup present; development and closure participation weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is stated in paragraph 1 and restated in closure (paragraph 6: "the archeologist of all that was lost"). It frames his purpose but is never dramatized through conflicting wants or on-page cost—no scene where the quest competes with safety, time, or another desire. Told-only with thematic reprise; friction between want and cost absent. Setup and closure participation present; development beat missing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" appears three times: paragraph 1 ("air held a hushed blaze"), paragraph 5 ("hushed blaze of the setting sun"), and paragraph 6 ("hushed blaze of his endeavor settled into a quiet ember"). The tone is coherent and modulates from external (dusk) to internal (endeavor), charging the final image with metaphoric closure. However, the phrase is repeated rather than evolved, and "hushed blaze" itself is contradictory (blaze implies noise/light intensity; hushed implies quiet) without the text signaling irony or tension. Early signal, multi-beat presence, closure participation present; specificity and coherence mixed.</comment>
