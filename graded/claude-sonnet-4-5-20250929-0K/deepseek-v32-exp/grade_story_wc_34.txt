<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "articulate unspoken needs" remains abstract throughout; no on-page micro-choices reveal contradictory impulses or earned cost. The ghost in code connection feels declarative rather than dramatized through embodied action. Interiority relies heavily on label-like statements ("her motivation burned brightly") instead of concrete, character-particular perception. The final "smile" and emotional resolution arrive without visible renunciation or trade-off that would earn the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece presents one continuous scene with clear anchors (misty courtyard, storm timing). However, closure lacks felt cost: Elara completes her mural and the ghost acknowledges her, but no path is foreclosed and no visible price is paid on the page—she descends "carrying the warmth" with no complication. The causal lens is established but the ending delivers satisfaction without the struggle or sacrifice required for Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change. The "driftingly alert moment" and storm timing create atmosphere but do not tighten options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (glass chimes, ozone scent, ancient machinery). However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; no spatial constraint or resource shortage shapes Elara's choices. The flower press bolt plate is handled but operates as a magical tool without friction. The setting intensifies atmosphere but does not alter tactics or charge the final image with environmental consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving voice to the voiceless—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or trade-off. Elara's encode action proceeds smoothly: she kneels, works, the graffiti glows, the ghost appears and affirms her. No reversal, no visible cost, no narrowing of options. The storm and "between lightning and thunder" timeframe promise urgency but do not impose a deadline that complicates her work. Agency is present in her choice to encode, but the resolution is granted rather than earned through sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of voicing the unspoken emerges through the mural and ghost interaction, but the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("The unspoken needs had been articulated"). The flower press bolt plate and tinkersong wonder recur but do not reweight prior material with new meaning—they are reaffirmed rather than repriced. The ending offers emotional satisfaction but no counter-reading or complexity; the ghost becomes a guardian, Elara descends victorious, and all prior tensions dissolve without ambiguity or conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent narrative distance. Perceptual signature is present but generic: "deep breath," "heart light," "smiled" are functional but lack character-particular texture. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("tendrils of code," "spectral entity") that feels externally imposed rather than organically filtered through Elara's balladeer voice. Psychic distance is controlled but the prose does not modulate under pressure—crisis and resolution share the same lyrical cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles damage momentum: "ghost in code" is restated across six sentences; "driftingly alert" appears three times with minimal variation. Template cadence appears in scaffold openings ("The air hummed," "The mist swirled," "The courtyard settled"). Figurative density is high ("vessel for forgotten tales," "stories pressed like blossoms," "tendrils of code") but many metaphors feel decorative rather than load-bearing. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance. Apply −1.2 for pervasive loops and template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—artist encoding emotion into graffiti to summon a digital ghost—offers surface novelty but executes through familiar beats: isolated artist, magical tool, affirming supernatural encounter, triumphant resolution. The flower press bolt plate and "tinkersong wonder" feel like prompt-fulfillment ornaments rather than organically integrated choices. No risk-taking complicates the arc; the ghost validates Elara without friction, and she descends victorious. Emotional arc is template: silenced → creates art → is heard.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara (seldom-heard balladeer) is present throughout and her choice to encode is the story's spine. However, her decisions do not create key turns—the ghost's appearance is a response to her work, not a reversal she must navigate. She observes the ghost and feels connection but makes no mid-scene choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The character is functional but not causal beyond the initial decision to paint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate appears in three beats: kneeling beside it, using it as a stencil, and holding it warm at the end. However, its mechanics are vague ("etched with fine, swirling patterns," "bolt acting as a pivot") and it does not constrain choice or shift meaning—it functions as a magical catalyst. The final mention ("felt warm") adds atmosphere but does not reweight prior material. Present across beats but swappable with any enchanted tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The ghost in code is seeded early as Elara's "silent partner" and appears on-page at the climax, interacting with her mural. It shapes the ending by acknowledging her work and becoming a guardian. However, it does not constrain Elara's choices or complicate her tactics—it arrives to affirm rather than challenge. The concept drives the story's premise and closure participation but lacks friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" is mentioned three times as an ambient sensation but never constrains or enables a specific action. It describes atmosphere ("driftingly alert presence," "sensation intensified," "driftingly alert moment") without visible trade-off or tactical consequence. Label-only trait without embodied cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The encode action is seeded early ("encode the whispers of the heart"), executed in the middle beats (painting the mural), and completes at closure ("encode action completed"). It is the story's structural spine and all major turns trace to it. However, the action is smooth and unopposed—no failed attempt, no cost to encoding. Essential but lacking friction that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Messages encoded in graffiti art is the method from the opening and shapes the middle beats (Elara painting sigils, layering meaning). The mechanics are present but abstract: we see her trace grooves and apply pigments, but the encoding process itself is gestural. The method is integral to the premise and closure but could be replaced with another art form (song, sculpture) with minor edits. Signaled early, used across beats, but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is anchored early and provides vivid atmosphere (glass chimes, ozone, weathered stone bench). However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint: no spatial pressure, no resource shortage, no environmental hazard that alters Elara's tactics. The storm's electricity makes the graffiti glow but does not threaten or complicate her work. Present and coherent but postcard-level.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Between lightning and thunder" is mentioned three times and frames the opening urgency ("her only moment to act") and closure ("between lightning and thunder, Elara had found her voice"). However, the timeframe is not tracked or enforced—Elara works at leisure with no on-page clock tightening her choices. Symbolic rather than functional; vague rather than live.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to articulate unspoken needs" is seeded early ("unspoken needs she yearned to articulate") and drives her decision to paint. The ending explicitly completes this goal ("The unspoken needs had been articulated"). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between her desire and competing costs. Present at setup and closure but abstract in execution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" appears in the opening (glass chimes and machinery music) and returns at closure (chimes celebrate her victory). The tone is consistently lyrical and awe-filled but does not modulate with pressure—crisis and resolution share the same register. The tone frames the piece but remains static rather than shifting to charge the final image. Coherent but one-note.</comment>
