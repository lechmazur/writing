<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to "store wonder in the cellar of reason" is declared early but remains abstract; his reverse-engineering is shown through summary ("documented each variation," "adjusted tiny levers") rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is absent—he never doubts his project or weighs competing goods. The final satisfaction is told ("profound satisfaction") without visible cost that forecloses a path, and the years-later coda dilutes any decisive change at the moment of repair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elian gathers observations across dawn/noon/dusk and the text accumulates echoes and vessels. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The closure unit—timer repaired, echoes stored—lands on the page, but cost is conceptual and diffuse; no live option is foreclosed in the final image, and the coda ("In the years to come") extends beyond the ending beat, weakening the cadence shift required for Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern's acoustic properties are referenced throughout (dawn/noon/dusk reflection angles), and the crystalline vessels function as micro-setting objects. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elian's work proceeds without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The "wounded season" outside remains postcard atmosphere, and the final image does not charge the setting's properties to alter meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—master the harvest of echoes—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through observation cycles, but there is no on-page reversal or moment where a live option narrows with visible cost. The timer's insight ("designed not to measure time, but to harvest echoes") arrives as epiphany rather than earned discovery through failure. Agency reads as patient assembly without trade-offs; success is assured, and the wounded season's "healing" coincides with completion without causal linkage.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—reason as keeper of wonder—emerges from Elian's project and is reinforced by the cellar metaphor. The final paragraph, however, delivers overt thesis: "reason need not crush wonder, but could instead be its most faithful keeper" and "echoes are not just sounds, but memories of space itself." These direct statements replace resonance with moralizing. The motif of echoes recurs but does not constrain choice or reweight prior material at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature ("peripherally focused") colors descriptions of shadows and pooled sounds. Diction is consistent and elevated ("lull of a wounded season," "audial wonder"), fitting a reflective locksmith's interior register. However, phrases like "the cavern seemed to respond" and "awaiting his command" anthropomorphize without irony, and filter verbs ("noticed," "believed," "felt") stack in mid-passage beats, dulling immediacy when observation should sharpen.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraphs breathe, but several paraphrase loops appear: "He documented each variation" is restated by "his mind weaving these observations into a mental map"; "the timer was designed not to measure time, but to harvest echoes" is echoed two lines later by "he began reassembling the device, incorporating his new understanding." Template stems recur: "He [verb]" opens six sentences in close succession. Stock phrasing ("quiet beauty," "threads of mystery," "faithful keeper") appears in thematic beats. No single artifact obscures causality, but cumulative scaffold and elevated register in peak moments reduce propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise—locksmith reverse-engineers a device to harvest sound—offers a lyric angle, but the execution follows a template arc: observe → insight → repair → satisfaction. The "harvest of echoes" concept remains metaphorical without grounded mechanics; reflection angles and crystalline vessels are asserted, not demonstrated through lived constraint. Emotional truth is diluted by tidy resolution and the coda's promise of future additions. No risk-taking heightens stakes; the wounded season heals on cue, and Elian's work proceeds without meaningful friction or failure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elian appears in every beat but makes few decisions that alter tactics. His choices—document, adjust levers, test revisions—are told in summary. The reflective trait colors perception but does not constrain action; he never stops, doubts, or trades one approach for another. Present across the arc but functionally passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The broken timer is introduced early, examined mid-story ("stubborn gear"), and repaired by the end, appearing in at least three beats. Its function—synchronize with reflection angles to harvest echoes—shapes the plot's central task. However, the device does not impose cost or narrow options; Elian's success is assured once he understands it. Causal role present but without visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Harvest of echoes" is the stated goal and frames the story's conceit. Yet the mechanics remain abstract: echoes are "collected into a cohesive stream" and stored in vessels, but no on-page action demonstrates capture or trade-off. The concept functions as theme and setting flavor rather than a tactical constraint that alters choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" appears once as a trait label ("his gaze often drifting to the cavern's edges") and colors descriptive texture ("shadows and sounds pooled strangely"). It does not enable or constrain a decision; Elian's work proceeds linearly whether he is peripherally or directly focused. Ornamental mention without causal leverage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering is the method from paragraph four onward: Elian takes apart components, studies angles, and reassembles with adjustments. This action drives the middle arc and the resolution. However, the process is summarized rather than dramatized in distinct attempts with failures, and "reverse-engineer" could be swapped for "repair" or "reconstruct" with minimal rewrite. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Studying reflection angles at different times" is signaled early and occupies multiple paragraphs (dawn/noon/dusk cycles). The method matters: Elian's documentation leads to the insight that the timer synchronizes with these angles. Yet the mechanics are told, not shown through trial and error, and the method does not impose a visible cost or force a trade-off between competing approaches.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The marble cavern is present throughout, providing acoustic properties (reflection angles) that inform Elian's work. The setting supplies atmosphere and a conceptual resource (echoes). However, it does not constrain action—there is no moment where the cavern's layout, access, or conditions force a tactical adjustment. The final image mentions the cavern as "silent guardian" but does not reweight its role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across the lull of a wounded season" appears in the opening and closing, framing the narrative window. Time is tracked vaguely ("days that bled into weeks," "In the years to come"), and the season's "healing" at the end coincides with Elian's success without causal pressure. The timeframe provides lyric texture but does not tighten decisions or escalate urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elian's motivation—"to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later, when the world might need its buried marvels"—is stated early and restated at closure. It frames his project but is never tested by competing desires, doubt, or cost. The motivation is told and affirmed rather than dramatized through friction or sacrifice on the page.</comment>
