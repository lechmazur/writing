<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared early but never shown in conflict; she moves through the plot without internal friction, contradiction, or visible cost to her choices. The "calmly inventive" trait remains a label rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her competence is unbroken—no mistakes, no degradation under stress—and the ending simply confirms her plan without foreclosing a live option or revealing a hierarchy of values. Interiority consists of generic assertions ("felt a thrill, not of fear, but of purpose") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who and where within the first paragraph, meeting orientation minimums, but the closure unit—pamphlets distributed, revolution "inevitable"—declares success without on-page cost or a decisive change in Elara's options or knowledge. The blackout functions as convenient cover rather than a pressure that narrows tactics; once she begins moving, no reversal or complication alters her plan. The accumulative lens is suggested by the recurring images (sundial, quill holder, "cradle of sparks") but the ending asserts transformation ("the people would never be the same") instead of dramatizing a reweighting with felt cost. The "winking hush" tone and recurring motifs gesture toward a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the final image—Elara waiting, the fort asleep—leaves the consequence off-stage and the cost implied rather than legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The luminous fort and blackout frame the action, and the sundial anchors the cipher scene with functional spatial detail. However, the armory and courtyard remain generic holders for plot moves; no environmental constraint shapes Elara's choices, and the setting does not charge the final image. Sensory detail is sparse and unfiltered by urgency—"shadows clung to rusted weapons" reads as stage dressing rather than perception under pressure. The quill holder functions as a tool but does not embody the setting's pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sparking the revolution—is signaled early but never tested. The blackout complicates the guards' awareness but does not narrow Elara's options; she "had practiced this very maneuver in her mind a hundred times," so the night unfolds as rehearsed success rather than escalation. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; each step confirms the plan. The ending declares the revolution "inevitable" and "underway" but locates the consequence ("others would find the pamphlets") off-page, forfeiting the on-page cost required for meaningful escalation. Agency consists of flawless execution, not a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "cradle of sparks" recurs as a motif and the revolution-as-whisper idea has thematic potential, but both remain abstract labels restated across beats without accruing new pressure or meaning. The sundial, quill holder, and blackout are named repeatedly but do not shift in significance at closure; the ending recaps the theme ("silent revolution," "winking hush," "cradle of sparks") rather than offering a non-literal answer grounded in image or action. "The fort slept on, but its heart was stirring" exemplifies the decorative abstraction that replaces dramatized resonance. No epiphany is earned through specific struggle; the protagonist's arc is declared ("vigilant lock sentinel had unlocked the future") rather than shown through a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited, but the narrative voice is generic and tonally flat, with no perceptual signature to distinguish Elara's way of noticing. Diction drifts between elevated ("winking hush," "luminous fort") and functional without a consistent idiom rooted in character. Key beats rely on summary and assertion ("Her calmly inventive nature had foreseen this") rather than filtering perception through embodied experience. The phrase "winking hush" appears multiple times as a tonal label but is not enacted in syntax or rhythm; the prose pace remains uniform regardless of pressure, and no modulation reflects the blackout's urgency or the stakes of exposure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn flatten momentum: "cradle of sparks" appears five times with decorative variation but no added pressure; "silent revolution" and "winking hush" recur as placeholders. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]…She [verb]…" runs across multiple paragraphs without syntactic variety. Key beats are summarized ("worked quickly, distributing the leaflets") rather than shown, and figurative language ("a thread of hope in the gloom," "a canvas for her invention") stacks without coherent vehicles or embodied grounding. The final third loops thematic labels ("The silent revolution was underway, soundless and sure") in place of propulsion. Combined artifact penalties (paraphrase loops, template stems, stock metaphor strings, summary-only pivotal action) and the spread into the closure paragraph trigger cumulative deductions and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The premise—lock sentinel uses a blackout to distribute revolutionary pamphlets via sundial cipher—assembles genre tropes (secret rebellion, coded message, convenient crisis) without transformation through specific world logic, character contradiction, or a non-obvious moral calculus. The sundial cipher is introduced and solved in one beat with no prior groundwork, reading as a convenient puzzle rather than an inevitable synthesis. Elara's flawless competence and the absence of friction or cost drain the frame of risk. The "winking hush" tone and "cradle of sparks" motif gesture toward lyricism but remain decorative labels rather than lived-in particulars. No turn or inflection feels surprising in hindsight; the ending announces success generically ("a new story was beginning") without a fresh image or realized cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as sentinel frames the setting, but her choices are procedural rather than transformative—she moves through rehearsed steps without on-page friction, cost, or a decision that alters tactics. The "vigilant" trait is asserted but not tested; she observes the blackout as opportunity, not threat, and no reversal forces a new stance. Closure participation is thematic recap ("The vigilant lock sentinel had unlocked the future") rather than a causal turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The quill holder appears in the opening beat (carried on her belt), is used to align the sundial shadow, and pries open the armory panel—three beats with functional involvement. It returns in the ending paragraph as a symbolic anchor ("its ordinary appearance belying its role"). However, its use is instrumental without evolving meaning or charging the final image with reweighted pressure; it could be swapped for any small tool without structural loss. The luminescent stone shard inside is mentioned once and does not constrain a later choice. Mid-band fit: present across beats, functional, but replaceable and not indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Cradle of sparks" is named five times but functions as a thematic label rather than a stake-shaping force. It first appears as the luminescent stone in the quill holder, then as a metaphor for the pamphlet cache, then recurs in the final paragraph as mood-setting. The concept does not narrow options, create friction, or alter tactics; it is decorated rather than dramatized. Ornamental presence without causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is asserted three times ("She was calmly inventive," "Her calmly inventive nature had foreseen this," "Elara's calmly inventive spirit had turned oppression into opportunity") but never shown through a choice with visible tradeoff. No moment dramatizes calm under stress costing her speed, or invention requiring risk; the trait is label-only without on-page friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Intrigue frames the blackout as cover for the pamphlet distribution and the sundial decoding. The action is present in at least two beats (sundial scene, armory scene) and shapes the middle sequence. However, the intrigue does not generate a reversal or cost at closure—Elara completes the mission without complication—and could be rephrased as "secret mission" with minor edits. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The sundial and coded angles appear in one extended beat where Elara aligns the quill holder with the gnomon shadow to decode the armory location. Setup is mid-story rather than early, and the method does not return or shape the ending. The mechanics are asserted ("a cipher known only to the dissidents") rather than shown; we do not see her interpret angles, only the result. Single-beat use with late first appearance and summary-only mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The luminous fort and twilight-to-blackout transition frame the opening and recur in the final paragraph, providing atmospheric brackets. However, the setting does not pressure Elara's choices—darkness aids rather than complicates her moves—and the "luminous" quality is decorative descriptor without tactical consequence. The courtyard and armory are generic stage-holders. The fort's light/dark binary gestures toward theme but does not constrain action or charge the closure image with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The blackout is present from the inciting incident and provides the operational window ("giving her the window she needed," "a blanket of confusion that hid her actions"). It appears in the ending ("The blackout persisted"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock, no patrol schedule, no risk of lights returning mid-mission—so it functions as static cover rather than escalating pressure. Functional setup and ending presence, but replaceable with any convenient distraction.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation to spark a revolution is declared in the second paragraph, drives the pamphlet-distribution goal across multiple beats, and is restated at closure ("The silent revolution was underway"). However, it is never shown in friction or cost—no competing loyalty, no fear, no sacrifice of safety or relationship. The desire is told and pursued without internal contradiction or visible price, limiting integration to functional goal-tracking rather than dramatized stake with tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Winking hush" is named four times as a tonal label ("Her movements were a study in winking hush," "A winking hush fell over the fortress," "The tone of the night was a winking hush") but is not enacted in syntax, rhythm, or sensory detail. The prose pace and diction remain uniform; no modulation reflects the playful secrecy the phrase claims. The tone is asserted rather than embodied, and it does not charge the final image or shift under pressure. Label-only presence without integration.</comment>
