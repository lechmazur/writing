<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to preserve forgotten names is clear and consistent, but her interiority reads as decorative rather than contradictory. Phrases like "snowmelt ardor" and "technically gentle" function as labels rather than embodied emotional states with competing impulses. The final transformation lacks visible cost—she achieves her goal without struggle, renunciation, or meaningful failure. Her competence faces no genuine obstacle that forces her to trade one value for another.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The orientation test is satisfied (who/where/when established early), and the accumulative lens is inferrable by midpoint. However, closure lacks visible cost: Elara succeeds without forfeiting anything, and the rope transformation occurs through smooth execution rather than through a tightening that narrows options. The "street organ scrap crumbled to dust" arrives as convenient erasure rather than felt sacrifice. Under an accumulative lens, the final image should reweight prior material with pressure, but instead it delivers triumph without friction or price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (frigid air, prismatic sparks, glistening walls). The ceremonial rope functions as a tactile, hands-on object that enables the central action. However, the environment does not constrain choice—the sanctum facilitates rather than resists, and no environmental detail forces Elara to adapt tactics or pay a spatial price at closure. Strong description but lacks the pressure-test needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and remains coherent. Yet no meaningful tightening occurs: Elara begins with the rope, card, and vision already in hand, and each step succeeds without resistance or escalation. The aurora brightens and whispers emerge in smooth sequence with no reversal, complication, or choice that narrows options. Closure delivers success without a visible price or trade-off, failing the escalation requirement for accumulative designs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of reclamation and memory emerges from the rope/wax-casting metaphor and the action of reweaving names into permanence. The final image of the rope as "lattice of luminescent remembrance" offers resonance. However, "snowmelt ardor" and explicit statements like "preserving sound was like lost wax casting" over-articulate rather than imply. The ending explains its own meaning ("she had illuminated the darkness") instead of trusting the image, lowering thematic restraint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual bias (caster's eye for technique, reverence for materials) is evident. Phrases like "technically gentle" and "snowmelt ardor" feel authorial rather than voice-particular; they recur as ornament without evolving under pressure. Sentence openings vary, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cascade through her veins," "sonorous light") that feels imposed rather than organic to a hands-on artisan's idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are generally strong, with sensory detail woven through action. However, paraphrase loops appear: "preserve the sound" / "let them resonate," "technically gentle" repeated without deepening, and synonym churn around "names" (identities, voices, forgotten names) without added pressure. "Snowmelt ardor" appears three times as a thematic badge rather than evolving meaning. Template cadence in several paragraphs ("She [verb]... She [verb]...") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she understood," "she saw") dull immediacy in key beats, triggering −0.6 for patterned artifacts and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The lost-wax-caster protagonist and ceremonial-rope mechanics offer specificity, and the aurora/ice setting is vivid. However, the core premise—artisan uses ancient object to restore lost cultural memory in a frozen sanctum—reads as a template fantasy quest without transformation. Elara's flawless execution, the vision-granted solution, and the triumphant ending without complication or moral friction follow familiar beats. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material beyond competent genre execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara makes the decision to reconfigure the rope and executes each step, driving all major beats. However, her choices face no resistance or cost—she begins with the method, succeeds at each turn, and achieves her goal without renunciation or tradeoff. Present in setup, middle, and closure (all three gates), but swappable with any skilled artisan performing a ritual without the caster identity shaping a unique constraint or tactic. Causal but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The street organ card appears in the opening (setup gate), is pressed against the rope mid-scene (middle gate), and crumbles at closure (payoff gate). Yet its mechanics are vague—"transcribed memory" and "perforations catching glow" describe effect without showing how the card constrains Elara's method. It functions as a passive artifact rather than a tool she must decode or whose fragility forces tactical choices. Present across beats but largely ornamental; easily replaceable with any memory-storage token.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Transcribed memory" frames the premise and stakes from the opening, shapes Elara's goal (preserving sound encoded in the card), and drives the rope-reconfiguration tactic. The concept is central to closure: the card's memory merges with the rope to restore names. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no on-page friction over what "transcribed" means or how Elara reads/translates it. Present in all three gates and causally active, but lacks the specificity and cost that would make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" is mentioned twice as a descriptor for Elara's touch and once in final reflection, but it never constrains or enables a choice. No beat shows her rejecting a forceful method in favor of gentleness with visible cost, nor does gentleness fail and force adaptation. The attribute functions as a character label rather than a tactical tradeoff. Present in setup and closure (two gates), but ornamental; easily cut without altering plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears as the stated goal ("to illuminate those sounds"), the climactic beat ("Light burst forth, illuminating the sanctum"), and the final reflection ("she had illuminated the darkness"). It drives the closure image and is inseparable from the story's resolution. However, the action itself is abstract—light emerges from the rope's reconfiguration without a tactical choice or cost tied to *how* Elara illuminates. Present in setup, middle, and payoff with strong closure linkage, but the lack of friction or specificity prevents top-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ceremonial rope and braid-reconfiguration method are introduced in the opening vision, occupy the entire middle section (Elara untwisting and reweaving), and produce the closure effect (glowing lattice, names resonating). The method is irreplaceable: removing the rope would break the story's central mechanism. However, the mechanics remain vague—"threading new alignments" describes outcome without showing constraints or missteps. All three gates with strong causal and closure linkage, but lacks the tactical friction or cost that would push it to 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum and aurora are present throughout, anchoring all major beats from setup to closure. The aurora "brightens" in response to Elara's work and "pulses in rhythm" at the end, charging the final image. However, the setting never constrains Elara's choices—it facilitates her work rather than resisting or forcing adaptation. The ice "drips" metaphorically but does not alter tactics. Strong closure participation and vivid description, but lacks the pressure-test for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After forgiving yourself" is mentioned once in the second sentence ("She had forgiven herself for the silence she had once caused") and never returns or shapes a choice. It functions as backstory context rather than a live temporal constraint or emotional friction at closure. No beats test whether forgiveness is stable or costly; the timeframe does not tighten decisions. Setup gate only; ornamental and easily removed.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve forgotten names is stated in the opening, drives every beat (vision, card, rope-work, final chorus), and is fulfilled at closure when "the forgotten names ring out." It is indispensable: remove it and the story collapses. However, the motivation faces no friction—Elara never doubts, sacrifices another want, or confronts a cost for preserving names. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage across all three gates, but the lack of conflicted choice or visible price caps the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" appears three times (middle beat, penultimate paragraph, final paragraph) as a recurring phrase marking Elara's emotional state. It modulates from "rush" to "cascade" and charges the final mood of warmth-in-cold. However, the tone remains static—triumphant throughout with no tonal shift under pressure. The phrase functions as a thematic badge rather than a lived emotional progression. Present in middle and closure (two gates) with lyric reprise, but lacks the pressure-driven modulation for higher bands.</comment>
