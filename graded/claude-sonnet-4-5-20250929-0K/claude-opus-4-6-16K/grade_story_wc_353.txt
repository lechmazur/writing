<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in her craft identity, driving her obsessive pursuit through a coherent progression of experiments. Her interiority is concrete and particular—"symphonically minded" shapes how she perceives silence as a kind of madness—and the fracture-mapping sequence shows her expertise under pressure. The final strumming beats embody her determination through repeated physical action, though the emotional payoff ("eyes filled") leans slightly toward label. Internal contradiction is present but muted: her refusal to stop is consistent rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a clear Causal lens: Maren's discovery of the sculpture enables the fracture-analysis method, which in turn enables the anti-frequency instrument, which produces the first sound. Orientation anchors (grove, eleven-year silence, sculptor's workshop) appear early. Closure is a Decisive Change—sound returns with audible birdsong and the hedgehog's response—earned by her patient iteration. One persistent constraint (the Quiet's acoustic consumption) shapes every tactic. The cost is opportunity and time (weeks of work, hours of playing), visible but not deeply felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is anchored early with sensory specificity (silent throats, mineralized wood, collapsed creek bank) and the porcelain insulator salvaged from a telegraph line adds material texture. The hedgehog's watching presence and the siskins on Maren's shoulders ground the space in lived-in detail. The grove constrains her work (she must use local alder) and the final beat positions her on the grove floor among the trees, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—create music in a silent world—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation follows the Causal lens: each failed instrument attempt (drums, flutes, strings) tightens the problem until the fracture-map method offers a new tactic. The porcelain node and anti-frequency design represent a meaningful turn that narrows her options to one specific solution. The midnight-to-dawn playing sequence shows iterative tightening (three feet, four, five, grove edge) with visible cost in sustained effort. One clear on-page reversal when the insulator first rings.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fracture-map conceit: sound is archived in stress, and patient iteration carves channels through silence "the way water carves stone." The contrast between inner symphony and outer void drives the piece without thesis statements. The final image—"crack by crack reclaiming a world that had forgotten what it meant to listen"—reweights the opening silence with earned resonance, and "empathy in motion" (feeling what the wood/air/silence needs) operates as method rather than abstraction. The hedgehog's uncurling bookends the piece with a quiet, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices stress cracks, growth rings, and acoustic geometry. Diction remains controlled and technical without slipping into exposition ("minerite," "node," "anti-frequency") and reflects her craft expertise. No dialogue to assess. The phrase "empathy in motion" is slightly elevated for interiority but voice-motivated by her sculptor's mindset. Purposeful compression in the fracture-analysis paragraph maintains momentum. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high: most lines advance character, setting, or pressure. The opening paragraph's repeated negatives ("not heard," "every silent," "every mute," "every voiceless") are purposeful parallelism that teaches the suffocating absence. Minor scaffold appears in "She strummed again, adjusting, feeling" (near-synonym series) but does not obscure causality. The fracture-to-frequency translation is compressed efficiently. One metaphor (sap through heartwood) is apt; no mixed vehicles. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The premise—analyzing stress cracks as a sound archive—offers a fresh synthesis of sculpture, acoustics, and archeology that feels specific to this character and world. The porcelain insulator as a resonance bottleneck is a non-obvious mechanical choice. The emotional arc (inner music vs. outer silence as madness) could apply to any musician, but the tree-song sculptor angle and fracture-geometry method particularize it. The eleven-year timescale and patient, iterative closure resist quick-fix tropes. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and technical detail heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's role as tree-song sculptor drives every beat: her craft knowledge enables fracture analysis, instrument carving, and the anti-frequency design. Setup in paragraph two, development through the sculpture discovery and weeks of translation work, payoff in the strumming sequence. Her expertise constrains her method (she must work with wood and resonance) and her repeated attempts (drums, flutes, strings, then the new instrument) are all sculptor's choices. The final act of strumming is hers alone. Removing this exact identity would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator appears late (third-quarter mark) but is causally essential: it reflects vibration inward to concentrate the anti-frequency at the calculated node. Setup describes its salvage and positioning, development shows it mounted "at the precise node," payoff delivers the first tone when "the porcelain insulator rang." Two distinct beats (mounting, ringing) with clear function. Its non-absorbent property is specified and necessary. Late arrival caps the score despite strong closure linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Empathy in motion" is defined on the page as "the ability to feel what the wood felt, what the air wanted, what the silence needed" and guides her final adjustments while strumming. Setup in paragraph four as her motivation method, payoff when she lets empathy guide her hands in the climax. It shapes her iterative tactic (feeling resistance, adjusting) rather than remaining abstract theme. The phrase itself is slightly elevated but the concept constrains her approach with a visible cost in patience. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) without middle development caps the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" is introduced early and constrains her perception: she cannot stop hearing "layered and complex" music, and the gap between inner sound and outer void becomes "a kind of madness." This trait drives her obsessive work and shapes the final image where "symphonies blooming in her mind" translate to outer truth. Setup in paragraph three, payoff in the ending. The attribute explains why she persists when others might have stopped, making her goal credible. Two-gate presence and causal pressure on motivation justify mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strumming is the sole action that breaks the silence. Setup frames it as the culminating test, development shows three attempts with escalating reach (whisper, three feet, adjustment), payoff spans the midnight-to-dawn sequence where iterative strumming carves channels and restores birdsong. The verb "strum" recurs in six distinct beats, each with new consequence. Her fingers and the instrument's resistance are foregrounded. Removing strumming in favor of any other action (bowing, striking, blowing) would require rewriting the fracture-map logic and the porcelain node. Indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The stress-crack analysis method is signaled when Maren finds the sculpture, developed across the mapping paragraph ("stress cracks form where vibration once concentrated"), and pays off when the anti-frequency instrument design inverts the pattern. The mechanics matter: crack depth becomes amplitude, direction becomes pitch. This method is the hinge that turns her prior failures into a viable solution. Three gates clearly met. The specificity (calipers, magnifying lens, frequency translation) makes it irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is named in the opening line and provides the living alder she carves, the siskins that validate the returning sound, and the spatial anchor for the final strumming scene. Setup is immediate, development shows her working "among the alders," payoff places her on the grove floor when the siskins sing. The grove's silence is the story's central constraint. The setting is more atmospheric than tactically decisive (she could theoretically work elsewhere), but its return to life charges the closure image. Three gates with moderate causal pressure justify mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hedgehog's uncurling bookends the story: it appears "one cold morning after the hedgehog uncurled" at the sculpture's discovery and "uncurled fully in the new warmth of sound" at closure. This seasonal marker implies spring's arrival and the end of a long silence, tightening the temporal frame. Setup in paragraph five, payoff in the penultimate line. The hedgehog's state change (curled to uncurled) tracks the world's thaw. Two-gate presence with a charged reprise that reweights the opening, though it does not constrain middle choices, places it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to create music in a silent world" is declared in paragraph four as "simple and impossible" and dramatized through her failed attempts (drums, flutes, strings) and sustained effort (weeks of analysis, hours of playing). Setup is early, development shows her trying "everything," payoff delivers the music with audible birdsong. The friction between the impossibility (the Quiet consumes all sound) and her refusal to stop drives every choice. Her inner symphonies versus the outer void create madness-level pressure. Three gates with strong causal linkage and felt cost in sustained iteration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tone of "intensely quiet" is established in the opening (eleven years without sound, silent dawn, mute sunset) and modulates purposefully: oppressive in the silence-as-madness paragraph, forensic during fracture analysis, tentative when the insulator first rings, then gradually warming as sound reaches farther. The final beat balances quiet (faint, broken birdsong) with earned intensity (symphonies blooming, crack by crack reclaiming). The tone charges the closure image by maintaining restraint even in triumph. Coherent through all turns and essential to the story's emotional register.</comment>
