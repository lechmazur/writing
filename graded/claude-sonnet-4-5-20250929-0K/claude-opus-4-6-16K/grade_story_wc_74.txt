<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is concrete and embodied through insomnia's toll ("eleven days," sleep "rousing itself...like a shy animal"), and her methodical cataloging reveals character under pressure. The final choice to "not fight it" and lie down forecloses the obsessive cycle with visible cost (ending the painting work). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between compulsive creation and the body's collapse, though the piece leans toward reflection over dramatized struggle in peak moments. The daydream visions provide motivation but remain told rather than enacted with micro-choices that narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lena stops fighting sleep and accepts rest, reweighting her obsessive search with the realization that the language is one of remembered kindness. Orientation anchors early (rooftop greenhouse, insomnia, painting symbols). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through visions, cataloging, and the Deshi discovery until the final image reweights all prior material. Cost is felt (she stops painting, lets go of compulsion) but the causal link between sending the message and feeling able to sleep is more asserted than dramatized; the turn happens because she decides it does, not because an on-page event forces it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse supplies vivid, selective detail (cracked tile, tomato plants, moonlight through glass, smog-bruised skyline) that reflects Lena's perceptual filter and constrains the nocturnal ritual. The moon's physical presence enables the daydreams and charges the final image ("one constellation through"). Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling on tile, easel, logbook, phone, lying among plants). The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that holds the action and recurs in the Chengdu vision, creating a purposeful echo that supports closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the symbols to understand their origin—is signaled early and coheres across beats. Pressure tightens through the methodical cataloging, moonlit visions, and discovery of Deshi's post, culminating in the realization and message. The final choice to stop and sleep forecloses the search with felt cost. Agency is present (she writes, she lies down) but the escalation is more textural accumulation than a reversal that narrows live options under duress. The Deshi discovery feels coincidental convenience (finding the exact stranger on a forum) that delivers resolution rather than complicating stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—kindness persisting beyond language and memory—emerges organically from the brushstroke symbols, the Chengdu encounter, and the final realization without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the "language that exists before words" is kindness remembered, charged by the constellation image and sleep as earned release. Subtext operates in the daydream fragments and the unspoken weight of the stranger's canvases. The piece resists moralizing, letting particulars (rain, old man, paintings) carry thematic weight. Minor slip: "the language we are writing is the one that exists before words, the one that means someone was kind to me once" edges close to articulating the thesis in the message text, though it remains character voice rather than narrator sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled distance and a distinct perceptual signature (moon as blade, smog as bruise, sleep as shy animal). Diction is elevated and lyric but consistent with the established voice. Knowledge boundaries hold (Lena's certainty about Deshi is inference, not omniscience). The piece uses purposeful compression and patterned imagery (moonlight, symbols, kindness) that coheres across beats. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she was certain") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. One minor slip: "the kind of instrument a calligrapher might use" briefly shifts to a more distanced register mid-description, slightly weakening immersion in Lena's present perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, density is high, and figurative language (moon as blade, smog as bruise, sediment metaphor) is vivid without muddle. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and recharge imagery cleanly. Minimal scaffold; no paraphrase loops. Two craft slips lower the score: "She stared at the screen until the light hurt. Then she stared longer" is a micro paraphrase loop that adds no new pressure, and "the saffron quiet of the greenhouse" in the final paragraph introduces an untethered descriptor (saffron) that feels ornamental rather than earned by prior sensory detail. Both touch or approach the closure beat, preventing entry to 8.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of insomnia, lost languages, moonlit daydreams, and a seven-year-old act of kindness is specific and memorable. The piece transforms the "mysterious brush" trope by rooting it in intergenerational memory and human connection rather than magic. Emotional honesty (obsessive hope, weeping stranger, shy sleep) avoids sentimentality. The Chenggo coincidence—Lena finding Deshi's exact post on a forum—leans on convenient plotting that undercuts ingenuity at the story's hinge. The ending's lyric resonance and thematic particularity (rain, canvases, unnamed constellation) lift the score within the 7-band, but the core premise (magical realism brush enables cross-cultural kindness memory) follows a familiar template without fully transforming it through lived occupational or procedural detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena (insomniac painter) is present throughout and makes two key choices: cataloging/painting the symbols and writing to Deshi, then choosing to stop and sleep. Her insomnia enables the extended moon exposure and frames the stakes. The final choice (lying down, not fighting sleep) forecloses the obsessive cycle with visible cost and shapes the closure image. Setup early, involved in cataloging and vision beats, and decisive at the end. Specificity moderate—insomnia matters more than "painter" per se (she could be any nocturnal creator). Caps prevent higher: the choices are more about recognition and release than tactical problem-solving under evolving pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The calligrapher's moon-tipped brush appears in paragraph two (early setup), is handled in multiple beats (painting canvases, triggering visions when moonlight hits it), and recurs in the final paragraph when Lena sets it down, signaling the end of compulsion. Its "moon-tipped" property enables the daydream mechanic and links to the waxing moon timeframe. Removing it would break the daydream logic and the inherited-memory premise. Strong causal work and closure linkage. Caps prevent 8.5+: the brush is more conduit than object with evolving material properties, and its mechanics (why moonlight on this brush triggers visions) remain asserted rather than tested or constrained on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lost languages (Sumerian, Linear A, Proto-Elamite) are cataloged in paragraph four and frame Lena's research method, shaping her nightly tactics. The concept culminates in the realization that the symbols encode not a linguistic script but "the language that exists before words"—remembered kindness. This reweights the entire search and charges the closure. Setup by first third, alters interpretation at the end. Caps prevent higher: the concept operates more as thematic anchor than on-page constraint that narrows tactical options under pressure; Lena's cataloging is described but not dramatized as a choice-forcing problem.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is named in paragraph four and demonstrated through Lena's logbook, cross-referencing, and patient cataloging despite eleven sleepless days. The trait enables sustained effort without despair. At closure, hope is validated (she finds Deshi) but the trait does not force a visible tradeoff or cost—her method simply succeeds. Setup present, behavior consistent, but the attribute does not constrain a choice (she never faces a moment where methodical patience conflicts with another urgent need). Functional but not indispensable; a determined or obsessive character could follow the same arc.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Rouse" (sleep rousing itself) appears in the final paragraph as the climactic image: sleep approaches "like a shy animal" after eleven days, and Lena chooses not to fight it. This reversal—from compulsive wakefulness to earned rest—is the story's decisive turn and closure unit. The action redefines her state and forecloses the painting obsession with visible cost. Late first appearance (final paragraph) would normally cap at 4.6, but here "rouse" is the closure verb that makes the ending legible; the entire arc builds toward this moment. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability elevate the score within the lyric-resonance allowance, though the lack of mid-story presence and the fact that it is more internal shift than physical act prevent 9+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Daydreams sparked by moonlight are introduced in paragraph five, shown triggering visions of the ancient market and the weeping man in the greenhouse, and implicitly recur across "eleven days" of painting. The mechanic shapes Lena's nightly process and delivers the Deshi vision that precipitates the climax. Setup by midpoint, involved in at least two distinct vision beats, and causally necessary (without the visions, she has no symbols and no connection to Deshi). Caps prevent higher: the daydream mechanic is more given magical-realism device than a method Lena must learn, refine, or risk; it works reliably without constraint or cost until the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse supplies spatial grounding (cracked tile, tomato plants, glass filtering moonlight) and positions Lena "six stories above" the smog-choked city, creating atmospheric contrast. The setting enables moon access (rooftop location) and provides the final resting place among plants. Setup early, present across beats, and recurs in closure image. Moderate causal work: the greenhouse shelters the ritual but does not supply resources or obstacles that alter tactics under pressure. The smog/moon contrast charges tone but remains descriptive rather than a constraint Lena navigates. Solid integration, but the setting could be swapped for another nocturnal moon-access space (hilltop studio, rural cabin) with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The waxing moon is named in paragraph one and recurs in the final paragraph ("The moon climbed higher"). Moon phase matters mechanically (moonlight triggers daydreams) and symbolically (waxing = approaching fullness/revelation). The timeframe is present at setup and closure, and the moon's glow is causally active across vision beats. However, the "waxing" quality does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Lena could paint under any moon phase for the same number of nights. The element functions more as atmospheric anchor than a live clock that alters moves. Functional and consistent, but replaceable with "full moon" or "clear night" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to prove strangers remember kindness—is dramatized through Lena's obsessive painting, her certainty that the symbols mean something, and culminates in her message to Deshi: "the language...that means someone was kind to me once and I have never forgotten." The desire drives the eleven-day insomnia and catalog work. Friction appears in the cost (exhaustion, compulsion) and the final release when validation arrives. Setup implicit early (why is she painting?), clarified by the Chengdu memory mid-story, and resolved at closure. Strong thematic and causal work. Caps prevent 8.5+: the motivation is more interpretive frame than a choice-forcing dilemma (Lena never doubts the search is worth the cost or faces a competing need that would test her commitment on the page).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" appears once in the final paragraph, naming the greenhouse's atmosphere as Lena lies down. The descriptor charges the closure image with warm, contemplative color and links tonally to the moonlight and lyric register sustained throughout. Setup is absent (saffron is not seeded earlier), but the tone of methodical hope, lyric compression, and restrained emotionality coheres across all beats and modulates appropriately (urgent cataloging → weeping vision → quiet release). The single late naming prevents higher integration score, but the tonal effect it names is present structurally. Functional reprise that reweights the ending but does not drive beats or constrain choices.</comment>
