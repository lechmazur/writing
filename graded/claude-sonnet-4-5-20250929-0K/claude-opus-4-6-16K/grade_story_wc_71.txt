<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is a coherent noticer whose interior texture remains consistent—the specificity of "woman who could feel a town reshaping itself by degrees" anchors her perceptual signature. Her investigation into displaced objects and the orris root placement reflect micro-choices that alter present stance, and the final act of placing the shard forecloses a path (she steps away, the house breathes, she walks home). Internal contradiction is limited: she observes but does not struggle against competing impulses, which keeps her in the upper-mid band. No diagnostic label-speak mars peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren places the orris root, feels the "faintest ignition," and the bungalow takes its first breath—options are reconfigured with conceptual cost (sanctification through unknowing care). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through cataloging, the orris root crystallizes understanding, and the final placement shifts meaning. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (Maren, Briar Bay, evening, spring). One meaningful tightening occurs when the orris root "crystallized everything," narrowing her investigation to a test at Tide Street. Cost is felt in the quiet closure image: she steps back, the house breathes, "nobody would notice"—the price is her solitary knowledge and the invisible labor of sanctification.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and filtered through Maren's noticer lens: "streetlights flickered on but hadn't yet committed," "water shifting from iron-gray to something almost tender," spring pressing "by another imperceptible degree." The bay and the bungalow on Tide Street constrain her final choice—she places the shard on the windowsill inside the open porch, spatial choreography clear. Micro-setting (the orris root shard, the windowsill congregation) charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, balanced across sight, smell, and touch without catalog excess. The environment subtly mirrors internal states (spring's "quiet insistence" parallels Maren's patient investigation) without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "why did some houses feel alive while others were merely shelters?" One meaningful tightening occurs when the orris root "crystallized everything," narrowing her question to a test. The final act—placing the shard at the hollow bungalow—is protagonist-driven agency that forecloses a path (she walks home, leaving the house to breathe). Cost is legible: she performs sanctification that "nobody would notice," accepting solitary knowledge as the price. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through cataloging displaced objects, the grandmother's artifact, and the test at Tide Street. No explicit antagonist is required; the mystery itself provides coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: "the objects didn't make houses alive. The displacement did." The orris root shard functions as a recurring image that reweights meaning—from grandmother's relic to test object to sanctification tool. The final image offers a non-literal answer: "Every migration was a sanctification performed in ignorance," charged by the marble rolling toward "a house that needed it." No thematic echo or moralizing mars the ending; instead, the closure image (bungalow breathing, streetlights committing, marble rolling) resonates without stating a thesis. Subtext operates through gesture and implication: Maren's solitary walks, her palm on the clapboard, the "hushed blaze" she feels. Earned wisdom arises from her cataloging and the orris root placement, avoiding platitudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "creeping normality," "the streetlights seemed to daydream," "a shard of hush itself." Distance remains controlled; narrative certainty matches Maren's knowledge without leaps. Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated: "affliction—or her gift," "inadvertently profound," "hushed blaze." No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy. Free indirect style is clean: "She understood now. A house becomes alive the way a person does—not through any single dramatic event but..." Rhythmic control holds under the accumulative pressure, with sentence variety supporting the quiet intensification. One minor register drift: "inadvertently profound" reads slightly elevated for the POV's texture, but it occurs once and does not recur at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with high information density: "streetlights flickered on but hadn't yet committed to their purpose—that liminal moment when they seemed to daydream" does three jobs (setting, mood, voice). Figurative language is controlled and purposeful: "shard of hush," "hushed blaze," "violet ghost." No paraphrase loops or synonym churn mar the text. One templated stem appears: "She [verb]" opens multiple sentences in the final third ("She placed," "She waited," "She stepped," "She walked"), triggering a minor penalty. Metaphors remain coherent without contradiction. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively. Sentence variety supports rhythm without algorithmic patterns.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The core premise—sanctification through displaced objects—offers a fresh angle on "house as living entity" tropes by grounding aliveness in unconscious care and migration. Maren's noticer role transforms the observer archetype through specific cataloging and the orris root test. The final image (marble rolling toward a house that needs it) feels earned in hindsight, arising from prior cataloging and the sanctification concept. Emotional specificity avoids generic templates: her palm on the clapboard, the "faintest ignition," the violet ghost on her fingers. One proximity concern: "hushed blaze" and "shard of hush" echo lyric-essay conventions without full transformation, keeping the score in the upper-mid band. Risk-taking is moderate; the quiet, accumulative design heightens meaning without gimmickry but does not push structural boundaries.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren (creeping normality noticer) is present throughout and drives key turns: she catalogs houses, investigates displaced objects, retrieves the orris root, and places it at the bungalow—three distinct beats. Her observation leads to decisions that alter tactics (cataloging → investigation → test). Cost is visible: she accepts solitary knowledge, walks home alone. Early signal strong (first paragraph). Closure linkage solid (she places the shard, the house breathes). Causal pressure moderate: her choices enable the test but the sanctification concept does some lifting. Swappability low: a generic observer could not replicate her noticer trait without script changes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orris root shard appears in three beats: grandmother's cedar box ("crystallized everything"), placement on the windowsill, and the violet ghost on her fingers post-placement. Early signal at ~40% (midpoint). Causal pressure: enables the sanctification test at Tide Street. Closure linkage strong: "the orris root's violet ghost still on her fingers" charges the final image. Specificity high: "pale as bone," "smelled faintly of violets and earth," "shard of hush itself"—unique properties matter. Cost connection: her act of displacement sanctifies the bungalow, accepting invisible labor. Swappability low: no generic relic could replace its scent and symbolic freight without script rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" shapes the orris root's description ("a scent so quiet it was almost a shard of hush itself") and recurs in the final image ("hushed blaze"). Early signal at ~40% (orris root beat). Development moderate: the concept frames her understanding but does not constrain mid-scene choices—she catalogs, retrieves, and places the shard without the "hush" concept altering tactics. Closure participation indirect: "hushed blaze" modulates tone at the ending but does not redefine options. Lyric resonance partial: the phrase reweights the orris root's meaning but remains more thematic than causal. Swappability moderate: "quiet sanctification" or "silent blessing" could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" appears once as a descriptor when the orris root "crystallized everything" into an "inadvertently profound" understanding. Late first appearance (~40%). Development minimal: the trait labels her realization but does not constrain later action—she would place the shard regardless. Closure participation absent: the phrase does not recur or shape the final image. Ornamental: the label-only mention does not enable or disable a choice with cost. Swappability high: "unexpectedly deep" or "accidental insight" would fit with no structural impact. Causal pressure zero.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sanctification is the major action: she understands that displacement sanctifies ("Each migration was an act of unconscious sanctification"), then places the orris root to sanctify the bungalow—two beats. Early signal at ~40% (orris root insight). Causal pressure strong: the act enables the closure effect (bungalow breathing). Closure linkage solid: "Every migration was a sanctification performed in ignorance" charges the final image. Cost connection clear: she performs invisible labor, accepting that "nobody would notice." Swappability low: no generic blessing or ritual could replace the displacement-as-sanctification mechanic without major rewrites. Irreplaceability moderate: the concept is unique within the story, but the physical act (placing an object) is simple.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Through displaced objects" is the method: she catalogs which houses hold displaced objects (porcelain dog, brass doorknob, marble), finds the orris root (a displaced object from another city), and places it at the bungalow—three beats. Early signal strong (~25%: "Her investigation led her to displaced objects"). Causal pressure solid: the method enables both her investigation and the sanctification test. Closure linkage strong: the marble rolling toward a house charges the final image, reinforcing the method. Specificity high: the method's mechanics (migration, accumulation, breathing) are taught and paid off. Swappability low: no generic magic system could replace it without script rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Briar Bay in spring is present throughout: "crocuses shouldering through gravel," "water shifting from iron-gray to something almost tender," "bay gleamed under its half-hearted lights." Early signal strong (opening paragraph). Development moderate: the setting frames Maren's walks and the bungalow on Tide Street is the test site, but geography does not constrain choices—she could place the shard anywhere. Closure participation indirect: "the bay held still, and spring pressed forward" modulates tone but does not alter the sanctification outcome. Micro-setting (windowsill, river stone, rusted key) charges the final image more than the macro bay setting. Swappability moderate: a different coastal town in spring would fit with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" is the timeframe: "arriving precisely when the streetlights flickered on but hadn't yet committed," recurring at the bungalow ("The streetlights were daydreaming again") and closure ("The streetlights finally committed to their glow"). Early signal strong (first paragraph). Development weak: the timeframe does not tighten decisions or constrain tactics—Maren could place the shard at any hour without altering stakes. Closure participation lyric: the streetlights committing charges the final image but does not redefine options. Specificity moderate: "daydream" is a distinctive metaphor. Swappability moderate: twilight or dusk would fit with minor edits. Cost connection absent: no price is tied to this window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To understand why some houses feel alive" is Maren's motivation: stated early ("the question consumed her"), drives her cataloging and investigation, and is answered by the orris root insight and sanctification test—three beats. Early signal strong (~15%). Causal pressure solid: the desire drives her investigation and the placement at Tide Street. Closure linkage strong: "she understood now" and "Maren understood" frame the resolution. Friction minimal: no competing want complicates the pursuit, which limits cost visibility—she succeeds without trade-off. Swappability low: a generic mystery would not capture the noticer-specific question without rewrites. Cost connection moderate: her solitary knowledge is the price, legible in "nobody would notice."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is the tone: "hushed blaze behind the walls," "the faintest ignition, like a match struck in a cathedral. Not fire. Warmth," and the quiet closure where "the bungalow on Tide Street took its first breath in months. Nobody would notice." Early signal at ~60% (bungalow beat). Coherence strong: the tone modulates from investigation to sanctification without static mood, supporting the accumulative pressure. Closure charge solid: the hushed intensity ("match struck in a cathedral," "marble rolled... quiet journey") charges the final image. Specificity high: the oxymoron "hushed blaze" is distinctive and irreplaceable. Swappability low: "quiet intensity" or "gentle fire" would lose the paradox. Cost connection indirect: the tone reflects the invisible labor but does not constrain a choice.</comment>
