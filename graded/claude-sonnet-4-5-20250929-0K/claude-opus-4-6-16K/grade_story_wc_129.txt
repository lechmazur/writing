<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sable's motivation to graft onto community is clear and sustained, and her sculptor's recognition of Cael's technique provides embodied expertise. However, the piece delivers most interiority through summary ("She had been solitary too long") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Ren's "boldly sympathetic" trait is labeled but never shown through a difficult on-page choice with visible cost. The final dedication feels ceremonial rather than a choice that forecloses a path; the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: weeks of searching accumulate pressure through shared silence and discovered glyphs, culminating in Cael's reveal and the arbor dedication. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—three hands on the arbor reweight "belonging" from longing to reconstruction. The cost is felt but not foregrounded: Sable's solitary identity and the marshlands' erasure are accepted rather than dramatized as trade-offs in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vivid and purposeful; the arbor functions as both spatial anchor and charged object at closure. The marsh-reed stylus and "pressure patterns" ground Sable's expertise in tactile detail. Spatial choreography across the orchard's rows is clear. The crater's shimmer and "liquid gold" air recur to charge the final image, and the arbor's cold surface holding Sable's warmth is a micro-setting choice that alters the emotional register of the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grafting onto community—is signaled early and sustained. The shared search provides a method that tightens Sable and Ren's bond through weeks of tracing glyphs. Discovery of Cael and the arbor dedication offer one meaningful deepening that reweights belonging from absence to presence. However, escalation is largely offstage ("weeks they followed"); no on-page reversal tests Sable's commitment before the elders grant permission. The cost at closure (accepting displacement as permanent) is legible but muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—belonging as patient graft rather than instant absorption—emerges through the craft metaphor and the arbor as living archive. The final image (three hands, sap beginning to flow) reweights prior longing without stating a moral. "Luminescent ache" shifts from longing to warmth through accretion of shared silence and Cael's waiting. However, "the lost languages...did not feel so far away" risks slight thematic summary; the image of hands on glass already carries that resonance without verbal assistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and controlled: "the way light passed through...aching and beautiful at once" establishes poetic diction that remains consistent under pressure. Perceptual signature filters setting through Sable's sculptor's eye (cambium layers, pressure patterns). Free indirect style is clean. However, Ren and Cael lack distinct speech or internal idiom; Ren's dialogue is minimal and Cael is silent, so voice distinction cannot be tested. Brief elevation ("dissolution into silence," "diaspora") fits the tone but nudges toward abstraction in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines layer setting, emotion, and thematic weight. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor figurative density in the opening ("prismatic veins," "nest holds an egg," "cambium layers") front-loads metaphor but does not obscure causality. "The webs of kinship between them tightened" is a slight cliché that duplicates the graft metaphor. The final paragraph's stacked short sentences ("The orchard hummed. The crater shimmered.") risk light incantation but remain propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The graft-as-belonging metaphor is specific and sustained through Sable's craft expertise. The silent-communication premise and marsh-people diaspora offer fresh context. However, the "lost elder who has been waiting" and "elders grant permission after a quest" are recognizable templates. Emotional arc (loneliness to warmth) is authentic but not surprising. The piece commits fully to its lyric register and the arbor-as-living-archive synthesis feels earned, lifting the score within its band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sable is present throughout. Her sculptor's eye identifies Cael's technique (middle beat) and she carves three names at closure (payoff). However, her key "choices"—to search with Ren, to weep at Cael's reveal—are more reactive than decisional. The dedication is granted by elders rather than won through a dilemma Sable resolves. Setup and payoff gates met; causal pressure modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The obsidian arbor is introduced in paragraph four, described as the orchard's heart where names mark belonging. It reappears at closure as the site where Sable carves three names and presses her palm, feeling warmth held by cold glass. Two beats (introduction, dedication) plus closure participation. The arbor's "dark branches catching light" and tactile properties (cold surface, carved surface) matter. Essential to the ending; specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Webs of kinship" is named early ("their webs of kinship drawn tight") and used to describe Sable and Ren's bond tightening. It frames the dominant stake but does not constrain a specific on-page choice with cost. The concept shapes theme more than tactics. Setup and thematic reprise present; middle development weak. Lyric-resonance allowance applies but causal pressure modest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Ren is labeled "boldly sympathetic" in one paragraph: "he would hold a stranger's hand...weep openly...offer his food." But no on-page scene dramatizes these behaviors under pressure. He offers the tag-search idea and accompanies Sable, yet no moment shows his sympathy creating a tradeoff or complication. Present but ornamental; label without action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Dedicate" is signaled early (elders say new carving allowed) and is the story's climactic act: Sable uses her sculptor's knife to carve three names into the arbor. The action redefines Sable's status from outsider to member and is the mechanism of closure. Two beats (setup via Ren's explanation, payoff at ending) plus closure participation. Causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "shared search for an elusive street artist's tag" is introduced by Ren as the method to earn a new carving. Sable and Ren trace spiraling glyphs for weeks, and the search culminates in finding Cael. Setup, middle (weeks of following marks), and payoff all present. However, the mechanics of the search are summarized ("weeks they followed the trail") rather than shown in beats that constrain tactics. Two-gate-plus-summary: eligible for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard is introduced in the opening line and returns at closure ("crystal branches above scattered the crater's glow"). It supplies the arbor (a pressure point) and the setting for Sable and Ren's search. However, the orchard itself does not constrain a choice—Sable could have searched anywhere. It charges atmosphere and the final image but does not alter tactics. Lyric reprise with thematic weight; modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" establishes a post-lingual era in paragraph two. It frames tone and world logic (communication through craft, gesture) but imposes no time pressure or deadline. The phrase recurs at closure ("the lost languages...did not feel so far away") as thematic echo, not tactic constraint. Present as atmospheric frame; no clock function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sable's desire "to graft herself onto community" is introduced early and sustained: she wants alignment "not by force, but by patient alignment." The search with Ren and the arbor dedication are both motivated by this want. The graft metaphor is literalized through her sculptor's expertise. Friction between want (belonging) and cost (accepting permanent displacement) is implied but not dramatized as a dilemma. Setup, development, payoff all present; causal pressure high; visible tradeoff modest.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is introduced in the opening line ("aching and beautiful at once") and returns at closure ("the luminescent ache shift from longing into something warmer"). The tone modulates from longing to warmth, supporting the Accumulative lens and charging the final image. Coherent through turns; the ache-to-warmth shift mirrors Sable's arc. Purposeful modulation elevates this above static mood.</comment>
