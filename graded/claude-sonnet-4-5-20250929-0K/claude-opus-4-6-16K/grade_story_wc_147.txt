<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—her oxygen countdown creates visceral pressure, and the choice to stay versus flee is dramatized through sensory detail and memory intrusion. Her decision to "unsnarl the mechanism" by overriding panic shows internal contradiction acting in scene. The final choice carries visible cost (eight minutes of air spent), though the convenient rescue arrival slightly undercuts the stakes. Minor deduction for the academic framing ("doctoral advisor saying...") which reads slightly stock.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors cleanly (temple, Maren, oxygen crisis) within the first paragraph. The core turn—staying to engage the vial rather than fleeing—narrows options and is motivated by her scholarly drive and the temple's memory-touching mechanism. Closure effect is a Decisive Change (she ascends with the vial and rescue arrives), but the rescue submersible's arrival reads as external convenience rather than earned causality, softening the cost. The escalation from discovery to engagement to ascent is legible, but the deus ex machina rescue prevents full closure mastery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underwater temple is vividly realized through bioluminescent coral, basalt plinth, and suspended silt; the setting constrains choice (limited oxygen, depth, current) and charges the final image (ascending through black water). Sensory hierarchy is consistent with Maren's POV—she notices carvings and architectural detail filtered through her scholarly lens. The crystal vial as micro-setting object anchors the central action. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: survive versus document/engage the temple's mystery. The oxygen countdown provides a live ticking clock that tightens pressure through three time-checks (fourteen, eight minutes). Maren's agency—choosing to "slow her breathing, and stay" rather than flee—drives the key turn and forecloses the safe option with visible cost (air consumed). The rescue arrival diminishes earned resolution slightly, as it solves the survival problem externally. One meaningful tightening (the choice to touch the vial) is present and driven by protagonist decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the temple-as-memory-engine conceit: "what vanishes can also endure." The vial and carvings concretize the ephemeral-versus-preservation question without overt statement. The final image—"carrying three thousand years of borrowed memory"—resonates as a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the "gathered hush" motif and the choice to stay, which dramatizes the scholar's willingness to risk mortality for proof of continuity. No explicit moralizing mars the ending, though "proof that the fleeting matters" edges toward thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; perceptual signature is distinct (scholarly, attuned to architecture and memory). Diction is elevated but consistent with an academic narrator under pressure: "lonesome splendor," "gathered hush," "architecture designed to harness the ephemeral." Psychic distance tightens during the vial sequence. No head-hopping. Voice modulates appropriately with urgency (short sentences at "Eight minutes of air"). Minor pressure from occasional stock academic phrasing ("born for deep places"), but the prose signature is coherent and purpose-driven.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high—most sentences advance situation, character perception, or thematic texture. Figurative language ("ribs of some enormous sleeping creature," "light spooled from its facets") is vivid and coherent, though density is high across multiple beats without strict necessity. Sentence openings vary. Clarity is strong; no pronoun ambiguity or sequencing errors. The opening and closing lines anchor and resolve effectively. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in the middle passages (stacked metaphors in quick succession), but none obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The memory-touching temple and perfume-vial-as-preservation-vessel offer a fresh synthesis of ancient architecture and ephemeral experience. The underwater setting adds constraint and urgency. The core conceit—architecture as memory machine—is specific and non-obvious. Execution is strong, though the distress-signal-and-rescue frame is more conventional. The emotional arc (scholar's obsession overriding survival instinct) is grounded in particular sensory and memory triggers rather than generic epiphany. Transformation test passes: the specifics of carved memory and crystal vial are integral.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maren sends the distress signal in the opening exposition ("she had sent the distress signal forty minutes ago") but it does not create a key turn or constrain her choices; the signal is passive setup. The rescue submersible's arrival at the end is a consequence, not a decision by Maren. Setup present, no middle development, closure participation is external/passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears at the sanctuary center, is handled and understood ("she understood at once"), is lifted from the plinth with light and warmth effects, and is carried to the surface in the final image ("the crystal warm against her chest"). It drives the key choice (stay and engage versus flee) and charges the closure. Early signal, two distinct beats (discovery, lifting/light), causal pressure, closure linkage, high specificity, and cost connection all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" is named twice—once early ("lonesome splendor") and again at the vial sequence ("The gathered hush of the temple settled around her"). It shapes her choice to stay and slow her breathing, constraining panic and enabling the unsnarling action. Setup and middle development present; closure participation is indirect (she carries memory, not hush). Causal role in one major beat; purposeful reprise reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The carvings' memory-touching trait is introduced early ("the carvings were doing something"), demonstrated through multiple sensory intrusions (rosemary kitchen, father reading, first kiss, advisor's words), and enables Maren's understanding of the vial's purpose. It constrains her initial disorientation and propels her decision to engage the mechanism. Early signal, middle development (multiple memory beats), and shapes the ending choice. Visible tradeoff: time spent experiencing memories costs oxygen.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" is named explicitly ("To unsnarl the mechanism") and defines the key action: staying, slowing breath, touching the vial until "tumblers of ancient purpose clicking into alignment." It drives the major turn from fleeing to engaging. Setup in middle third, active in peak beat, and the resolution (light, warmth, vial lifted) traces directly to this action. Causal pressure and closure linkage present; somewhat swappable with "activate" but the specificity of mechanical imagery matters.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"By overriding instinct" is signaled early ("Every instinct told her to take the vial and kick hard") and its mechanics matter: she must "override that panicked drive, slow her breathing, and stay." The method shapes the peak choice and is enacted on the page (closing eyes, setting hand on vial without pulling away). Early signal, middle development through breathing control, and closure participation (the override enables the vial's activation). Causal pressure, cost connection, and irreplaceability all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater temple is introduced immediately, provides all sensory and spatial grounding (entrance arch, columns, sanctuary center, plinth), and supplies the memory-touching carvings and vial that drive the entire plot. It constrains choice through depth, limited oxygen, and current. The setting is indispensable: remove the temple and the story collapses. Early signal, multiple beats, causal pressure, closure linkage (she ascends from it), high specificity, and cost connection (time/oxygen spent inside).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is tracked precisely (forty minutes since signal, twenty minutes oxygen at start, fourteen minutes, eight minutes) and tightens every decision. The live countdown narrows Maren's window to flee versus stay, directly shaping the peak choice. Early signal, multiple beats (three time-checks), causal pressure (each check raises cost of staying), and closure linkage (she ascends with minimal air). The clock is essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is dramatized through Maren's engagement with the memory-touching carvings and the vial's purpose ("to bottle what vanishes"). Her choice to stay and activate the mechanism enacts this desire with visible cost (oxygen consumed). The motivation is conflicted—scholarly obsession versus survival—and shapes the key turn. Early signal (she came "to document"), middle development (understanding the vial), and closure participation (she carries "borrowed memory" up). Friction between wants and costs is legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is named explicitly early ("that was the only phrase for it") and sustained through descriptions of violet-and-gold coral, gathered hush, and "colors she had no names for." Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (urgency at time-checks, awe at the vial sequence). The final image ("ascending toward a surface she could not yet see but refused to stop believing in") carries the tone's blend of solitude and grandeur. Reprise charges the ending but does not reweight prior material dramatically.</comment>
