<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's contradictory impulses are embodied throughout: she writes relief checks while studying drought imagery, holds the egg at night with "something vestigial," and closes her eyes "against a sting she would never admit to." Her moral calculus is consistent and character-particular—she does the math knowing it's not moral, simply executing it. The final renunciation (walking away without looking back, denying sentimentality) is earned by prior causality and forecloses emotional engagement with visible cost. Minor deduction: the "vestigial" emotion and final denial feel slightly over-articulated rather than fully embodied in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered backstory (three-year engineering project, egg acquisition, decade of digitization) that all converges at the salt flat closure. The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—the speaker array activated, egg placed as sentinel, call following her across the flat—reconfiguring the manufactured suffering into permanent echo with conceptual cost made undeniable in the final image. One meaningful deepening (the convergence of all prior acts into the release) is sufficient for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The salt flat is vividly realized—"white and blinding," "broken mirror," crystals refracting light, boot-crunch texture—and constrains the protagonist's choice by providing the convergence coordinates read from the fracture map. The micro-setting (the exact spot where seven tributaries meet) charges the final image by anchoring the speaker array and egg as altar offering. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's engineered-drought perspective. No occupational depth issues; the setting directly enables the closure action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving extinct birdcalls through manufactured drought—is signaled early and braided tightly with the moral cost (11,000 displaced). The tightening occurs on-page: Elara kneels, opens the case, sets the egg at precise coordinates, activates the array. This is protagonist-driven agency (decision and renunciation) that forecloses emotional engagement with visible cost—she walks away without looking back, the call following her. The escalation deepens via accumulation (three years, fourteen million, a decade of work) converging into a single irreversible act. Minor gap: the physical act of placement feels slightly muted in pressure compared to the conceptual stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the manufactured drought as ink for a map, suffering as currency, the egg as relic and altar offering. The final image—walking away while the call follows—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether preservation justifies harm, reweighting prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the "sting she would never admit to" and the vestigial emotion, avoiding overt philosophizing. The night-heron's call "fractured and graceful" charges the closure without meta-commentary. No thematic echo or sermonizing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Elara's perceptual signature: she sees fractures as "cartography of thirst," the egg's blue as "sky reflected in still water," and frames displacement in calculated arithmetic. Diction is controlled and purpose-driven—"vestigial," "cartography," "sentinel"—matching her engineered precision. Psychic distance modulates intentionally: close during the egg-handling, pulling back for the manufactured-drought exposition, tightening again at closure. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the compression of backstory remains anchored to present stimuli (kneeling, opening case, activating array).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive with high information density: "She had paid fourteen million dollars to make them" delivers motive, scale, and culpability in one line. Rhythm varies naturally—short declaratives ("Nothing did. Nothing would.") contrast with longer, layered sentences. Minor loop detected: "suffering was its ink" and "map she had tortured from the land" restate the same metaphor without added pressure (−0.2). One template-cadence run: "She had calculated this. She had also calculated..." feels mechanically parallel (−0.3). No figurative muddle in peak beats; the final image is clear and propulsive. Scaffold is minimal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of amoral philanthropy, manufactured drought as mapmaking tool, and extinct-species preservation through permanent audio installation is specific and non-obvious. The moral calculus (11,000 displaced vs. permanent species silence) avoids false equivalence—Elara commits fully without redemption or balance. The twist that "restoration" means redirection, and that suffering draws the map to nesting grounds, feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in presenting an irredeemable protagonist whose calculus the text neither condemns nor endorses heightens stakes without gimmickry (+0.3 within band). Minor deduction: the "last known egg" + "private collection in Zurich" reads slightly familiar as a setup.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara's amorality drives every key turn: funding the watershed project to manufacture drought, acquiring the egg to outbid the museum, calculating displacement against species silence, and walking away without sentimentality. Her choices constrain later tactics (the speaker array must be placed at the convergence point she engineered) and charge the closure (the release is irreversible, the cost undeniable). Setup, development, and payoff all present. Specificity high: her particular brand of calculus—"goodness was a currency she spent freely"—is irreplaceable. Cost visible: she forecloses emotional engagement and accepts permanent moral debt.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The egg appears in three distinct beats: acquisition from Zurich (backstory anchor), night-time hotel handling ("something vestigial"), and placement beside the speaker array at closure. Its pale blue shell "speckled with pigment that had faded to the faintest bronze" is specific and charged. It shapes the closure as "altar offering, relic and reliquary both," reweighting prior suffering into permanent sentinel. Causal pressure moderate: the egg itself does not narrow options (the speaker array does the preservation work) but it charges the final image with symbolic and emotional cost. Strong closure linkage and specificity lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The manufactured drought is the central mechanism that drives every tactic: it redirects tributaries, creates the fracture map, displaces 11,000 people, and enables the coordinate discovery. Setup early ("She had paid fourteen million dollars to make them"), development across multiple beats (watching satellite imagery, studying fracture patterns), and payoff at closure (the convergence point where the speaker is placed). Causal pressure high: without the drought, no map, no coordinates, no placement. Cost undeniable: the moral arithmetic is on the page. Specificity and irreplaceability strong; the exact mechanics (dam system, tributary redirection) matter.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's sentimentality is signaled early ("something in her chest she had long ago decided was vestigial"), constrains her final stance ("Sentimentality, she told herself, was a weakness she could not afford"), and charges the closure contradiction—she lets the call follow her despite the denial. The trait enables on-page cost: the "sting she would never admit to" and the walk-away without looking back are direct renunciations of acknowledged feeling. Setup and payoff present; development moderate (the hotel-room egg-turning is brief). The cost is felt but slightly abstract—more label than embodied micro-choice in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The speaker-array release is the story's irreversible climax: "She activated the array. The night-heron's call rose across the flat, thin and ancient and startling." Every prior action (drought engineering, fracture-map reading, egg acquisition, decade of digitization) enables this single moment. It redefines options permanently—voices will outlast her sins, cannot be taken away, and the cost (displacement, moral debt, foreclosed sentiment) is undeniable. Setup strong (digitizing, restoring, encoding across a decade), development present (building the array to last fifty years), payoff decisive. Causal pressure maximal; swapping the release for another action would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crack-map mechanics are signaled early ("The fissures ran in every direction, deep and deliberate, a cartography of thirst"), developed through the backstory ("watching the fracture patterns emerge across two hundred miles"), and directly shape the closure ("the precise coordinates the riverbed fractures had indicated, the convergence point of seven dried tributaries whose cracks formed an arrow pointing here"). The method constrains her tactics: she must read the bones, find the convergence, and place the array there. Specificity high: the arrow formed by seven tributaries is irreplaceable. Cost tied to method: 11,000 displaced to draw the map.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The Arden Salt Flat is the only location where the convergence coordinates exist, directly constraining Elara's placement choice. It supplies the resource (the fracture-arrow) that enables the speaker installation. The setting charges the closure image: "white expanse," "crystalline surface," "barren cathedral" where thousands once gathered. Micro-setting (the exact convergence spot) alters tactics—she kneels, presses her palm, sets the egg. Setup, development, and payoff all present. Specificity strong: the flat's dried-riverbed geology is the mechanism. Cost connection clear: the manufactured drought created this exact landscape.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The thunder-lull timeframe is signaled in the opening ("thunder rolled somewhere beyond the Kessler Range") and brackets the closure ("The thunder shifted closer. Rain was coming"). It creates urgency: Elara must complete the placement before rain erases the fracture map. The lull allows the ritual ("in the lull between one rumble and the next, she opened the case") and charges the final image (the call persists as rain approaches). Time tightens decisions moderately—she walks away knowing erasure is imminent. Setup and payoff clear; development present but not intensified across beats. The clock shapes mood more than forcing a hard tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Preserving extinct birdcalls is the stated motive, established early ("the Arden night-heron's call...would be lost within a decade without intervention") and dramatized through decade-long digitization work and the speaker-array engineering. Friction between want and cost is on the page: 11,000 displaced vs. permanent species silence, and the vestigial emotion she denies. The motivation shapes every tactic (funding the drought, acquiring the egg, studying fractures) and charges the closure (the release transforms suffering into echo). Setup, development, and payoff all present. Cost visible: moral debt and foreclosed sentiment. The desire is complex, not purely altruistic—she needs to believe the preservation justifies the harm.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fractured-grace tone is established immediately—"killed a river to read its bones," "sky bruised with clouds that refused to weep," "cartography of thirst"—and modulates under pressure: clinical during the moral arithmetic, elegiac at the egg-handling, crystalline at closure ("fractured and graceful"). The tone charges the final image: walking away as the call follows, sentimentality denied yet allowed. Coherence strong across turns; diction and rhythm support the accumulative lens. The juxtaposition of beauty (pale blue egg, salt crystals refracting light) and brutality (displacement, manufactured drought) is consistent and purposeful. No single static mood; the tone deepens from calculated to conflicted to resonant.</comment>
