<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and specific—glass-artist perception colors every observation. The internal contradiction between her former identity and emerging purpose drives micro-choices (cataloging frost, encoding coordinates in glass). The final choice to follow the coordinates is earned by the ledger discovery and frost-pattern decoding. Minor deduction: the attempt on her life remains abstract; we never see her weigh concrete fear against the pull of her father's path, which would sharpen the cost of her decision.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (Maren, canyon floor, post-assassination attempt) by the second paragraph. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the pendant around her neck and the decision to leave crystallize her transformation from fugitive to active inheritor with felt cost (she will expose herself by retracing her father's path). One meaningful deepening occurs when frost patterns unlock the ledger's coordinates, narrowing her options from passive hiding to purposeful pursuit. The cost is legible in "Tomorrow she would leave…she did not know what she would find"—uncertainty now charged with commitment.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The canyon is not postcard; frost geometry on rock shelves constrains her decoding method and charges the breakthrough moment. The portable kiln at canyon floor enables the glass pendant, a tactical choice that ties micro-setting (kiln, sandstone, narrow sky slot) to survival logic. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through glass-artist priorities: "feathered patterns," "branching logic," "light trapped in glass." The final image—canyon walls humming with "drifting resonance"—reconfigures the setting from refuge to threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: decode her father's scorched testament and claim her place in the resistance. One meaningful tightening: frost unlocks coordinates, shifting her from passive study to active pursuit. Agency is clear—she chooses to fire the kiln, encode the pendant, and leave the canyon. Cost is visible: exposing herself by following the coordinates. Minor deduction: the assassination attempt itself is off-page, so the opening pressure feels reported rather than lived; we trust her fear without feeling its visceral grip in a dramatized beat.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: glass as transformation medium, pauses as sites of heat-gathering before shaping. The frost-to-symbol decoding and the pendant as "scorched testament" answer the central question (how to inherit her father's purpose) without stating a moral. "Pauses were not emptiness…spaces where transformation gathered its heat" risks didacticism but is earned by the cataloging discipline and the kiln firing. The final image—pendant against stars, slow exhale—offers non-literal resonance. One hairline slip: "Purpose…did not arrive as a blaze" edges toward overt theme statement, though the context (her glass-work patience) grounds it.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is glass-artist specific: "light…sang in colors that had no proper names," "heat moved through material," "sand became liquid became solid became prism." Psychic distance is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Diction remains within Maren's lexicon—technical precision (molten silica, feathered frost patterns, branching motif) never drifts into corporate register. Rhythm modulates cleanly from urgency ("they tried to kill her") to meditative pacing ("the quiet here was not silence but a living stillness"). No dialogue to judge. Zero filter-verb stacks or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("frost gave her the key," "glass…its own scorched testament"). Two deductions in the −0.6 range: (1) "the quiet here was not silence but a living stillness" and "the pauses were not emptiness" both deploy the "not X but Y" template within high-pressure reflection, creating mild cadence stiffness; (2) "a thread that connected who she had been before the attempt to whoever she might become after" is abstract scaffolding that could compress to "a thread between who she was and who she might become." These do not touch the closure beat but dull momentum in the opening third.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of glass-working logic applied to frost-pattern cryptography feels specific and non-obvious. "Steadily adaptive…always translating between mediums" transforms the mentor-legacy trope into a disciplinary method. The pendant as encoded coordinates is a fresh inflection on "hidden message" mechanics. Minor deduction: the assassination attempt and resistance-cell premise lean on familiar thriller scaffolding; the emotional core (daughter inheriting covert father's mission) is executed well but not structurally novel. The frost-decoding turn is the story's most original beat and charges the ending cleanly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Maren's glass-artist identity is signaled in the opening line and drives the closure: she catalogues frost patterns using glass-working logic, fires a portable kiln, and encodes coordinates in a pendant. Her choices—decoding through disciplinary translation, creating durable testimony—are irreplaceable; a non-artist character would require different mechanics. She appears in every beat and the final image hinges on "light trapped in glass." Cost: she must expose herself by retracing the path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The ledger strip is unrolled across her knee in paragraph three, annotated with symbols matched to scorch marks (two beats: discovery, decoding). On the fourth morning, frost patterns map onto a ledger sequence to yield coordinates (middle beat). The ledger's transformation from "fuel merchant" record to resistance key drives the central turn. It does not appear in the final paragraph, but the pendant encodes its coordinates, so closure participation is indirect yet causal. High irreplaceability: swapping for "coded letter" would lose the charcoal/fire motif.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>"Scorched testament" is named twice: scorch marks on workshop walls encode symbols, and the glass pendant becomes "its own scorched testament, persistent and luminous." The concept shapes stakes (decode father's message) and the climactic choice (encode in glass for durability). It constrains tactics—she must translate between burn patterns and frost geometry. Present in setup (scorch marks), middle (decoding), and payoff (pendant as new testament). Cost: making herself visible by carrying encoded proof. Swappability check: replacing "scorched" with "hidden" would weaken the fire/glass/heat motif but not break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>"Steadily adaptive" is labeled in paragraph five: "always finding the adjacent discipline that unlocked the stubborn one, always translating between mediums." The trait enables the key turn—she decodes the ledger by cataloging frost, a cross-disciplinary leap. It also drives the pendant solution (encode in glass what paper cannot survive). The attribute is demonstrated on the page with visible cost (days of dawn sketching, patient discipline she "never possessed before"). Swappability: "resourceful" could substitute with minor loss, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>"Retrace" is announced in paragraph two ("retrace something she could not yet articulate") and fulfilled in the final paragraph ("retrace her father's path through the mountains"). The action defines the dominant stake: decode coordinates to follow the resistance trail. It drives the middle turn (frost decoding produces a route) and the closure choice (she will leave the canyon and expose herself). Removing "retrace" would require a different verb ("follow," "pursue"), which would preserve function but lose the motif of recovery and inheritance. High causal integration, present in all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Frost patterns are cataloged starting paragraph five and reappear each morning. The method is signaled ("sketching the frost geometry at dawn") and its mechanics matter: "frost patterns echoed the branching logic of her father's symbols." On the fourth morning, frost supplies the decoding key (coordinates). The pendant's layered colors encode coordinates "in a language only another glass artist would recognize," linking frost-reading to glass-working. Present in setup (cataloging ritual), middle beat (breakthrough), and indirectly in payoff (encoded pendant). Swapping frost for another natural pattern (e.g., star positions) would work but lose the dawn/ephemeral urgency.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The canyon supplies cold sandstone for sitting, rock shelves for frost, and a floor for the kiln. It provides refuge ("quiet…living stillness") and a deadline (sun erases frost at dawn, forcing early study). The "narrow slot of sky" and "canyon walls hummed with drifting resonance" charge the final image. Present in setup, used tactically in the middle (frost on rock shelves), and returned at closure. Cost: isolation that allows focus but also vulnerability. Swappability: another remote refuge (desert cave, mountain cabin) would function with minor edits, capping the score near mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"Three weeks ago" anchors the post-attempt timeframe and "fourth morning" tracks her canyon study. The time element adds urgency (she is still a target) and frames her transformation ("patience she had never possessed before"). It does not tighten choices on the page—no pursuers close in, no deadline forces her hand. The ending shifts to "tomorrow she would leave," but this is her decision, not a time-driven necessity. Present in setup and closure framing but does not constrain middle beats. Functional but replaceable with "after the attempt" and generic duration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"To discover purpose in the pauses" is named explicitly in paragraph six and demonstrated through the cataloging ritual and the kiln firing ("purpose…arrived in the pauses, in the held breath"). The motivation drives her choice to stay in the canyon, decode patiently, and act only when the frost delivers the key. It contrasts with her former impatience, adding cost (she must endure uncertainty). Present in setup (she "could not yet articulate" what she sought), middle reflection (pauses as transformation sites), and closure (slow exhale before departure). Minor deduction: the motivation is stated more than shown in friction; we do not see her wrestle with impulse to flee versus the pull to linger.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"Drifting resonance" appears in the final paragraph ("canyon walls hummed with a drifting resonance") and is prepared by accumulative tone: "living stillness," "feathered patterns," "slow exhale," "luminous." The tone is coherent through turns—lyric patience in reflection, sharper urgency in the ledger discovery—and modulates appropriately. It charges the final image (pendant, stars, humming walls). The phrase itself is abstract but the texture (slow pacing, sensory drift, meditative interiority) is consistent. One deduction: "drifting resonance" as a label risks being ornamental if the reader cannot point to how resonance drifts (e.g., sound evolving, meaning shifting); here it works as atmosphere but not as dramatized phenomenon.</comment>
