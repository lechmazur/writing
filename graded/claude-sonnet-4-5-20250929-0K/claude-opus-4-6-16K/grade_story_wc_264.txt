<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Harsk's interior life is concrete and character-particular: the dreamlessness, the frozen clock as prayer, the cultivation work all flow from grief without therapy-speak. His motivation to "charm echoes into the archive" is embodied through the listening ritual and the micro-choice to hold still rather than reach. The daughter's presence is felt through specific details (age eight when forests burned, gone before thirteen) that anchor loss without summarizing it. Minor slip: the motivation could press harder against an internal contradiction—grief work reads consistent rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (bioluminescent dunes, archive work, wave functions) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Harsk cultivates one more spark, enriching the archive "by one almost-moment." The cost is visible—he remains "dreamless and awake," the clock silent, walking toward another unlit corner in an unending task. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening: the dune's song carries him into the interference pattern, he holds still, the echo settles. Causality coheres under the Accumulative lens; the final image reweights the opening's "strange new blooms" with the archive's purpose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glowing dune constrains the archive work: its fractured lullaby provides the interference pattern Harsk listens through, and the flowers' phosphorescent genes anchor the post-forest world with specificity. The chess clock functions as micro-setting, handled twice (placed on sand, brushed clean, held to ear) and charging the final beat. Sensory hierarchy filters through Harsk's professional lens (wave functions, resonance, interference patterns). Minor gap: spatial choreography is clean but the dune itself could press a tactical choice more directly—it enables rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: to cultivate sparks (echoes of lost timelines) into the archive. One meaningful tightening: Harsk listens through wave functions, detects a flicker of his daughter, resists reaching (which would "collapse the wrong things"), holds still instead—a renunciation that forecloses direct contact but preserves the archive echo. The cost is felt: another spark cultivated, but he remains dreamless, the clock silent, the daughter unreachable. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the final walk toward "another unlit corner" confirms the task's endlessness. No antagonist required; the barren real itself is the constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the frozen clock at midnight, dreamless sleep as "clean dark room," charm as singing "in the universe's broken language." The ending offers non-literal answer—archive work cannot resurrect but can preserve "divergent tenderness against the barren real"—without moralizing. The flowers' "fractured lullaby" and "colors the dead forests never knew" reweight the opening's "open wounds and strange new blooms." No prompt echo; the piece resists tidy resolution (Harsk walks on, dreamless) and embraces ambiguity with conceptual cost legible in the silent clock and endless task.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is character-specific: "the way a mind could build cathedrals from nothing," "charm their echoes… the way one might coax a frightened animal." Diction remains within Harsk's technical-contemplative register (wave functions, interference patterns, resonance) without corporate drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the listening ritual, pulling back for the final walk. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control under pressure: "He did not reach for it. Reaching collapsed the wrong things. Instead he held still…" compresses syntax at the key choice. No dialogue present to evaluate. The prose texture—long, lyric sentences with embedded clauses—reflects Harsk's contemplative mind consistently.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: "as though time itself had forfeited for both players" does three jobs (clock, chess metaphor, death). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the listening beat tightens syntax ("There—a flicker") then releases into the daughter's imagined speech. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor deduction: two instances of elevated diction ("coaxing them from the margins of probability the way one might coax a frightened animal"; "the vast and patient dark") approach purple without crossing, but the second phrase in the final line feels slightly decorative given the flowers already "kept singing." Overall propulsion is strong; no clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-apocalyptic setting, quantum-resonance archive, grief work—feels specific and non-obvious. "Divergent archive" as recorded almost-timelines transforms the tired multiverse trope through Harsk's micro-practice of listening and holding still. The chess clock frozen at midnight is a fresh grief anchor, tied causally to the daughter and the work. The flowers engineered with deep-sea genes offer verifiable specificity. Risk: the piece commits fully to its lyric-technical register and accumulative structure without retreat. Minor proximity concern: "cathedrals from nothing" evokes common dream imagery, but the line earns its place through voice. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact details.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Harsk appears throughout, and his choice to hold still rather than reach drives the key turn ("Reaching collapsed the wrong things"). The dreamlessness colors his perception (no architecture of dreaming, envies no nightmares) and contrasts with the archive work. His freight-guard past anchors backstory economically. Two beats: placing the clock, listening through wave functions; both shaped by his grief and discipline. Closure linked: he walks on "dreamless and awake." Cost visible: the silent clock, the endless task. Early signal (second paragraph). High causal pressure and closure linkage push this toward 8.0, but the choice is largely renunciation rather than active decision, which slightly limits band entry.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Chess clock handled in three distinct beats: introduced as prayer-weight in pocket, placed on sand before listening, brushed clean and held to ear at closure. Returns with reweighted meaning: "Silent, as always" but the archive is "richer now." The frozen midnight timestamps the daughter's death and mirrors the hold-still technique. Irreplaceable: no generic object could anchor both grief and method. Cost connection: its silence underscores the task's limits. Early signal (paragraph three). Causal pressure moderate (it anchors ritual but doesn't alter tactics). Closure linkage strong. Specificity high (both flags fallen, forfeited for both players).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Divergent archive shapes the dominant stake (cultivate sparks from almost-timelines) and defines Harsk's work. Mechanics introduced early (paragraph four: "not of what had happened, but of what had almost happened"). Method explained: resonance in rocks, dune flowers, old glass; wave functions collapse possibility into record. The archive is enriched "by one almost-moment" at closure—conceptual cost is legible (preservation without resurrection). Two beats: exposition of the archive's nature, the listening ritual that adds to it. Causal pressure solid: the work frames every choice. Swappability low: no generic "memory collection" would carry the quantum-resonance specificity. Setup and payoff present; middle development is conceptual rather than tactically altering a choice on the page, which prevents full high-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Occasionally everywhere" describes the archive's spatial nature (surfaces in hum of rocks, spiral patterns, light bent in glass). Signaled in paragraph four. Returns implicitly at closure when the echo "settled into the sand"—the dune becomes one site where the archive surfaces. Constraint: Harsk must find the right site and conditions to access it. Two beats: definition, use during listening ritual. Causal role moderate: it requires Harsk to travel and listen in specific places, but the trait doesn't force a visible tradeoff or block an option on the page. Cost connection indirect. Lyric reprise (archive resonance → sand as archive site) present. Not ornamental, but the attribute enables rather than meaningfully constrains, limiting band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Charm" is the method Harsk uses to coax echoes into the archive. Defined in paragraph five: "not to deceive… to sing back to the universe in its own broken language." Active in the key beat: he charms the flicker of his daughter by holding still. The action is irreplaceable—no generic "record" or "capture" carries the gentleness and negotiation implied. Two beats: definition, execution during listening. Closure linked: "Another spark, cultivated" restates the charm's success. Cost visible: he cannot reach, only coax. Early signal. Causal pressure solid. Swappability low. The action drives the turn but doesn't redefine all options or create a second major complication, preventing ≥8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Through wave functions" describes how Harsk accesses the archive. Introduced in paragraph four ("worked through wave functions, collapsing possibility into record"). Active in the listening beat: "listened through the wave functions, letting the dune's song carry him into the interference pattern." Mechanics matter: the method requires holding still to avoid collapsing "the wrong things." Two beats: exposition, use. Closure: the method succeeds, enriching the archive. Causal role moderate: it constrains his approach (must listen, not reach) but the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized as a tactical problem. Specificity high (quantum vocabulary). Cost connection present (wrong collapse if he reaches). Setup and payoff clear; middle development is conceptual, and the method could be more tactically tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glowing dune provides the interference pattern Harsk needs: the flowers emit "a faint harmonic when the temperature dropped," and their fractured lullaby carries him into the archive. Setting drives the beat: he sits among the flowers, the song enables the listening work. Micro-setting (the sand) receives the echo ("settled into the sand like rain into dry earth"). Two beats: arrival and description, active use during charm. Closure linked: "dunes that bloomed in colors the dead forests never knew" and "the flowers kept singing" recharge the opening image. Cost indirect but present: the setting offers the method but also underscores the barren real. Irreplaceable: no generic location would supply phosphorescent harmonic. Early signal. High causal and closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Timeframe established early (paragraph one: "eleven years ago… since then"). The post-forest world shapes all conditions: no trains, no rails, engineered flowers, the daughter's death timeline (age eight at burn, gone before thirteen). Setting and stakes arise from this history. Backstory is economically threaded (freight guard once, no dreams for seven years). Closure echoes: "colors the dead forests never knew." Two beats: historical anchor, immediate post-forest conditions that enable/require archive work. Causal role moderate: the timeframe creates the barren real but doesn't tighten a live decision on the page. No tracked clock or urgency within the single evening. Cost connection present (the forests' loss motivates the work). Not ornamental, but temporal pressure is structural rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation stated in paragraph five: "to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners." Dramatized through the listening ritual and the hold-still choice. Conflicted: Harsk cannot bring timelines here, only preserve echoes—he resists the temptation to reach for his daughter's flicker. Two beats: exposition of motivation, enactment during charm. Closure: "Another spark, cultivated. Another unlit corner given a small, persistent glow" fulfills the want but underscores its limits. Cost visible: he remains dreamless, the clock silent, the task endless. Friction between want (daughter's presence) and method (preservation without contact) is felt. Early signal. High causal pressure. The motivation drives every choice and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Fractured lullaby" describes the dune flowers' song (paragraph six) and governs the piece's tonal palette: lyric melancholy, broken beauty, impossible harmonies. Tone modulates: contemplative in exposition, tightens during the listening beat ("There—a flicker"), releases into quiet resolve at closure. Coherent through turns without flattening. The final image—"flowers kept singing their broken song to no one, to everyone, to the vast and patient dark"—crystallizes the tone and charges closure. Purposeful: the fractured quality mirrors the archive's nature (almost-timelines, divergent tenderness) and Harsk's state (dreamless, daughter gone). Rhythmic control supports pressure. The tone is indispensable to the piece's effect and inseparable from theme.</comment>
