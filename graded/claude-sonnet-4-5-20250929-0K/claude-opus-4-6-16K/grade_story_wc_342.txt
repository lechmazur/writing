<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's prosopagnosia is dramatized through her work rather than simply labeled, and her decade-long obsession with the coin creates a credible motivation architecture. The final choice to leave the sketches behind feels earned by the tension between her blindness and her rendering obsession. Interior voice remains specific and embodied ("the faint indentations," "fractally precise detail"), though the "vastness is defined by the point where vision ends" epiphany leans slightly abstract. The renunciation at closure forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the coin's teaching → sketches as completion → entombment as boundary marker. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly within the first paragraph. Closure delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara's decision to entomb the sketches and walk away with only the coin reweights her decade of work as a boundary discovered rather than a technique completed, with the cost legible in "leave the drawings here, entombed." One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "completion meant she had discovered where her art stopped."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hollowed oak library constrains the retrieval scene and charges the final destruction; the "knot in the wood" detail and "narrow door the guild had carved" embed lived-in specificity. The coin's physical indentations ("faint," "microscopic groove") function as micro-setting that enables her method and reappears at closure when she "pressed the coin between her palms." Spatial choreography (shelf → wall → door → outside) tracks cleanly. Sensory economy balances sight/touch without catalog excess, and the demolition timeframe tightens the frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: retrieve the coin/sketches before demolition and confront the artistic limit they represent. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes "completion meant she had discovered where her art stopped," narrowing her path to acceptance and entombment. The walk-away with only the coin forecloses the option to preserve or continue the sketches, paying a visible price. Agency is renunciation with cost; no antagonist is required under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (the boundary between craft and unknowable presence) emerges through the coin's indentations, the fractally precise method, and the sky-mirror aspiration without meta-commentary. The final image—"some faces... were never meant to be fully known, only endlessly approached"—offers a resonant answer rooted in her decade of work and the entombment choice. The sky motif recurs purposefully: openness without recognition → desire to mirror infinity → final lesson about vastness defined by vision's end. Minor deduction: "where vision ends and wonder begins" leans slightly sententious in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; distance and focalization are clean with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices texture and topology over faces, and the prose modulates from contemplative ("the world held its breath") to resolute ("walked away, carrying nothing but"). Diction stays within her educated-artist register without corporate drift. Free indirect style is controlled, and the reflective passages anchor to present stimuli (coin in hand, oak interior, demolition sounds). No dialogue present; voice remains internally coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with minimal scaffolding. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor template cadence in the reflection blocks: "She had spent years... She had mapped every... The method was complete" uses parallel stems across three lines, though the repetition serves thematic accumulation rather than filler. One filter-verb cluster ("she understood," "she realized") in the climactic paragraph slightly dulls immediacy. No loops or synonym churn; figurative language (sky-mirror, fractal precision) remains coherent and on-voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist premise transforms a familiar disability trope through the coin's indentations as method and the fractal-precision technique, avoiding therapeutic redemption or magical compensation. The sky-mirror motivation and the entombment-as-boundary ending offer a non-obvious synthesis. Minor deduction: the condemned-building frame and the scholar's-guild backstory, while atmospheric, lean slightly toward template melancholy; the core originality resides in the tactile-mapping technique and the protagonist's acceptance of limits rather than transcendence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Face-blind portrait artist: Setup clear in paragraph one. Development: her blindness enables the fractal method (middle reflection). Payoff: her blindness defines the limit she accepts at closure ("she could never fully capture"). Her choices—retrieving the coin, leaving the sketches, walking away—drive all three major beats. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; swappable only with heavy structural rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Secret book safe: Setup paragraph three ("disguised as a leather-bound volume"). Development: she opens it and retrieves the coin (beat two). Payoff: she places the sketches back and closes it for entombment (final third). Present in three beats but the safe itself is a passive container; the coin and sketches do the causal work. The safe's concealment function matters for retrieval but not for closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Discovering limits: Setup implicit in her decade-long project. Development drives middle reflection ("The method was complete, and completion meant she had discovered where her art stopped"). Payoff: entire closure turns on accepting the boundary ("discovering limits... was not a failure"). This concept shapes stakes, narrows options, and charges the final image. The entombment choice is inconceivable without this realization; irreplaceable and cost-laden.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fractally precise: Setup in paragraph five ("fractally precise detail that repeated at every scale"). Development: the attribute enables her unique method and decade of work (middle exposition). Payoff: implicit in the limit she reaches ("finest, and they were not enough"). The trait constrains her artistic approach and defines the boundary at closure, but it operates more as a descriptor of her work than a visible on-page tradeoff during the retrieval scene itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Craft: Setup via her decade of portrait work. Development: she retrieves the coin and sketches, tangible products of her craft (beat two). Payoff: leaving the sketches to be destroyed reweights her craft as bounded rather than infinite. The action of entombment and walking away is the closure gesture. Craft shapes her motivation and the stakes; swapping it for "study" or "technique" would require rewrites but might not break the logic entirely.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Through faint indentations on a centuries-old coin: Setup paragraph four (coin introduced, indentations described). Development: the indentations taught her the mapping method over a decade (middle). Payoff: she presses the coin "one last time, those tiny valleys that had taught her" before walking away. The method's mechanics matter: texture/topology vs. recognition. Shapes her entire artistic approach and charges the final tactile moment; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tree trunk library: Setup paragraph one (hollowed oak, shelves carved into heartwood). Development: provides the physical container for retrieval and the setting's sacredness ("silence of a cathedral about to become rubble"). Payoff: the oak's destruction entombs the sketches. The setting constrains the timeframe and supplies the closure mechanism (entombment via demolition). Strong early signal and closure participation; the library's scholarly history adds texture but the hollow trunk's destruction is load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>At the hush just before a condemned building is demolished: Setup paragraph two ("demolition scheduled for dawn," "just before the wrecking crews arrived"). Development: auditory cues track time ("distant rumble of engines," "first machine roared"). Payoff: the oak shudders as Elara walks away, timing the entombment. The timeframe tightens her window for retrieval and decision but does not force a choice between competing options; it functions more as atmospheric pressure than tactical clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>To mirror the sky inside walls: Setup paragraph six (desire stated directly). Development: the sky motif recurs as her measure of success ("infinite depth," "boundless, unnamed, radiant"). Payoff: final paragraph reweights the sky as the lesson ("vastness is defined by the point where vision ends"). The motivation is dramatized through her refusal to settle for technique alone and her choice to entomb rather than preserve. Minor deduction: the motivation is articulated more through reflection than conflicted choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Heightened stillness: Setup paragraph two ("the world held its breath," "this hush"). Development: tone modulates through contemplative retrieval, reflective realization, and resolute departure without breaking coherence. Payoff: "The heightened stillness inside the tree felt sacred" charges the final entombment image. Tone remains consistent across turns and intensifies at closure when she walks away under the "pale thread" of dawn. The stillness contrasts with and is broken by the machine's roar, sharpening the ending.</comment>
