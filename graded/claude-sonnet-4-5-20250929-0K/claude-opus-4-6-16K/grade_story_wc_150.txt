<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Adaeze's interior world is richly embodied—her "forgetting sickness," the "emptiness [that] grew teeth," and her tactile engagement with roots and bones all ground abstract spiritual yearning in physical specificity. The progression from diaspora hollowness to cautious re-rooting is earned through micro-choices (touching roots, asking bones questions, placing the kola nut, speaking broken Igbo). Internal contradiction surfaces cleanly when she both rejects prayer and enacts ritual gestures without naming them as such. Minor weakness: the dibia and child skeletons remain atmospheric rather than pressure points; they illustrate theme but don't complicate her choices on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its method early—"reading the tomb the way her grandmother had read the forest, with her feet"—and layers discovery beats (sundial, interrupted burials, root-cradles) that accumulate toward the final kola-nut offering and broken-Igbo address. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the first green thread of a root finding its way back down through the dark, interrupted and reaching still" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (incompleteness acknowledged, faith not restored but re-seeded). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from structural engineer to ritual participant, narrowing her stance from professional observer to embodied supplicant. Cost is felt in the acknowledgment of brokenness ("so broken it might have been a new dialect entirely") and the explicit statement "It was not restoration. Not yet."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is not mere backdrop: roots "held everything together now. Remove them, and the dead would finally fall apart" becomes both structural constraint and metaphor that charges every subsequent beat. The sundial's shaft of light at noon, the root-choked opening, the niches holding stone kola nuts—all are tactile, recurring anchors that guide Adaeze's choices (where to sit, where to place her offering). The interweaving of bones, roots, and living fruit above creates a micro-ecology that pressures her final gesture: she mirrors the roots' interrupted-but-persistent journey by speaking broken Igbo. Nsibidi symbols, red camwood, clay pots, and the dibia's skull are deployed with restraint and specificity, filtered through her engineering eye and her grandmother's forest-reading. The setting constrains (load-bearing walls, risk of collapse) and enables (ventilation shafts as ritual discovery paths).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restoring lost faith, signaled early ("until the emptiness grew teeth"). Pressure accumulates through purposeful wandering that uncovers interrupted journeys, mirroring her own. The tightening occurs when she moves from mapping stress points to rebuilding the sundial as centerpiece—a shift from professional task to personal pilgrimage. The final offering and broken-Igbo speech are acts of agency that foreclose the path of continued denial and open a path of incomplete, costly re-engagement. Cost is legible in the acknowledgment "It was not restoration. Not yet" and in the vulnerability of speaking "so broken it might have been a new dialect entirely." One reversal: she arrives expecting no answers ("She did not expect answers, but the asking felt necessary") and exits with "something cautious and enchanted" stirring—a small but decisive reconfiguration of her stance toward faith.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—interrupted journeys resumed at cost—emerges organically from the dibia's redirected burial path, the half-anointed child, rerouted roots, and Adaeze's own twenty-three-year absence. The sundial without gnomon becomes a non-literal emblem: it cannot cast proper shadow, yet light still reads the symbols, just as Adaeze's faith cannot be cleanly restored, yet she enacts ritual anyway. The final image—"the first green thread of a root finding its way back down through the dark, interrupted and reaching still"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: return is not arrival but renewed descent, incomplete and costly. No moralizing; the kola nut and broken Igbo are gestures, not declarations. The piece resists tidy resolution and holds ambiguity without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Adaeze notices via her engineering lens ("load-bearing walls," "stress points," "timber frames that mimicked the roots' organic geometry") and her grandmother's forest-reading. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight interiority at peak moments ("she was tired of being half-anointed"), atmospheric middle distance during discovery beats. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "the forgetting sickness," "faith becomes a word without weight," "fruit-light dappled the walls." No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Compression in the final paragraph ("cautious and enchanted," "interrupted and reaching still") heightens rather than obscures. Minor slip: "She did not pray, exactly" edges toward hedging, though it's quickly grounded in the kola-nut gesture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with high information density: "Fig and breadfruit roots had grown downward through generations of soil and bone, weaving between skulls and femurs like pale fingers threading through dark hair" does sensory, world-building, and thematic work in one sentence. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentence variety supports the accumulative mode. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (roots as fingers, the emptiness with teeth, fruit-light). Minor density slip: "She began to rebuild" paragraph opens with a summary move ("Not the tunnels alone, though she reinforced…") that slightly flattens momentum before recovering with the sundial detail. The final image is lean and charged. Zero scaffold or synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of engineering rigor, Nsibidi symbolism, and diaspora spiritual yearning feels specific and non-obvious. The catacomb orchard is a fresh frame that avoids "character returns to ancestral village" clichés by routing the journey through professional excavation and literal underground work. The sundial without gnomon—a timekeeper that cannot keep time but still marks meaning—is an elegant objective correlative for faith that cannot be cleanly restored but still functions. The choice to speak broken Igbo rather than fluent English at the climax is a small, particular turn that grows from prior material (her grandmother's stories, the Nsibidi symbols she's been reading). Not boldly experimental, but the accumulative structure and the root-as-ritual metaphor cohere into a singular vision. The transformation test passes: plot and arc cannot be lifted unchanged to another setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Adaeze's diaspora-returnee status is signaled early ("twenty-three years in Manchester," "the forgetting sickness") and drives key choices: touching roots and asking bones questions (warmly curious engagement rooted in loss), shifting from engineering to ritual participant, placing the kola nut, speaking broken Igbo to the dibia. Her incomplete cultural competence ("Igbo so broken it might have been a new dialect entirely") is both constraint and the cost she pays for return. The final stance—"It was not restoration. Not yet"—hinges on her specific position as someone relearning rather than remembering. Beat involvement: at least three (arrival/diagnosis of emptiness, sundial discovery/reorientation, final offering). Closure linkage is strong; the "first green thread" image gains force from her interrupted journey. Irreplaceable: a local archaeologist or engineer without diaspora experience would not carry the same thematic weight or make the same choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sundial base appears on day four, is identified via Nsibidi symbols (spiral for journey, crossed lines for interruption, open eye for return), is rebuilt into a centerpiece for the main chamber, and anchors the final scene where Adaeze sits beside it and speaks to the dibia. Three beats with evolving function: discovery/recognition, physical reconstruction, and closure anchor. Causal pressure: the sundial's lack of gnomon ("the dial could not cast a proper shadow, but the light moved across the Nsibidi symbols like a slow hand reading scripture") mirrors and shapes her understanding that restoration is incomplete. The object's specificity—Nsibidi symbols that she can decode via her grandmother's stories—makes it irreplaceable. It does not resolve a problem it did not help create; instead it articulates the problem (interrupted journey) and becomes the site where she enacts her response. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The core concept (interrupted journeys) is seeded early (her twenty-three-year absence, "the forgetting sickness"), illustrated through multiple on-page examples (dibia's redirected burial path, half-anointed child, roots split by stone and rerouted), and directly shapes Adaeze's tactics: she begins to wander purposefully, "not following the team's grid but moving by instinct," mirroring the roots' interrupted-but-persistent growth. The concept reweights her final choice—she does not achieve restoration but enacts continuation ("interrupted and reaching still"). It changes options by reframing her goal from "restore lost faith" to "resume the journey of faith despite interruption." Irreplaceable: "broken journeys" or "delayed returns" would not carry the same mechanical/spatial specificity or support the root/burial path imagery. Closure linkage is total; the final line restates the concept with new emotional and conceptual charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" is demonstrated on the page—she pauses to touch roots, presses her palm against bark embracing a ribcage, asks bones questions in her mind—and the trait enables her shift from structural engineer to ritual participant. It shapes one key choice: moving by instinct rather than grid, which leads to secondary discoveries and the sundial. Minor cost: her colleagues are "unsettled," signaling mild professional friction. However, the trait does not constrain a peak beat or force a tradeoff; it facilitates rather than complicates. Present in the ending beat (she places the kola nut and speaks to the dibia with the same warm curiosity), but not causally active there. Swappability test: "open" or "reverent" curiosity would function similarly with minor edits. Mid-band for enablement without friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is signaled as her professional task (reinforcing tunnels) and transforms into personal ritual (rebuilding the sundial base into a centerpiece, placing the kola nut, speaking to the dibia). The action drives at least two beats: the physical reconstruction of the sundial and the final offering/address. It is irreplaceable in the sense that "repair" or "restore" would not carry the same connotation of ground-up reconstruction after interruption. However, the rebuild is more method than decisive turn; the key choice is to *stop* professional rebuild and *start* personal ritual. The action enables rather than forces the final stance. Strong thematic fit but modest causal pressure at the climax, where "speak" and "offer" are the operative verbs. Mid-7s for multi-beat presence and thematic coherence without peak-beat dominance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method (purposeful wandering) is explicitly named and taught: "She began to wander the tunnels purposefully after that, not following the team's grid but moving by instinct, letting the roots guide her." It shapes her discovery beats (secondary chambers, ventilation shafts, offerings, sundial) and is justified via her grandmother's forest-reading—"reading the tomb the way her grandmother had read the forest, with her feet." The method constrains by rejecting the team's grid and enables by yielding discoveries the grid would miss. It is present at multiple points (signaled, enacted, reflected upon) and charges the ending by establishing the pattern of following roots/instinct that culminates in the kola-nut gesture. Specificity is high; "systematic exploration" or "intuitive search" would not carry the same resonance with her grandmother's teaching. Strong integration, though the method is more pervasive than peak-decisive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is introduced in the title beat and pressures every choice: roots hold the dead together (remove them and collapse follows), the sundial sits where three roots converge, ventilation shafts disguised as tree hollows guide discovery, the root-choked opening admits noon light, and the final scene positions Adaeze "beside the sundial base" with "roots [breathing] around her" and "bones rest[ing] in their tangled cradle." The setting's dual nature (living/dead, growth/decay, structure/ritual) is irreplaceable and charges the closure image: "the first green thread of a root finding its way back down through the dark." It constrains her engineering work (load-bearing concerns) and enables her ritual work (discovery paths, light shafts, spatial metaphor). The setting is not backdrop but co-protagonist. Exceptional integration; the story's logic, tone, and final image would collapse without this exact environment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Timeframe is signaled ("On the fourth day," "On the last day of excavation") and provides loose structure. It does not create urgency or narrow options; the excavation's end is a natural stopping point, not a pressure that forces the kola-nut offering. The time spent underground allows accumulation of discoveries, but those discoveries are not race-against-clock moves. The timeframe is present and logical but replaceable—"over several weeks" or "during the dig season" would function similarly. No evidence that a ticking clock alters tactics. Mid-band for structural presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation (restore lost faith) is seeded early ("She had not prayed to any god in a decade. She had not felt the need to, until the emptiness grew teeth") and dramatized through her shift from professional detachment to ritual engagement. Internal conflict is visible: "She did not pray, exactly. But she placed a fresh kola nut…" The friction between wanting restoration and accepting incompleteness charges the final beat: "It was not restoration. Not yet." Cost is legible in her vulnerability ("tired of being half-anointed," speaking "Igbo so broken it might have been a new dialect entirely"). The motivation drives her choice to speak to the dibia and enact ritual despite uncertainty. Strong integration, though the motivation is more thematic driver than on-page obstacle; no moment where faith and another want (professional duty, safety, skepticism) collide in a forced choice. High-7s for clear dramatization and cost without peak friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tone (cautious enchantment) is established early—"She was warmly curious in a way that unsettled her colleagues"—and sustained through sensory details that blend wonder and restraint: "fruit-light dappled the walls," "roots breathed around her with the patience of centuries," "something cautious and enchanted stir[red] in the place where faith had been." The tone modulates with pressure: detached professionalism at the start, increasing reverence through discovery, and a careful, tentative openness at the end. It charges the final image: "interrupted and reaching still" captures both caution (incompleteness acknowledged) and enchantment (the reach continues). The tone is coherent across beats and fits the accumulative lens. Irreplaceable: "reverent curiosity" or "tentative wonder" would be near-synonyms but lack the precise balance of wariness and magic. Strong closure linkage; the tone *is* the ending's emotional register.</comment>
