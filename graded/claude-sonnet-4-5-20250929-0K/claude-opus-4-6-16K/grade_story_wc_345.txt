<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sable receives the most development with embodied action (climbing, striking the arch, waiting with fruit), but her interiority remains thin—motivation is inferred from actions rather than felt through contradictory impulses. The Gardener operates as a device rather than a character with agency; its "true motivation" is told in exposition ("Its true motivation was never to fix the blight single-handedly but to orchestrate collective effort") rather than dramatized through on-page choices under pressure. Secondary characters (Petro, Jun) are mentioned by name and skill but never appear in scene to apply relational pressure or force trade-offs. The final choice (Sable leaving fruit, the Gardener's disappearance) lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no competing value sacrificed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (orchard planet Verath, blight, settlers, central square) land cleanly in the opening. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: chalk messages accumulate, mineral water is discovered, fungal networks pulse, fruit grows back—a density increase across months that reweights the stake from dying trees to flourishing orchards. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the Gardener departs after delivering "YOU WERE ALWAYS THE GARDEN," the bell rings by itself, and the community continues chalking messages—a crystallization of collective agency with conceptual cost (the ghost's absence, the transfer of responsibility). However, the middle section compresses months of labor into summary ("Months later, the first clean fruit grew back"), eliding the escalation beats where tactics might narrow or prices become visible. The lens holds but the tightening is muted by transit-tell.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating arches function as micro-setting that constrains choice: Sable must climb to strike mineral water, and Jun rigs pulleys beneath them to sustain irrigation—both tactically essential. The copper watering bell's "clear tone" becomes a recurring auditory anchor and signal device, charging the final image when it "rang by itself." Sensory detail is purposeful (mineral streaks, fat ringing drops, pale dirt, violet sky) and filtered through the settlers' survival priorities rather than touristic catalog. The "Nebula of Respite" simile ties sky color to thematic sanctuary but remains ornamental—no character navigates by it or uses its properties. Spatial choreography is clean (ridge path, central square, orchards below) and the arches' weeping water drives irrigation logistics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—orchard survival—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Sable follows the chalk instructions to strike the arch, unlocking mineral water; this narrows options from passive despair to active resource-gathering. However, escalation is told rather than shown: "Months later, the first clean fruit grew back" compresses the middle into summary, and no on-page reversal tests Sable's or the community's commitment after the initial discovery. The Gardener's orchestration is declared in exposition ("Its true motivation was never to fix the blight single-handedly but to orchestrate collective effort") rather than dramatized through a beat where collective effort nearly fails or fractures. Agency is present (Sable climbs, strikes, waits) but the cost at closure is conceptual (responsibility transferred) rather than a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening suffices but lacks a sharp price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: the copper bell's recurring tone, the chalk messages as threads of trust, the final line "YOU WERE ALWAYS THE GARDEN" reconfiguring agency from ghost-dependence to collective self-reliance. The piece resists moralizing—no character articulates the thesis, and the ending offers a non-literal answer (the bell rings by itself, messages continue) that reweights prior material without spelling it out. The "brambled hope...thorny and imperfect, yes, brambled with the memory of every world they had already lost" passage risks over-articulation but stays rooted in the settlers' lived loss rather than abstract philosophizing. Subtext operates in gesture (Sable pressing warm chalk letters, leaving fruit overnight, the Gardener taking it) and the quiet transfer of ritual. One friction: "strangely trustworthy in a way the settlers could not rationalize but also could deny" tells rather than showing the trust through a skeptical character's conversion or a moment of collective doubt overcome.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a consistent narrative distance that zooms selectively (close on Sable's fingers pressing chalk, wide on the community effort). The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"nebula light, that soft violet haze," "brambled hope," "sanctuary made visible"—but risks elevated diction at peak beats: "the arches wept their quiet mineral rain" in the denouement reads more poetic than urgent. No dialogue appears, so subtext must operate through action and image, which it does (fruit left, taken, replaced by chalk). Perceptual signature is collective rather than individual—"the settlers" as a group rather than Sable's particular way of noticing—which flattens voice specificity. The phrase "After strangers become family, the threat of loss cuts differently. It cuts communal" intrudes with authorial aphorism rather than staying in character-bound perception. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful (zooming from Sable to community to months of labor) but the collective "we" mode in the opening and close dilutes individual focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in key beats (the bell's mechanics, the mineral water discovery, the pulley rigging). However, several loops and scaffolds appear: "strangely trustworthy in a way the settlers could not rationalize but also could not deny" is near-paraphrase within the clause; "small, tart, radiant" and "green and improbable" stack modifiers without added pressure; "violet sky that looked, if you squinted, exactly like a nebula offering rest to every traveler who had ever needed it" recycles the Nebula of Respite simile established earlier without advancing the image. The phrase "thorny and imperfect, yes, brambled with the memory of every world they had already lost, but hope nonetheless" loops the brambled-hope motif within a single sentence. No major clarity breaks, but the text favors elegant restatement over propulsion in the final third. Template cadence appears in the chalk-message beats: "The first message read...The second morning...By the third day" is functional but mechanical. Figurative density in the closing paragraph (arches weep, sky offers rest, orchards stretch improbable) risks overwriting without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to a choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ghost-as-community-organizer premise offers a fresh inflection on the "savior figure" trope by making orchestration rather than direct intervention the core function, and the copper watering bell as signal device is a specific, non-obvious choice. However, the emotional arc—despair to collective hope via incremental trust—follows a familiar template, and the transformation test reveals substitutability: swap "orchard blight" for "water shortage" or "crop disease" and the plot holds without material change. The Nebula of Respite functions as thematic echo rather than world logic that constrains tactics. The ending's quiet resonance (bell ringing by itself, messages continuing) is earned but not bold—it retreats to symmetry (ghost started messages, settlers continue them) rather than a harder, more specific reconfiguration. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative mode but does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ghost appears in two observational beats (translucent figure at twilight, taking the fruit overnight) and generates all chalk messages, but it makes no on-page decision under pressure—its "true motivation" is told in exposition rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. The final chalk message "YOU WERE ALWAYS THE GARDEN" is the ghost's last act, but it arrives after months of off-page labor and reads as benediction rather than a turn that alters tactics or cost. Present across setup, middle (messages), and closure (final message and disappearance), but its altruism is label-only; no visible trade-off or cost to the ghost itself is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bell appears in three distinct beats: Sable catches mineral water drops in it and its tone signals the discovery; it becomes the dawn signal for new chalk/hope across months; it rings by itself in the final image, charging the closure with the ghost's absence made audible. Early signal (introduced at the first water-strike), middle use (as community signal), and closure reprise (self-ringing) satisfy all three gates. The bell's specific property—its clear tone—constrains communication tactics (the sound carries down the ridge) and its final autonomy reweights prior uses from tool to symbol of transferred agency. However, the bell does not impose a visible cost or narrow a choice under pressure; it enables rather than constrains, preventing a score ≥8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Nebula of Respite is mentioned twice: once as a simile for the ghost's violet glow ("that soft violet haze the astronomers called the Nebula of Respite because ships sheltered in its gas clouds") and once in the final paragraph ("a violet sky that looked, if you squinted, exactly like a nebula offering rest"). Both uses are descriptive/thematic rather than causal—no character navigates by it, shelters in its mechanics, or makes a choice shaped by its properties. It echoes the story's sanctuary theme but does not change options or constrain tactics on the page. Present in setup and closure (lyric reprise), but missing middle development and swappable with any "safe-harbor" metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is attributed to the ghost in exposition ("strangely trustworthy in a way the settlers could not rationalize but also could not deny") and enables Sable's first climb to follow the chalk instructions—a single on-page action. However, the trait is told rather than earned through a beat where skepticism is overcome or trust is tested and vindicated with visible cost. Present in setup (attributed mid-opening) and enables one middle choice (Sable's climb), but absent from closure and no cost or trade-off dramatized. The phrase "Its messages were never wrong" reinforces the trait but does so in summary rather than through a moment where a wrong message would have carried consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears explicitly in the second chalk message ("NOW REEXAMINE THE SOIL—IT IS NOT DEAD, ONLY DORMANT") and drives the discovery that mineral water activates fungal networks, enabling the orchard's recovery—a major middle turn. The action is signaled early (second dawn message) and shapes the middle beat (sifting pale dirt, discovering dormancy), but it is summarized rather than dramatized in scene: "And they did reexamine it, sifting the pale dirt through their fingers, discovering..." The closure does not loop back to reexamination; the final image pivots to the bell and continued chalk messages without reprising soil or fungal networks. Two gates (setup, middle) but missing closure participation, and the middle beat is told rather than shown with visible cost or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The chalk-message mechanic is established in the opening ("Each dawn, before anyone else woke, words materialized on the deserted sidewalks"), drives every middle beat (three messages guide water discovery, soil reexamination, and collective labor), and the final message "YOU WERE ALWAYS THE GARDEN" triggers the ghost's departure and the settlers' continuation of the practice. Early signal (first third), repeated middle beats (three messages shape tactics), and closure payoff (final message, then settlers continue chalking to each other). The method's properties—dawn timing, luminous hand, warm letters—are specific and the practice's transfer to the settlers charges the ending with visible cost (ghost's departure, responsibility assumed). However, the mechanics (how the ghost writes, why dawn, why sidewalks) are never tested or constrained under pressure; they enable without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The floating arches supply the mineral water that solves the blight—a causal role in the major turn—and Jun's pulley system beneath them sustains irrigation, altering tactics. The arches are introduced in the opening hook ("floating rock arches bridged the sky like the ribs of some slumbering god"), the ridge path and arch-striking occur in the middle, and the final image includes "the arches wept their quiet mineral rain." All three gates present. The arches' specific property (mineral deposits on underside) is irreplaceable and drives the solution. However, they do not impose a cost or constraint—Sable climbs without difficulty, the water flows continuously once accessed—preventing a score ≥8.5. The "orchard planet" frame is present but secondary to the arches' mechanical function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After strangers become family" is stated in the opening as the condition under which the blight's threat "cuts communal," framing the emotional stakes. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—months pass in summary ("over three quiet harvests they had become kin...Months later, the first clean fruit grew back") without a clock or deadline that forces choices. The phrase returns implicitly in the closure (community continuing messages as family) but the temporal pressure remains atmospheric rather than causal. Present in setup and thematically at closure, but missing middle development where time scarcity or urgency would narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation "to orchestrate collective effort" is declared in exposition mid-story ("Its true motivation was never to fix the blight single-handedly but to orchestrate collective effort") and is demonstrated across the middle beats as chalk messages connect skills (Sable's climbing, Petro's chemistry, Jun's engineering). The motivation drives the plot structure—each message is a thread—and the closure transfers orchestration to the settlers. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through a choice where the ghost sacrifices direct intervention for slower collective work or where orchestration risks failure. Present across all three gates but lacks on-page friction between wants and costs; the ghost succeeds without visible trade-off, and the motivation is summary-only at its introduction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" is articulated explicitly in the phrase "new hope—thorny and imperfect, yes, brambled with the memory of every world they had already lost, but hope nonetheless" and modulates coherently across beats: settlers step around the first chalk "puzzled," Sable tests the letters' warmth (cautious hope), the bell's tone signals incremental trust, and the final image carries both absence (ghost gone) and continuity (messages persist). The tone charges the final image—hope is earned through loss and sustained effort rather than magical resolution. However, the explicit articulation of "brambled" mid-story risks naming what the images already convey (warm chalk, weeping arches, tart fruit, violet sky), reducing subtlety. Tone is consistent through turns and present in closure, elevating the score, but the meta-phrase itself is an intrusion.</comment>
