<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is consistently well-rendered through embodied perception—"felt its unexpected heft," "jaw was set firm"—and her final choice to destroy the dynasty emerges with clear cost. The backstory about her grandfather's acoustics work and family dealings stays anchored to present investigation and primes the ledger discovery. Minor slip: her eloquent silence is labeled more than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure, and the grandmother's observation feels like external validation rather than contradictory impulse acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds cleanly: intuition with the crank → standing waves → hidden ledger → decision to expose. Orientation anchors (Elara, reading room, evening) land within the first paragraph. Closure delivers Decisive Change with visible cost: she walks out knowing the dynasty will fall, carrying both ledger and crank as proof and relic. The cost is stated rather than shown in a final gesture or image, which prevents entry to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The reading room's "precise dimensions and hard plaster walls" designed as an instrument directly enables the discovery; the gramophone and its crank are handled across multiple beats. Sepia palette and golden shadows recur to frame mood and final image. The room's acoustic properties constrain method and charge the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the "rising water" simile and repeated "golden shadows" feel slightly ornamental in the final paragraph, capping at 8.2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncover hidden truth—is signaled early and escalates through one meaningful tightening: intuition leads to discovery, which then forces the exposé choice. The ledger revelation narrows options with visible cost (dynasty destruction). Agency is clear in the final decision. No micro-turn muddies the line; the piece delivers one causal deepening sufficient for this length under a causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of inherited complicity emerges entirely through action and image: the acoustician's resonance obsession, the ledger's meticulous cruelty, Elara as "ending, instrument, most eloquent silence." The final image—walking out without looking back, shadows closing "like a book whose final chapter had, at last, been read"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. The "bridge of intuition" phrase risks meta-commentary but stays rooted in sensory experience (dowsing rod, skin pressure).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (architecture of sound, resonance metaphors). Diction matches Elara's educated lineage without register drift. Two slips lower the score: "She began to muse" is a filter verb that dulls immediacy at a key beat, and "a bridge of intuition, she would later call it" briefly violates present tense with retroactive framing. Both occur in the discovery sequence, reducing impact but not breaking focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; information density is high. Two artifacts constrain the score: "golden shadows" appears three times with near-identical phrasing (opening, mid-scene, closure), creating a decorative loop rather than reweighted meaning. The phrase "most eloquent silence" in the final paragraph recycles the opening label without fresh pressure. Metaphor coherence holds; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks beyond the single "muse" instance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The acoustics-as-discovery-mechanism is a fresh synthesis, and the dynasty-ender who self-immolates for justice offers a non-obvious moral stance. The piece commits fully to its premise. However, the core frame—hidden ledger reveals family crimes, protagonist exposes—is a widely used template. The standing-wave method and "eloquent silence" trait elevate specificity enough to avoid the derivative penalty, but the ending's inevitability feels earned more by execution than conceptual surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elara frames expectation early, discovers the ledger (middle beat), and makes the exposé decision that closes the story. Her choice is causally driven by prior interiority and forecloses the dynasty with visible cost. The element is indispensable: remove her role as blood-heir and last generation, and the closure collapses. All three gates present; causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Crank handle appears in paragraph four, is examined and used to activate the gramophone (middle beat), and is carried out at closure as a "relic of the method." It enables the discovery and charges the final image. Setup, development, and payoff gates all present. Specificity is high: "too long, too ornate, engraved with a pattern of frequencies." Strong causal role and closure participation justify high score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Bridge of intuition" is named mid-story and shapes the discovery method: "intuition guiding her wrist the way a dowsing rod pulls toward water." It enables the acoustics breakthrough and ties to theme (knowledge in blood, waiting for resonance). Setup and development gates present; closure linkage indirect (the bridge led to ledger, which drives ending). Lyric resonance without mid-beat dramatization; the phrase reweights meaning but does not constrain a distinct second choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Eloquently silent" is introduced early with backstory detail and reappears in the final paragraph ("its last and most eloquent silence"). It characterizes Elara but does not visibly constrain an on-page choice or impose a tradeoff. The trait is largely label-only; her silences are described rather than shown altering tactics under pressure. Setup and payoff gates present; development gate weak. Lyric reprise without causal pressure trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Muse" (turning the handle slowly in her fingers before fitting it) is the action that leads directly to discovery. It shapes the key turn and is irreplaceable within the acoustics logic. Setup and development gates clear; closure participation indirect (the ledger, not the musing itself, drives the ending). One strong causal beat plus specificity, but the action does not recur or get reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Standing waves are introduced via backstory ("rooms tuned like instruments, standing waves that could make objects vibrate"), then dramatized on the page ("nodes and antinodes of pressure that she could feel against her skin") to open the hidden compartment. The method is mechanically specific and causally necessary. Setup, development, and payoff gates all present; it shapes two beats (adjustment of speed, bookshelf resonance) and enables the discovery that drives closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is anchored early, its "precise dimensions and hard plaster walls" designed as an instrument enable the standing-wave discovery, and the "golden shadows" frame the final exit. The room's acoustic properties constrain method and supply the resource (hidden compartment) that alters outcome. All three gates present; causal pressure and closure linkage strong. Slight deduction for "golden shadows" decorative repetition.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"First yawn of evening" anchors the opening and "evening deepened" marks progression mid-scene. Time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the discovery sequence proceeds without a live clock. Setup gate present; development and payoff gates weak. The timeframe is atmospheric but functionally replaceable—dawn or afternoon would not alter tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to uncover a hidden truth" is dramatized in the investigation beats (examining crank, cranking gramophone, reading ledger) and drives the exposé choice at closure. Friction between want (truth) and cost (dynasty destruction) is visible on the page. Setup, development, and payoff gates all present. The desire is indispensable: remove it and the plot dissolves. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" recurs three times to anchor the sepia tone and modulates slightly (stretching, climbing, closing) to match pressure. Tone remains coherent and charges the final image ("closed behind her like a book"). Setup and payoff gates clear; development present but ornamental in mid-scene mention. The tone element supports closure but feels somewhat decorative rather than indispensable—"amber twilight" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>
