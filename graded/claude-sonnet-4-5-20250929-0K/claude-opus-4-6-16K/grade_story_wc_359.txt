<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior is richly embodied through synesthetic perception, with contradictory impulses visible when she holds the responsibility/gift tension and when she recognizes wonder as structural rather than ornamental. The final unfettering moment—"a tightness she had carried so long she had mistaken it for her own heartbeat"—is earned by the cavern's proof rather than her own epiphany, creating visible cost (the weight lifted) with clear before/after states. Minimal interpersonal pressure limits full crucible testing, but solitary agency and renunciation of proving beauty herself constitute a credible arc at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly (prism-song bell ringer, Northern Conservatory, ice cavern descent) and the accumulative/textural lens holds: each struck column braids color into an aurora that proves wonder is structural, culminating in the white tone that rises to join the arctic sky and the amber sheet recording the final note. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Maren's release of the proving-burden is legible through the unfettering and the cavern's self-inscription, with visible cost (she no longer must certify beauty; the proof now exists independent of her effort). One tightening—blank measure to struck column to inscribed note—narrows her stance with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ice cavern constrains choice (columnar formations enable the performance; sculpted hush registers as violet disturbance), and the amber music sheet functions as micro-setting by pressuring her discovery and later recording the proof. Sensory detail is purposeful: "rings of soft violet" from breath, coral that "smelled, impossibly, of cedar," and the final oscillating blue traced with her fingertip. The cavern's self-inscription at closure charges the final image, making environment indispensable to the proof rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving that beauty/wonder matters—is signaled early ("a responsibility she had not yet fulfilled") and tightens when the blank final measure waits for "a note that was not yet written." The climactic strike is a protagonist-driven choice (she supplies the missing tone from memory of irreversible commitment), and the cavern's sympathetic resonance + unfettering constitute visible cost: she relinquishes the proving-burden. No explicit antagonist, but the accumulative pressure of carrying proof alone escalates cleanly to the release. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the aurora dome teaches wonder as structural ("It held the world together the way gravity held ice to rock"), and the final inscribed note—"a calm, oscillating blue…like the chest of someone deeply, peacefully asleep"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The sculptor's chisel memory ties irreversible commitment to Maren's mallet choice, integrating her vocation with the thematic question. No prompt-echo or thesis statement; the cavern's self-recording reweights prior material (amber sheet, responsibility, proof) without explaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Maren's synesthetic perception anchoring every sensory line ("every silence wore a shade of blue so deep it bruised her inner sight"). Diction remains character-particular under pressure: "sculpted hush," "braided luminescence," "unfetter" all fit her artisan's lens. No dialogue to judge. One brief elision (the note "came to her…as the memory of a feeling") is purposeful and paid off immediately in the strike. Rhythmic control modulates from deliberate setup to resonant final image without leakage or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high (most sentences advance perception, cavern mechanics, or thematic weight), and figurative language—"aurora born not from solar wind but from sound," "dye into fabric"—clarifies rather than decorates. Minor template cadence in the strike sequence ("The first…The second…The third") is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. One paraphrase slip: "a tightness…she had mistaken it for her own heartbeat" echoes the prior "unfetter" concept within two lines. Propulsion strong; no loops touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synesthesia-as-proof premise offers a fresh synthesis (musical performance inscribes onto resin through sympathetic resonance), and the sculptor's chisel metaphor for irreversible commitment is specific rather than stock. The final image—oscillating blue "like the chest of someone…asleep"—feels earned in hindsight from the "sculpted hush" and breath-violet motifs. Risk is present (no antagonist, abstract stakes) but the accumulative design coheres. Mild derivative pressure from artist-proves-beauty templates, mitigated by the cavern-as-witness turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the title beat, drives the entire action sequence (she descends alone, interprets the sheet, strikes each column, supplies the missing note), and the final "She climbed back…carrying the proof" shows her agency forecloses the proving-burden path with cost. Two-beat minimum (descent decision, final strike choice) plus closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced early (arrival three days ago, held to lamplight), used at cavern center (angled on ice ledge to guide strikes), and returns transformed at closure when "a note now gleamed, pressed into the resin by the cavern itself." Three functional beats with reweighted meaning; her tracing the inscribed note charges the proof. Strong causal and closure work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Seeded early as "a silence so deliberate it felt chiseled…a sculpted hush," reappears after the strike ("the hush returned, but it was different now…full"), and the sculptor's chisel metaphor ties it to irreversible commitment. Present in setup and payoff; middle beats rely more on aurora/color. Lyric reprise reweights the stake (emptiness → fullness), meeting the ~6.3 threshold for two-gate integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Certified at birth, enables every sensory perception on the page ("every sound…arrived wrapped in hue," violet rings from breath, ribbon of green-gold light), and underwrites the cavern-proof mechanism (colors teach wonder as structural). Constrains her vocational identity and tactic (she strikes tuned crystal because she sees sound). Present across all beats with visible enabling cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Signaled as the responsibility-burden in paragraph two, dramatized at closure when "something inside her chest unfetter[ed], a tightness…The cavern had just proved it for her," and the action forecloses the proving path (she no longer carries that weight). The verb "unfetter" is irreplaceable and the turn hinges on this exact release. Strong causal and closure linkage with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "through the colors of the aurora she perceived…wonder was not ornamental. It was structural." The aurora accumulates from each strike and at closure "the colors dimmed slowly, settling into the ice like dye into fabric," showing the proof now resides in the cavern. The method shapes her tactic (strike columns to generate color-proof) and charges the final image (white tone joins arctic aurora). Present across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Ice cavern introduced early (descent paragraph), the columnar ice formations enable the performance, the sculpted hush pressures her breath (violet disturbance), the ledge holds the amber sheet, and the cavern inscribes the final note onto the resin—acting as witness and co-agent at closure. Setting supplies irreplaceable resources (resonant columns) and charges the proof mechanism. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sculptor's chisel moment is seeded as "the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble, that instant of irreversible commitment when potential becomes form," tied explicitly to "every time she raised her mallet…and chose to bring it down." Functions as psychological anchor for the blank-measure choice and reappears in the final strike. Present in setup and closure; no live clock but the metaphor reweights her vocational commitment with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Stated early as "a responsibility she had not yet fulfilled" and "proving that beauty mattered," dramatized through the descent choice and column-strike sequence, conflicted at closure when the cavern proves it for her (she wanted to certify, but must relinquish the burden). Friction between wanting to prove and the cost of carrying proof alone generates the unfettering payoff. Strong causal and closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone oscillates between deliberate quiet ("sculpted hush," "she listened for the note that was not yet written") and charged sensory crescendo (aurora dome, white tone rising), then returns to repose with "a calm, oscillating blue…like someone deeply, peacefully asleep." The modulation supports pressure (building to strike, then settling) and the final image embodies the oscillation. Coherent through turns and charges closure.</comment>
