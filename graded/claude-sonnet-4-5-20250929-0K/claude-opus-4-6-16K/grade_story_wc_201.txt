<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's proprioceptive enhancement and trauma-response navigation show strong internal contradiction—geometry as refuge from suffering, the mask strap as calibration tool. Her motivation to extract the algorithm is embodied through micro-choices (bracing, walking, kneeling to write equations). The compressed backstory anchors present stance and pays off at closure, though the "mathematician hidden beneath" risks slight label-speak. The final renunciation of passivity into active extraction feels earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors POV, forest location, and post-extraction timeframe by ~150 words; slightly late but functional. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered memory triggers (violet light, pewter strap, fluorescent recall) toward the closure image of equations written in luminous dirt—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the cost (converting wounds into coordinates) is conceptually legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from passive recall to active extraction, narrowing options by committing to night-long work. Causality holds under the lens; the surgeon's warning creates pursuit pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vivid and purposeful: phosphorescent bark and lichen guide her path, the clearing's unfiltered light enables her to write equations in glowing dirt—setting directly charges the closure image. Proprioceptive detail (joint angles, soil give, center of gravity) functions as micro-setting that constrains body awareness. Sensory hierarchy reflects trauma-trained perception: violet shades trigger interrogation memories, tactile precision anchors survival. No spatial drift; the forest evolves from threat-space to workspace. The "cathedral of penance" metaphor integrates tone without forced symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (extract the algorithm to invert the mathematics of mercy) is signaled early and drives all moves. One meaningful tightening: the surgeon's warning that her captors know she's alive raises external threat, yet Maren chooses to work through the night despite exposure—agency as endurance with visible cost (vulnerability, no safe haven). Trauma responses function as both tool and price: each memory unlocks data but re-imposes suffering. The resolution is protagonist-driven (her choice to convert wounds into proof) and forecloses retreat. Persistent constraint: the proprioceptive enhancement that kept her sane now binds her to relive pain to access information.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the inversion of suffering-as-data: Maren's captors treated pain as optimizable variables; she reclaims that calculus to publish mercy as a theorem "belonging to everyone who had ever been on the wrong side of its arithmetic." The pewter strap and equations in luminous dirt function as charged particulars, not imposed symbols. The final image—bracing against earth, converting screams into proof—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question (can systematized cruelty be systematically dismantled?) without moralizing. No thematic echo or label-speak in the closure beat. Subtext operates in "geometry could be studied rather than suffered" and the mask's deprivation of expression.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds tight to Maren's perceptual signature: "crystalline precision," "vectors of force," "absolute certainty of her own position in space." Diction reflects her mathematical lens without register drift. No head-hopping. The narration modulates with pressure—compressed syntax during memory triggers, longer cadence during equation-writing. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") are voice-consistent and sparse. One minor slip: "the mathematician hidden beneath" edges toward expository summary rather than showing the concealment through prior scene work. Psychic distance stays controlled; proprioceptive detail remains character-particular throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; no template runs. Information density is high—most sentences do multiple jobs (world-building, characterization, pressure). "Color born from damage" and "bruise is beautiful" risk slight overwriting but remain coherent and voice-motivated. One paraphrase edge: "the forest glowed around her like a cathedral of penance, ultraviolet and unforgiving" near-echoes earlier "beautiful the way a bruise is beautiful" in metaphorical vehicle. No loops or scaffold; pronoun references clean. Opening line ("anesthesia wore off in layers") and closing action (hand braced, writing equations) anchor and propel. Minor: "the mathematics of mercy" is stated twice in adjacent paragraphs without pressure variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest born from atmospheric collapse offers fresh world-building; combining proprioceptive enhancement with trauma-response navigation as extraction tool is non-obvious. The inversion—captor's dehumanizing data calculus repurposed by victim to dismantle the system—feels earned rather than gimmicky. Risk: heavy reliance on speculative elements (enhanced nervous system, UV sky, algorithm as memory) could veer toward concept-crowding, but the piece commits fully and grounds them in embodied experience. One proximity note: "geometry as refuge from suffering" and "mathematics of mercy" risk abstraction, yet are specified through equations written in dirt. The closing image transforms the premise with specific cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren's status as enhanced interrogation survivor shapes every beat: the implant extraction wound throbs, trauma responses unlock memories, her decision to extract the algorithm rather than flee drives the closure. Present by paragraph one (setup ✓), enables middle navigation via trauma triggers (development ✓), and her final choice to work through the night despite exposure constitutes the closure action (payoff ✓). Causal pressure: her survival skills (geometry-as-study, mask-as-calibration) narrow options to this single path. Cost: vulnerability, re-traumatization. Irreplaceable—no generic survivor could carry this specific skill set or algorithmic goal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pewter mask strap appears in three beats: pocket touch that "unlocked" trauma response (development via tactile trigger), wound around wrist during the walk (embodiment), and implicit presence during equation-writing (sustained anchor). Setup occurs ~paragraph 4, slightly late but functional. It functions as "relic" for "calibration," enabling memory navigation—causal link to the algorithm extraction. Closure linkage: the strap's role in unlocking memories charges the final image of writing equations, though it is not named in the last paragraph. Specificity: pewter coolness, torn from interrogation mask, kept for calibration not comfort. One friction: could a different trauma object serve similarly? Moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ultraviolet penance is established early (paragraph 2: UV sky, forest glowing "the way a bruise is beautiful—color born from damage") and the closing paragraph explicitly frames the forest as "cathedral of penance, ultraviolet and unforgiving." The concept shapes tone and setting throughout, and the final image—writing equations in luminous dirt under UV light—directly charges closure by literalizing penance-as-work. Development beat: the violet shade triggering interrogation memory (middle paragraph) links UV light to trauma navigation. Cost: the unforgiving light exposes her while she works. Minor friction: "penance" as a term risks thematic echo, yet the image work (bruise-color, cathedral metaphor) earns it. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with conceptual closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Proprioceptive enhancement is introduced in paragraph one, used to study fractures as geometry during interrogation (backstory that primes present skill), and active in every movement beat: "angle of the slope, the give of the soil, her center of gravity shifting like a pendulum she could read." It enables her navigation and grounds her certainty ("she always knew exactly where she stood"), and the trade-off is explicit—kept her sane during torture but now binds her to hyper-awareness. Causal: the trait allows trauma-response navigation and equation-writing precision. Closure: her braced hand and writing in dirt rely on this enhanced body sense. Irreplaceable: no generic "awareness" could carry this specificity or cost. Three gates met with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Brace" appears four times: bracing against trunk to stand (recovery action), bracing in clearing to write (transition to climax), and closing line "braced her hand against the earth and kept writing" (final image anchoring closure). Setup occurs early (paragraph 3), development in paragraph 6 (kneeling shifts to braced writing posture), payoff in final sentence. The action literalizes her rooted/displaced theme and enables the equation work that constitutes her agency. Cost: physical vulnerability (kneeling, hand pressed to earth) during exposure. Moderate irreplaceability—other verbs (kneel, press) could substitute with minor tonal shifts, yet "brace" carries connotations of endurance under load that fit her stance. Two strong beats plus closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("what the surgeons called a trauma response but what Maren understood as a doorway… moving through the architecture of what had been done to her"), demonstrated in the middle beat (violet shade triggers Commander Vasik's voice and detention quotas), and executed at closure (working through the night, "converting every wound into a coordinate, every scream into a proof"). Mechanics matter: the pewter strap unlocks responses, specific sensory cues (violet light, fluorescent recall) retrieve algorithm fragments. Cost: re-experiencing terror to extract data. Irreplaceable: the story's entire causal engine depends on this method—without trauma-response navigation, she has no access to the algorithm. Three gates with high causal pressure and closure centrality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ultraviolet forest is introduced in paragraph two with vivid specificity (spectral blues, phosphorescent bark and lichen), pressures choices via exposure ("the field surgeon who freed her had left her here, at the forest's edge"), and supplies the resource that enables closure: the clearing's unfiltered UV light turns the dirt luminous, allowing her to write visible equations. The forest functions as cathedral and workspace, its glow literalizing the conversion of damage into evidence. Spatial choreography is clean (edge → deeper → clearing). Three gates met. Causal: the setting's bioluminescence is integral to the equation-writing climax. Cost: no shelter, full exposure under the changed sky. Irreplaceable—no generic forest could provide this UV-charged resource.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Timeframe opens with "anesthesia wore off in layers" and closes "she worked through the night… by dawn… she would have the formula complete." Setup is immediate, and the night-long deadline creates a live clock that tightens her exposure window (captors know she's alive). Development: "she walked deeper" and "paused in a clearing" compress transit, then "by dawn" establishes the endpoint. Closure relies on this frame: working through the night with no safe harbor. Moderate causal pressure—the clock raises stakes but does not force a tactical pivot. Cost: vulnerability accumulates with each hour. Minor friction: the night passage is more atmospheric anchor than a mechanism that alters moves beat-by-beat. Two gates (setup, payoff) with modest development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Motivation is introduced in paragraph five ("the mathematics of mercy—the formula by which a system decided the threshold of suffering. If she could extract it… she could invert it"), drives the walk and clearing work, and constitutes the closure action (writing equations to completion). The desire is dramatized through embodied choice: she walks despite danger, kneels in the clearing, works through the night. Friction between want (dismantle the system) and cost (re-traumatization, exposure) is on the page. The motivation shapes every beat—memory navigation, equation extraction, final commitment. Three gates met with strong causal pressure. Minor slip: "the mathematics of mercy" risks slight abstraction, though the image of equations in luminous dirt grounds it. Irreplaceable: no generic "revenge" could carry this specific algorithmic inversion goal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tone is established early: "displaced from every place she had ever called home, yet rooted in the absolute certainty of her own position in space." This duality modulates under pressure—estrangement intensifies ("ghostly and strange" in UV light) while rootedness deepens (braced hand, equations anchored in earth). The final image fuses both: displaced survivor kneeling in an alien forest, utterly certain of her geometric and moral position. Coherent through turns; no single static mood. The closing paragraph's "cathedral of penance, ultraviolet and unforgiving" charges the tone without breaking it. The displaced/rooted tension directly shapes characterization (proprioceptive precision vs. homelessness) and thematic closure (systemic exile met with embodied certainty). Strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>
