<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lien is realized through concrete actions—knotting, photographing, dismantling—and her "esoteric realist" stance is embodied rather than declared. Her motivation to honor Dawa feels consistent and drives the climb, the building, and the archival recording. The internal life is spare but character-particular: she believes in "the gesture, the interrupted cadence" and enacts that philosophy on the page. Minor slip: the renunciation (leaving nothing permanent) carries conceptual weight but the felt cost remains oblique; we see care in dismantling but little friction or doubt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates density through the grotto arrival, knot-tying, butterfly landing, and archival commitment, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid) where Lien's documentation ensures Dawa's invisible history will attach to the record—a reweighting with conceptual cost (the final migration passing, the structures dismantled). Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph. The tightening is a single deepening: the butterfly arrival validates Dawa's map and charges Lien's gesture with urgency. Cost is conceptual and slightly oblique—"the last year they would pass through" and "leaving the listener leaning forward into silence"—legible but not visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto is rendered with vivid, selective detail: "cupped palm of moss and stone," "verdant walls weeping with condensation," "pink with alpenglow." The updraft curling "like breath over a mirror" integrates setting into the butterfly arrival. The structures become micro-setting that constrains Lien's hands ("feeling the cord bite into her skin") and charges the final image when she dismantles them. Spatial choreography (ledges, cloud rim, descent) remains clear across beats. The moth wing caught on a frayed knot is a tactile micro-anchor that links past and present.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: honoring Dawa's overlooked cartography before the monarch migration ends. The climb and building telegraph urgency; the butterfly arrival tightens by validating the map's precision and making the gesture concrete. Lien's agency—photographing, recording coordinates, naming Dawa in the archive—forecloses the path of leaving no trace and enacts a choice with conceptual cost (the structures are dismantled, but the record persists). The cost is felt in "the interrupted cadence would find its resolution...in the quiet insistence," though it remains more thematic than visceral. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length; no spurious reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: interrupted cadence, transiently rooted structures, the last migration, invisible histories. The knots as "language of tension and release" and the gesture stopping "before its resolution" create a coherent thematic arc without statement. The ending's "quiet insistence that someone had been here first" offers a resonant answer to the question of how we honor the overlooked—through records that outlast gestures. The moth wing pressed in the journal is a non-literal image that reweights prior material (Dawa's two-hundred-year map, the final monarchs). Minor slip: "the interrupted cadence would find its resolution...in the record" edges toward articulating the theme rather than letting the final image hold it alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "She wanted the specific, the granular, the overlooked fact." Diction is controlled and voice-particular—"esoteric realist," "the blushing stillness," "held breath finally released." The narrative modulates subtly: spare and propulsive during the climb and building, expansive and lyric when the butterflies arrive. Purposeful compression (six-day climb in one phrase, two centuries in a clause) serves momentum. No dialogue, so those bullets are inert. Psychic distance tightens appropriately when the butterfly lands on Lien's wrist. A few phrases ("the silence so complete she could hear") verge on stock lyricism but remain legible and voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances setting, motive, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally, and paragraph structure creates visual cadence. The opening grounds voice and stakes cleanly. Minor loop: "She believed in the gesture, the interrupted cadence...leaving the listener leaning forward into silence" and later "The interrupted cadence would find its resolution...in the quiet insistence" repeat the motif without advancing pressure; the second instance could compress. A few filter verbs ("she could hear," "she saw") are acceptable but cluster slightly. No muddy metaphors; "floating embers" and "breath over a mirror" remain coherent. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of esoteric cartography, monarch migration ecology, and ephemeral structure-building feels specific and non-obvious. Lien's "esoteric realist" stance and the knot language drawn from Dawa's margins avoid template territory. The final image—moth wing trembling in the journal, structures dismantled, archive naming Dawa—is purposeful and earned. Risk-taking in tone (meditative, accumulative) succeeds without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the core emotional arc (honor overlooked history through temporary gesture made permanent via record) is thoughtfully executed but not radically transformed; the premise reads fresh rather than paradigm-shifting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lien's choices—climb, build, photograph, dismantle—drive all major beats. Her decision to document (coordinates, date, count) and name Dawa in the archive is the story's decisive action, reweighting the "nothing permanent" stance with conceptual cost. She appears throughout and the closure depends on her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The moth wing appears twice: caught on a frayed knot mid-story, then "trembling inside" the journal in the final line. It links nocturnal shelter to Dawa's drawing and charges the descent image. However, it does not constrain a choice or shift tactics; its role is lyric reprise rather than causal pressure. Early seed → final return qualifies for mid-6s under the lyric allowance, but it lacks beat involvement or cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" is named early, embodied in the temporary structures "designed to collapse within weeks," and paid off when "the interrupted cadence would find its resolution...in the record." It shapes Lien's tactics (build, then dismantle) and charges the closure: the gesture stops, but the archive persists. The concept constrains on-page actions and reweights the ending with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" is named once and enacted throughout: structures "anchored just enough to stand...but designed to collapse," then dismantled. The trait constrains Lien's building method and forecloses permanence, creating the central tension resolved by the archive. It shapes two beats (building, dismantling) and informs the closure logic. Visible tradeoff: ephemeral gesture vs. lasting record.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The knots appear in setup (margin illustrations), development (each structure lashed with "deliberate" knots as "language"), and payoff (loosening "with the same care"). Knotting defines the building action and the moth wing is "caught on a frayed knot." The act is irreplaceable: swapping "knot" for generic "fastening" would lose the tactile and symbolic texture. Knots shape two beats and charge the closure by linking Lien's hands to Dawa's system.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Building temporary structures is signaled early (unpacks materials, begins first tripod), drives the middle (eleven structures arranged as "sentences in a story"), and payoffs in dismantling and the archive photograph. The method shapes Lien's tactics (transiently rooted, deliberate knots) and the closure: structures are removed, but their documentation ensures Dawa's name persists. Mechanics matter (tripod = safe passage, lattice = water, arch = sacred). The method is indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The grotto frames the entire story: Lien climbs six days to reach it, Dawa mapped it as a waypoint, the monarchs arrive there, and Lien builds on its "mossy ledges." It supplies the space for the gesture and the thin wind that structures must "stand against." The descent through clouds closes the arc. The grotto constrains action (altitude aches Lien's fingers) and charges the closure (coordinates recorded, structures left to rot into its soil). Essential to setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"The last migration" is announced early ("This was the last year they would pass through"), tightens urgency for the building, and payoffs when "the last one disappeared below the cloud line." The timeframe makes the gesture irreplaceable and charges the archive commitment with conceptual cost: after this, the route "would have no bodies left to carry it." It shapes Lien's decision to climb now and document. Visible constraint on tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Honoring overlooked histories is dramatized: Lien climbs to validate Dawa's journal, builds using her knot system, and commits to naming her in the archive. The motive drives all major choices and faces friction (temporary structures vs. lasting record). The closure reconfigures the want: "the name would attach to a history that had been invisible for two hundred years." Cost is conceptual (ephemeral gesture, permanent archive) but undeniable. Desire shapes three beats and the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Blushing stillness" is named once ("the blushing stillness of that moment, the air pink with alpenglow") at the butterfly-landing beat. Tone throughout is meditative, accumulative, and restrained, modulating subtly from spare (climb, build) to lyric (arrival, descent). The stillness charges the pivotal image but does not recur or constrain other beats. Coherent and purposeful, contributing to the ending's resonance, but not woven through enough beats to reach the high 8s.</comment>
