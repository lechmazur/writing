<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and intensifies coherently—she purses connection through the entangled memories despite clinical pressure to sever them. Interior texture is strong ("quietly rebellious against the numbering"), embodied in the drumming ritual. The connection to Lior reads as felt rather than diagnostic, though the final heartbeat answer risks convenient resolution. Internal contradiction could be sharper; her defiance is steady rather than torn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the syncopated answering heartbeat crystallizes the shared-dream bridge with undeniable pressure and cost (41 days of waiting, surgical risk, institutional defiance all converge). Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words. The accumulative lens holds—drumming intensifies sensory architecture until the lagoon manifests, then the monitor responds. One tightening (basin fills, reflection appears, heartbeat answers) is sufficient and causally earned by prior entanglement setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The Sound Wave Garden is not postcard décor—it constrains and enables every beat. Crystalline stalks, membrane walls, and the resonance basin are tactile, manipulated tools that translate Maren's drumming into the auric lagoon. The garden's "strange physics" supplies the bridge mechanism and charges the final image (golden water, dual reflections). Sensory selection modulates with pressure (copper lip, warm fog, violet arches). The setting *is* the method, indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early and held: keep the entanglement alive as a bridge to Lior. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lagoon materializes and his reflection appears independently, narrowing options to this single ritual window. Agency is renunciation (she "signed nothing") and endurance (41 days, nightly drumming). The answering heartbeat is the visible cost/payoff, though it risks feeling externally granted rather than wrested. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: shared memories as both clinical error and bridge, the dream-as-door, the cost of holding threshold space. The auric lagoon recurs with reweighted meaning (dream → manifest → reflection → answer). "Auroral sorrow...luminous, dawn-colored grief of loving something that existed only at the threshold" is conceptually earned, not stated as moral. The ending offers a resonant answer (entanglement becomes lifeline) without explaining it. No thematic echo or sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren with distinct perceptual signature ("quietly rebellious," "the hush of the universe inhaling"). Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated for a lyric-situational piece. No head-hopping; Lior's presence is accessed only through shared memories and the reflection. Psychic distance tightens cleanly at closure. Minor slip: "auroral sorrow" phrase in the penultimate paragraph edges toward narrated theme rather than embodied perception, though it recovers quickly in the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and no paraphrase loops appear. Figurative language is dense but coherent ("arches of violet light," "golden liquid luminance"). Minor overwriting in the penultimate paragraph: "auroral sorrow...luminous, dawn-colored grief" stacks metaphors without added pressure. The final beat (syncopated heartbeat answering) is clean and propulsive. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Closure image is unobscured.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The entangled-memories premise is familiar from recent speculative templates, but the story transforms it through the Sound Wave Garden's strange physics and the drumming-as-bridge mechanic. The auroral lagoon manifestation and dual-reflection turn feel earned rather than convenient. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulation and the open-but-charged ending (monitor response, not full awakening) elevates without obscuring clarity. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous SFF moments.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (Subject 7) makes the key choice to continue the ritual nightly and refuse severance ("nodded and signed nothing"). Her agency drives the escalation and closure—drumming creates the lagoon, holding the threshold yields the answering heartbeat. Present early, involved in all major beats, indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The auric lagoon appears first as shared dream (~20%), materializes through drumming at the basin (mid-beat), then becomes the charged reflection surface where Lior's face answers (closure beat). It narrows options (only this dream-door might reach him) and supplies the final image's resonance. Removing it breaks the bridge metaphor and closure mechanism entirely.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Entangled memories frame the stake (keep the braid, refuse excision), supply the shared dream, and enable the dual-reflection moment. The concept shapes tactics (drumming to manifest shared architecture) and is tested under institutional pressure. Present by ~15%, causally active in at least three beats (Lior's coma, her refusal, the lagoon manifestation, the answering heartbeat). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Quietly rebellious" is signaled in the opening line and enacted when she refuses to sign the severance consent. It constrains her to covert night action rather than open defiance. The trait is more than label but could impose sharper on-page cost (e.g., surveillance risk, exhaustion trade-off). Present early and at one key choice; solid but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Perching on the basin rim is the literal stance from which she drums and summons the lagoon. It recurs ("perched there at the edge of the lagoon") and charges the threshold metaphor. Swapping "perch" for "sit" or "kneel" would slightly dilute the avian/edge imagery but the core choice remains. Solid integration across setup, middle, and closure; not quite irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Drumming on everything (basin, stalks, walls, sternum) is signaled by ~25%, explicitly framed as "the only method that worked," and drives every escalation beat. The mechanics matter: varied surfaces yield different tones/hues that build the lagoon. Removing it collapses the entire causal chain and closure mechanism. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Sound Wave Garden is not backdrop—it supplies the strange physics that translate vibration into visible phenomena, enabling the manifestation. Every tactical choice (which surface to drum, how pressure accumulates) depends on the garden's tuned architecture. It provides the resonance basin, crystalline stalks, membrane walls, and the harmonic projection of stars. Removing it makes the story impossible. Fully integrated, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"The deep hours—the hush of the universe inhaling" is poetic and sets nocturnal secrecy (doctors asleep), but elapsed time is vague. The 41-day duration of Lior's coma supplies background pressure but does not tighten on-page decisions. No countdown or live clock alters her moves within this single session. Lyric presence with mild causal weight; functional but not urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To breathe life into a shared dream" is distilled explicitly in the penultimate paragraph and drives every choice: nightly drumming, refusal of severance, holding the threshold open. Friction is present (clinical risk, 41 days of failure, her own surgical port aching). The motivation is tested under institutional pressure and pays off in the answering heartbeat. Strong integration with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Auroral sorrow is named once but enacted throughout: the garden's violet/amber light, the "luminous, dawn-colored grief," the poised waiting at threshold. Tone modulates from defiant determination (opening drumming) to charged quiet (final heartbeat). The sorrowful beauty charges the closure image without flattening into single-note sadness. Coherent, purposeful, and closure-active.</comment>
