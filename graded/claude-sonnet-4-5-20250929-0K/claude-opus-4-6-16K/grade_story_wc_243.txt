<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marguerite is given concrete interior life through her belief system and methodology ("gently thorough," working "through proximate causes"), and her physical embodiment on the jetty grounds the interiority. The speaking-to-photographs habit and her micro-choices (propping the locket, mixing walnut ink) reveal character under pressure. However, the core choice to publish the covenant feels predetermined rather than tested by live on-page conflict; we see her execute a plan, not wrestle with competing goods. The final stance is earned by backstory and thematic commitment but lacks a pivot moment where she weighs visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates density through the locket discovery, the tannin steeping, and the covenant's emergence, then closes with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image—"The jetty bloomed. The water lapped. The covenant breathed"—reweights prior material and crystallizes the archivist's achieved purpose with felt cost (eleven years, dwindling funding, physical ache). However, the escalation is gentle and the cost is primarily told in backstory ("eleven years," "funding...dwindle") rather than tested in a present tightening that forecloses an option. One meaningful deepening occurs (the ink surfaces, the promise breathes again), sufficient for this length, but the closure leans heavily on thematic resonance rather than a narrative turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is vividly anchored with sensory specificity ("pale violet clusters," "jasmine and saltwater") and the twilight progression tracks across the scene. The walnut-ink kit, tannin bath, and parchment fragments constrain Marguerite's physical actions and ground her methodology in tactile detail. The locket photo and document case function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. The setting directly enables her restoration work and the closing line ("The jetty bloomed") reweights the earlier description, satisfying the 9+ gate by charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—regenerating the covenant to restore a forgotten obligation—is signaled early and sustained. Marguerite's agency is renunciation and endurance (eleven years, dwindling support) rather than a contested choice in the present scene. The tightening comes when the ink surfaces and she photographs the fragments, but no live opposition tests her commitment; the families who engineered the flood are off-page history. The cost (aching knees, "haunted euphoria," years spent) is told and felt but not dramatized as a trade-off that forecloses another path. Escalation is accumulative and textural rather than a contested turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: preservation as mercy, small moments versus grand narratives, chosen memory against engineered forgetting. The covenant's regeneration and the locket photo anchor the theme in concrete objects and actions. Marguerite's interior claim—"to preserve the weight of small moments was the only honest act"—risks didacticism but is grounded in her eleven years of work and the specific curl of a child's name. The final image ("The covenant breathed") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists false equivalence (the wealthy families are culpable) and the emotional honesty of "haunted euphoria" avoids sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly filtered through Marguerite's archival priorities and perceptual biases. The diction is controlled and purposeful ("proximate causes," "tannin solution," "acid-free tissue"), reflecting her professional idiom without drifting into exposition. The prose rhythm modulates effectively: lyric compression in the opening, patient detail during the steeping, cadenced closure in the final triad. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Brief convergence toward lyricism at closure ("The jetty bloomed. The water lapped. The covenant breathed.") reads intentional and voice-consistent. One minor slip: "haunted euphoria" is articulated with near-diagnostic precision mid-scene, but it is later embodied in physical ache and ritual, so the effect recovers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythm, purposeful compression in the opening and expansion during the work sequence, clean syntax and vivid sensory anchors. Information density is high (each paragraph advances character, setting, or theme). Minor scaffold appears in mid-story backstory exposition ("She had found evidence, through proximate causes traced across a century..."), which summarizes rather than dramatizes the discovery process. The phrase "haunted euphoria, the impossible coexistence of grief and wonder" over-explains the feeling rather than trusting the image. Final triad is clean and rhythmically effective. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs, but the backstory block flattens momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—archivist as guardian against engineered forgetting—transforms the familiar "preservation as resistance" trope through hyper-specific detail: walnut-ink recipes, tannin baths, proximate-cause methodology, the 1743 covenant, the 1919 flood. Marguerite's dual commitment (archival precision and moral witness) feels particular to her voice and vocation. The story resists tourist-history surface decoration and stakes a claim for historical obligation as living duty. The central turn (ink surfacing, letters visible) is earned by prior ritual, not a late rule change. However, the overall arc is contemplative and predetermined rather than risk-laden; no bold structural gambit complicates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marguerite drives all beats: she identifies Elise, traces the flood conspiracy, mixes the ink, steeps the fragments, photographs the results, and frames the publication. Her methodology ("gently thorough," "through proximate causes") shapes every action. She appears in the opening, middle (steeping), and closure (packing, feeling the weight return). The final image depends on her completed work. One minor friction: her choices feel more like ritual execution than contested decisions, so causal pressure is moderate rather than high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The locket photo anchors three beats: discovery (pressed between pages), mid-scene witness (propped against the ink case, Marguerite speaks to it), and closure (placed in the document case with the covenant). It identifies Elise Caron and thus enables the backstory reconstruction. The photo's return at the end, "alongside the covenant her family had authored," reweights its meaning from artifact to co-equal testament. However, the locket itself does not constrain a present choice or shift tactics; it functions as witness and thematic echo rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The regenerated covenant is the story's dominant stake and shapes all action: Marguerite's eleven-year career, her jetty ritual, the tannin steeping, the ink surfacing, and the publication plan. The covenant's destruction and her reconstruction frame the entire narrative. The moment the letters surface ("...shall share in equal portion...") is the story's hinge. The final image ("The covenant breathed") depends entirely on this element. Cost is legible: years of work, aching knees, professional isolation, and the gamble that publication will matter. High irreplaceability and full three-gate integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is named once as the mentor's compliment and demonstrated in Marguerite's method: "never forcing a document back to wholeness but instead addressing each adjacent point of decay." The trait enables her steeping technique and patient reconstruction. However, it does not visibly constrain a choice or create a trade-off; it describes her approach rather than testing it under competing pressure. The attribute is present in setup and implied in method but lacks a beat where thoroughness costs her speed or another goal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Steep" (the tannin bath) appears in the setup ("here to steep the recovered parchment pieces"), drives the central action (lifting fragments from the bath, ink surfacing), and the result enables the publication. The process is specific to walnut-ink restoration and could not be swapped for a generic "repair" without losing the story's archival texture. However, the action itself is methodical rather than contested; no complication or failure tests the steeping. It shapes two beats (preparation, surfacing) and is causally necessary but not dramatically charged.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is Marguerite's stated method and demonstrated twice: tracing the flood conspiracy across "meeting minutes, tax disputes, and harbor logs," and working "through proximate causes, never forcing a document back to wholeness." The method is signaled early, enables her discovery of the engineered destruction, and justifies her restoration approach. It appears in setup and middle development but is summarized rather than dramatized in real time. The method matters conceptually and thematically but does not constrain a live on-page choice where she must choose adjacency over a shortcut.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight anchors all action: Marguerite kneels there, the twilight progression tracks time, the violet blooms close against the dark, the scent triggers "haunted euphoria," and the locket photo shows Elise standing on this same jetty. The setting enables the ritual (proximity to water, historical continuity) and charges the final image: "The jetty bloomed. The water lapped. The covenant breathed." The jetty is irreplaceable; no other location carries the same historical and thematic weight. Full three-gate integration with strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"When context changes, obligations become suggestions" is thematized and demonstrated through the 1919 flood (context changed, covenant dissolved) and the present archive funding shift (history becomes decoration). The timeframe pressure is conceptual rather than tactical: Marguerite works against cultural forgetting, not a ticking clock. Twilight tracks scene time but does not tighten her choices. The element is present in setup (historical arc) and payoff (her counter-move to publish) but does not constrain moment-to-moment decisions. Lyric resonance is strong but practical pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marguerite's motivation—"to preserve the weight of small moments"—is stated early, demonstrated through eleven years of work, and dramatized in her jetty ritual (handling fragments, speaking to Elise, photographing each piece). The desire drives her publication plan and the final image reaffirms it: "feeling its full weight settle back into the world." Friction appears in dwindling funding and public indifference, creating mild cost. However, the motivation is never contested by a competing want; she does not waver or sacrifice another goal. Present in setup, development, and closure with thematic charge but limited dramatic conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is named once ("a feeling she could only describe as haunted euphoria, the impossible coexistence of grief and wonder") and embodied throughout: chest ache from the scent, the bittersweet ritual, the final "strange, haunted euphoria...holding a small, almost-vanished moment." The tone is coherent across turns and modulates with the twilight's progression and the covenant's emergence. The final image—blooming jetty, lapping water, breathing covenant—charges the duality without naming it again. The label-moment mid-scene is over-articulate but recovers through embodied closure. Strong lyric reprise and tonal control under pressure.</comment>
