<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior is deeply specific and embodied—"audibly muted" grief, the four-second filament piercing numbness, tears "as audibly muted as everything else." Her contradictory impulses (craving feeling vs. fearing its absence) act simultaneously in scene. The ending's choice to wrap the broken needle and leave carries visible cost: she gains access to the seam but loses nothing of her deafness or Aldo's absence. Minor: the eleven-month numbness is told rather than tested earlier, but the present action earns the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): numbness cracks along a seam she can now find, with felt cost ("still broken… still deaf… still empty"). The cavern experiment and seven-record sequence deepen pressure through density and cadence shift. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Elara, cavern, October, phonograph case). One meaningful tightening—backward needle to mirrored hush to tears—narrows her emotional access with on-page cost. Lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cavern's acoustics constrain her experiment (limestone folds reversed melody into mirrored hush) and charge the final image (empty of its maker, yet a living instrument). Micro-setting details—workbench vibrations, mallets as "sleeping birds," damp wall—anchor perception and choice. The oak at the end supplies a tactile closure beat (tree letting go). Sensory hierarchy reflects her deaf POV (vibration primacy, visual rustle inferred). Scope fits; no excess occupation detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: pierce eleven months of numbness. One meaningful deepening: the four-second filament (paragraph two) becomes sustained access through seven reversed records, each layering sorrow, gratitude, unnamed seasonal recognition. Agency is endurance and attention, forecloses the path of passivity with visible cost (weeping without sound, wrapping the broken needle). No antagonist required; pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens. The final moment reweights options: "It was enough" crystallizes Charged Poise with undeniable felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—grief and numbness as seasonal withdrawal, return as incremental thaw—emerges through particulars: backward melody as shadow, mirrored hush as presence, the filament "no louder than the hush between one season and the next." The broken needle and falling leaves constrain metaphor without stated moral. Final image (tree letting go) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "can feeling return?" Conceptual cost is legible: she gains the seam but nothing is restored. No prompt-echo in the ending paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: deaf POV privileges vibration, touch, inference ("teaching starlight through mathematics"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("audibly muted," "filament of hush," "season's faint rustle in how the rock had cooled"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the needle descent, wide at the climbing-out beat). No head-hopping; first-person-adjacent third remains stable. Figurative compression ("photographic negative," "sap inward to survive") is taught early and consistent. Under peak stress (weeping), syntax tightens without losing texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density high: most sentences do double duty (e.g., "the tree pulling its sap inward to survive" = seasonal metaphor + numbness logic + closure prep). Rhythm varies (long periodic sentences in setup, shorter declaratives at closure). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor: "audibly muted" recurs three times across the piece—functional for motif but borderline churn. Figurative language is dense ("filament," "photographic negative," "mirrored hush") but remains coherent and voice-motivated. Zero scaffolding or pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise—deaf music teacher using reversed phonograph to access "mirrored hush"—is specific and non-obvious. Transformation of familiar grief-recovery arc through acoustics, deafness-as-lens, and the "filament beneath sound" feels fresh. Execution is confident; the backward-needle mechanism and cavern-as-drum synthesis are grounded in her teaching expertise. Slight dock: the seasonal-withdrawal metaphor (numbness as winter, thaw as spring) leans toward template emotional progression, though the sensory particulars (tree letting go, rustle of turning) elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara drives key turns: chooses the cavern (setup), angles the broken needle backward (inciting action), plays seven records (escalation), wraps the needle and leaves (closure choice). Her observation is decision-laden—she "intended to play" the cave, calculated the backward angle, and recognized the filament. Deaf identity constrains method (vibration primacy) and charges the ending (tears "as audibly muted as everything else"). Present across all beats with causal agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Broken needle appears in setup (wrapped like relic, snapped three weeks ago), enables the backward-play experiment (middle beats), and is re-wrapped at closure with reweighted meaning ("still broken" = acceptance of imperfection). Three distinct beats; specificity matters (broken state enables reversed grooves). Visible cost: she keeps it broken, gains access to the seam but forfeits repair. High integration; removal would collapse the plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Filament of hush" shapes stakes (Elara seeks to access it again after the four-second pierce) and tactics (backward needle to create mirrored silence). It appears in setup (paragraph two), middle (the cavern produces it via reversed nocturne), and closure ("a filament no thicker than a phonograph needle"). Conceptual resonance is strong, but the element trends slightly abstract—its causal pressure is felt through the needle and records rather than as a standalone constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" recurs three times, labels Elara's grief and tears, and reinforces her POV constraint (no direct sound access). It enables her reliance on vibration and charges the closure image ("tears as audibly muted as everything else"). However, the trait functions more as motif than live constraint—it doesn't alter a specific tactic on the page, only colors perception. Mid-band: present across beats, thematic, but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Enthrall" governs the core turn: the backward nocturne "enthralled her bones… the locked chambers of her chest," breaking eleven months of numbness. The verb is specific (not merely "moved" or "affected") and the story dramatizes its mechanics (vibration climbing wrists, entering sternum). It defines the stake (to be enthralled again) and the payoff (seven records of escalating enthrallment). Swapping it would require deep edits; the sensory grammar depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are signaled early (broken needle snapped, reversing sound), supply the method for all seven experiments, and produce the "mirrored hush" central to closure. Mechanics matter: angled needle, reversed grooves, cavern folding inverse and original into silence. The method shapes every attempt and the ending hinges on its repeatable success. Removal collapses the plot. High integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Cavern supplies essential constraint (acoustics fold reversed melody into mirrored hush) and charges closure (empty of Aldo, yet functional as instrument). Limestone walls, workbench vibrations, and the cave-as-drum metaphor enable Elara's experiment. She chooses this location for its extraordinary acoustics, and the environment delivers the effect she seeks. Three-gate presence: setup (descent, described acoustics), middle (vibrations during play), closure (still empty, still a drum). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>October-to-November frame anchors seasonal metaphor (numbness as winter, thaw as spring turning) and the "faint rustle of turning" motif. Time passage is signaled (leaves falling, first cold morning) and supports theme. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten a decision—Elara could conduct the experiment in any season without mechanical change. Lyric resonance is present (early rustle, final tree letting go) but causal pressure is weak. Mid-band: thematic, not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation to defeat numbness is dramatized across all beats: eleven months of silt-like absence, four-second filament pierce, cavern experiment to access it again, seven records escalating through sorrow/gratitude/unnamed recognition, tears at closure. Friction is embodied (craving feeling vs. fearing its permanence, the pain of blood returning to a sleeping limb). The ending reconfigures the want: numbness hasn't vanished, but she's found the seam. Visible cost: she leaves still deaf, still without Aldo, accepting "enough." Essential.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush"—silence as presence, not absence—governs tone from the cavern's "mouth that swallowed wind and returned nothing" through the backward nocturne's "photographic negative" to closure's "hush between one season and the next." Tone modulates with pressure (contemplative in descent, charged during play, quiet-triumphant at ending) and charges the final image (tree letting go, faint and resonant). Coherent across turns; the mood of reflective acoustic silence holds without static flatness. High integration.</comment>
