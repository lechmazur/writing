<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and specific ("Careful people survived long enough to matter"), and her resourcefulness is shown through micro-choices (photographing pages, scheduling staggered releases). The trait "carefully resourceful" is embodied in actions with visible cost—her patient backup strategy pays off when Warehouse Four is lost. Minor issue: Dahl remains voice-only and the regime's antagonism is abstract; a second on-page character applying immediate pressure would sharpen the crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. Drive lens is Causal: the lost Vess prints create pressure, Maren's puddle-reading enables the retrieval, and her photographing/encryption forecloses the Ministry's erasure with visible cost (the quiet stubbornness of continued resistance). The closure—kneeling at the lagoon, recognizing someone else will read the puddles tomorrow—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the line held reweights prior material. One meaningful tightening (discovery of the backup archive) narrows options and the final image charges the premise with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The auric lagoon is vivid and purposeful: puddles function as a map that constrains Maren's route, and the final image (hand dipped in gold water, ripples carrying light to the far shore) charges closure. Spatial choreography is coherent (shoreline, alley, exchange, return). Minor slip: the linden stumps and corrugated tin feel slightly ornamental rather than shaping a choice in the exchange beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve revised histories against Ministry erasure) is signaled early and tightens when Warehouse Four is lost. Maren's agency (making the January backup, photographing pages, scheduling staggered releases) drives the reversal with visible cost—the quiet, unglamorous repetition that holds the line. The regime's indifference operates as coherent pressure throughout. One tightening that narrows options and forecloses the Ministry's erasure is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (resistance to bureaucratic erasure through patient, unglamorous work) emerges from particulars: the puddle-map, obsolete keys, staggered encryption nodes. The final image—gold rippling toward someone else who will read the puddles—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how to hold the line) without stating a moral. "Coded freedom" is earned through action, not assertion. The recurring water/light motif reweights prior material at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices puddles as lenses, obsolete locks as security, and administrative indifference as tyranny. Diction stays within her lexicon ("vertigo of months of work collapsing," "sugar in tea"). Dahl's clipped voice contrasts with Maren's measured interior rhythm. The phrase "coded sort" of freedom in the penultimate paragraph mirrors the story's compression and precision. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift across beats. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere without padding. Opening ("held its gold even after the sun dropped") and closing ("ancient, unrevised light") bookend with resonant imagery. Minor artifact: "the water had swallowed centuries of light and refused to give them back" leans slightly purple, and "voiced its corrections in reflected gold" in paragraph two echoes the opening's metaphor without adding pressure. Minimal loop or scaffold otherwise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The combination (puddle-maps, obsolete phone-company locks, bureaucratic memory-erasure) feels organic and particular to Maren's voice. The regime's "tyranny of indifference" and the notion that hardware survives when records are pulped offer fresh inflection on resistance narratives. Risk-taking (quiet ending, reflection-heavy middle) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final turn (someone else will read the puddles tomorrow) grows from prior particulars and reweights the premise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (underestimated rebel) is present throughout and her decisions drive key turns: she chooses to go to Vess despite Dahl's objection, finds the backup archive, photographs and encrypts the files, and schedules staggered releases—all agency that alters tactics and forecloses the Ministry's erasure. The trait "underestimated" is acknowledged by Dahl and shapes the final image (quiet stubbornness). Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability; the story would collapse without her exact choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The phone booth key appears in three beats: drawn from her jacket (paragraph four), used to unlock the exchange door (paragraph nine), and locked behind her (paragraph eleven). Its defunct-company origin (AuraLink) enables the archive's security and shapes her tactic. It's causally essential (without it, no retrieval) and charged with specificity (brass teeth worn smooth). Not swappable; reaches closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Revised histories (the element) shape stakes (Vess prints lost, backup retrieval) and tactics (photographing, encrypting, staggered releases) across multiple beats. The concept is the dominant stake: the Ministry's erasure versus the rebels' preservation. It drives the opening problem, the middle discovery, and the ending's reweighting ("ancient, unrevised light"). Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is signaled early (paragraph four: Dahl's label, Maren's preference), constrains her tactic (making the January backup "precisely because she never trusted a single location"), and is visible in her actions under pressure (photographing by starlight, encrypting, scheduling nodes). The trait enables the reversal with visible cost (months of unglamorous work). Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Reappear" drives the major turn: the files will "reappear across six different nodes...at staggered intervals" and "surface in places the censors hadn't thought to watch." This action is the resolution's mechanism and shapes the ending's charge ("tomorrow someone else would...find the next path"). Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability are strong; swapping it would require structural rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The puddle-map method is signaled early (paragraph two: "each puddle became a lens"), shapes her tactic (tracing the route in paragraph three, finding the alley "exactly where the reflection had promised"), and charges the ending (kneeling, dipping her hand, recognizing the next reader). Three-beat involvement with causal pressure and closure linkage. The specificity (dusk, reflections, gold) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The auric lagoon provides the opening anchor, the puddle-map method, and the final image (hand in water, gold rippling). It constrains her information-gathering and charges closure. The setting is present in three beats (opening, implicit middle reference, ending) and shapes tactics. Micro-setting (body, water) functions as constraint and closure charge. Solid causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"When plans unravel" (the timeframe element) is dramatized on-page: Dahl's call announces Warehouse Four's loss "at noon," creating immediate pressure that tightens Maren's choice to go to Vess. The unraveling shapes her tactic (retrieving the backup) and the ending's stakes (by morning, files reappear). The timeframe is causally active and tied to closure. Strong beat involvement and pressure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To hold the line against the tyranny of indifference" is Maren's stated motivation (paragraph six) and is dramatized through her choices: making backups, walking to Vess despite Dahl's doubt, photographing/encrypting, and the ending's recognition that "the line held." The friction between want (preserve histories) and cost (unglamorous repetition, months undone overnight) is visible on the page. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Coded freedom" (the tone element) modulates across beats: the opening's restrained lyricism, the middle's patient exposition under pressure, and the ending's quiet triumph ("not the loud, declarative kind, but the coded sort"). The tone is coherent and charges the final image (gold rippling, hidden paths, unrevised light). Rhythm and diction support the concept without becoming static. Strong closure charge and specificity.</comment>
