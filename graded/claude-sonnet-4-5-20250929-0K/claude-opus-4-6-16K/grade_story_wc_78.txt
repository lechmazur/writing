<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is vividly particular—her gift of reading cloud "calligraphy" and her principle of repurposing obstacles demonstrate consistent character logic. Her embodied perception (resonance traveling "through her feet, her ribs, her teeth") grounds the interiority in physical sensation. The seven-year backstory serves the present by priming her response to the fractal clouds, and her final whispered mantra ("Every obstacle. Every single one") lands as earned rather than label-speak. Minor friction: the piece leans heavily on her competence without dramatizing a genuine mistake or doubt that complicates her choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture: fractal clouds signal convergence, Maren layers counter-rhythm through "dubbing the obstacle," the standing wave arrives, and the orchard rides the new current. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image reweights prior material—clouds calming, her palm on the vibrating bark, the whispered principle—with visible cost (the physical exertion, "breathing hard, the mallet trembling") and undeniable pressure earned by the wave sequence. Orientation anchors early (orchard, Maren, blue hour). One meaningful tightening (the wave's arrival and her decisive strike) narrows options and the outcome alters the orchard's trajectory, fulfilling causal escalation for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating orchard is not postcard but functional constraint: driftwood logs, root-cables, and hollow branches are struck to diagnose rot and reef-pull, directly shaping Maren's tactics. The blue hour recurs as temporal anchor; "slick driftwood logs," "mat of tangled roots," and "root-cable" details ground spatial choreography. The standing wave's tilt and the trees' groan translate environment into tactile pressure. The final detail—bark vibrating under her palm—charges the closure image with the orchard's living response, satisfying the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice and charges the final image).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—survive the convergence wave and reach warmer waters—is signaled early through fractal clouds. Maren's agency drives escalation: she moves through the orchard, layers counter-rhythm, and strikes the central root-cable "with everything she had," narrowing options to a single decisive act. The cost is legible on the page: physical exertion ("breathing hard, the mallet trembling") and the risk of the driftwood shattering. The wave's passage and the new current constitute a meaningful tightening that forecloses the prior drift, meeting the causal-lens standard for this length. No forced reversals; coincidence (the wave's arrival) complicates but her action resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the orchard-as-obstacle repurposed, the mallet carved from lightning-split wood, the dubbing practice that overwrites threat. The mantra "every obstacle could be turned into an instrument" is not thesis-stated but demonstrated across beats (landslide grove becomes raft, threat becomes lift). The final whispered line reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to the central question. Subtext operates in the "salt and sweetness" fruit, the "euphony that contained its own dissonance," and the trees' continued hum—imagery that charges meaning without explanation. No late symbolic convenience; all motifs (mallet, clouds, root-cable) recur with escalating function.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (cloud "calligraphy," resonance traveling through body, "sketched architectures in space"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "leeward tide prophet," "dubbing the obstacle," "fractal generating," "restless euphony"—all idiomatic to Maren's practice without register drift. No head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure: short, urgent clauses during the wave ("She felt it first as a silence, the water holding its breath. Then the raft tilted...") expand to lyric rhythm in the denouement. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress. No dialogue to judge. Minor friction: a few filter phrases ("she felt," "she knew") could be trimmed for immediacy, but they remain voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: clipped urgency during the wave contrasts with the opening's lyric flow. Information density is high—most lines serve character, action, and world simultaneously (e.g., "root-cables sang high and anxious" diagnoses and characterizes in one image). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled: "slow calligraphy of cloud movements," "invisible architectures," "euphony that contained its own dissonance"—all coherent and purposeful. Minor friction: "fractal generating" and "dubbing the obstacle" lean toward jargon without full dramatization of their mechanics, and "restless euphony" borders on ornamental in peak beats. The final image is clean and propulsive. Proofreading is solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—floating orchard + sound-based navigation + cloud-reading prophecy—feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding generic "magical realism" templates. The mallet's origin (lightning-split branch) and the orchard's birth (landslide) transform potential clichés into earned particulars. The "dubbing" practice and "sketched resonance" terminology risk preciousness but remain grounded in physical action (striking logs, feeling vibration). The emotional truth—competence earned through adversity, the embodied knowledge of survival—avoids template arcs. Risk-taking in the accumulative texture and non-confrontational climax heightens stakes without gimmickry. Minor deduction: the premise echoes familiar "lone survivor/mystic on raft" and "sound magic" beats; transformation is strong but not fully original at the conceptual level.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as tide prophet is seeded early (reads clouds, interprets drift), drives the middle beat (recognizes fractal convergence pattern), and shapes closure (her strike on the root-cable answers the wave). Her decision to "dub the obstacle" with counter-rhythm is the key tactical choice that narrows options. Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost is embodied (physical exertion). High irreplaceability: remove the prophet trait and the plot collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mallet appears early (carved from lightning-split branch), is used across multiple beats (striking logs, hollow knot, central root-cable), and charges the closure image (trembling in her grip, then tucked into belt). Its origin story ties to the "obstacle into instrument" theme. The final act—striking the root-cable "with everything she had"—depends on the mallet's presence. Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal pressure high; cost connection clear. Strong specificity (carved from oldest tree after lightning). Nears indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Sketched resonance" is defined early (sound drawing "invisible architectures in space") and operationalized in the middle (diagnosing rot, reef-pull via tone quality) and at closure (the "enormous" note that holds the driftwood and finds the new current). The concept shapes tactics directly: Maren's choice to layer counter-rhythm depends on understanding resonance. Present in all three gates; causal pressure moderate to high; closure linkage strong. Minor deduction: the term itself leans jargon-adjacent and the exact mechanics remain somewhat abstracted despite vivid description.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Cloud interpretation is seeded in the opening (reads "slow calligraphy," sees "intention"), constrains the middle beat (recognizes fractal pattern and its meaning: convergence), and enables the ending (clouds calm, signal westward drift). The trait is not label-only: Maren acts on her reading, choosing to dub the obstacle because the clouds promise a new current "exactly where the fractal clouds had promised it would be." Setup, development, payoff all present. Causal pressure high; cost connection implicit (if she misreads, the orchard shatters). High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Dubbing the obstacle" is defined early (layering tone to overwrite threat) and executed in the climax (rapid sequences on starboard/port, striking the central root-cable). This action is the protagonist's primary tactical response to the standing wave. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is implicit (the dubbing begins before the wave arrives). Causal pressure moderate: the dubbing enables survival but the exact mechanism remains somewhat opaque. Not easily swappable; the term and practice are story-specific. Cost connection present (exertion, risk of failure).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Fractal generating" is defined in the middle (clouds splitting into self-similar spirals) and its meaning—convergence—drives Maren's tactical choice to dub and her expectation of the new current. The method is signaled but appears only once as a cloud phenomenon rather than a repeatable practice. Setup minimal (clouds are watched but not yet fractal); development strong (recognizes pattern, acts on it); payoff indirect (clouds calm post-wave). Moderate causal pressure; the fractal reading shapes the attempt. Specificity high but involvement limited to one beat. Swappable with another rare cloud sign.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The orchard raft is anchored in the opening, supplies the entire tactical arena (logs, root-cables, hollow branches as instruments), and appears in the closure image (trees dripping, bark vibrating, root-cable humming). Setting directly constrains Maren's choices: she must diagnose and respond to the driftwood's integrity and the wave's threat using the orchard's own structure. Present across all three gates with high causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability. The setting is not postcard but functional constraint and resource. Near-indispensable: remove the raft and the story has no stage or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "blue hour" is named in the opening and recurs in the final third ("blue stillness"). It establishes mood and signals Maren's practice window ("each evening at the blue hour"), anchoring the timeframe. However, it does not tighten decisions with a live clock—Maren is not racing sunset, and the wave's arrival is signaled by clouds rather than time pressure. Setup present; development minimal (timeframe is stable, not escalating); payoff present as atmosphere. Moderate specificity; moderate causal role. Lyric reprise reweights mood but not stakes. Mid-band: functional but not essential to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn obstacles into instruments" is seeded early (the orchard's origin, the mallet's carving), drives the middle beat (dubbing as overwriting threat), and charges the closure (whispered mantra, palm on vibrating bark). Desire is dramatized through on-page choices rather than told-only. Friction between want (survive, adapt) and cost (exertion, risk) is legible. Present across all three gates; high causal pressure; closure linkage strong. The final whisper reweights the entire arc. High irreplaceability: this motivation defines Maren's method and the story's thematic spine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Restless euphony" is embodied in the prose rhythm (lyric flow punctuated by urgency), the described note ("low and bright and restless, a euphony that contained its own dissonance"), and the final lingering hum. Tone modulates with pressure: contemplative in the opening, urgent during the wave, settling into charged stillness at closure. Coherent through turns without static mood. The tonal register supports the concept (sound, resonance) and charges the final image (trees "still singing"). Present across beats; moderate to high causal shaping of emotional arc. Specificity high; tone is not generic but tied to the story's sonic texture.</comment>
