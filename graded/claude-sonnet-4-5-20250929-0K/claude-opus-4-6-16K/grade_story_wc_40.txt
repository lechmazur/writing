<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is specific and embodied—"noticing was the only thing she had ever been good at"—and her decision to testify grows organically from months of solitary work. The internal contradiction between her reticence and the impulse to speak is lived in the practice scene and the final walk. Minor deduction: the "weathered innocence" framing in the reflection feels slightly over-articulated for peak pressure, though it remains character-particular. The final choice forecloses her scholar-in-shadow stance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara walks into the world carrying her crystal, options crystallized, cost undeniable—she has renounced silence and accepted imperfection as proof. The accumulative lens (pattern of decay → composting language) holds throughout and the final door-close chord charges the ending without forcing a dramatic reversal. Orientation anchors (library, dawn, Elara) arrive early. One meaningful deepening—language is composting, not dying—narrows her options and drives the walk toward testimony.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn, the shattered chandelier, the reading tables with motionless dust motes—all constrain Elara's work and filter through her scholar's attention. The crystal (micro-setting object) shapes her discovery method and charges the final image as she carries it out. Sensory selection is purposeful: gray light, held-in hush, dust listening. The "mausoleum" shelves and settling building anchor decay without catalog-touring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decode and prove language's transformation—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when she realizes "no one would believe a scholar who never spoke." The decision to testify forecloses her reticent stance with felt cost: she must speak imperfectly before an audience. Agency is renunciation of silence, visible in the practiced voice that "cracked and wandered" and the final walk. One meaningful tightening (she must testify) drives the ending under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—language alive in fracture, green pushing through ruin—emerges from the crystal's refracting mechanics, the composting metaphor, and Elara's realization without stated moral. The final image (door closing into chord, dawn widening, carrying broken light) offers a resonant non-literal answer: brokenness as proof of life. "Weathered innocence" as trust worn transparent integrates specificity with the thematic question. Subtext operates in the empty-library practice and the forward echo she alone hears.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is scholar-particular: Elara notices "fractured sequences," "phonemic material," "spectrograms." Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction stays within her lexicon except one phrase—"weathered innocence...worn thin enough to become transparent"—which borders on elevated abstraction but remains anchored to her long study. Rhythm modulates: longer accumulative sentences in reflection, shorter beats in the walk. No dialogue to judge. Minor slip: "testify" meta-commentary feels slightly expository in the pivot paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances understanding or image (the chandelier's sonic property, the pattern emerging, the practice). Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes. Two minor slips lower from 8.5: "as old buildings do when no one tends them anymore" is slight scaffold, and "the kind of trust in the world that survives disappointment not by hardening but by wearing thin" risks abstraction in a high-pressure pivot. No loops or filter-verb stacks. The final-paragraph propulsion—door, chord, dawn, walk—is clean and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—language as compost decoded via sonic refraction—feels specific and non-obvious. The reticent scholar with a chandelier crystal is fresh; the "forward echo" inflection and the testimony frame grow inevitably from her predicament. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, the crystal's unusual property) heightens without obscuring. Mild deduction: the "last dictionary" inciting scenario borders on familiar post-apocalyptic template, though the composting transformation rescues it from cliché.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Reticent scholar is signaled early ("the only thing she had ever been good at...quietly"), drives the middle conflict ("no one would believe a scholar who never spoke"), and her choice to walk out and testify creates the closure turn with visible cost (renouncing silence). Present in setup, development, and payoff; decisions alter tactics twice (decode alone, then practice and go public). Causal pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystal appears in paragraph three (setup), is used in four distinct beats (whisper "innocent," months of prior observation noted, practice scene where it "caught each attempt," final walk carrying it), and charges the closure image ("small, bright, broken piece of light" and the door-close chord it holds). Irreplaceable: its sonic refraction property enables her discovery method and embodies the fractured-proof thesis. Cost tied to it: she must trust imperfection it reveals.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Suspended hush is named explicitly ("a suspended hush filled the library") and described through dust motes motionless, the pause "between last page of one story and first of another." It frames the ending's "both an ending and a beginning" and the "world waiting to exhale." Present in setup and closure; shapes tone more than tactics. Mid-band: it charges atmosphere and closure resonance but does not constrain a choice with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sonically reflective property is introduced paragraph three, mechanics explained (refracts sound into layered echoes, harmonic fragments), and used in two beats: whisper "innocent" to decode, practice session where fractured sequences prove her thesis. The trait enables her discovery and testimony tactic—imperfection as proof. Cost connection: she must accept broken speech. Setup, development, payoff all present; causal pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Testify is named mid-story as the turn ("She would have to testify"), drives the practice beat and walk-out closure. The action redefines her reticent stance and forecloses silence with cost. Present in middle and ending; causal role clear. Not swappable—"speak at a conference" would lack the oath/audience weight "testify" carries. Score held from 8+ because the mechanics of testimony (courtroom, panel, symposium?) remain abstract; we see preparation but not execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Through fractured sequences is signaled paragraph three ("splitting a single spoken word into layered echoes"), used as her decoding method across months, and reprised in the practice scene where "the crystal caught each attempt and scattered it into those beautiful fractured sequences." The method enables her discovery (forward echo, composting pattern) and her testimony tactic (brokenness as proof). Setup, development, and payoff clear; causal pressure solid.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Shadowed library at dawn is anchored paragraph two, supplies the crystal (from shattered chandelier), the notebook, the shelves as audience for practice, and frames the world outside as "waking into a morning where people had fewer words." The door-close at ending charges the transition. Setup and closure strong; middle development weaker—library functions more as backdrop than constraint. Micro-setting (crystal, reading tables) does more tactical work than the room itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>After the last dictionary is printed timeframe is named opening line ("Tuesday...by Wednesday"), establishes the decay premise, and sets Elara's "months of similar observations." Present at setup; closure references "fewer words than the day before." Mid-band: time pressure is conceptual (ongoing decay) rather than a live ticking clock that alters her tactics beat-to-beat. No urgent deadline forces the testimony decision; her realization does.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>To decode the pattern of growth is stated paragraph four, shown through her crystal work across months, and drives her testimony decision—she has decoded composting and must now prove it. Friction visible: she lacks confidence ("no one would believe") and must overcome reticence. The desire shapes the middle discovery beat and the closure choice. Setup, development, payoff all present; cost (public speech vs. private study) legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Weathered innocence is named explicitly in the testimony-decision paragraph ("a conviction that felt less like knowledge and more like weathered innocence") and defined through the trust-worn-transparent image. Tone modulates from quiet observation through self-doubt to resolve; the final image of walking into dawn with "small, bright, broken piece of light" embodies it. Present at setup (quiet noticing), middle (practice uncertainty), and charges closure. Coherent across turns.</comment>
