<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is concrete and her trait "calmly inventive" drives visible actions (solvent sabotage, cipher design). Her final micro-choice—pressing the quill holder into Declan's hands—reflects her hierarchy of values. Internal contradiction is present but muted: the piece shows competence more than genuine struggle, and the phrase "private cradle where she kept her own small fire banked and waiting" leans slightly diagnostic. The cost of her choices is legible but not deeply embodied under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Maren, Fort Solenne, autumn evening, blackout). The drive lens reads Causal with strong because/therefore linkage: solvent → blackout → cipher retrieval → cell openings → river escape. Closure is a Decisive Change (fourteen prisoners freed, Maren back at post, revolution begun) with felt cost visible in her controlled suppression of the smile and the irreversible breach. One meaningful tightening (blackout narrows the window) suffices at this length and the lens holds cleanly to the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The phosphorite channels and sundial are vivid, purpose-driven anchors. The blackout constrains Maren's window and the sundial's geometry encodes the escape plan, charging both the middle and the closure. Spatial choreography (courtyard, corridors, river gate) tracks cleanly. Sensory selection is efficient—"pale gold light," "darkness instead"—and filtered through Maren's professional priorities. The fort's luminous boast ("nothing hides here") subtly mirrors the thematic inversion when darkness enables secrecy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing fourteen prisoners to ignite revolution—is signaled early and tightens through the blackout window. Maren's agency (three months of solvent sabotage, cipher design, nightly lock tests) drives escalation causally. The final cost is legible: irreversible action, professional mask maintained, personal fire ignited. One credible loss shapes tactics: the blackout compresses her timeline and forces reliance on the pre-coded sundial. The resolution is earned by prior preparation, though coincidence (the blackout timing) sets the stage rather than resolving the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: locks as control, light as surveillance, darkness as liberation, the sundial's false function hiding true purpose. The "Cradle of Sparks" metaphor reweights across the arc—first abstract, then literal as the prison becomes the incubator. Maren's final suppression of the smile and the banked fire image offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how does silent resistance catch?) without moralizing. Subtext operates cleanly in the quill holder exchange ("not just a quill holder") and the coded sundial geometry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maren; psychic distance is consistent and controlled. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "turning a key between her fingers the way other people turned thoughts," professional attention to locks and channels. Diction remains within Maren's register except for one slip: "Calmly inventive—that was how her late mother had described her, half-proud, half-warning" reads slightly expository. Dialogue is minimal, purposeful ("You'll need this where you're going..."), and carries subtext. Syntax and rhythm modulate appropriately with pressure, tightening during the cell-opening sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally and propulsion is clean through the blackout and escape sequence. The phrase "the private cradle where she kept her own small fire banked and waiting" stacks metaphors slightly ("cradle," "fire," "banked") in a way that dilutes rather than sharpens, applying −0.3. One paraphrase loop: "A mystery" after "bewildered as anyone" restates without added pressure, −0.2. Otherwise no scaffold, loops, or filter-verb stacks; figurative language is controlled and grammar is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of lock sentinel + coded sundial + phosphorite sabotage + silent revolution feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation is earned: the sundial's "hour lines...at angles that did not correspond to any latitude on earth" is a fresh, grounded cipher device. The blackout-as-revolution-trigger avoids template plotting. Risk-taking is present in the nested meanings ("Everything tonight was a wink and a hush, a meaning nested inside a meaning") without obscuring clarity, +0.3 within band. The premise does not closely match widely used templates and the lived detail (key ring, drainage grate solvent, artisan dismissal) transforms familiar resistance tropes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's vigilance frames expectation early (key ring, nightly tests) +0.6; her choices create two key turns: retrieving the cipher list and freeing the fourteen prisoners +0.9; her agency drives causal pressure (solvent sabotage, coded sundial design) +1.2; she is present in the closure beat (back at post, suppressing smile, "spark caught and held") +1.4. Swappability is low; the "Lock Sentinel" role is irreplaceable for the lock/freedom thematic core +0.6. Cost is visible: professional mask, irreversible breach +0.4. Base 3.0 + 5.1 = 8.1, round down 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder appears in two beats: retrieval at the sundial base (middle) and handoff to Declan (closure) +0.9. Its nested meaning ("not just a quill holder") ties to the theme of hidden purpose +0.5. It enables the final prisoner's future action ("people across the river who are very tired of silence") +0.6. Setup is present by the middle third (no early signal penalty, but no bonus). Closure linkage is direct +1.0. Swappability is moderate; any concealable object with symbolic weight could serve, −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5, adjusted +0.7 for thematic charge = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "Cradle of Sparks" concept is signaled midway ("That was the term the movement used") and shapes the dominant stake: transforming the prison into an incubator for revolution +1.0. It reweights at closure ("the silent revolution breathed its first breath") +1.2. Causal pressure is present: the blackout and escape are tactics to realize the Cradle +0.8. Setup arrives late (middle third), −0.3. The concept is more thematic frame than on-page constraint; it names the goal but does not alter specific tactics within scenes, limiting band entry. Base 3.0 + 2.7 = 5.7, round up 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is signaled early via Maren's mother's assessment +0.5 and demonstrated in two on-page actions: pouring solvent over three months and designing the sundial cipher +0.9. The trait constrains her approach (patience, indirection) and enables the blackout tactic +1.0. Cost is visible: the slow, cumulative method requires sustained deception +0.4. The trait shapes her suppression of the smile at closure (calm control) +0.8. Swappability is low; the trait is woven into her method +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1, but trait is partially told rather than fully embodied under peak pressure, −0.7 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Intrigue" is present throughout: solvent sabotage (setup), sundial cipher coordination (middle), prisoner release sequence (closure) +1.4. It drives three distinct beats +1.4 and is causally central to escalation +1.3. The method is specific (coded sundial, bronze quill holder, river gate) and irreplaceable; swapping "intrigue" for direct action would break the story's logic +0.7. Closure participation is direct +1.3. Cost is tied to the irreversible breach +0.5. Base 3.0 + 6.6 = 9.6, but the action itself is conventional (prison break via inside help), −2.0 for replaceability at the action-type level = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sundial cipher is signaled early ("half-painted sundial...an ornamental project") +0.6, its mechanics explained in the middle beat ("hour lines...at angles that did not correspond to any latitude...a cipher Maren had designed") +0.9, and it enables the coordinated escape ("they had read the sundial. They knew.") +1.2. The method constrains Maren's tactics: she cannot pass written notes, forcing reliance on the geometric code +1.0. Irreplaceability is high; the sundial's dual function (ornament/cipher) is specific +0.7. Closure linkage is indirect (enables the escape but not present in final image), +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.9 = 7.9, but setup detail slightly expository, −0.7 = 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The luminous fort is signaled in paragraph two +0.6 and its phosphorite channels enable Maren's sabotage tactic (solvent attack) +1.2. The blackout created by their failure drives the entire escape window +1.6. The fort's architecture ("walls...that drank the sun...exhaled it back as pale gold light") constrains both surveillance and Maren's counter-tactic +1.0. The setting charges the closure: darkness replaces the boast "nothing hides here," enabling the revolution +1.4. Irreplaceability is high; the luminous-fort premise is load-bearing +0.8. Base 3.0 + 6.6 = 9.6, but the glow mechanism is slightly explained rather than discovered through action, −1.6 = 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The blackout is signaled at the inciting incident ("twilight settled...the phosphorescence simply did not come") +0.7 and tightens the escape window causally +1.3. It drives two beats: officers' scramble (middle complication) and Maren's covert moves (climax) +0.9. Time pressure is live: lanterns are fetched, narrowing her window, and she completes fourteen releases "in the next quarter hour" +1.0. The blackout shapes the closure by making the breach possible +1.2. Cost is tied to the compressed timeline +0.4. Irreplaceability is high +0.7. Base 3.0 + 6.2 = 9.2, but the blackout is engineered rather than situational, reducing urgency slightly, −1.3 = 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The revolutionary motivation is signaled early (Maren's patient sabotage, "waiting for this blackout for three months") +0.6 and dramatized through her choices: retrieving the list, freeing prisoners, pressing the quill holder into Declan's hands +1.2. Friction is present between her calm exterior and the "small fire banked and waiting," creating visible cost (suppression of the smile) +0.8. The motivation drives escalation causally +1.0 and charges the closure ("the silent revolution breathed its first breath") +1.2. Swappability is low; the specific goal reshapes the prison-break trope +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.4 = 8.4, but the motivation is more told than tested by on-page dilemma, −1.1 = 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "winking hush" tone is present in early diction ("conspiratorial clicks," "Everything tonight was a wink and a hush, a meaning nested inside a meaning") +0.6 and modulates across beats: calm surveillance, covert cipher retrieval, whispered instructions, suppressed smile +0.9. The tone coheres through turns and charges the final image (the banked spark catching without a visible smile) +1.0. Rhythm supports the tone via controlled pacing and ironic contrast (Maren "bewildered as anyone" while guilty) +0.7. The tone is consistent and purposeful but not strictly indispensable; a more overt resistance tone could work with minor edits, −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.7 = 5.7, adjusted +1.2 for tonal control at closure = 6.9.</comment>
