<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivations are clear and embodied through the pocket rosette and her "expectantly resigned" stance, which constrains her teaching method to subtraction rather than force. The students' inherited grudges create credible internal pressure, and the release of these grudges is dramatized through vocal dissonance rather than stated epiphany. The final choice to begin again with the rosette on the table reflects earned endurance. Minor slip: the students' individual voices blur slightly—Katrice, Davor, and Elena are defined more by ancestry than by distinct perceptual signatures or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through six weeks of rehearsal compressed into one session, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Maren sets the rosette down and they "begin again." Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure lands with felt cost—the vanishing art passes through living throats "on their way out of the world"—and the rosette's placement charges the final image. One tightening is legible: the students' release of dissonance narrows the harmony, and the decision to continue despite inevitable loss forecloses the path of preservation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The velvet library is purposefully textured—drapes muffling sound, amber light through pressed leaves—and the environment directly enables Maren's method of subtraction by creating "velvet stillness" that exposes dissonance. The rosette functions as micro-setting, constraining her pedagogy and charging the final image when she places it on the table. Spatial choreography is clear: students in a crescent, Maren at center, the table where she transcribed and now sets the rosette. The autumn timeframe and decaying world anchor the stakes of vanishing traditions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—braiding hostile voices into harmony before the tradition vanishes—is signaled early and tightens when dissonance becomes audible to the students themselves, forcing them to release inherited grudges. Agency is distributed across the ensemble's choices to "let go," and Maren's decision to continue teaching despite futility. The resolution is earned through the six-week arc of unlearning, and the cost is explicit: the art will vanish regardless. The final "begin again" crystallizes the stance of endurance. Escalation is modest but sufficient under the Accumulative lens: the chord resolves, the rosette is placed, and the reopening reweights prior effort.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the rosette motif, the subtraction method, and the vanishing-arts premise without direct statement. The final image—"the carved and patient opening, through which something nearly lost could still, for now, emerge"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how fragile traditions survive. The piece resists tidy resolution: the arts will vanish, but living voices carry them briefly. Subtext operates in Maren's silence after the chord, the students' look at the rosette, and the braided melodies whose composer no longer exists. The only minor friction is the slightly didactic framing of "That is where the sound comes out… From the hollow space inside," which edges toward stated theme but remains grounded in the object.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren with clean distance and a distinct perceptual signature: she notices "the way a tongue finds the gap where a tooth once lived" and hears "what the grudges actually sounded like when they sang." Prose rhythm modulates with emotional beats—short imperative "Again. But less." versus the longer, reflective final paragraph. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful, carrying subtext in Maren's directive and her metaphor about the soundhole. Minor slip: the phrase "traveled stillness she had earned over decades" edges into abstract elevation, and "stained glass" in the opening metaphor feels slightly borrowed rather than character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., the rosette description anchors history, motive, and symbol in one beat). Figurative language is controlled—"autumn held the way a cupped hand holds water"—and mostly avoids density overload. Two frictions: "traveled stillness" in the opening and "the way light moves through stained glass before it reaches the floor" in paragraph three both repeat the light/passage metaphor within close proximity, creating mild conceptual redundancy. The final paragraph's parallelism ("the carved and patient opening") charges the closure cleanly without loop or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of subtraction pedagogy, the soundhole rosette as teaching tool, and the historical weight of vanishing folk traditions creates a specific synthesis. The premise of teaching through removal rather than addition offers a fresh angle on reconciliation narratives. Risk: the piece commits to a quiet, accretive structure and earns its closure through image rather than confrontation. Minor limitation: the velvet-library-in-autumn setting and the "old teacher passes on dying art" frame are familiar, though the rosette and the method of subtraction personalize them. The final image feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout, and her choice to place the rosette on the table and restart the session drives the closure. Her method—"by subtracting noise"—shapes every beat. Her expectant resignation constrains her to transmission rather than preservation, informing both her pedagogy and the final decision to continue. She appears in setup, middle instruction, and closure gesture.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rosette is handled in the opening (touched in her pocket), explained mid-scene (its history and symbolic function), and physically placed on the table at closure, reweighting the entire teaching moment. Its specific carved aperture anchors the story's method and final image. Removing it would erase the closure's visual and thematic charge. The object is irreplaceable and causally active across three distinct beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Vanishing arts shapes stakes from the opening assertion that Maren's purpose is "to let them move through her students' voices on their way out of the world." The six-week timeframe is framed as a measure of "unlearning hatred" before the tradition vanishes. The closure's "for now" and "nearly lost" directly reweight the concept with cost. The concept drives both the emotional arc and Maren's pedagogical choices, appearing in setup, middle reflection, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is dramatized through Maren's habit of touching the rosette "the way a tongue finds the gap where a tooth once lived" and her acceptance that her purpose is transmission, not preservation. This trait constrains her method: she never demands release of grudges but creates conditions for hearing dissonance. The final decision to begin again embodies the resignation with visible cost—continuation despite futility. Present in setup and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Denote" is explained via the rosette's function ("to denote where music emerged from silence") and dramatized when Maren places it on the table, stating "That is where the sound comes out." The action of marking the aperture shapes the final teaching moment. However, the verb "denote" itself is not physically enacted in a way that alters tactics mid-scene; its function is more thematic than causal. Present in middle exposition and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The method "by subtracting noise" is signaled in the opening directive "But less," explained in paragraph four ("by subtracting noise, she found the music underneath"), and operationalized through the students' release of jaw tension, competitive edge, and throat-guarding. The final chord resolution proves the method's success. The mechanics matter: the method creates the conditions for harmony and drives the central conflict. Present in setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet library's sound-muffling properties enable Maren's subtraction method by creating stillness that exposes dissonance. Autumn light and pressed leaves anchor the timeframe and tone. The library table is the site of transcription and the rosette's final placement. The setting constrains pedagogy and charges the closure image. Present in setup, middle description, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "across unlearning hatred" is explicitly defined as having "no fixed duration, only a direction," and the six-week rehearsal compresses into the single session. The autumn season tracks decay and impending loss. Time pressure is legible: the arts are vanishing, and this session may be one of the last. The final "for now" underscores temporal constraint. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to braid diverse voices is dramatized through her directive "But less," her method of clearing false noise, and the students' on-page choices to release grudges when they hear dissonance. The motivation is tested by the inherited hatred and the futility of preservation, creating friction between the desire for harmony and the cost of its impermanence. The final decision to begin again embodies the motivation with visible cost. Present in setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" is introduced in the opening ("the library held autumn the way a cupped hand holds water"), operationalized through Maren's decades of listening in "many ruined towns," and charged in the closure phrase "traveled stillness she had earned." The tone modulates with pressure: directive brevity ("Again. But less."), reflective expansion in the rosette history, and quiet intensity in the final paragraph. The tone shapes the final image's resonance and remains coherent throughout. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure.</comment>
