<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and embodied—the unmedicated return brings "raw edges" she needs for reckoning. Internal conflict operates through contradictory impulses: the need for control (three years of methodical mapping) versus the need to face what she's avoided (Callum's drowning). The final choice to write the honest sentence and integrate it into the chronicle is earned by prior causality, though the turn from numbed chronicler to truth-teller could show more micro-resistance on the page. Embodied emotion is strong ("trembling," the physical squeeze of the bellows), but the bathroom-wall epiphany about the creek's indifference edges toward articulated insight rather than discovery through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren writes the truth sentence and accepts ongoing presence with the wound, forecloses the false-mercy path, with visible cost (three years of evasion now documented). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered mapping imagery, red-ink confessions, the bathroom graffiti revisit, and the bellows motif, culminating in a cadence shift at the final entry. Orientation anchors cleanly (Greyhollow Station, six days post-medication, alone). The lens holds without contradiction, and one meaningful deepening (from cartographic control to embodied confession) suffices at this length. Cost is legible: the sentence "sat on the page like a stone in moving water" makes the ongoing weight undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The overgrown station, ivy-consumed platform, bathroom graffiti, and the bellows all constrain or charge moments. The ivy's "unbearable" green reflects unmedicated sensory overload; the bathroom door "half-consumed by ivy" must be pushed through, making the return to her old words physical. The bellows ("patched with electrical tape") functions as micro-setting, its "flex and hold" action constraining her realization that repair differs from being undamaged. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("rust on the rails smelled like something alive"). The station's decay mirrors her internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reckoning with Callum's drowning to finish the chronicle) is signaled early and tightens once: the bathroom revisit forces her to see the inadequacy of her prior framing ("The creek didn't forgive anything. The creek simply moved"). That realization narrows options—false mercy is foreclosed—and the final act (writing the honest sentence) is protagonist-driven under the Accumulative lens. Visible cost: three years of evasion now on the record, integrated as "the central document." The turn is meaningful but singular; no second reversal, which is acceptable at this length. Pressure coheres throughout, and the cost is felt in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (the inadequacy of metaphorical forgiveness versus the ongoing work of truthful presence) emerges from the graffiti revisit, the bellows motif, and the final sentence without moralizing. The bathroom wall's false scripture is confronted on the page, and Maren's realization ("Forgiveness required a self that could hold both the wound and the healing") is earned through her three-year mapping evasion. The final image—truth as "a stone in moving water...slowly wearing smooth"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: repair is process, not absolution. Subtext operates in the bellows' "flex and hold" and the red-ink map notations. One hairline slip: "the reckoning beneath it" in paragraph two names the theme slightly too directly, though it's brief and doesn't recur.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization on Maren. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices "cartographic data" and sensory overload post-medication. Diction is controlled and character-specific ("daringly methodical precision," "indifferent, beautiful passage"). Free indirect style is clean ("She had been the one who turned away" carries both narratorial distance and interior accusation). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, pulling close during the bellows moment and the final writing beat. One minor slip: "as though indirection might make it true" in the bathroom paragraph edges toward over-articulated self-analysis, though it's brief and the surrounding voice holds. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (each line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes). The bellows sequence and final writing beat propel cleanly. Minor loop: "She had been the one watching him that day. She had been the one who turned away" is intentional parallelism but edges toward paraphrase; the repetition serves emphasis, so penalty is minimal. One register drift: "daringly methodical precision that her colleagues admired and her therapist called a coping mechanism" introduces clinical framing early, which POV can plausibly hold but tilts slightly elevated. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Clarity and concision are strong throughout, and the final line's image ("slowly wearing smooth") closes with apt rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise (unmedicated river chronicler confronts her evasion via mapping and graffiti wisdom) is specific and synthesis-driven rather than template-reliant. The bellows motif and the map-as-confession layering offer fresh angles on familiar grief-processing material. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality; Maren's realization that the creek "simply moved" rather than forgave resists tidy closure. The bathroom graffiti revisit and the accordion bellows are particular to this voice and situation. One friction: the "river chronicler" frame and the off-medication timing feel slightly assembled to meet prompt elements rather than organically inevitable, though they integrate well once in motion. The final image's metaphor (stone in moving water) is apt but not wholly unexpected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren (truth-seeking river chronicler) frames the setup and drives the ending: she returns unmedicated, revisits the graffiti, and writes the honest sentence. Her choice to integrate the confession into the chronicle as "the central document" alters tactics (three years of cartographic evasion now confronted). Two beats: the bathroom revisit and the final writing. Causal pressure is present but quiet; the role of "chronicler" is more thematic frame than engine. Closure participation is strong. Cap relaxed slightly for role-as-lens integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The accordion bellows appear twice: once early ("blow dust from her survey instruments") and again mid-scene ("squeezed them absently, watching the tape flex and hold"). The second use shifts meaning—"Something patched could still function"—and charges her realization that repair differs from being undamaged. The bellows constrain the thought by embodying it physically. Closure linkage is indirect (the final sentence about wearing smooth echoes the flex-and-hold logic). Two beats, causal pressure via embodied metaphor, and modest cost connection. Strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Map references shape stakes and tactics throughout: the hand-drawn maps with "elevation markers, flow-rate annotations, cross-hatched zones" establish her control method; the red-ink confessions ("dates, initials, fragments") reveal the personal beneath the cartographic; "here" marks Callum's drowning site. The final act (writing Callum's entry as "the central document") reweights the maps from evasion tool to truth vehicle. Three beats (counter setup, red-ink reveal, final integration), strong causal pressure, and closure linkage. The concept is the spine of the piece.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Daringly methodical" is named once ("daringly methodical precision that her colleagues admired") and echoed in the final writing beat ("daringly methodical, refusing to look away from any coordinate"). The trait enables her to map the drowning moment with precision, constraining her to face every detail rather than abstract. One visible beat (the final entry), modest causal pressure, and closure participation. The trait is present but not leveraged across multiple turns; more a descriptor than a driver. Mid-band for single-beat constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Allude" appears once: Maren "had tried to allude to grace without naming it directly" regarding the bathroom graffiti. The action characterizes her prior evasion and sets up the bathroom revisit turn, but it is retrospective exposition rather than a dramatized present-tense act. The setup is functional but the action itself is summary-only and swappable (she could have "hinted," "implied," etc.). One beat involvement (bathroom frame), no direct causal pressure or closure linkage. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bathroom graffiti ("THE CREEK FORGIVES THE STONE THAT FALLS INTO IT") is signaled early and returns mid-scene. Maren physically pushes through ivy to reach it, reads it "unmedicated and trembling," and realizes its inadequacy—the turn that narrows her options from false mercy to ongoing truth-work. The method (graffiti wisdom) shapes the key turn and charges the final image (truth as stone in water). Two beats (setup mention, revisit), strong causal pressure, closure linkage via metaphor echo. The graffiti could be another medium (journal entry, letter) with minor edits, capping slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Greyhollow Station (disused railway station overgrown with ivy) anchors the entire piece. The ivy's sensory overload ("unbearable in its vividness") reflects Maren's unmedicated state; the platform edge where she sits provides the physical space for the final writing; the bathroom door "half-consumed by ivy" must be pushed through, adding physical resistance to the emotional turn. Three beats (arrival, bathroom access, platform writing), strong causal and atmospheric pressure, and closure participation (the final act occurs on the platform). Setting is essential but not indispensable—the piece could function in another decayed space with modest revision.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Six days after stopping the medication" is named once and colors the sensory overload ("Colors carried weight again"). The timeframe explains why Maren can now feel the "raw edges" she needs, enabling the bathroom revisit and final confession. One beat (setup), modest causal pressure (unmedicated state is necessary for the turn), but no ticking clock or tactical constraint. The timeframe is functional but not tracked or leveraged across beats. Mid-band for enabling condition without escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The path to self-forgiveness is dramatized across the piece: Maren's three-year evasion via mapping, the bathroom graffiti's false mercy, the bellows' repair metaphor, and the final honest sentence that refuses absolution. The motivation drives the bathroom revisit (testing the old "scripture"), the bellows realization (patched ≠ undamaged), and the final writing choice (integration as "the central document"). Multiple beats, strong causal pressure, visible cost (evasion foreclosed), and closure linkage (the final sentence rejects false forgiveness for ongoing presence). The motivation is the engine. One friction: "to find a path" is slightly tell-forward in paragraph two, but the dramatization across beats is robust.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Raw solace" (not named but tonally present) threads the piece: "raw edges" she needs to finish, the "unbearable" vividness of green, the "trembling" bathroom revisit, and the final sentence that is "not absolution" but solid presence. Tone modulates with pressure—sensory overload at the start, confrontation at the graffiti, quiet resolve at the bellows, and somber clarity at the ending. The final image ("a stone in moving water...slowly wearing smooth") charges with both rawness (ongoing cost) and solace (eventual smoothing). Coherent through turns, no tonal breaks, and strong closure linkage. Very strong execution.</comment>
