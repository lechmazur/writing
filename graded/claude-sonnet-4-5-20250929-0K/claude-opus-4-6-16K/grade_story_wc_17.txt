<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's sensory perceptiveness is embodied throughout and drives her choices—her capacity to "feel the architecture thinking" motivates both her research and her decision to finish her grandmother's work. The discovery of the diaries forces a visible cost: she inherits both the scientific pursuit and the family's fear of consumption by that legacy. Internal contradiction appears when she acknowledges the protective silence yet chooses to amplify the signal anyway. Minor slip: the final beat's declaration "I'm finishing it" risks sounding overly articulate under emotional pressure, though the embodied palm-against-stone grounds it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: Maren's voiced commitment to publish Elise's work crystallizes her stance and reconfigures the family silence into active signal, with the conceptual cost of accepting the inheritance made undeniable in "carry the burden not as weight but as signal." The piece operates under a hybrid lens—causal discovery of the diaries narrows options, accumulative resonance patterns build pressure—and the ending holds both. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who: Maren, where: Harwick Hall passages, when: post-climate-shift present). One meaningful tightening occurs when the film negative reveals her grandmother stood in the same corridor with the same expression, collapsing past and present into inherited necessity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and bricked-up fireplace constrain Maren's discovery; she must reach into the chimney throat to retrieve the diaries, a tactile moment that charges the inheritance. The post-climate coastal campus—fog, creeping green, buckled floors—establishes the world's abandonment and justifies her solitary research role without exposition. The film negative held up to her headlamp is a micro-setting move that enables the visual revelation. The passage itself becomes the stage for the final speech act, its acoustics literalizing the theme of walls-as-memory and making her voice a physical addition to the archive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—validating her sensitivity as gift rather than curse—is signaled early and tightens when she discovers Elise's parallel work was discredited. The fireplace discovery reverses her understanding: she's not alone, but inheriting a suppressed lineage. The choice to publish alongside her own work forecloses the family's protective silence with visible cost: "watching it consume another generation." Agency is clear—Maren's decision to speak to the passage and commit on the page transforms solitary research into public reclamation. The coincidence of finding the diaries does not resolve the conflict; it redefines the stakes and forces her stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the spectrograph recordings, the half-burned diaries, the film negative, and the ivy-veiled passage all accumulate into the central question of whether sensitivity is pathology or inheritance worth amplifying. Elise's theory—"vibrations impressed into stone the way grooves are pressed into vinyl"—offers a non-literal answer grounded in acoustic physics rather than mysticism. The final image of Maren's voice joining "the collected whispers of everyone who had ever walked these stones" reweights the premise without stating a moral, and the answering echo charges the closure with ambiguity. No thematic statements intrude; the concept of walls-as-memory is dramatized through her research methods and the diaries' survival.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance; Maren's perceptual signature—acoustic sensitivity, pained focus—colors every observation. Diction remains consistent: "the ivy-veiled passage breathed back at her" and "she could feel the architecture thinking" reflect her phenomenology without floating into generic lyricism. The single line of dialogue ("I'm finishing it") serves as action and oath, not mere speech. Free indirect style is clean throughout. Minor slip: "Legacy's burden settled over her like the damp air itself" risks stating what the prior paragraph already dramatized, a brief expository cushion that doesn't obscure the moment but slightly softens its immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences do double work (e.g., "the climate shifts had driven most of the faculty inland" establishes both world state and Maren's isolation). Rhythm varies purposefully, slowing for the diary discovery and accelerating into the final speech. No paraphrase loops detected. One minor scaffold moment: "Legacy's burden settled over her" followed immediately by "She understood now why..." restates the realization in two adjacent beats. The final paragraph's syntax—"She would publish... She would carry..."—uses parallelism for deliberate rhetorical charge rather than template drift. Figurative language is purposeful and voice-consistent; no purple accumulation in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—acoustic archaeology combined with inherited scientific persecution—synthesizes familiar elements (academic ghost story, family secret, climate-abandoned campus) into a specific configuration. The image of "walls as vinyl grooves" offers a fresh angle on haunted-building material, and the film negative strip as both evidence and inheritance is particular. The choice to make sensitivity itself the contested inheritance rather than mere data elevates the emotional stakes beyond a simple vindication plot. Slight limitation: the campus-abandonment frame and the discredited-female-academic trope are well-worn, and while the acoustic focus distinguishes the execution, the core emotional arc (redeeming grandmother's work) follows a recognizable template without bold subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as corridor echo cartographer is introduced in the opening and motivates every beat: her acoustic mapping leads her to the fireplace, her understanding of resonance lets her interpret Elise's waveform annotations, and her final act is to speak into the passage as a researcher adding to the archive. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure speech. The occupation is causally essential—a historian or custodian could not perform the same interpretive work with the film negative or recognize the passage's acoustic significance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The film negative strip appears mid-story, tucked between diary pages, and Maren examines it under her headlamp to see the waveform printouts and the photograph of Elise in the same corridor. It provides the visual proof that collapses past and present, earning the realization "an expression Maren recognized as her own." It is carried into her breast pocket in the final beat but does not directly shape the closure action. Two beats (discovery and examination, then pocketing alongside the stylus), but no charged reprise that reweights the ending image. Functional and causal, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" is named explicitly and structures the entire arc: the family's protective silence, the discredited research, and Maren's choice to "carry the burden not as weight but as signal" all enact the concept on the page. It shapes her stakes (validate sensitivity vs. protect herself from consumption) and alters tactics (from solitary mapping to public restoration). The concept is not merely thematic decoration; it is the engine of the closure choice. Present in setup (family discouraged her studies), middle (discovery of Elise's persecution), and ending (decision to amplify across generations).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's sensitivity is introduced early as both "curse" and "gift" and demonstrates immediate on-page utility: she hears "what instruments only approximated" and recognizes the passage's difference ("something was different" today). It enables the acoustic research role and justifies her recognition of Elise's expression in the film negative. The trait carries a visible cost—"ordinary life overwhelming"—and the final choice to continue despite "watching it consume another generation" acknowledges the inherited risk. Present in setup, middle (interpretation of grandmother's work), and closure (commitment despite cost). The trait constrains and enables with felt trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Glimpse" structures the entire middle section: "Through half-burned diaries found in a fireplace, she began to glimpse a history she had never been told." The act of glimpsing (partial, incomplete knowledge) drives the accumulation of understanding across multiple beats—diaries, then film negative, then theory—and redefines her research from solitary to inherited. The action is irreplaceable; full revelation would collapse the discovery arc, and no glimpse would leave her without the key that unlocks legacy. Present in title position of the key turn, causally active, and shapes the closure decision to finish what Elise started.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries found in the fireplace are the method of discovery and appear at the structural hinge: Maren reaches into the crumbled chimney throat, retrieves the brittle pages, and the mechanics matter—edges "blackened to lace," enough survived to read, Elise had burned records "rather than let the administration seize them." The incomplete burning becomes the plot's enabler and thematic echo (knowledge preserved through destruction). The method is signaled early in the beat ("bricked-up fireplace... charred remains of paper") and its specific form (hidden in chimney, not fully consumed) is essential to causality. Swapping for an archive box or desk drawer would eliminate the dramatic irony of partial erasure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is introduced in the opening line and serves as the primary location for all action: Maren records Node 417 there, follows it to the fireplace terminus, discovers the diaries, examines the film negative, and delivers her final speech there. The passage's acoustics are the research object and the thematic vessel ("collected whispers"). It constrains access (she must follow it to the terminus) and charges the ending (her voice joins the archive). Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure. The ivy trembling in the final beat recurs with reweighted meaning, signaling response. Essential across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the climate shifts" establishes the world state (coastal campus abandoned, faculty driven inland, fog and subtropical storms) and justifies Maren's solitary funded role as corridor cartographer. It does not tighten decisions in real time—no live clock pressures her choices—but it creates the structural condition that enables the discovery (abandoned building, crumbling infrastructure exposes the fireplace). Present in setup and referenced in middle, absent from closure. Functional backdrop rather than active constraint; swappable with any post-disaster scenario that depopulates the campus.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover what walls dream about" is introduced early as Maren's deeper, stranger drive beyond official resonance mapping and is dramatized through her acoustic sensitivity and her choice to listen rather than merely record. The diaries reveal Elise held the same conviction ("the building's strange resonances were a form of communication"), collapsing the motivation into inherited mission. The final choice to finish the work and speak to the passage enacts the desire on the page with visible cost (accepting potential consumption). Friction appears between the want (validation, discovery) and the family's protective silence. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure action.</comment>
