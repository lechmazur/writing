<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's progression from instrumental need (rooftop access) to genuine desire (learning the building's language, then Sumerian) is cleanly motivated and embodied through micro-choices: returning with the empty cup, moving tea sessions to the rooftop, requesting language lessons during the meteor shower. Cassia's interiority remains somewhat opaque—her decision to teach and gift the seal arrives without visible internal conflict—but her "patiently nimble" gestures and sharp observation ("You don't want sugar") supply consistent characterization. The final stasis (continuing Tuesday lessons amid renovation) reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost: documentation becomes a "beautiful lie" rather than salvation, and both women accept preservation's limits. Minor gap: Cassia's motivations for opening her world are told more than shown, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers encounters (sugar → tea → rooftop → cuneiform lessons) in a rising-density arc that reweights Maren's professional documentation into a shared ritual of "listening" to dead languages. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the sugar cup "gathers dust," its lie "beloved," while the women continue their Tuesday sessions amid the developers' renovations—acceptance of preservation's insufficiency with felt cost (the building will be modernized; they persist in ritual, not rescue). Orientation anchors (apartment 4C, Maren as conservator, 1887 warehouse) land by ~180 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when Cassia moves lessons to the rooftop and begins teaching building-interrogation, then again when Sumerian enters, each intensifying the thematic stake. Cost is conceptual and emotional: Maren's professional mission becomes a "lie," yet she commits to it. The quiet ending makes the cost undeniable without melodrama.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The 1887 textile warehouse supplies concrete details (mason's marks, cast-iron columns, faded advertisements, salvaged chimney caps) that anchor Maren's professional stake and constrain her documentation work. The rooftop garden with terra-cotta pots and herb smells charges the meteor-shower scene and serves as the locus for lessons, making it more than backdrop. The brass desk seal (C.H.V. initials, "warm, as though held for a long time") functions as micro-setting/object hybrid, recurring to charge the handoff moment. Spatial choreography across apartment 4C and rooftop remains clear. However, the setting does not force a tactical choice or block a path during escalation; it enriches atmosphere and thematic resonance without constraining options, placing the score in the strong-but-not-indispensable band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Maren wants to understand (not merely document) the building's language before renovation erases it. The stake is signaled early and tightens when Cassia reframes it ("dead languages too"), then deepens when Maren requests Sumerian lessons, seeking truth beneath lies. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens: each session adds density (sugar → tea → rooftop pedagogy → cuneiform) and the developers' spring arrival supplies a deadline. The final image shows the women continuing lessons "among languages the living world had forgotten" while "walls were opened, columns wrapped in plastic"—a trade-off between rescue and ritual, with conceptual cost legible (documentation "felt insufficient" and becomes another "agreed upon lie"). Agency is present (Maren's requests drive escalation), but the developers remain abstract and no on-page confrontation tests her stance, preventing entry to the 8.0+ band where visible friction typically appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The theme—preservation as the "most beautiful of all agreed upon lies"—emerges organically from the sugar-cup subterfuge, Cassia's dead-language tutoring, and Maren's architectural work without overt thesis statements. The desk seal, handed over during the meteor shower with "It belongs to whoever listens," and the final image of the dusty sugar cup and ongoing lessons charge the ending with non-literal resonance: the women choose ritual and care over rescue, accepting that renovation will layer new fictions onto old stone. Sumerian's entrance ("I want to hear something that isn't lying" / "Everything lies, dear. Sumerian lied beautifully. That's why it lasted") reweights the premise without moralizing. The thematic question—what does it mean to preserve the dead?—receives a specific, embodied answer (continuing to speak and teach) rather than an abstract one. Minor constraint: the concept of "lies" is slightly over-articulated in dialogue, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV anchored to Maren remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a measured, slightly formal cadence that suits an architectural conservator's attention ("patiently nimble," "economy of small gestures," "collapsed vocabularies"). Dialogue feels purposeful and distinct: Cassia's compressed observations ("You'll come back" as statement, not question; "Every building lies") versus Maren's requests. Perceptual signature is consistent—Maren notices material details (brass warmth, chimney caps, mortar joints) in ways that reflect her training. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the meteor-shower intimacy, slightly wider during expository scaffolding). One small friction: some reflective lines ("the agreed upon lie had calcified into ritual") drift toward essayistic register, though they remain anchored in present observation. No major slips touch closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declarations like "It was not a question" alongside longer, layered descriptions). Information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., the housecoat "color of dried lavender" evokes both palette and age). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is controlled ("the sky cracked open in bright, silent streaks"; "a sound like a door opening in an old house") without overwriting. Minor scaffold appears in a few transitions ("After that," "The night of the meteor shower") that could be tightened, and one phrase—"the agreed upon lie had calcified into ritual"—leans slightly abstract. The meteor-shower paragraph's lyricism (phosphorescent green, "as though the building itself had opened its eyes") elevates without obscuring causality. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong; the small scaffold keeps the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of dead-language pedagogy and architectural conservation feels fresh and specific, avoiding generic mentor-student or preservation-vs.-progress templates. The sugar-cup ruse evolving into genuine apprenticeship is a small, earned transformation. The meteor shower and cuneiform index cards supply concrete, non-obvious particulars. However, the underlying arc (older mentor imparts wisdom; protagonist finds meaning in ritual rather than rescue) follows a recognizable emotional template. The piece does not take bold structural risks (chronological, single-POV, gentle escalation), and the developers remain abstract obstacles rather than dramatized pressure. The ending's quiet acceptance is thematically coherent but predictable in hindsight. Strong mid-range originality, elevated by specificity but not transcending familiar shapes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cassia (dead language tutor) drives three key beats: measuring sugar and predicting return (establishes gate), reframing Maren's desire ("dead languages too") and beginning rooftop pedagogy (middle turn), handing over the seal and agreeing to teach Sumerian (closure participation). Her choices—opening the door, moving lessons, gifting the seal—alter Maren's options and enable the final stasis. Setup in first beat, development across rooftop sessions, payoff at meteor shower and ongoing lessons. Causal pressure is strong (without Cassia's access and teaching, Maren's arc cannot complete), closure linkage secure (the lessons continue in the ending image), and irreplaceability high (the "dead language" skill is unique). Cost: Cassia shares her knowledge and key, foreclosing solitude. All three gates passed, multiple beats, causal and closure work present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The antique desk seal (brass, C.H.V. initials) appears in two beats: Cassia holds it during a rooftop conversation ("found it years ago wedged behind a baseboard") and hands it to Maren during the meteor shower ("Keep it... It belongs to whoever listens"). Setup is mid-story (~50% mark), development is the handoff beat (Maren closes her fingers around it, feels its warmth), and it does not reappear in the ending paragraph—no closure participation. The seal symbolizes listening and legacy but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource; Maren receives it passively. Two-of-three gates (development + thematic charge) allow eligibility to ~6.3 under lyric-resonance allowance, but the lack of closure reprise and the absence of causal pressure (it doesn't enable or block an action) cap the score in the mid-6s. Swappable with any heirloom without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Agreed upon lies" is named explicitly and drives the story's conceptual spine: the sugar ruse is the first lie that becomes beloved ritual; Cassia teaches that "every building lies" and renovation "simply replace[s] them with new ones"; Maren's documentation becomes "just the most beautiful of all agreed upon lies"; Sumerian "lied beautifully. That's why it lasted." The concept constrains Maren's professional stance (she cannot rescue the building, only add another layer of fiction) and reweights her final choice (continuing the lessons is acceptance of preservation's limits, not defeat). Setup early (sugar lie, first beat), development throughout (building-lies dialogue, Sumerian exchange), payoff in final paragraph ("its lie long since agreed upon and beloved"). Causal pressure high (the concept shapes Maren's realization and the thematic closure), closure linkage undeniable, irreplaceability clear (remove "lies" and the thematic engine collapses). Visible cost: Maren renounces the illusion of authentic rescue.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" appears twice as a descriptor of Cassia's hands: first when measuring sugar ("each movement precise yet unhurried, as though she had spent decades perfecting the economy of small gestures"), then when writing cuneiform on index cards ("the same patiently nimble hands"). It characterizes Cassia and links her domestic and pedagogical work, but it does not constrain an action or create a visible trade-off. The trait is observational rather than causal—Cassia's nimbleness does not enable a key choice or foreclose an option. Setup in first beat, reprise in final section (two-of-three gates), but no middle development where the attribute matters tactically. Label-only use without cost; swappable with "careful" or "practiced" without loss. Mid-band for presence and lyric echo, but functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Interrogate" is used explicitly when Cassia "began to teach Maren how to interrogate a building the way a philologist interrogates a text: layer by layer, seeking grammar in the mortar joints, syntax in the cornice profiles, dialect in the irregularities of hand-pressed brick." This pedagogical method drives Maren's middle development (she learns to read the building's silences) and underpins her final acceptance that documentation is insufficient. Setup at rooftop pedagogy (~40% mark), development in the walks through the building, implicit in the ending (Maren now "listen[s] for what the old walls chose to say next"). The action is thematic and methodological rather than a discrete physical beat; it shapes Maren's stance but does not create a single pivotal turn. Two-of-three gates (development + closure resonance), causal linkage present but diffuse. Swapping "interrogate" for "study" or "examine" would slightly weaken specificity but not break the arc, placing it in the solid-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The method—borrowing sugar that turns into weekly tea sessions—structures the entire narrative arc. Setup in opening beat (Maren knocks with rehearsed smile, needs access, receives sugar), development across second and third visits (kettle already on, "neither of them mentioned sugar at all"), and payoff in final image (sugar cup "gathered dust... its purpose long since outlived, its lie long since agreed upon and beloved"). The method is the story's hinge: without the sugar ruse, no access to Cassia or rooftop; the evolution from instrumental lie to genuine ritual embodies the theme of "agreed upon lies" and drives Maren's transformation. Causal pressure undeniable (the method unlocks every subsequent beat), closure linkage strong (the dusty cup charges the ending), irreplaceability total (no other method fits this particular deception-to-devotion arc). All three gates, multiple beats, high specificity, felt cost (Maren and Cassia both accept the lie's dissolution into truth). Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rooftop garden (herbs in terra-cotta pots, salvaged chimney caps) is where Cassia teaches Maren to interrogate buildings and where the meteor shower scene unfolds. Setup at ~30% when tea sessions move there, development during pedagogy walks, payoff during the meteor-shower handoff of the seal and Sumerian request. The garden enables privacy and access (Cassia holds "the only key"), charges the meteor-shower intimacy (rosemary/thyme smells, phosphorescent light), and persists in the ending ("on the rooftop, the herbs still grew"). However, it does not constrain a tactical choice or block an alternative; Maren could plausibly have met Cassia elsewhere. The meteor shower adds atmospheric charge but is not causally necessary (the handoff could occur without it). All three gates present, closure participation solid, but causal pressure is enabling rather than constraining. Micro-setting use (body/tool/object) is secondary to the larger space. Solid integration, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—"to learn the language of old buildings"—is stated explicitly and dramatized through her actions: she pursues Cassia for access, requests pedagogy ("I want to learn the language of old buildings"), walks the building to interrogate its silences, and ultimately asks for Sumerian lessons to "hear something that isn't lying." Setup in the fourth tea session (~25% mark), development throughout rooftop pedagogy and building walks, payoff when she accepts that preservation is a "beautiful lie" and continues the lessons anyway. The desire faces friction (documentation "felt insufficient"; Cassia warns "every building lies") and costs (professional mission becomes another fiction; she must renounce rescue). Causal pressure strong (the motivation drives every escalation), closure linkage clear (the desire persists transformed in the ending image), cost visible (acceptance of limits). Setup slightly delayed (not in opening beat), preventing a higher score, but all three gates passed and the motivation shapes the final stance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone of "mysterious familiarity" is established through the opening (Cassia's owlish knowing gaze, "You'll come back" as certainty) and sustained via the layering of dead languages, the building's silent "grammar," and the intimate yet slightly formal distance between the women. The meteor shower's "pale green" illumination ("as though the building itself had opened its eyes") and the final image of languages "the living world had forgotten" maintain the tone's blend of strangeness and warmth. Tone modulates subtly—more reserved in early beats, warmer during the rooftop intimacy—without breaking coherence. It charges the closure by making the ongoing ritual feel both uncanny and inevitable. Setup early, development consistent, payoff in the ending's quiet persistence. Tone does not constrain a choice but does reweight the emotional register of preservation-as-lie, elevating thematic resonance. Strong tonal control without causal pressure, landing in the 7.0–8.4 band.</comment>
