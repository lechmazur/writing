<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and her discovery of the deception is well-grounded in her expertise. Internal conflict exists (risk vs. safety) but operates more as sequential decisions than simultaneous contradictory impulses in the peak moments. The final stance—accepting hatred as "a human problem"—feels slightly pat given the magnitude of what she's done, though her coffee-stained isolation carries embodied weight. Backstory (graduate student background, signal discovery) is efficiently compressed and anchors present choices without flattening momentum.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors are present early (radio station, Maren's role, signal timeline). The escalation from discovery → factional conflict → transmission-back → silence lands as because/therefore linkage with visible cost: the gifts withdraw and both factions turn on her. Closure is a Decisive Change (signals stop, formulas degrade) paired with Earned Stasis (she accepts hatred). The cost is legible—she's saved them from poison but lost institutional support—though the final paragraph's "cautiously hopeful in its emptiness" edges toward telling the resonance rather than letting the image carry it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The radio station is anchored with sensory particulars (burnt coffee, ionized dust, ancient analog board processing subsonic frequencies) that constrain Maren's capability and enable the climactic transmission. The subsonic-frequency mechanism functions as micro-setting, shaping both discovery and tactical choice. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The astronomical charts return at closure ("sat among her charts") to charge the final image, though the sky-as-setting moment in the last line leans symbolic rather than tactically operative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent long-term catastrophe by exposing the deception. The secondary pattern (harmonic ghosts) discovery tightens options and Maren's decision to transmit back is a high-agency reversal that narrows the field to irreversible consequences. The cost is unmistakable on the page: formulas degrade, both factions hate her, and she's left isolated. One strong causal tightening is sufficient at this length; the escalation from wonder → power struggle → Maren's solitary counter-move coheres under causal pressure without redundant loops.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (deception, dependency, the cost of foresight) emerges from concrete events—signal patterns, factional blindness, Maren's isolation—rather than abstract statement. The "cosmic tricksters" label and the final "cautiously hopeful" phrase risk thematic echo, but the particulars (cascading feedback timelines, poisoned mineral coordinates) ground the concept. The ending image of the empty sky reweights prior material, though "hatred, she thought, was a human problem" edges toward articulating the theme rather than letting action and image alone carry it. The long-game trap premise invites reflection beyond the immediate plot.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited focalization throughout. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("cosmic tricksters," "seam in the deception," "searchlight finding a fugitive"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices frequency patterns, harmonic ghosts, chart correlations—filtering through her astrophysics expertise. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The phrase "cautiously hopeful" appears twice (once as description of Maren's state, once projected onto the sky), which risks a minor template touch but remains within the narrator's idiom. Dialogue is absent; no penalties apply there.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance plot, character insight, or world logic (subsonic frequencies, secondary harmonic patterns, timeline of transmissions). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The final paragraph's "cautiously hopeful" reprise and "hatred, she thought, was a human problem" edge toward scaffolding the theme, but the closure image remains anchored in action (she sits among charts, the sky is silent). Minor: "Each transmission's subsonic carrier wave contained a secondary pattern" could integrate more tightly into action rather than exposition, but it's efficient and clear. Propulsion is steady; no momentum stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—cosmic tricksters embedding delayed traps in subsonic frequencies—offers a specific, non-obvious angle on first-contact material. The subsonic detail and harmonic-ghost mechanism feel grounded in Maren's expertise rather than generic science fiction. The factional power struggle is familiar but particularized through Dean Vasquez's gatekeeping and the disclosure faction's haste. Maren's counter-transmission using the tricksters' own hidden language is an earned, character-specific reversal. Minor: the "cosmic tricksters" phrase and the sky-as-hopeful-emptiness closing image lean slightly toward stock lyric gestures, and the core emotional arc (lone expert versus institutional blindness) is well-trodden, though executed with enough specificity to avoid pure template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren (celestial signal interpreter) drives every major turn: isolates the signals, decodes the secondary patterns, decides to transmit back, and accepts the consequences. Her expertise constrains tactics (ancient analog board, subsonic detection) and her final choice to interfere is the story's fulcrum. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure isolation. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear in the opening (spread across the desk, hand-annotated margins), enable the targeting of her reply ("charts had given her the precise coordinates"), and return in the closure image ("sat among her charts"). They constrain her capability and charge the final image, but their specific function (coordinate targeting) is told rather than dramatized in the transmission beat. Two beats plus closure reprise with causal role; swapping for "star maps" would not break logic but would lose the hand-annotated particularity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Power plays (core concept) shape on-page stakes throughout: Dean Vasquez locks down the station and appoints herself gatekeeper; the disclosure faction demands immediate release; both factions vie for control of the signals and later turn their fury on Maren when she disrupts their plans. The concept drives the middle conflict and directly enables Maren's isolation at closure. Essential across beats and ending; removing it would collapse the institutional pressure that forces Maren's solo action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" (attribute) is named twice: once mid-story ("She was cautiously hopeful") describing Maren's stance after discovering the deception, and again in the final line projected onto the sky. The first instance labels rather than constrains action; the second charges the closure image but risks thematic echo. It does not demonstrably narrow options or impose visible cost in a dramatized beat. Lyric reprise that reweights the ending image but lacks middle beat involvement and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Interfere" (action) is the story's decisive turn: Maren waits until 2:47 AM, patches into the broadcast system, and transmits back using the tricksters' hidden language. This action triggers the immediate response (monitors flicker, silence), the withdrawal of all signals, and the dual-faction backlash at closure. Setup (decision paragraph), executed in the transmission beat, and directly shapes the ending. Irreplaceable; swapping "interfere" for "respond" or "act" would not capture the active subversion.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies (method) are signaled early (ancient analog board processes signals below twenty hertz, vibrations felt in the chest), enable Maren's discovery of the harmonic ghosts, and constrain her counter-transmission method ("same subsonic frequencies"). The mechanics matter: only her equipment can detect them, which isolates her expertise and makes her solo action plausible. Present in setup, middle discovery, and climax execution. Essential to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>University radio station (setting) provides the ancient analog board (subsonic capability), the factional lockdown (Vasquez posts security), and the 2:47 AM access point (single bribed guard). It constrains who can act and supplies the resource that enables Maren's counter-move. The burnt-coffee/ionized-dust anchor and the broadcast desk staging are vivid and integrated into action. Present across all three beats and indispensable to tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"As the community divides" (timeframe) structures the middle escalation: the factional conflict erupts after the third transmission, Dean Vasquez locks down the station, and Maren works "through the nights" cross-referencing before acting at 2:47 AM. The division drives tactical urgency (she must act before either faction prevails) and shapes the closure backlash. The timeline is present but not tightly tracked beat-to-beat; "three weeks ago" and "by morning" bracket the action without live-clock pressure in the transmission scene itself. Two gates plus closure consequence; causal role is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To outwit cosmic tricksters" (motivation) is dramatized through Maren's decoding work (finding the seam, mapping secondary patterns) and her counter-transmission choice ("reflect back like a mirror held up to a liar's face"). The desire is conflicted—she risks institutional wrath and isolation—and the cost is paid on the page (hatred, formula degradation). The phrase "cosmic tricksters" appears as her internal diagnosis, grounding the motivation in her expertise. Present in discovery, climax action, and closure consequence. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" (tone) is pursued through the blend of astrophysical mystery (subsonic pulses, cosmic microwave background) and grounded institutional conflict (burnt coffee, bribed security guard, homemade empanadas). The tone modulates from wonder (campus erupts) to dread (seam in the deception) to isolation (coffee-stained fingers, hatred). The final sky image leans ethereal; Maren's acceptance of human hatred leans grit. Coherent through turns and charges the final image, though the "cautiously hopeful" reprise risks softening the grit slightly. Strong tonal control with minor lyric drift at closure.</comment>
