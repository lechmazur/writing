<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Siv's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout: bronze dust on palms, hands trained by decades measuring pressures in fractions, the stone-in-sternum metaphor. The forgiveness-as-thaw moment and the final palm-to-rope gesture carry embodied contradiction—she's both mourning and preserving. Minor dip: the wax-casting meditation risks over-articulation in places ("paradox had once felt cruel"), though it remains character-specific enough to avoid therapy-speak. The arc from paralyzed grief to witnessed restoration is earned through her technical skill enabling the final act.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page through Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Siv completes the encoding, witnesses the light-as-sound projection, and speaks the first name—a crystallization of her eleven-year journey with visible emotional cost ("still water… still capable of flowing"). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered metaphors (wax/ice/light/rope/sound) that converge at the sanctum moment when the reconfigured rope splits aurora light into spectral threads, reweighting the premise of transcribed memory into permanent, illuminated form. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when her technical skill (the braiding) unlocks the physical transformation of the sanctum itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum constrains the action: glacier stairs, frozen fibers resisting her work, aurora light bending through ice veins to enable the prismatic lattice effect. The rope's stiffness and the sanctum's light geometry are not decorative—they create the conditions under which her encoding becomes visible as projected color. Micro-setting excellence: her hands ("pressures measured in fractions") and the punched card's soft edges anchor tactile reality. The final image where braids act as prismatic lattice and the sanctum illuminates from within charges closure directly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: preserve the Kanallat names permanently after her earlier failure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the rope resists and her patience must overcome ceremonial stiffness—her hands' trained gentleness becomes the tactical constraint that enables success. The cost is legible: eleven years of carried silence, the original warped recording, and now the physical and emotional labor of translation under cold and memory. Agency is expressed through endurance (returning after eleven years) and the decisive act of reconfiguring the braids, which forecloses her prior paralysis. Minor issue: the middle section leans slightly expository on the wax-casting metaphor, which slows pressure briefly before the rope work begins.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-erasure and preservation-through-destruction emerges organically from the wax-casting paradox and the rope encoding without thesis statement. The final image—names projected as light, "still capable of flowing," the bell waiting to be struck—offers a resonant non-literal answer: memory survives through transformation, not literal capture. The "monument to its own vanished original" thread recurs with purpose, charging the ending where the destroyed wax method finds its analog in frozen rope made luminous. Subtext operates cleanly in the "technically gentle" hands, the Tuesday-in-March forgiveness, and the whispered first name that fills the chamber.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and distinct: Siv notices through a caster's lens (pressures, filaments, molten flow, fractions), and the diction remains elevated but disciplined ("snowmelt ardor," "thaw," "aurora's slow green fire"). Psychic distance is stable, tight third with no head-hopping. The final paragraph modulates beautifully under emotional pressure—short clauses accelerate ("Still capable of flowing. Still capable of carrying…") without losing the established rhythm. Free indirect style is clean throughout, filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated when present. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly controlled: wax/destruction/permanence, ice/rigidity/thaw, light/sound/names form a coherent lattice. Two friction points: the opening's "silence like a stone in her sternum" and "snowmelt ardor" both risk slight over-poeticization, and the phrase "the slow and stubborn heat of something frozen remembering" stacks modifiers heavily in the penultimate paragraph. These don't obscure causality but do approach overwriting in peak beats. Sentence variety is strong, no loops detected, information density is high. Minor template echo: "she was… she had… she needed…" structure recurs in paragraph four but doesn't constitute a run.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of wax-casting/rope-braiding/aurora-optics as a method for encoding tonal language into light is specific and non-obvious. The emotional premise (grief held too long becomes erasure) is familiar, but the execution through tactile craft detail and the sanctum's prismatic mechanics offers fresh inflection. Risk: the piece commits fully to its lyrical accumulative design and trusts the reader to parse the street-organ → rope → light chain without linear causality. The "Tuesday in March" detail and "bronze dust on palms" ground the elevated register in lived specificity. Proximity check clear; transformation test passed—plot requires these exact crafts and this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Siv's identity as lost wax caster shapes the metaphor ("monument to its own vanished original") and her hands' technical skill enables the rope reconfiguration. She makes the key choice to return after eleven years and the decisive action of translating perforations into braids. Present in opening exposition, active in the middle rope scene, and her whispered name closes the piece. Two beats: the studio forgiveness and the sanctum encoding. Causal pressure is visible—her craft literally makes the transformation possible. Cost: eleven years of silence overcome.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The punched card appears in beat one (pocket, edges soft with age), is studied under aurora glow to decode intervals in beat two, and its perforations are translated into the rope pattern that enables the final light projection. Three distinct touches across setup, middle translation, and closure linkage. Specificity high: the card's material history (street organ, harbor village, tonal encoding) and its mechanical function (holes = intervals = pitches = names) are irreplaceable. The card's presence is causal—without it, the rope cannot be reconfigured. Visible cost: fragility ("moth wing") under preservation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Transcribed memory as concept drives the central action: the punched card encodes melody/names, the rope will hold them permanently, and the final light projection makes them "witnessed." The concept shapes stakes (preservation vs. erasure) and tactics (translation through braiding). Present throughout: opening reflection on the warped recording, the organ-maker's understanding that "music was the only notation precise enough," and the ending where encoded names become light. Two-gate clear (setup and closure); middle development is implied in the translation work but not as explicitly conceptual pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" appears as character trait in paragraph five: "fingers, trained by decades of wax work, were technically gentle: capable of pressures measured in fractions." This attribute directly enables the rope reconfiguration—the fibers are stiff and ceremonial, resisting, and only her precise micro-adjustments succeed where force would fail. One on-page action with visible constraint: her patience and measured touch overcome the rope's resistance. Cost: the labor is slow ("her hands knew patience the way rivers know stone"). Specificity and irreplaceability high; the trait is not ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is the climactic action: "When the final braid settled into place, light changed in the sanctum. The reconfigured rope caught the aurora… splitting the green light into spectral threads… projecting the encoded names as light." This moment is the story's payoff—it makes Siv's encoding visible and permanent, fulfilling her stake. Present in the penultimate paragraph and charged in the final image ("the sanctum answered"). The action is not swappable; the entire arc builds toward this physical transformation. Closure participation is direct and causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled in paragraph four (the ceremonial rope's patterns as records, each braid a syntax) and executed in paragraph five: "she began to reconfigure the braids… translating the card's holes into a new pattern within the ancient weave, each crossing point corresponding to a pitch, a name." The mechanics matter causally—braid geometry creates the prismatic lattice that splits aurora light. Three beats: the rope introduced on the plinth, the reconfiguration labor, and the resulting illumination. Irreplaceability high: this exact method (rope braiding as encoding) is the story's engine. Cost: physical effort against frozen fibers.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum supplies essential resources: aurora light filtering through ice walls provides the illumination source, and the glacial plinth holds the ceremonial rope. The setting's geometry—ice veins bending light inward—creates the conditions for the prismatic effect. Present in beat one (descent, blue darkness), active in beat two (aurora glow for reading the card), and charges closure (the sanctum "answered" the aurora flare). Constraint: the cold stiffens the rope fibers, adding resistance Siv must overcome. The setting is not postcard; it pressures and enables.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after forgiving herself" anchors the emotional arc and is specified early: "She had forgiven herself on a Tuesday in March… and the forgiveness did not feel like absolution so much as thaw." This past moment sets up the present descent ("Now she descended"). The timeframe shapes the decision to return after eleven years and alters her internal stance from paralysis to action. Two beats: the March forgiveness and the present sanctum work. Cost is visible (eleven years of carried silence). Lyric reprise in the final paragraph ("still capable of flowing") reweights the thaw metaphor. Does not function as a live ticking clock, so mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Motivation to preserve forgotten names is dramatized throughout: the warped recording failure haunts her, the punched card encodes the last melody, she translates it into rope to "make it permanent," and the ending witnesses the names as light before she whispers the first one aloud. Friction between want (preservation) and cost (eleven years of grief, physical labor in cold, confronting failure) is on-page. Three beats: opening failure memory, the rope encoding, and the spoken name that fills the chamber. The motivation drives every choice and charges the closure image directly. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" as tone appears explicitly in the penultimate paragraph: "not fire, but snowmelt ardor, the slow and stubborn heat of something frozen remembering." The tone is coherent through all turns—grief-thaw-patience-warmth—and modulates with pressure: cold descent, focused labor, luminous witness, spoken tenderness. The final image of the bell "waiting, all this time, only to be struck" carries that slow-warmth charge. Present in setup (forgiveness as thaw), active in middle (hands like rivers knowing stone), and charges closure (still capable of flowing). The tone is specific, not generic melancholy, and integral to the accumulative design.</comment>
