<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's arc from skeptic to someone who acknowledges the "weight of a swallowed truth" is earned through concrete choices—turning the valve, sitting to process, walking out lighter. The confession recording provides a strong embodied shock moment. Internal contradiction operates well: she's "religiously skeptical" yet spends weeks researching psychic calls, her method both systematic and emotionally driven. Minor slip: the final interiority ("she believed, now, that she had known them all along") edges toward diagnostic summary rather than pure dramatization, though the body language and spatial grounding keep it anchored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara confronts her suppressed guilt, turns the valve back, and walks out "lighter by exactly that much"—a visible psychic cost paid. Causal lens holds: her triangulation method leads her to this tunnel, her touch triggers the recording, her choice to turn the valve back enacts renunciation. Orientation is swift (headlamp, mill, tunnel by line three). One meaningful tightening occurs when the hum stops and her own voice plays, narrowing options to direct confrontation. The closure's conceptual cost (carrying the secret versus releasing it) is legible and felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tunnel is vividly particularized—damp breath, wet stone, rusted track ties, brass valve with glass beads—and constrains Mara's movement and choices (she must walk deeper, touch the valve). The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: its ceremonial detail and her interaction with it anchor both the confession reveal and her decision to turn it back. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional explorer's eye (tensile strength of bolts, concrete solidity). The drowsy-but-alert filter is consistent and purposeful. Minor note: the loading bay distance (400 meters) and the recording speaker feel slightly convenient rather than fully discovered, but they don't break spatial logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—confronting her father's death and her own complicity—is signaled early through her research into the "ghost shift" and sharpens decisively when her deleted confession plays. The valve-turn reversal narrows options: silence broken, no retreat possible. Agency is clear: her method brought her here, her hand turned the valve, her choice to turn it back enacts renunciation with visible cost (she sits, processes, walks out changed). Pressure coheres under the Causal lens and tightens once, sufficient for this length. The cost is both emotional (guilt acknowledged) and physical (she sits, feels the stone, walks lighter).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—guilt as machinery, suppressed truth as perpetual motion—emerges organically from the ghost shift metaphor, the valve mechanics, and Mara's realization that "the architecture of guilt made audible" describes her own cycle, not the factory's. The final image ("lighter by exactly that much") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The beaded valve evolves from devotional object to confession trigger to release mechanism, charging the closure. Subtext operates in her method (researching psychics while skeptical = displaced mourning) and in the recording's content (anger, responsibility, the choice not to stop). No thematic echo or summary mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Mara notices "tensile strength of rusted bolts," filters sensation through her explorer's expertise and skeptical stance. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure—short, sharp clauses when the hum stops, longer reflective sentences when she processes. The phrase "religiously skeptical" and "drowsy...hypervigilance" are voice-consistent and fresh. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "the hush that follows a sudden confession, stretched and distorted by stone walls and decades of silence" edges toward narrator commentary rather than pure character perception, though it remains within plausible interiority for an educated explorer processing shock.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings are diverse, information density is high (headlamp, mill history, valve mechanics all advance character and plot). No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges "lighter" motif. Minor texture issue: "the weight of a swallowed truth is precisely the weight of the body that swallows it" in the penultimate paragraph is a touch abstract and poeticized for peak-pressure interiority—functional but slightly elevated beyond Mara's established register under stress. One filter-verb cluster ("she heard," "she recognized," "she had spoken") in the confession paragraph, but brief and not pervasive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The core synthesis—urban explorer confronts personal ghost via paranormal research method—feels specific and non-obvious. The beaded valve as confessional trigger and the recording playback transform the ghost-shift trope into psychological architecture. Emotional specificity (deleted phone confession, seeing her father walk in, the anger and refusal) avoids generic grief template. The triangulation-via-talk-radio method is fresh. Risk: the supernatural-that-isn't frame could feel familiar, but the particular mechanics (valve, beads, her own voice) and the earned guilt-as-machinery metaphor elevate it. Not fully indispensable in every detail, but the premise commits and follows through without hedging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's recklessness is demonstrated (three years of dangerous exploration, taking "risks nobody else would stomach," entering via collapsed wall). Her choice to turn the valve drives the confession reveal; her choice to turn it back and walk out constitutes the closure action. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle choice (valve turn), and ending (walk out lighter). Causal and indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel appears in setup (mid-tunnel discovery), is turned twice (beats: hum stops, hum does not return), and its "devotional" appearance charges both the confession mechanism and Mara's renunciation. The beads click in the cold, a detail that layers sensory and thematic texture. Irreplaceable: no other object could carry the ceremonial/mechanical fusion or the tactile two-turn structure. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The factory ghost shift frames Mara's research motivation and the paranormal premise, and the recording playback literalizes "phantom sound." Her realization that "the ghost shift...was the tunnel remembering her" reweights the concept thematically. Present in setup (talk-radio history), middle (the hum), and ending (her revised understanding). Functional but somewhat abstract at closure; the concept shapes stakes more than it constrains tactics. Solid mid-high integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Religiously skeptical" is dramatized early (she doesn't believe in ghosts, trusts concrete and rebar) and tested when the supernatural-seeming event occurs. Her skepticism enables her to interpret the recording as human-planted rather than paranormal, which is consistent with her character and maintains coherence. It constrains her method (systematic triangulation rather than mystical acceptance) and her final stance (she still doesn't believe the tunnel "knew" her secrets, but she acknowledges psychological truth). Present across arc with visible cost (the tension between method and motivation).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Appraise" governs her entire method: she appraises callers' accounts for overlapping details, triangulates the epicenter, and the verb recurs when she touches the valve ("she reached for it"). The systematic appraisal brings her to the closure site and her tactile appraisal (turning the valve) triggers the confession. Essential to both setup and climax; removing it would require structural overhaul. Strong integration, though the verb itself could be replaced with "assess" or "evaluate" without deep loss—slight swappability lowers the score from highest band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The talk-radio-psychic method is signaled in paragraph four, described as "unconventional but systematic," and provides the triangulation data that leads Mara to this tunnel stretch. It appears again in the closure realization (the calls were real accounts of her own suppressed guilt made audible). Present in setup and thematic payoff. Functional; however, the mechanics (how she accessed recordings, why callers would describe *her* tunnel experience) remain slightly vague, and the method could be replaced with police reports or urban-explorer forums with moderate edits. Solid but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel provides damp breath, rusted ties, wet stone vibration, the valve housing, and spatial pressure (400 meters from loading bay, gentle curve that reveals the valve). It constrains her movement and supplies the valve as the key object. The tunnel's acoustics ("the hush...stretched and distorted by stone walls") charge the confession moment. Present throughout, alters tactics (she must walk deeper to find the source), and the cold stone floor anchors her processing beat. Environment essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the hush that follows a sudden confession" anchors the central beat when the recording ends and silence holds. That hush governs Mara's frozen reaction ("unable to move") and the processing that follows. It appears in the closure third and charges the tonal shift. The phrase recurs as metaphor ("the tunnel held its breath"). Time pressure is psychological rather than clock-driven, but the hush's duration shapes her stance crystallization. Strong thematic and tonal integration; would score higher if it tracked across more beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to find the weight of a swallowed truth"—is dramatized through her weeks of research, her 16-hour drive, and her method of stripping hysteria from psychic calls. The motivation is revealed explicitly in the narration but earned through her actions and her reaction to the confession playback. It creates the central conflict (her systematic skepticism versus her emotional need) and is resolved when she acknowledges the weight and walks out lighter. The exact phrase appears late but the motivation governs every prior choice. Indispensable, with visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Drowsy alertness" is named in paragraph five ("drowsy from a sixteen-hour drive but alert in the way that only darkness and strangeness can make a person") and enacted throughout: her systematic observations paired with exhaustion, her hypervigilance when the hum grows louder, her slowed processing when she sits on the rail. The tone modulates from wary alertness to shock-stillness to reflective calm as she walks out. Coherent and purposeful, charging the paradoxical state that enables both her exploration and her vulnerable confession-moment. Strong tonal integration across arc.</comment>
