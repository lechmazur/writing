<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular—the mathematician's impulse to quantify grief, the conjurer's secrecy, the engineer's mind seeking formulae in loss. Internal conflict is embodied: she searches for eleven months, touches the glass eyes "the way a mathematician touches a proof," enacts the contradiction between hope and grief through ritual action. The final choice—to return tomorrow with rope and lantern—is earned by the iterative tightening of her formula and forecloses total despair with visible cost (the acceptance that resolution will not arrive). Minor issue: Elda's "gently inventive" trait is told more than shown through micro-choices, limiting full 9+ access despite strong protagonist work.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within opening lines (Maren, cavern orchard, moonlit night after silence). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: pressure builds through recursive conjuring imagery (mosaic gaps, glass eyes, dripping resonance) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—"the formula had shifted tonight, tightened, moved one decimal place closer to a truth she could almost hold." Cost is conceptual but legible: she has not found Elda, has not proven her lost, yet the asymptote sharpens and she will persist. The mathematics-of-emotion premise coheres across all beats and charges the final image of pale trees "growing toward a light that came and went but never fully disappeared." No causality breaks; the lens holds.</comment>

<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The cavern orchard is rendered with vivid, selective detail—fracture admitting moonlight, translucent fruit, roots curling around calcite—that reflects Maren's conjurer's perception. The mosaic stepping stone constrains the conjuring method (chipped patterns as code). Spatial choreography is clear: kneeling on the stone, placing the eyes, standing and brushing grit. The setting charges the closure image (pale trees, moonlight) and the dripping-water resonance is woven into the spell's sound. Minor gap: the deeper passages Elda charted are mentioned but remain abstract, limiting full irreplaceability at 9+.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>One dominant stake—resolving ambiguous loss—is signaled early and accumulates pressure through the conjuring attempt. The tightening is conceptual: Maren's realization that "the mathematics of emotion did not resolve. They iterated" narrows her stance from seeking proof-of-loss to accepting asymptotic approach. Agency is endurance with cost: she will return tomorrow, foreclosing closure but maintaining search. No reversals are required under the Accumulative lens; the single deepening suffices. Cost is felt in the gap between hope and grief that persists, but remains oblique—closer to Charged Poise than visceral forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme—ambiguous loss and the attempt to quantify the unquantifiable—emerges organically from Maren's conjuring and the asymptote metaphor. The glass eyes as "returning what silence had borrowed" and the mathematics imagery cohere without stated moral. The final image (trees "growing toward a light that came and went but never fully disappeared") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: persistence without resolution. Elda's taxidermy/inventiveness enriches the motif of restoring sight to the dead. No thematic echo or prompt language; the conceptual cost (iterative longing) is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Single POV, stable third-limited focalization with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren's mathematician-conjurer lens filters all detail (asymptote, coefficient, decay rate). Diction is controlled and purposeful—"the marrow of her craft," "reverently, seeking certainty"—and matches the character's register. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure: the conjuring beat tightens syntax ("The spell rose not as fire or wind but as sound"), then releases into the quieter final paragraph. Elda's voice is recalled but not directly on-page; no dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or thematic pressure. Rhythm varies naturally without algorithmic stems. Minor issues: "It was via the chipped patterns on that mosaic stepping stone that Maren performed her most delicate work" employs passive distancing at a key moment; the phrase "the loss lived in a space between grief and hope" edges toward abstraction. A brief paraphrase loop: "She had not found Elda. She had not proven Elda lost" restates slightly without added detail. No loops touch closure; figurative density (asymptote, planets, congregants) is purposeful and coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The conjunction of taxidermy (returning sight to the dead) with conjuring and mathematics of emotion is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The asymptote metaphor and iterative formula reframe grief freshly. The underground orchard and mosaic-as-code add vivid particularity. Risk: the accumulative/lyric design and conceptual closure avoid formulaic turns. Minor limiter: the "mathematics of emotion" concept, while executed with specificity here, echoes recent literary explorations of grief-as-data; transformation through the asymptote image and taxidermy linkage is strong but not fully unprecedented.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Maren (secretive conjurer) is present throughout, signaled early ("secrecy was the marrow of her craft"). She performs the spell mid-story (placing eyes, tracing gaps) and makes the final choice to return tomorrow—altering tactics from seeking proof to accepting iterative approach. Her conjuring constrains method and charges the closure. Cost: acceptance of ongoing search without resolution. Strong causal role across setup, middle action, and ending; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The glass eye pair is introduced early (Elda's tools, "hazel, flecked with copper"), touched reverently in Maren's pocket, placed on the mosaic during conjuring, then wrapped again at the end. Two distinct beats (carrying/touching; placement during spell). The eyes embody the taxidermy theme of "returning what death had borrowed" and charge the spell's resonance. They reappear in the closure paragraph with reweighted meaning (failure to restore sight yet persistence). Strong integration; near-indispensable for thematic and ritual coherence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>Ambiguous loss is the story's spine: Elda "had not died. She had simply stopped being findable." The concept shapes Maren's motivation, the conjuring's goal, and every tactical choice. The realization that "the mathematics of emotion did not resolve. They iterated" directly articulates the ambiguity with conceptual cost. The asymptote metaphor and final image of ongoing growth embody unresolved loss. Setup, middle pressure, and closure all pivot on this exact concept; removing it would collapse story logic. Exemplary integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Elda's "gently inventive" trait appears in backstory: reimagining a clock as music box, posing a sparrow convincingly. It primes the taxidermy-as-restoration theme and the notational language for expressions. However, the trait is told rather than dramatized in on-page action with visible cost. No middle beat where inventiveness enables or constrains a choice. Lyric reprise at closure is absent. Functional but replaceable; another trait (e.g., meticulous, obsessive) could serve similar thematic work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"Dovetail" is signaled early: "letting the broken code dovetail with the conjuring lattice she built in her mind, interlocking loss with logic." The action structures the conjuring beat—tracing gaps, merging symbol systems—and produces the key realization ("mathematics of emotion did not resolve. They iterated"). It shapes the spell's mechanics and charges the closure moment. Two beats (the tracing; the resulting understanding). Strong causal role; removing "dovetail" would require re-engineering the spell's logic. Near-essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The mosaic stepping stone method is introduced early ("It was via the chipped patterns on that mosaic stepping stone that Maren performed her most delicate work"), used in the conjuring beat (kneeling, tracing absences, placing eyes on the stone), and its mechanics matter: gaps map to Elda's notational symbols. The stone's glow during the spell and its placement at the orchard entrance anchor spatial and thematic coherence. Setup, middle use, and closure participation all present. High specificity; the exact method (chipped-tile code) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The cavern orchard is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (moonlight column, translucent fruit, dripping stalactites). It supplies the conjuring's acoustic resonance ("a low hum that matched the frequency of dripping water") and the recurring motif of pale trees growing toward intermittent light. The setting constrains Maren's secrecy and isolation, enables the spell's mechanics, and charges the final image. Three beats; strong closure participation. Removing the cavern would require wholesale redesign.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"After the orchard grows silent beneath the moon" is signaled in the opening and establishes nocturnal ritual timing. The moonlight enables the trees' growth and the spell's visual anchor. However, time does not tighten decisions on the page; the conjuring unfolds without a ticking clock or deadline pressure. The timeframe sets atmosphere and enables the spell but remains static. Setup and closure presence qualify for mid-band; lack of tactical constraint limits higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Maren's desire "to understand the mathematics of emotion" is dramatized throughout: her belief that "sorrow had a coefficient and longing a decay rate," the conjuring to "determine whether Elda was gone or merely elsewhere," and the realization that emotions "iterated" rather than resolved. The motivation drives the spell, the tracing of mosaic gaps, and the final choice to persist. Friction between wanting proof and accepting asymptotic approach creates cost. Strong causal and thematic integration across all three gates; near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Buried optimism coheres through the entire arc: Maren's eleven-month search, the belief that formulae could resolve loss, the realization that "the formula had shifted tonight, tightened," and the final resolve to return tomorrow. The tone modulates from mournful reflection to tentative hope ("the pale trees went on growing toward a light that came and went but never fully disappeared"). Optimism is buried—qualified by cost and ambiguity—but charges the ending. Strong coherence; the tone shapes both middle pressure and closure image.</comment>
