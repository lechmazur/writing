<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's arc from unknowing inheritor to someone who "remembers" is structured, but the interiority relies heavily on summary ("she began to remember") rather than embodied contradiction in scene. The bride's motivation is told ("repaying a debt") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The final recognition moment feels epiphanic without the micro-choices under pressure that would earn it; Maren's passivity—waiting, speaking to air—limits agency until the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present early (greenhouse, Maren, inherited deed). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bride's debt is paid, the bead cools, darkness thins—a clear before/after with felt cost (the bride's departure, Maren's solitude). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: repeated visitations layer meaning until the final eruption reweights the orchard's purpose. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maren speaks aloud and the bride materializes fully, narrowing distance and forcing recognition. Cost is legible in the bride's smile and vanishing, though the emotional price for Maren could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse environment is vivid and purposeful: mercury pomegranates, luminescent sap, obsidian cherry tree anchor the setting with specificity. The carved stone bead's warmth/coldness constrains Maren's understanding and charges the final image when it cools. Spatial choreography is clear (alembics, roots, glass panels). The endless night pressing against glass creates atmospheric pressure, and the final blossoming transforms the space causally. Sensory detail is filtered through Maren's attention (tuberose and smoke, frost and fire touch) without becoming a catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maren's need to understand the inheritance and the bride's presence—is signaled early and tightens as visitations lengthen and the bead warms. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: Maren begins speaking to the air, which extends the bride's materialization and leads to the climactic meeting. Agency is mostly observational until the final night when Maren holds the bead in open palm, a choice that triggers the resolution. The cost is the bride's departure and Maren's acceptance of solitude, legible but somewhat muted in emotional charge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particulars: love as sacrifice across lifetimes, memory as debt, the orchard as a vessel for connection. The final image—"alone and not alone"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The "lovingly venomous" truth-telling and the bride's mournful elation modulate the core question of what it means to repay a debt that spans death. Subtext operates in the bride's smile ("You took your time") and the bead's temperature shifts. Minor slip: "a love that had outlasted death itself" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward explicit thematic statement rather than letting the image hold alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third limited, anchored to Maren's perceptions. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("centuries of exhalation," "devastating yearning"), creating a consistent gothic-romantic register. Psychic distance stays controlled; Maren's interior access is clear. However, the voice occasionally drifts into exposition that tells rather than shows: "These were resonant awakenings" and "She was repaying a debt across lifetimes" read as authorial framing rather than Maren's lived understanding. Sentence rhythm is purposeful, but some stems repeat ("She remembered dying. She remembered being held").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is often vivid ("mercury pomegranates," "frost and fire and the ache of every winter field") and rhythmically controlled. Information density is high in the opening and closing. However, several issues accumulate: paraphrase loops ("a yearning so sharp it cut" / "devastating...yearning"), repetitive sentence openings ("She remembered... She remembered... She remembered"), and occasional register drift into abstract summary ("resonant awakenings," "mournful elation" as labels). The final third maintains clarity, so the core closure image is untouched, but mid-story scaffold ("Over the hush of winter-cracked fields, across weeks of silence") and stock metaphors ("bleeding mercury," "luminescent sap") slightly dull momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard as a cross-lifetime anchor and the bride who refuses rebirth to repay a debt offer a fresh synthesis of gothic haunting and reincarnation romance. The carved bead as a temperature-sensitive object that tracks psychic proximity is a specific, non-obvious detail. However, the core emotional arc—amnesiac inheritor remembers past love through supernatural visitations—follows a recognizable template. The "lovingly venomous" attribute and the greenhouse's impossible botany add texture, but the plot beats (inheritance from unknown relative, escalating apparitions, climactic recognition) are well-trodden. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging, which elevates it within its genre.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ghost bride appears in setup (third night), development (repeated cameo appearances that lengthen as Maren speaks), and payoff (materializes fully on the longest night, touches the bead, triggers blossoming, then vanishes). She drives two key beats: the escalating visitations that force Maren to remember, and the final materialization that completes the debt. Her choice to remain ashen-veiled across centuries and her decision to depart after touching the bead are causal. However, her agency is mostly reactive—she appears, she waits—until the ending. The smile and touch are her only on-page actions with visible consequence. Swappability is low (the bride's specific history and refusal of rebirth are unique), but her passivity in development keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The carved stone bead is introduced in setup (arrives with the deed, worn on a cord, always warm), developed across multiple beats (grows warmer with each visitation, tracks proximity), and central to closure (Maren holds it in open palm, bride touches it, bead goes cold for the first time). It constrains Maren's understanding and enables the final recognition. The temperature shift is a specific, irreplaceable property that alters tactics (Maren learns to wait when it warms). Visible cost: the bead's coldness signals the debt's end and the bride's permanent departure. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Resonant awakenings" is named explicitly mid-story as a label for Maren's memory returns. It shapes the dominant stake (Maren must awaken to her past to understand the inheritance) and is present in development (each visitation loosens "something calcified"). However, the concept is told rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices that shift tactics. The awakening happens off-page between visitations; we see the result (Maren remembers hands, voice, dying) but not the moment of friction or cost within a scene. Present in closure as the "understanding flooding through her," but the mechanics are summarized. Functional but somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Lovingly venomous" is introduced in backstory reflection (mid-story: "a voice lovingly venomous, speaking truths that stung") and reprised at closure (the bride's smile: "lovingly venomous even now"). It appears in setup as memory and payoff as final image, but is absent from development—no middle beat where the bride's actions or words demonstrate this trait with on-page cost. The phrase is evocative but label-only; no scene shows the bride wounding Maren to help her. The smile's "You took your time" carries light subtext but no visible tradeoff. Lyric reprise present, but the attribute never constrains a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The act of ghosting (appearing as translucent figure, dissolving, flickering) is introduced early (third night reflection in glass) and recurs across development (behind alembics, beside roots, ephemeral cameo appearances). It drives the escalating pressure: each appearance lasts longer as Maren engages, leading to full materialization. Closure turn: the bride "materialized fully for the first time," touches the bead, triggers the orchard's eruption, then vanishes permanently. The ghosting mechanics are specific (veils thin, face emerges, translucent touch) and irreplaceable—the story's causality depends on the bride's incremental solidity. Two distinct beats plus closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through ephemeral cameo appearances" describes the method of ghosting and is signaled early ("ephemeral cameo appearances—always at the periphery, always dissolving"). It shapes development: the bride's brief, peripheral materializations force Maren to narrate her work aloud, which extends the appearances. The method is tied to the mechanism (veils thin, face emerges as engagement deepens). However, the phrasing "ephemeral cameo appearances" is used once as a label; the actual mechanics (reflection in glass, flickering, dissolving) are shown but not named consistently. Present in closure (full materialization breaks the pattern), but the method itself is more descriptive than causal. Mid-band for lyric setup and functional payoff without mid-scene constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is introduced in the opening sentence and anchors every beat: Maren prunes crystallized pears, distills fruit at alembics, grafts moonstone branches, stands among mercury pomegranates at closure. The setting's impossible botany (trees that should not survive, fruit that bleeds mercury) supplies the resources Maren tends and the reason she stays long enough to remember. The endless night pressing against glass creates atmospheric pressure. Closure linkage is strong: "every tree blossoming simultaneously, fruit splitting open to release seeds of pure light" is the visual climax, and the greenhouse's brightness afterward signals the debt's completion. The orchard is revealed as the bride's deliberate creation ("You grew this place for me"), which reweights all prior tending as courted memory. Irreplaceable and causally central.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Over the hush of winter-cracked fields" appears in the opening paragraph (setting frame), mid-story as a lyric refrain ("Over the hush of winter-cracked fields, across weeks of silence"), and at closure ("Outside, over the hush of winter-cracked fields, something shifted"). It establishes seasonal atmosphere and recurs to mark time's passage, but does not tighten decisions or tactics. The "weeks of silence" notation tells rather than tracks a live clock. The timeframe is static backdrop rather than active pressure; Maren's work proceeds at an unspecified pace. Lyric reprise at closure adds minor charge (darkness begins "reluctant retreat toward dawn"), but the element is ornamental. Present in setup and payoff, absent from development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bride's motivation—to repay a debt across lifetimes—is introduced mid-story in exposition ("She was repaying a debt...a love Maren had offered in some prior existence") and dramatized at closure when the bride touches the bead, triggers the blossoming, and vanishes with the debt paid. The motivation shapes the bride's refusal of rebirth (told in backstory) and her choice to remain ashen-veiled until Maren remembers. Friction is implied: the bride has carried the burden "so long that setting it down feels like both liberation and loss." However, the internal conflict is told rather than shown through contradictory on-page choices. The closure moment ("the debt was paid") makes the cost legible—Maren stands "alone and not alone"—but the bride's departure is swift and we don't see her wrestle with the release. Strong closure linkage and causal role; moderate dramatization of friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Mournful elation" is introduced mid-story as the bride's expression ("sorrowful and radiant, wearing an expression of mournful elation") and modulates the final encounter: the bride's smile is both release and loss, and her touch is "frost and fire and the ache." The tone charges the closure image (the bride's simultaneous joy and grief at setting down her burden). It is present in development (the bride's "devastating yearning" and "lovingly venomous" smile) and coheres across turns. However, the phrase "mournful elation" is used once as a label; the emotional duality is shown in action (smile, touch) but not consistently woven through earlier beats—early visitations are described as "devastating" or "yearning" without the elation counterweight. Tone is purposeful and modulates under pressure, but the specific pairing is front-loaded as description and back-loaded at closure.</comment>
