<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and character-specific ("diesel and optimism," "resiliently positive the way she'd been every morning"). The final choice to persist and coordinate other versions of herself is earned by her established trait of showing up despite erasure. Her embodied response—holding the radio toward the stars, humming—demonstrates contradictory impulses (fear versus duty) acting simultaneously. Minor deduction: the emotional arc is clean but the stakes feel slightly abstract; the cost of merging timelines is conceptual rather than viscerally felt as a personal sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: the timelines braid, the hourglass fills with fused light, and the ferry resurfaces—a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration (the city is "stitched from many"). Drive lens is Causal-Situational Hybrid: the grotto discovery forces immediate tactical response, and the radio coordination narrows options under the temporal frequency constraint. Cost is visible (eleven minutes accounted for, the city changed) and the lens holds. Orientation is swift (Pier 11, 6:47 PM, ferry deck). One meaningful tightening: the discovery of the hourglass and the realization that timelines want to merge escalates Mara's task from passive observer to active orchestrator.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The spectral grotto constrains Mara's final choice: she must stand on the quartz ledge, hold the radio toward the fractal sky, and let the other Maras hear the rhythm. The stalactites, phosphorescent stone, and spiral constellations are filtered through her perception and directly enable the solution. The hourglass on the natural shelf is a micro-setting anchor that charges the closure image (it fills with fused light). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The harbor lights bending and water turning luminous are vivid, selective, and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: the ferry's vanishing runs threaten its existence and Mara's purpose. One meaningful tightening occurs when the clocks run sideways and the ferry descends into the grotto, forcing Mara to act. Her agency—keying the radio, letting the other Maras hear the interval, humming the pattern—drives the resolution with visible cost: she coordinates multiple versions of herself under pressure, and the timelines merge permanently. The constraint (matching the temporal frequency) narrows tactics and shapes the final image. Coincidence does not resolve; protagonist action does.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: showing up despite erasure, the labor of continuity, and interconnection as survival. The hourglass, empty then filled with fused light, becomes a charged motif without stated moral. The final image—"proof that showing up is its own kind of miracle"—reweights prior material through the radio call ("All souls aboard") and the glowing hourglass, offering a resonant answer to the question of what persistence means when the world keeps erasing you. The fractal stars and braided timelines function as subtext for pattern and interdependence without meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, filtered consistently through Mara's perceptual signature: "diesel and optimism," "the way you understand a song before you learn the words." Diction remains grounded and voice-motivated throughout. The radio dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("Hey… I think you are too, or close"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the grotto discovery. No head-hopping. Minor deduction: a few filter verbs ("she understood," "she felt a hum") are present but not overused, and one phrase—"interference patterns in water"—edges toward elevated register but stays within a deckhand's plausible idiom given her ardent, observant nature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high ("stalactites dripped light instead of water"). The opening and closing images are strong and resonant. Clarity and momentum are maintained throughout. Minor deductions: "the way you understand a song before you learn the words" is slightly generic; "permanent as a heartbeat, transient as a crossing" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward stock phrasing. One near-loop: "proof that showing up is its own kind of miracle" restates the opening's implicit message with minimal added pressure. No major scaffolding or template cadence, but figurative density is high in the grotto scene without full pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise—vanishing ferry runs as overlapping timelines—transforms a familiar trope (quantum/parallel worlds) through the specific particulars of a working deckhand, a harbor grotto, and a temporal frequency encoded in fractal starlight. The empty hourglass as the junction device and the radio coordination of multiple Maras feel fresh and earned. The emotional truth (labor, persistence, interconnection) anchors the speculative elements. Risk-taking is evident in the lyric compression and the fractal-sky mechanics, which remain legible. The synthesis of blue-collar persistence and cosmic braiding is non-obvious and coheres fully. The story commits to its premise without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout, drives the key turn (keying the radio, coordinating the other Maras), and her choice to keep showing up despite erasure shapes the entire arc. Her ardent trait constrains the final action (she remains resiliently positive under pressure). She appears in the opening, middle discovery, and closure beats. Causal pressure is strong, and the closure would fail without her decision to broadcast the pattern. Cost is tied to her coordination effort and the permanent merging of timelines.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hourglass appears empty on the rock shelf (beat 1, discovery), fills with fused light during the resolution (beat 2, closure participation), and remains glowing in Mara's locker as a charged final image (beat 3, reprise). Its emptiness signals the problem (sand poured out, timelines drifting), and its filling with light marks the solution. Removing it would break the story's logic and visual closure. Cost is tied to its transformation from empty to filled. Irreplaceability is high; no generic object could replace its temporal-sand symbolism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The vanishing ferry drives the dominant stake from the opening ("the ferry began to vanish") through the escalation (Tuesday run flickered, Thursday dissolved) to the closure (ferry rises, harbor reassembles, 11 minutes accounted for). The concept shapes Mara's tactics (she must understand why it vanishes, then actively merge the timelines) and appears in the final radio call. Removing the vanishing would eliminate the entire plot engine. The concept is not merely thematic; it changes options and forces the grotto descent and the radio coordination.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is established early ("ardently, stubbornly," "keeping her voice steady"), constrains her middle action (she doesn't panic, she coordinates), and charges the closure (she continues to show up, coil ropes, remember names). Visible tradeoff: her optimism keeps her aboard when others quit, and her steady voice over the radio enables the solution. The trait is embodied in gesture and choice, not merely labeled. Cost is felt but somewhat implied rather than sharply visible. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but the causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The radio appears early (VHF clipped to her belt), drives the major turn (she keys it and hears layered Mara voices), enables the middle tactic (broadcasting the interval to coordinate timelines), and participates in closure ("Pier 11, *Perseverance* arriving on schedule"). Removing the radio would eliminate the mechanism for merging timelines. It is irreplaceable; no other object could coordinate multiple versions of Mara across parallel timelines. The action is specific, causal, and charges the final beat. Cost is tied to her coordination effort under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Interconnected patterns" is signaled early (the vanishing runs as "interference patterns in water"), developed in the grotto (fractal sky, spirals nesting inside spirals, "a rhythm encoded via interconnected patterns of light"), and drives the solution (Maras hum the interval, matching the temporal frequency). The method shapes Mara's tactic: she must listen, identify the pattern, and broadcast it. Removing the pattern-based method would break the resolution logic. Specificity is high. Cost is tied to the coordination effort. Present in setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto appears at the inciting descent, supplies the hourglass (the key object), provides the fractal sky (the pattern Mara must broadcast), and its stalactites ring like bells during resolution. The quartz ledge is where Mara stands to coordinate. Removing the grotto would eliminate the junction concept and the visual/auditory mechanism for merging timelines. It constrains Mara's choice (she must step off the boat, hold the radio toward the ceiling) and charges the closure (grotto resonates, ferry rises). Irreplaceability is very high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways" triggers the inciting event (every timepiece counts laterally, harbor lights bend, ferry descends). The timeframe signals the junction moment and tightens the need for immediate action. It reappears at closure (Mara's watch ticks forward, chronometer reads 6:58 PM, eleven minutes accounted for). The sideways-clock image is specific and constrains the narrative window. Removing it would weaken the transition into the grotto and the closure proof. Cost is tied to the eleven blank minutes now recovered. Present in setup and closure; middle development is implicit.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to merge parallel timelines" is dramatized through Mara's discovery ("the timelines wanted to merge"), her immediate choice to radio the other Maras, and her coordinated humming of the interval. Friction exists between the risk (what does merging cost?) and the necessity (the ferry and city are fracturing). The desire drives the resolution and appears in the closure (the city is "stitched from many," timelines braid cleanly). Cost is visible (the city changes, the hourglass glows permanently). Present in setup, middle choice, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" is embodied throughout: Mara's job is routine yet the ferry keeps vanishing; the crossing is repeated nightly yet erasable; the hourglass now glows "permanent as a heartbeat, transient as a crossing." Tone modulates from matter-of-fact opening (coiling ropes, wiping cleats) through eerie escalation (clocks run sideways, grotto descent) to charged resolution (quiet return, glowing hourglass). The final image—ferry arriving on schedule, Mara ready to coil ropes again—charges the tone with both permanence (she will keep showing up) and transience (each crossing is a new miracle). Coherent and purposeful.</comment>
