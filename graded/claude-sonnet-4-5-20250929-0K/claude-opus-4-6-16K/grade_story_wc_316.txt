<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's emotional numbness is established concretely through action ("the wind that raked across the dojo's exposed platform" she cannot feel), and the sparring creates embodied progression from cold precision to tears. However, the eleven-minute death feels like convenient backstory rather than lived contradiction, and Kael-2's warm certainty reads slightly stock against Kael's flatness. The final choice—mutual acceptance rather than custody battle—arrives quickly after hours of sparring summarized in one paragraph, undercutting the earned transformation the premise promised.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece holds a Causal lens: Kael climbs to defeat numbness → encounters her clone → they spar with complementary techniques → mutual teaching produces dual transformation and shared custody. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (both women altered, daughter gains two mothers), and the cost is legible: Kael-2 renounces the custody claim, Kael regains feeling, both forfeit singularity. The Orientation Test passes (Kael, floating dojo, present tense anchored by ~40 words), but the sparring sequence compresses "hours" into summary, creating mild ellipsis debt that slightly weakens the causal chain at the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating dojo over "the space between tectonic memories" supplies vivid, purpose-driven surrealism, and the brain-in-jar becomes a concrete anchor for the duplicate premise. The dojo drifts "through strata of deep time, passing through eras" during the fight, charging the setting with thematic recursion around rewriting and forgetting. Spatial choreography remains clear (rope ladder, platform edge, glass cylinder on wooden rack), and the final burial of the brain in the rock closes the loop with cost, making the setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Kael seeking to vivify her interior life—is signaled early and tightens when Kael-2 demands custody, raising external and internal costs. The sparring functions as complementary teaching rather than zero-sum combat, which suits the theme but mutes antagonistic pressure; the turn from "she wants custody" to "I don't want your life" happens off-page during the summarized hours. One meaningful deepening occurs (Kael feels tears, Kael-2 gains calm), but the escalation compresses rather than dramatizes the peak choice, leaving cost visible but not fully tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the complementary-opposites structure: emotion without foundation versus foundation without emotion, history rewriting itself as metaphor for identity reconstruction. The burial of the labeled brain and the line "There was no original. There was no copy" offer a non-literal answer to the custody question without moralizing. The final image—Kael feeling the wind "cold, alive, indifferent, beautiful"—resonates as earned particularity. Minor slip: "undeniably real" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic declaration where the sensory image alone would suffice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds Kael's focalization cleanly with no head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure ("the wind that raked… as she pulled herself over the edge" embodies the numbness concretely). Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and distinct: Shen's blunt "She wants custody of your life" versus Kael-2's warm certainty. The prose rhythm modulates from detached precision early to embodied sensation at closure ("let it vivify her, let it reach into the hollow place"). One minor register slip: "complementary opposites" recurs in both narration and Shen's speech, flattening voice distinction slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Opening and closing images are strong ("floating rock dojo hung suspended over nothing" / "hands that finally felt like her own"), and information density is high throughout. However, the sparring paragraph compresses hours into summary ("They fought for hours… slowly, something shifted") with template cadence and stock intensifiers ("raw emotion, screaming, weeping, laughing mid-strike" stacks modifiers without embodied specificity), costing −0.5. The phrase "watercolor of a woman rather than the woman herself" is vivid but borders on writerly flourish. No paraphrase loops or fatal artifacts, but the compression at the climactic beat dulls propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of ego-death numbness, clone custody dispute, and martial-arts teaching through "complementary opposites" feels specific and non-obvious; the floating dojo adrift through geological time layers conceptual ambition onto the premise. The transformation of the custody battle into mutual completion rather than winner-take-all offers a fresh turn. Risk: the surreal setting and speculative clone premise demand high execution, which the piece largely delivers. Minor deduction for the "history rewrites itself" metaphor, which announces its thematic work slightly too overtly in the opening and timeframe element.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael (ego death survivor) drives the inciting climb, accepts the sparring challenge, and her final choice to share custody with Kael-2 closes the arc. Her numbness shapes perception throughout ("stomach did not drop, because her stomach no longer dropped"), and the tears at dawn mark visible transformation. The element appears in setup, middle sparring, and closure, with cost (forfeiture of singularity, acceptance of duality). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; no swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The brain in the jar appears early (setup), Shen gestures to it to establish the duplicate premise (one beat), and it is buried in the dojo rock at closure (second beat, reweighted as symbolic erasure of original/copy binary). The element enables the custody logic but does not constrain a middle choice—it remains evidence rather than tool. Two-beat involvement and closure participation qualify it for mid-6s, but limited causal pressure and no tactile handling beyond the burial cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The clone custody battle is the core premise: it creates the inciting conflict, Shen's arbitration, and the sparring stakes. Kael-2's custody claim drives the middle confrontation, and the resolution (shared custody, dual motherhood) directly answers the premise with visible cost. The concept shapes tactics (complementary sparring instead of combat) and the ending's moral calculus. All three gates met; high causal pressure; irreplaceable. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Shen "slices through pretense the way other masters sliced through bamboo—clean, without apology," and his blunt framing ("She wants custody of your life") drives the confrontation. The attribute appears in setup, structures the middle (no false comfort), and the burial ritual at closure reflects his continued directness. The trait enables honest stakes but does not constrain a protagonist choice with visible tradeoff—score trends toward beat involvement and closure participation rather than cost-driving irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Vivify" is the stated goal ("come here to defeat the emotional numbness, to vivify whatever remained"), the sparring literally transfers voltage ("Each blow Kael-2 landed carried feeling into Kael's body like voltage"), and the closure image completes it: "let it vivify her, let it reach into the hollow place." The action appears in all three gates, drives causality (without vivification, no transformation), and the final reprise charges the ending. Indispensable; high specificity; no swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("through complementary opposites, you will find what was divided"), demonstrated in the sparring mechanics (Kael-2's emotion vs. Kael's precision teaching each other), and fulfills the closure (both become whole). The method is not merely thematic—it structures the fight's tactics and the resulting transformation. All three gates; strong causal pressure; the resolution depends on this exact approach. Minor deduction: Shen announces the method overtly rather than letting the reader infer it fully from the sparring choreography.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The floating dojo over tectonic forgetting and the drift "through strata of deep time" supply both literal setting and thematic metaphor. The rope ladder (entry), platform edge (exit), and surreal temporal flux during the fight create pressure and symbolism. The burial of the brain "in the rock of the dojo, returning the duplicate to the earth that was busy forgetting and remembering itself" closes the loop. Strong setup, middle atmosphere, and closure charge; the setting is indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("history rewrites itself") is introduced early as metaphor and enacted during the sparring ("the rock dojo drifted through strata of deep time… dinosaur bones surfacing and dissolving"). It charges the thematic question of identity reconstruction but does not tighten a tactical choice or impose a deadline. The element appears in setup and middle but functions primarily as atmospheric reinforcement rather than causal constraint. Two gates; limited pressure on protagonist decisions; lyric reprise lifts it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to defeat emotional numbness drives the inciting climb, is tested by the custody confrontation and sparring, and resolves in the closure tears and felt wind. The desire is embodied throughout (e.g., "Everything felt like it belonged to someone else now"), and the final line ("hands that finally felt like her own") completes the arc with visible cost (acceptance of duality). All three gates; high causal pressure; irreplaceability. The motivation is the spine of the story.</comment>
