<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivations are embodied through concrete action—kneeling among trees, threading the nut with her teeth, descending the cliff—and her internal contradiction (hating the place yet staying) drives choice under pressure. The final renunciation (not introducing herself, pointing toward the valley) feels earned by prior causality. Minor slips: emotional interiority occasionally skews toward label ("mechanical focus of someone who had done this seven times before") rather than embodied perception, but the protagonist's values remain legible through micro-choices and the curse constraint shapes her tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis: Maren completes twelve of fourteen points, shouts the final directions herself, and returns to "her terrible, necessary trees"—a refusal that forecloses escape with visible cost (continuing the curse). Causality is clean: grandmother's death → blueprint → timed descent → partial success → voice substitution. The inferred lens is Causal with situational pressure (frost deadline), held throughout. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph without delay.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cliffside setting constrains every choice: iron ladder, resonance points, frost sealing stone, mechanical birds tracking movement. The guide-frame (oak, bone, funnel, iron nut) acts as micro-setting and the nut threaded with teeth charges urgency. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("air tasted of coming ice," "white fingers closing"). The labyrinth's acoustics and the orchard's sideways trees are integrated into Maren's tactics and the final image ("graceless beauty of survival on a frozen cliff at dusk").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the family before frost seals the resonance points—is signaled early and tightens through escalation: seventh point brings crying child closer, eleventh brings shaking arms, twelfth precedes frost, thirteenth freezes. Agency is visible: Maren chooses to descend, adapts when the thirteenth membrane fails, substitutes her own voice. The cost is legible (twelve points "would have to be enough," her flawed voice doing what the blueprint could not) and the final choice to return to the orchard forecloses freedom with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: grudging caretaking, curse as compulsion, partial success forcing improvisation, and the choice to remain. The final image—"graceless beauty of survival on a frozen cliff at dusk"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The blueprint motif accumulates meaning (grandmother's theory, Maren's practice, incompletion forcing voice) and charges closure. Minor slip: "terrible, necessary trees" edges toward overt thematic labeling in the final line, though the context earns it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "dust held together by stubbornness," "desperation makes things functional," "graceless, ugly, functional." Diction remains character-specific (no register drift) and syntactic rhythm modulates with pressure (shorter clauses during descent, longer during reflection). The single brief use of free indirect style ("Twelve would have to be enough") is clean. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at peak moments (threading the nut, frost creeping) without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops, high information density, and propulsion sustained throughout. Figurative language is controlled: "stone fruit," "white fingers closing," "arthritic fingers" are concrete and purposeful. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph structure supports scene momentum. The opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor note: "offhandedly exact in its rotations, as though precision were an afterthought it happened to achieve" carries slight conceptual muddle (precision as afterthought yet achieved) but does not obscure the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of cursed orchard, mechanical labyrinth, and acoustic resonance technology feels specific and non-obvious. The "leaving impressions without touching" constraint and the grandmother's unbuilt blueprint are fresh inflections on the reluctant-caretaker frame. However, the core emotional arc—grudging duty, partial success, return to burden—follows a recognizable template. The mechanical birds and stone-fruit trees add texture but do not fundamentally transform the underlying sacrifice-and-endurance structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren's reluctance and caretaking drive every beat: she hates the place, stays anyway, descends with the guide-frame, adapts when the thirteenth point freezes, substitutes her voice, and returns to the orchard. The character's choices create all major turns and the final image ("turned back to her terrible, necessary trees") charges closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is unmistakable; cost is visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The iron nut appears in assembly ("threaded it with her teeth because her fingers were shaking from cold") and locks the funnel's throat to shape output tone. It appears in two beats (assembly, implicit use during descent) and its function matters (frequency shaping). However, the nut is not reprised at closure and no specific cost ties to it. Setup and development gates met; payoff gate weak. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The forgotten blueprint shapes stakes and tactics throughout: Maren opens the leather case, consults the schematic, follows the fourteen-point network design, and the incompletion (twelve of fourteen) forces vocal substitution. Setup in paragraph five, development across the descent, and payoff when "her own flawed voice doing what the blueprint could not finish" articulates cost. The element is irreplaceable; removing it collapses the rescue logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Offhandedly exact" is illustrated once with the mechanical bird's gear ("spun without apparent power source, offhandedly exact in its rotations, as though precision were an afterthought it happened to achieve"). The attribute colors setting but does not constrain or enable a protagonist choice with cost. It appears early (setup gate met) but lacks development or payoff participation. Functional texture, not causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Assembly structures the entire middle: Maren withdraws components, slots forty-three pieces of oak and bone, builds the guide-frame, threads the nut, and the completed frame enables all twelve resonance-point activations. The action drives escalation and the incomplete assembly (fourteen points called for, twelve achieved) generates the climactic substitution. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; high causal pressure; specific cost (shaking arms, frozen thirteenth membrane).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method (pressing shaped wooden forms against stretched-hide membranes to transfer vibration without touching stone) is signaled early ("the curse forbade it; her skin against labyrinth stone would add her own voice"), demonstrated across descent beats ("pinned the membrane, pressed the frame against it, and felt the stone accept the vibration"), and its constraint forces vocal substitution when the thirteenth membrane freezes. Mechanics shape attempts and payoff; specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth supplies all tactical resources: iron ladder for descent, resonance points targeted in sequence, stone that contracts with frost, mechanical birds tracking movement. The setting pressures every choice (frost deadline, membrane freezing) and charges the final image ("frozen cliff at dusk"). Setup, development, and payoff gates met; the labyrinth is inseparable from rescue logic and closure stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The frost timeframe tightens decisions throughout: "frost would come tonight," "hours, maybe less," eleventh point brings shaking arms and "air tasted of coming ice," twelfth completes before "frost crept across the stone like white fingers closing," thirteenth freezes. The clock is live, tracked, and alters moves (forcing vocal substitution). Setup at paragraph eight, development across descent, payoff at thirteenth point.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation (guide lost travelers) is dramatized through action: Maren sees the family enter, tracks their fading shouts, retrieves the blueprint, descends, activates twelve points, shouts final directions, and leads them up. Friction is visible (she "hated the place" yet "stayed anyway because people kept stumbling in") and the cost—returning to "her terrible, necessary trees"—forecloses escape. Desire and conflict shape all choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Graceless beauty operates as coherent tone throughout: "arthritic fingers," "desperation makes things functional," "ugly, functional," "offhandedly exact," bleeding fingers, and the closing phrase "graceless beauty of survival on a frozen cliff at dusk." Tone charges the final image and modulates with pressure (clinical during assembly, urgent during descent, resigned at closure). The exact phrase appears only at the end but the texture saturates every beat.</comment>
