<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular—her gift announces itself through hidden scripts, the lens fragment becomes a second heartbeat. Internal contradiction appears in her methodical translation work versus the pull of intuitive anchors ("elusively tangible...something caught between"). The final choice to continue seeking murals is earned by prior causality, though the cost remains implicit rather than viscerally embodied. Minor slip: "anchors of intuition" risks label-speak but is immediately grounded in sensory terms.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story deepens through density increase—childhood gift, grandmother's salvage, Oshi's death, the mural's revelation—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Maren writes the translation onto canvases, crystallizing her role as keeper of erased histories. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (market, Maren, translator). Cost is conceptual and felt: she inherits the burden of testimony, walking "back through" forgettings with "more murals to find." The lens holds; the closure reweights the opening image of the market as a living archive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The alchemist's market—suspended on cables, swaying planks, glass-bead canopy—constrains Maren's physical movement and charges the final image of her walking westward on high planks. The lens fragment is handled twice (pocket presence, pressed to eye) and becomes a tool that enables the climactic translation. Micro-setting details (paint dealer's booth, canvases over the mural) shape the unfolding action. The market's verticality and ephemerality mirror the theme of overlooked histories "strung on cables." Sensory selection is purposeful: clove smoke, creaking wood, refracted light through glass beads.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: honoring erased histories by translating hidden scripts. Pressure accumulates through the pull of intuitive anchors, Oshi's death, and the mural's fading pigment. The tightening occurs when Maren unfastens canvases and translates aloud, an act that forecloses passivity—she cannot unknow what she reads. Agency is clear: her decision to write the translation onto the dealer's canvases ensures the testimony survives. Cost is visible in the final image: she carries the lens fragment's "old light into the new work," accepting a perpetual burden. No antagonist is required; the city's forgetfulness provides sufficient pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—recovery of erased histories and the cost of witnessing—emerges organically from Maren's translation work, the demolished lighthouse, and the lamplighters' guild dissolved by authorities. The lens fragment and mural function as recurring images that shift meaning: childhood wonder becomes adult responsibility. The final image of Maren walking westward with "more murals to find" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor the overlooked without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Oshi's silence (dead, testimony hidden), the paint dealer's shrug (strange things are commerce), and the city's "enormous and forgetful" sprawl below. The piece resists tidy closure; the work is perpetual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during translation, wider for market description). Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices hidden scripts, lens fragments, the "elusively tangible" pull of intuition. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon—translator, threshold work, passages between worlds—without corporate register intrusions. The single line of dialogue ("a moment alone with the east wall") is naturalistic and goal-driven. Prose rhythm reflects Maren's methodical attention: longer sentences for reflection, shorter beats during the translation climax. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively; information density is high ("the lighthouse lens fragment...pressed against her hip like a second heartbeat"). Clarity and momentum are maintained throughout. Minor loop: "The anchors of intuition were already pulling her" in the penultimate paragraph slightly echoes earlier phrasing about intuitive anchors, though the shift from past to present action justifies the reprise. Figurative language (suspended lanterns, pressed fingerprints, curtain-leaning) is coherent and sparse. No template cadence or paraphrase loops. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Zero grammatical errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of between-worlds translation, alchemist's market, and lighthouse-keeper lineage feels specific and non-obvious. The lens fragment as inherited tool and the mural-as-testimony avoid stock urban-fantasy tropes through grounded detail (tea stall, paint dealer's booth, clove smoke). Transformation test passes: the emotional arc is inseparable from this exact setting and premise. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative structure and quiet ending trust the reader to feel cost without melodrama. Freshness comes from the specificity of the lamplighters' guild and Maren's methodical, solitary work rather than a confrontation. Slightly derivative in the "hidden magical lineage" frame, but the occupational detail (translator, threshold maintenance) personalizes it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's identity as between-worlds translator is seeded early (paragraph 2), shapes her decision to climb to Oshi's stall (middle beat), and drives the climactic translation that honors the lamplighters' names. Her choices—asking the dealer to leave, unfastening canvases, translating aloud, writing on the dealer's canvases—create the story's key turns. The role is indispensable: without her ability to read the script, the testimony remains hidden. Cost is visible: she accepts perpetual work walking "back through" forgettings. Causal pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens fragment appears in three beats: carried in her pocket (early signal), pressed to her eye to sharpen the script (climactic use), and pocketed again at the end with its "old light" warming her hip (charged reprise). Its specific property—refracting hidden text into legibility—is irreplaceable and enables the translation. The object links Maren to her grandmother's lineage and the demolished harbor light, reweighting the opening image at closure. Strong integration; only minor deduction for the middle beat being a single extended use rather than two distinct moments.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Anchors of intuition are seeded early ("elusively tangible...pressure change before a storm") and drive Maren's decision to climb to the upper tier. The concept shapes her tactics: she follows the pull rather than systematic search. At closure, "anchors of intuition were already pulling her toward the next wall" reinforces the perpetual nature of her work. The concept is more than thematic—it alters her choices—but lacks a specific on-page cost tied to following (or resisting) an anchor. Solid integration across setup, development, and payoff, but the mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Elusively tangible" is illustrated through the anchors of intuition ("not quite thoughts, not quite sensations, but something caught between"). The attribute constrains Maren's perception: she feels the mural's pull for weeks before acting. However, no visible cost or tradeoff arises from the attribute itself—she follows the pull without friction or error. The trait enriches her interiority but does not enable or prevent a key action with consequence. Present in setup and development; lyric reprise at closure. Mid-band for functional but non-decisive integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Unfasten" drives the story's major turn: Maren removes the canvases one by one, revealing the mural beneath. This action is irreplaceable—without it, the script remains hidden. The climactic translation depends on the unfastening, and the decision to write on the unfastened canvases ensures the testimony's survival. The verb is specific and embodied, not swappable with "reveal" or "uncover" without losing the tactile, deliberate quality. Causal pressure is high; closure links directly to this act. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method (reading hidden details in paintings) is seeded at age seven with the tea-stall mural and returns as the climactic mechanism: Maren uses the lens to read script "nested inside the painted clouds." The method shapes her identity and the story's central conflict. However, the mechanics are glimpsed rather than dramatized in multiple attempts—she succeeds on the first try without friction. The method is essential to closure but lacks failed or difficult iterations that would deepen causal pressure. Present across all three gates; solid integration with minor swappability (hidden text could appear in other media).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is anchored early (paragraph 1) and constrains Maren's movement: she climbs the swaying rope ladder, walks suspended planks, navigates the upper tier. The market's verticality and transience charge the final image ("the market creaked and shimmered, an eternal instant strung on cables"). The setting supplies resources (paint dealer's ink, canvases) that enable the climactic act of writing the translation. The market functions as both physical space and thematic container for "things the world discarded." Strong integration; environment actively shapes tactics and the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("between childhood and now") is signaled early and structures the narrative: childhood gift at seven, grandmother's salvage, Oshi's death, present translation work. The span deepens Maren's motivation by establishing a "long corridor of such forgettings." However, time does not tighten on-page decisions—no deadline or clock pressure alters her tactics. The timeframe enriches backstory and theme but remains a backdrop rather than an active constraint. Present in setup and development; contributes to closure via the perpetual nature of her work. Mid-band for structural support without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to honor overlooked histories is dramatized through concrete choices: climbing to the stall, unfastening canvases, translating aloud, writing the testimony so it "would live on both sides of the cloth." Friction appears between the desire to honor and the burden of perpetual work ("more murals to find, more scripts...the next name waiting"). The motivation shapes all three gates and drives the closure image. Cost is visible: she accepts a solitary, endless task. Strong integration; only minor deduction for the motivation being stated rather than entirely inferred from action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone of "eternal instant" is established through the market "strung on cables" and "things the world discarded" finding their way to listeners. The tone modulates subtly: reflective during backstory, focused during the translation, expansive at closure ("the market creaked and shimmered, an eternal instant"). The final image charges the tone by reweighting the market as a timeless archive. However, the tone is more atmospheric than dramatic—it supports the ending but does not intensify under pressure. Coherent across beats; charges the final image without dynamic modulation. Solid integration.</comment>
