<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Margit's interiority is richly embodied through observation, tactile handling of the sea glass, and micro-choices (pocketing the glass, adding her twelve words). The characterization of keepers through their cairns is concrete and character-particular. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between her silence and her need to protect, culminating in the choice to add her own page—a visible cost that forecloses her twenty-three-year maximum. Minor deduction: the backstory percentage is high (~35%), but it anchors in present stimuli (the flickering lamp, Hallgrimsson's injury) and tilts present stance via the decision to write.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through stacked particulars (cairns, the letter chain, the lamp room's weight) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Margit's twelve words and the final image reweight her silent care with conceptual cost (she acknowledges her own burning). The closure lands on the page with felt cost: her admission breaks her rationed silence. One meaningful deepening occurs when she reads the chain by matchlight, which narrows her understanding and changes her stance. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. Cost is legible in the final line's image of quiet burning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lantern room constrains choice: Margit must climb alone, relight the lamp, and the accumulated weight of prior keepers charges her realization. The sea glass, stones, and Atlantic breathing are concrete, recurring, and charged at closure. Spatial choreography is coherent (dock, stairs, lantern room, descent). The micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) qualifies and directly shapes the final image. Minor deduction: some sensory detail is visual-dominant without urgent filter, but the piece's reflective mode justifies the balance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Margit's drive to protect and bottle safety, tested when the lamp fails and she discovers the chain. One meaningful tightening: her solitary climb and the match-by-match reading force a choice to break her silence. Agency is clear in her decision to add twelve words, a renunciation of her twenty-three-year rule with visible cost. Escalation reads under the Accumulative lens as density increase and cadence shift. The cost is legible: she exposes her own need and "burns so quietly" becomes undeniable at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the cairns, the letter chain, the lamp's rotation, the sea glass. The central question—what does it mean to carry and protect light—is answered non-literally in the final image of Margit burning quietly, her twelve words reweighting all prior silent care. The piece resists tidy morals; the keepers' confessions and Margit's admission are earned through concrete experience (Solveig's death, Hallgrimsson's fall, the lamp's flicker). The ending offers resonance without stating a thesis. No thematic echo detected; the final line charges rather than explicates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: Margit reads cairns "the way a warmly observant mother reads the architecture of a child's silence." Diction is controlled and purposeful ("luminescent ache," "reticent by nature and by necessity"). The prose modulates under pressure (short clauses during the match-lighting). Free indirect style is clean. The final line's compression ("burning so quietly") is voice-consistent and charges the closure. No head-hopping, no filter stacks in peak beats. Minor deduction: a few passive constructions in the backstory ("had been trying") could be stronger, but they serve the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or theme. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates (longer reflective sentences, clipped action). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The opening line anchors voice and stakes; the final line recharges the burning motif. Strategic telling compresses twenty-three years efficiently. Minor deduction: one phrase borders on elevated diction ("luminescent ache between them"), but it's voice-motivated and appears once, earning its place. No line-level artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of reticent skipper, cairn language, and anonymous letter chain feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of Solveig's sea glass into a token that threads the chain and returns at closure is earned in hindsight. Emotional specificity (the "warmly observant mother" simile, the matchlight reading) avoids generic templates. The premise could risk sentimentality, but the piece commits fully and follows its implications without retreat. The final image—Margit burning quietly, legible only to the keepers—is a fresh inflection on the light-as-care theme. Risk-taking in the reflective density and quiet closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margit is present throughout. Her reticence shapes early beats (the eleven-word maximum, silent observation). Her choice to pocket the sea glass, pass it on, climb the stairs alone, relight the lamp, and add twelve words creates key turns. The final decision to write—one word over her maximum—alters tactics (she joins the chain she unknowingly carried) and is causally active at closure. Specificity: her skipper role and rationed speech are irreplaceable. Setup by first paragraph, middle development (climbing, reading), and closure participation (her twelve words, the stones she stacks) all present. Cost: she exposes her own need.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sea glass appears in three beats: Solveig's cairn (pocketed), left at Skardvik with the note, and returned atop Margit's page at closure. It shifts meaning: from Solveig's loneliness to a token of the chain to a weight holding Margit's admission. Causal pressure: its journey enables the letter chain's start. Closure linkage: it appears in the final interior scene, charging Margit's words. Specificity: "milky green of a held breath" is irreplaceable. Minor deduction: the glass is not handled on the page in the middle beat, only recounted; dramatized handling would reach higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain shapes stakes (it gives the keepers' feeling a voice) and alters Margit's tactics (she reads it by matchlight, which prompts her decision to add her own page). It is introduced late (roughly 40% mark) but quickly becomes causal. Setup is delayed; middle development is strong (the discovery scene); closure participation is clear (she adds to the chain, reweighting her silent care). Cost: the chain exposes the vulnerability she sought to protect. Minor deduction: late arrival and the chain's mechanics (how it threads) are told rather than shown; earlier signal would elevate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" enables on-page action: Margit reads the cairns without asking, pockets the sea glass, leaves apricots, and ultimately adds her page after reading the chain by matchlight. The trait is embodied in her perceptual filter (the "architecture of a child's silence" simile) and constrains her choice (she cannot ignore what she sees). Cost: her observation compels her to break silence. Setup by first paragraph, middle development (the discovery), and closure participation (her twelve words result from seeing the chain). Specificity: the trait is indispensable to her choice. Minor deduction: the phrase "warmly observant" appears once as a label; more beats showing the observation in varied contexts would reach higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Protect" drives multiple beats: Margit's rationed words and punctual arrivals, her climb to relight the lamp, her realization that she has been "trying to protect them" and "bottle the feeling of safety." The action is not a single event but a sustained motive tested at closure when she chooses to expose her own need by writing. Cost: protection gave way to participation. Setup by first third, middle development (the lamp-relighting, the discovery), and closure participation (her admission redefines protection as shared vulnerability). Specificity: the action is core to theme and irreplaceable. Minor deduction: the protect motive is largely reflected rather than enacted in discrete, varied scenes; stronger if tested through multiple on-page refusals or choices.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stone-stacking is introduced early (first paragraph), recurs (Einarsson's three stones, Solveig's column), and shapes tactics: Margit reads the cairns to know what to bring. Mechanics matter: tilt and number convey specific needs. Closure participation: she stacks three stones tilted east before leaving, mirroring Einarsson and signaling continuity. The method is causally active in her observational practice. Minor deduction: the method does not constrain a difficult choice or escalate under pressure; it remains a consistent tool rather than a contested one. Specificity is high (the detail of tilt and shell is irreplaceable). Setup, development, and closure all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lantern room pressures choice: Margit climbs alone after the lamp flickers out, the darkness and "accumulated weight" force her match-by-match reading, and the room's haunting charges her realization. The setting supplies the lens mechanism behind which the letter chain is pinned, and the act of relighting the lamp is both practical and symbolic closure. Spatial choreography is clear (stairs, lantern room, brass fittings, glass panes). The room's constraint is felt: without it, the discovery and the relighting would not cohere. Setup by ~50%, middle development (the climb and reading), and closure participation (she relights the lamp). Minor deduction: the room does not recur across multiple beats or force a second constraint; one strong pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the lamp flickers out" anchors the discovery scene and tightens urgency: Margit must relight the lamp while Hallgrimsson bleeds below. The flicker is introduced at the scene break (~45%) and creates a live clock for the climb, reading, and relighting. The time constraint alters tactics (she reads by match, a consumption of limited resource). Closure: the lamp is relit before dawn, and the temporal arc (night to gray morning) frames the final image. Minor deduction: the clock is not tracked beat-by-beat; the match count implies urgency but elapsed minutes are vague. Setup delayed, middle development strong, closure present. Swappability moderate (another emergency could serve, but the lamp flicker ties to theme).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Margit's desire "to bottle the feeling of safety" is dramatized in her punctual arrivals, provision adjustments, and the realization scene where she sees what she "had been trying" to do. The motive is tested when she discovers the letter chain gave voice to what her silence could not, prompting her to write. Cost: she admits her own need, breaking the bottling impulse. Setup by first third (implicit in her care), middle development (the realization while reading), and closure participation (her twelve words enact the shift from bottling to sharing). Minor deduction: the motive is largely told in reflection ("she had been trying to bottle") rather than shown through multiple on-page refusals or micro-choices. Friction between want and cost is clear at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: the opening is spare and observational, the discovery scene intensifies with sensory clauses and shorter beats, and the closure sustains the "luminescent ache" in the final image of quiet burning. The phrase "luminescent ache between them, the color of sea glass held to the sun" appears once, earning its resonance. The tone charges the final image: Margit "burning so quietly" unites the ache, the light, and the cost. Diction (reticent, murmured, flung, aflame) supports the tone without static repetition. Minor deduction: one elevated phrase ("luminescent ache") borders on ornament, but it is voice-motivated and purposeful. Setup, development, and closure all present.</comment>
