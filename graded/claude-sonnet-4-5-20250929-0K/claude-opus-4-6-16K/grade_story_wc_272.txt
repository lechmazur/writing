<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradictions are richly embodied—grief has "redesigned her perception," and she draws "the way loss had taught her to see." The shift from attempting accurate portraits to mapping distances between features demonstrates earned agency through renunciation. The arc from "emotionally vacant" work to luminous strangeness tracks causally through her wilful descent into fragmentation. Minor deduction: the final self-portrait moment feels slightly under-dramatized given its pivotal role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the box that "could no longer close" becomes acceptance of fracture as data, not damage, with visible cost in the permanent openness. The accumulative/textural lens holds from the opening climb through thread-mapping to the final descent, each beat deepening perception rather than reversing plot. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, library, three months post-failure) arrive by line 8. One micro-deduction: the "redesign everything" transition could be more concrete in its first step.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse's round salt-warped library constrains and charges every choice—its middle chamber houses both isolation and transformation, its spiral stairs frame entry and exit with ritual weight. The broken tarot box's unsnapped hinges and frayed velvet threads become the literal method, not mere ornament. The closing-in walls shift from confinement to "concentration—the way a lens focuses light," a micro-setting reversal that anchors the final image. Sensory specificity is lean but apt: "low and bronze" light, salt damage, nerve-ending threads.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering honest vision after critical failure) signals early and tightens through the thread-mapping discovery that "fragmentation wasn't damage. It was data." The escalation is textural and knowledge-based: she moves from circling "necessary darkness" to deliberately sitting with painful separateness, a renunciation with clear cost. The choice to draw from distances rather than features narrows her old method and forecloses return. Agency is renunciation and redesign; the portraits that "looked like no one and everyone" complete the arc with visible transformation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—fragmentation as fidelity, not failure—emerges entirely through the tarot box's broken lid, the thread web, and portraits that record grief's warping rather than objective likenesses. The rhetorical questions "hang in the air, vibrate, rearrange the silence," performing the work rather than stating it. The final image of an uncloseable container holding open fractures answers the opening's "someone still depended on the light" without moralizing: she becomes the lighthouse, guiding through acknowledged brokenness. No thematic echo or thesis statement weakens the landing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is vivid and particular: "the grief she carried had redesigned her perception entirely," filtering every observation through loss and artistic failure. Diction remains stable in its lyric register—"luminous," "nerve endings," "weather patterns of tenderness"—without register drift into abstraction. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance contracts appropriately during the thread-work epiphany. The prose reflects Maren's artist mind through precise visual metaphor: "a mirror using only its dust." No head-hopping; POV knowledge remains tightly controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: the opening sentence establishes ritual, abandonment, and Maren's obsessive return. Rhythm modulates well from the compressed backstory block to the slower thread-untangling beat to the propulsive final descent. Minor loop: "fragmented/fragmentation" and "closing/close" recur across adjacent paragraphs without full reweighting, costing ~−0.3. One figurative stretch: "ompressed by guilt" after "stretched by longing" risks formulaic pairing. Otherwise, clarity and concision hold; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of literal craft method (thread-mapping portraiture) with psychological descent transforms the "failed artist in lighthouse" premise through specificity. The insight that wrong proportions record how loss teaches seeing, not incompetence, offers a non-obvious emotional calculus. The broken tarot box as both container and conceptual anchor avoids symbolic convenience by threading through all acts. Risk: the accumulative/lyric structure and rhetorical-question frame could flatten in lesser hands but here charge the closure without gimmickry. Slight deduction for the gallery-failure inciting beat reading somewhat familiar.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices—claiming the library, untangling threads, redesigning her method, descending with the box—drive every major turn. Her crestfallen state (post-failure, grief-warped) motivates the initial retreat and the willingness to "descend into necessary darkness." The final choice to carry the open box without closing it demonstrates agency with visible cost. Setup early (paragraph 3 names the failed show); developed through thread-work (middle); payoff in the descent bearing transformed work. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The broken tarot box appears in paragraph 2, houses the wrong portraits, supplies the literal threads for mapping (paragraph 5), and returns in the final two paragraphs as the uncloseable container she carries. Its hinges-snapped, velvet-frayed state becomes both method and metaphor without forced symbolism. The box's inability to close shifts from damage to rightness ("A container that could not contain"), reweighting prior material. Three distinct beats (introduction, thread harvest, closure image) with rising integration and a charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fragmented reality shapes the core problem (portraits with "gentle wrongness," proportions drifting from truth) and the solution (drawing distances between features, accepting painful separateness). The concept is dramatized through the thread-web that reveals "fragmentation wasn't damage. It was data," altering Maren's tactics from memory-drawing to relational mapping. It participates in closure when the broken box's openness becomes affirmation. Not merely thematic echo; it changes method and options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhetorical questions anchor paragraph 4 explicitly ("questions she asked aloud while she worked") and perform thematic work: they "hang in the air, vibrate, rearrange the silence." The attribute constrains her process—she does not want answers, only bearable rearrangement—and returns in the final line when the sea "asked its own rhetorical questions" and she walks "without answering a single one." Two beats with purposeful reprise, but the second mention risks ornamental echo rather than tactical constraint. Mid-band for functional return without cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Redesign" is signaled in paragraph 6 ("She began to redesign everything"), enacted through the shift from memory-drawing to thread-distance mapping, and completed in the new portraits that "looked like weather patterns, like topographic maps of tenderness." The action redefines her entire approach and produces the final self-portrait placed in the box. It is causally irreplaceable: substituting "rethink" or "restart" would not capture the systematic overhaul. Three beats (decision, method change, completion) with strong closure participation and visible transformation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Untangling threads is introduced in paragraph 5 ("she began by untangling them one evening"), physically enacted (separating, pinning to wall, connecting portraits), and yields the epiphany that fragmentation is data. The method's mechanics matter: she draws "from the threads—from the web of connections…from the distances between features rather than the features themselves." Setup, development (middle web-building), and payoff (new drawing method) across three beats. Strong causal work, though the final descent does not revisit the threads explicitly, costing slight closure-linkage points.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the lighthouse is established early (paragraph 3), supplies isolation and the round walls that shift meaning from confinement to concentration, and houses the thread-pinning that could not occur elsewhere. The salt-warped books and peeling walls anchor sensory detail; the middle chamber's geometry (round, floor-to-ceiling) matters for the web installation. The closing image reconfigures the walls' pressure into a lens focusing light. Three beats with spatial constraint shaping tactics and charging the final metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" frames the inciting crisis (paragraph 3: reviews prompt "the walls close in…with crushing specificity") and returns at closure when "the closing-in had changed meaning…not confinement now. It was concentration." The timeframe operates as psychological pressure more than a ticking clock, but it tightens decisions by marking the shift from gallery failure to lighthouse claiming to thread-work breakthrough. Two-beat reprise with reweighted meaning, though the middle development is more atmospheric than tactical. Solid lyric use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "descend into necessary darkness" is named in paragraph 6, dramatized as "a willingness to sit with the fragmented reality…to stop reconciling the two and instead let them exist in their painful separateness," and enacted through the redesign process. The cost is visible: she abandons the pursuit of accurate memory-portraits and accepts permanent brokenness (the uncloseable box). Friction between the desire for honest vision and the pain of renouncing wholeness drives the arc. Three beats with strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Luminescent ache saturates the prose from the opening ("someone still depended on the light") through "the ache in her chest had grown luminous, almost beautiful in its persistence" to portraits that "looked like weather patterns…like what a voice sounds like when it cracks." The tone modulates with pressure—compressed in the failure recap, expansive during thread-work discovery, resolute in the final descent—without breaking coherence. The oxymoron (light/pain) charges every major image and lands cleanly in the lens-focused-light closure metaphor. Exceptional tonal control.</comment>
