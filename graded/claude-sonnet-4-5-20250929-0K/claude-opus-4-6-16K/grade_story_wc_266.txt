<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is consistently particularized through concrete images (white knuckles, the frayed leash as question). Her shift from holding on to letting go is earned through the guides' pressure and accumulates credibly. The backstory layering ("the dog, but she also meant her father...") successfully anchors reflection in the present stimulus without flattening momentum. Minor slip: the courage-waiting insight edges toward stated theme rather than fully embodied contradiction in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): Maren wades into the water and inhabits the vigil, forgoing forward motion with visible emotional cost ("forgiveness she had never thought to ask for"). The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early through layered star-punch motifs and holds through the final image. Causality coheres via the guides' actions opening passages and Maren's micro-choices (letting go the leash, stepping forward). The cost is felt in the relinquishment of control and the acceptance of waiting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ridgeway's indirect spine, star-shaped windows in fog, and the shoreline with drifting lights all constrain movement and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the veiled setting. The ticket punch becomes a tactile anchor that enables passage. Twilight as perpetual vigil functions as micro-setting that reweights the dominant stake of courage-waiting, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early and tightens through the ridgeway traverse. The woman's initial observation ("holding something that isn't holding you") forces Maren's first renunciation (dropping the leash), and the final wade into water is a second meaningful deepening that forecloses retreat. The cost is legible: she trades control for presence, agency for vigil. One clear tightening and one deepening meet the lens requirement; persistent twilight and indirect routes function as constraints shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—courage as waiting rather than acting—emerges organically from the star-punched passages and shoreline lights without explicit moralizing. The leash/courage metaphor shifts meaning from opening to closure, satisfying the 9+ test: the final image (wading in, letting the shoreline lullaby wash over her) offers a resonant answer to "where unused courage waits" without stating a thesis. The twilight vigil and star-shaped lights create layered subtext. No therapy-speak or prompt-echo in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Maren's noticing filters through loss and hesitation. Diction is consistently lyric and concrete ("oilskin coats the color of wet stone," "fog itself had decided to take shape"). The guides' dialogue carries subtext and drives action without exposition. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider observation at the shoreline. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; voice control under emotional pressure is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings and lengths create visual flow. Information density is high (most lines advance image and stake). Minor loop: "star-shaped" recurs frequently but serves pattern-building rather than churn. The final paragraph's repetition ("Somewhere behind...Somewhere ahead") is purposeful cadence, not scaffold. One small slip: "the woman said, nodding" then "the man said" in quick succession edges toward template dialogue tags, but surrounding prose maintains texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The vigil-in-twilight premise and star-punch passages offer a fresh synthesis of psychopomp and courage-as-waiting themes. The specific particularization (ticket punch mechanics, heather and limestone ridgeway, shoreline lullaby) lifts the material above abstraction. Risk is evident in the slow accumulation and quiet ending, which could flatten but instead charges through consistent image layering. The transformation test passes: swapping names and setting would lose the ridgeway's indirect-route logic and the star-window mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guides appear early (setup), make decisions that alter Maren's path by punching passages open (middle development), and their lanterns dim as Maren steps forward at closure (payoff). Their choices—when and where to punch, what to say—shape Maren's trajectory. They enable rather than drive, but their enabling is causally specific: no punch, no passage. Present in all three gates with moderate causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ticket punch appears early and is used three times on-page to open passages, each with escalating meaning. It returns in the final punch "before Maren's chest," which "felt it open something inside her"—a charged reprise that reweights the object from tool to key. Causal pressure is strong: the punch enables traversal and the final interior opening. High irreplaceability (star stamp creates the drifting lights motif). All three gates met with closure linkage and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The vigil-in-twilight is established early ("twilight held...a vigil in twilight, an hour that did not pass"), constrains choices by suspending forward time, and shapes the closure: Maren "keeping vigil with the tide" in the final beat. It redefines stakes from linear progress to inhabiting stillness. Causal pressure: the perpetual twilight removes escape-by-waiting and forces stance. Present in setup, middle constraint, and closure crystallization. Cost is conceptual: renouncing forward motion.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is embodied in the guides' method ("the passage opened again, gently persistent, the way water finds its way through rock") and recurs as Maren's own stance at closure ("patient as stone, gentle as light"). It constrains approach: no force, only repeated star-punches. Visible in two beats (ridgeway traversal and final wading) with thematic repricing at the end. All three gates met, though causal pressure is moderate (it shapes method more than pivotal choice). Cost connection is present but oblique.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Traverse is the dominant action: the guides and Maren traverse the ridgeway through multiple beats, and the act of traversing (walking the switchbacks, passing through punched windows) drives all middle escalation. Closure hinges on Maren completing the traverse by stepping into the water. High irreplaceability: removing traverse removes the story's spine. Present in setup, multiple middle beats, and closure. Strong causal pressure and beat involvement (≥3 beats). Cost is built into the journey's renunciation of direct paths.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is signaled early ("the ridgeway did not permit straight lines"), enacted in the middle ("around standing stones and along sheep trails that spiraled inward"), and reflected in closure ("she had been closed so long she had forgotten it was a door"—indirection as interior method). The mechanics matter: indirect routes delay and test, forcing Maren to accept non-linear progress. All three gates met with causal pressure (shapes traversal tactics). Swappability is low; direct routes would undercut the courage-waiting theme.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway is established immediately, supplies obstacles (mist, doubling paths) and resources (heather, limestone, the shoreline below), and appears in the closure turn (shoreline as destination). It constrains movement and choice throughout: fog requires the punch, switchbacks force patience. High causal pressure across ≥3 beats. Closure linkage is direct (the ridgeway crests to reveal the shoreline). Irreplaceability is strong; the veiled, indirect setting is load-bearing for the vigil-courage theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the leash breaks" opens the story and frames all action as consequence. The broken leash is Maren's ticket to the ridgeway and the inciting loss. It appears in her reflection midpoint and is reprised at closure ("the leash was broken and she was free"). Present in all three gates. Moderate causal pressure: it enables rather than tightens. Cost is clear (loss of control). Swappability is low; another inciting event would require thematic retooling.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation to find unused courage is stated by the guides early, internalized by Maren in reflection ("I wasn't brave with him"), and fulfilled at closure when she wades in and claims "the courage had been here all along." It drives her choice to follow the guides and her final step into the water. Friction between want (to find courage) and cost (letting go of control) is dramatized. All three gates with strong closure linkage and visible cost. Slightly reduced by the guides' explicit framing rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "shoreline lullaby" tone is seeded early in lyric pacing and soft imagery ("fog...speak kindly," "lantern...burned the soft amber"), sustained through gentle diction in peak beats ("gently persistent," "patient as stone"), and charges the final image ("shoreline lullaby wash over her like forgiveness"). Tone modulates subtly with pressure (the guides' arrival, the ridgeway traverse) without breaking coherence. Strong closure linkage; the lullaby becomes the emotional center of the ending. High irreplaceability: harsher tone would contradict vigil-as-courage.</comment>
