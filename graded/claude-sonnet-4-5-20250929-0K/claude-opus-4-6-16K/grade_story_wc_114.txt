<comment>Sable's interior contradiction is embodied through her relationship with withheld warnings and the fever-weakened body; the smudging of the botanical illustration is a concrete, character-particular micro-choice that externalizes her shift from measuring to accepting ambiguity. Motivation is clear and intensifies toward the final handwritten confession, with visible cost (the stone becoming something carried "in daylight, in the open"). The renunciation—accepting that the truth won't "sit on a scale"—is earned by prior causality. Minor deduction: the interiority occasionally edges toward therapeutic label-speak ("fault-tolerant," "weather system"), though it remains anchored in meteorological diction.</comment>

<comment>Orientation is anchored promptly (who, where, when by ~80 words); drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with causal underpinning (fever → confession), and the ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: the stone "began—not to dissolve, but to become something she could carry"). The cost is legible in the final image: she writes the confession in the margin, forecloses denial, and accepts the weight "in daylight." One meaningful deepening occurs when the smudge action triggers her realization that certainty "spread, it blurred." The lens holds without contradiction, and the closure lands on the page with felt cost.</comment>

<comment>The mountain weather station constrains Sable's choices (isolation = no escape from memory; instruments = the measuring apparatus she can no longer trust for emotional truth) and charges the final image: she logs data in margins while the mountain "remains," mirroring her endurance. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered (barograph tracing, grey-violet dawn, ink smudge), spatial choreography is clean, and the body is setting-as-tool (her fever-sweat thumb smudges the illustration). The aurora sorrow tone is woven through environment without postcard tourism. The station is micro-setting that alters her capacity to avoid the truth.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (to measure the weight of a swallowed truth) is signaled early and deepens once: the smudge action reveals that certainty cannot be discretely measured, forcing her to write the confession instead. Agency is renunciation with on-page cost: she forecloses denial by writing "I saw it. I said nothing." and accepts the stone as something to carry rather than dissolve. Pressure is accumulative, driven by the fever break and the handling of Ren's illustration; no multiple reversals are required under the Textural lens. The cost is visible and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Theme (the instability of certainty under pressure) emerges organically from the smudge action, the barograph data, and the margins-as-method motif; the final image—confession written in the margin, the mountain indifferent—offers a non-literal answer to "what does carried truth weigh?" without moralizing. The saxifrage bleeding across the page is a concrete particular that reweights the central question. Subtext operates in the silence she keeps, the stone swallowed, and the work she continues. No thematic echo or sermon; the piece resists tidy resolution while delivering resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third limited; perceptual signature is meteorologist-specific (barometric pressure, wind shear, cirrus clouds) and the diction reflects her occupation without becoming Wikipedia-voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during smudge, cooler during instrument logging). The prose rhythm tightens under pressure ("She did not pull her hand away") and breathes in reflection. Minor deduction: one brief filter stack ("seemed to grieve," "began to shift") and a slight register drift ("fault-tolerant," "ungoverned") that reads more corporate than weather-observer, though it remains within plausible interiority for a technical professional.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Clarity and propulsion are strong; information density is high (most lines do two jobs). The opening anchors voice and stakes; the final line recharges the mountain motif with cost. Minor deductions: two paraphrase loops ("The things you were sure of began to shift" / "certainties sway" restates the same idea; "began—not to dissolve, but to become" uses a double negative hedge). One template cadence run in the closure paragraph ("She picked up… She set down… She picked up… She wrote"). These touch the ending third, preventing 9+ eligibility. No figurative muddle or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of meteorological precision and emotional ambiguity is specific and non-obvious; the margins-as-method motif and the smudge action feel organic rather than imposed. The piece avoids the "mountain solitude epiphany" template by grounding the turn in a concrete physical act (smudging ink) and occupational detail (barograph, margins). Risk-taking in the quiet, textural closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation of Ren's illustration from artifact to mirror is earned. Within-band adjustment +0.2 for risk distinction (the open ending trusts image over explanation).</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Sable as "fault-tolerant oracle" appears early and her final choice (writing the confession) is a key turn that forecloses denial. She observes throughout but her agency crystallizes at the smudge and confession beats. Her role as observer is dramatized in flashback ("she had seen the pressure drop") and frames the closure. Two beats shaped by her decisions (smudge, confession), both tied to the ending. Cap at 6.8: the character trait is more dramatized than driven by her protagonist choices; the oracle quality is told and then echoed rather than tested under live pressure in the present scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The botanical illustration is handled in three distinct beats: discovered under the mug, smudged with her thumb (the action that triggers realization), and set down before she writes the confession. It returns with reweighted meaning (from Ren's precision to her acceptance of blur) and charges the final image by contrast (his clean lines vs. her messy margin note). Early signal, causal pressure (the smudge triggers the "certainty spreads" insight), closure linkage (she sets it down and writes truth instead of measuring it). Specificity high: it is Ren's work, not generic. Cost connection: touching it forecloses her hope of discrete measurement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"Swaying certainties" shapes the dominant stake (she came to measure the weight of truth) and alters tactics on the page: the smudge action demonstrates that certainty "spread, it blurred," forcing her to abandon measurement and write confession. The concept is dramatized in the needle-of-a-compass metaphor, the ink bleeding, and the final "held" vs. sway tension. Present in setup ("certainties sway"), middle (smudge realization), and closure (the words "swayed on the page, but they held"). It is more than theme-echo; it changes her options from measuring to accepting. Two beats (sway declaration, smudge-triggered insight) and closure contribution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Peripherally aware" is signaled in the flashback ("peripherally aware of what the upper instruments were showing") and enables the central guilt (she saw the data but swallowed the warning). It constrains the present: her awareness now is hyper-focused (no longer peripheral) as she confronts what she saw. One beat (flashback setup) with cost connection (her peripheral awareness is what allowed her to ignore the warning). Missing middle development: the trait is not tested again in the present scene. Present in setup and closure context but not in a middle choice. Cap ~6.0 for two-gate presence; deduct −0.1 for minimal causal work in the present action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The smudge action is the story's pivotal turn: it triggers the realization that certainty cannot be discretely measured, forcing her to write the confession instead. It is irreplaceable (no other action carries the same ink-bleeding metaphor) and appears in the middle beat with high causal pressure. The action is specific (thumb on petal, ink bleeds) and charges the closure (she moves from touching the illustration to writing in the margin). Setup (illustration present), development (smudge as turning point), payoff (she writes truth because measurement failed). Early signal, beat involvement (one key beat), causal pressure, closure linkage, specificity, cost connection all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"By occupying margins" is signaled early ("That was her method, always: by occupying margins"), shapes her tactics (she logs observations in white spaces, not official fields), and appears in the closure beat (she writes the confession "In the margin of the morning's data sheet"). The method is her means of truth-telling and is indispensable to the ending's image. Setup (method declared), development (implied in her habit), payoff (the confession is written in a margin, making the method the vehicle of closure). Three gates, causal pressure, closure linkage, specificity. Cost connection: margins are "where no one audited," now where she makes herself visible.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The mountain weather station supplies the isolation that forces confrontation (no escape), the instruments that mirror her measuring obsession, and the concrete details (barograph, data sheets, cot) that ground her choices. It appears in setup (anchored early), middle (the station's tools are her measurement apparatus), and closure (she logs data and continues her work). The station constrains her choice (she is alone with the memory) and charges the final image (the mountain "remains" as she writes). Early signal, beat involvement (three: setup, instrument use, closure work), causal pressure (isolation = no avoidance), closure linkage, specificity (3,200 meters, concrete/aluminum).</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"After fever breaks" is signaled in the opening line and frames the action (her body is "hollowed," she rises slowly), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The fever is past; the present is open-ended. It enables the scene (she is weakened, vulnerable) but does not pressure tactics. Setup present, minimal development (the weakness colors her actions but does not constrain them), no payoff (time does not run out or force a choice). Two-gate presence at best. Lyric resonance: the fever breaking mirrors the truth breaking into daylight, which lifts the score slightly. Cap ~6.5 for functional but non-urgent time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>"To find the weight of a swallowed truth" is the dramatized dominant stake, signaled early ("to find the weight of a swallowed truth"), tested in the smudge beat (she discovers it won't sit on a scale), and resolved in the confession (she writes the truth, accepts it as something to carry). Friction between want (to measure and move past) and cost (the stone becomes heavier, then portable but never erasable) is on the page. Setup, development (smudge insight), payoff (confession as acceptance). Causal pressure, closure linkage, cost connection all present. Minor deduction: the motivation is slightly over-articulated in the setup paragraph.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>"Auroral sorrow" is coherent throughout (grey-violet light, pale gold bleeding into violet, "a dawn that seemed to grieve"), modulates with pressure (opens somber, tightens at the smudge, breathes at the ending), and charges the final image (the mountain and wind carry "nothing, carrying everything"). Tone is woven through sensory detail and the barograph's "slow, steady rise" without becoming static. Setup (auroral dawn), development (the sorrow colors her handling of the illustration), payoff (the auroral image returns in the ending as the mountain remains). Three gates, tone as texture, closure linkage. Specificity high: "auroral" is both literal (high-altitude light) and emotional.</comment>
