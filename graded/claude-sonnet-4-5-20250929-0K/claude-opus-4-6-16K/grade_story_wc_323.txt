<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Yael's interiority is concrete and her motivation to learn deepens credibly through encounter with the chain link. The weeping moment risks sentimentality but is anchored by "somber marvel" and the immediate return to action (journal writing). Internal contradiction appears when she volunteers despite no panic—balanced curiosity is shown through restraint—but the final stance (student again) feels earned by the chain-link epiphany. Minor: "balancedly curious" reads as external label rather than dramatized trait in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through the chain-link teaching moment, then shifts cadence in the final paragraphs when Yael writes the new curriculum and "let herself be a student again." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she abandons the role of teacher with visible cost—her old curriculum, her expertise-based identity). The cost is legible in "forget the surface" and the renunciation of her twenty-three-year pedagogical frame. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The benthic city's edge geometry and the chain link constrain choices: Yael must describe edges, not weight, which forces her conceptual shift. The neutrino filaments and bioluminescent gel function as micro-setting that charges the final image when the gel encodes the chain link. Sensory detail is filtered through Yael's navigation expertise (sextants, Polaris) and the deep-pressure atmosphere. The "ocean pressing down like a palm" and "frozen lightning" spires are vivid and specific. Spatial choreography remains clear across habitat module and charting table.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Yael's need to learn the Architects' navigation method (signaled early: "she had come to learn"). Pressure tightens when the Architects give her the chain link and ask her to describe its edges—she cannot answer in her existing frame. The turn occurs when she "slowly understood" and wept, then acts by writing a new curriculum that forecloses her old teaching identity. Agency is decision and renunciation with visible cost (abandoning her expertise). One meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—navigating by unseen dimensions, boundaries as negotiation—emerges through the chain link's corroded edges and neutrino starlight rather than statement. The final image (bioluminescent gel encoding the chain, connecting wreckage to stars) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: human and alien knowledge interpenetrate. "Every edge is a horizon waiting to unfold" borders on thesis but is embedded in the new curriculum, not authorial voice. The closure reweights prior material (her twenty-three years teaching visible stars) without moralizing. Subtext operates in the Architects' question and Yael's weeping.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooms in during the chain-link beat, pulls back for exposition on the Architects). Perceptual signature is consistent—navigation instructor filtering everything through wayfinding vocabulary (sextants, Polaris, horizons). Diction remains controlled; "edge geometry," "neutrino starlight," and "somber marvel" feel voice-motivated rather than ornamental. Brief exposition on the Architects and the committee anchors context without breaking POV modesty. No dialogue to judge. Syntax varies; the long third paragraph's rhythm supports the unfolding-horizons concept without becoming sluggish.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density; most sentences advance character, world, or theme. Rhythm varies naturally (short crisis beats: "She wept, there in the deep" / longer accumulative passages). No loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful: "ocean pressing down like a palm," "horizons...tucked inside the architecture like a letter inside an envelope." Minor: "somber marvel" and "unfolded horizons" repeat slightly more than necessary, risking motif-checklist feel, but each use reweights meaning. Opening and closing lines charge stakes and resolve by image. Filter verbs ("understood," "realized") appear but feel voice-motivated given the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—deep-sea first contact with non-visual aliens who navigate by neutrinos—is specific and non-obvious. Edge geometry and the chain-link teaching tool transform the "alien teacher" trope through grounded sensory detail and a focused epistemological question. Risk: the piece leans into lyricism and reflection, which could flatten pressure, but the chain-link beat and curriculum-writing anchor the turn in action. The emotional arc (expert to student) is particular to Yael's navigation expertise. Minor: "twenty-three years teaching cadets" and "four thousand meters beneath the Pacific" feel like template specificity rather than lived detail that alters her choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Navigation instructor: frames expectation early (paragraph 2), constrains her perception (she filters the Architects' city through wayfinding vocabulary), and drives the closure (she writes a new navigation curriculum, relinquishing her old expertise). Present in setup, middle (chain-link teaching), and payoff. Causal pressure: her professional identity both enables the learning and must be renounced. Cost: abandoning twenty-three years of pedagogy. Irreplaceable: the story's stakes depend on her being a navigation expert.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Boat anchor chain link: introduced mid-story (paragraph 5), used in one extended beat (Yael turns it over, describes its edges, realizes boundaries are negotiations), then returns in the closure (set on the charting table, encoded into the gel, connecting to the stars). Two distinct beats. Causal pressure: the Architects' question about edges forces her conceptual shift. Closure linkage: the gel encoding charges the final image. Specificity: "corroded, barnacled, heavy" and the rust-metal-absence boundary are irreplaceable. Cost: her realization that she "had never known" triggers the weeping and curriculum abandonment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unfolded horizons: phrase appears in paragraph 3 ("every step unfolded another horizon") and returns in the curriculum ("every edge is a horizon waiting to unfold"). Stakes: the concept frames her discovery that navigation is about reading boundary negotiations. Middle: implicit in the chain-link beat (rust becoming metal becoming absence). Payoff: the lesson "every edge is a horizon" reweights her prior teaching. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake. Causal pressure: the concept enables her understanding but does not narrow a tactical choice. Cost: tied to the broader realization, not this phrase alone.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Balancedly curious: mentioned in paragraph 2 ("leaning into neither [wonder or caution], letting both inform her steps") but not dramatized in a choice under pressure. The trait explains why she was selected but does not constrain an on-page decision with visible cost. Ornamental: the story would function identically if she were simply "curious" or "cautious." No payoff. Swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Expand: the action appears in the edge-geometry description (walls "expand around you") and implicitly in "unfolded horizons" and the filaments that "expanded, reaching, connecting." Middle: the gel's expansion in the final beat. Does not drive a major turn; the chain-link realization is the key moment, and "expand" is a descriptor rather than an action Yael takes. Swappable: "unfold," "open," or "reveal" could replace it with minor edits. Present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Edge geometry: introduced in paragraph 3 as the Architects' structural principle, shapes the chain-link question ("where did the link end and the water begin?"), and implicitly structures the closure when the gel encodes edges. Two beats. Causal pressure: the Architects' edge-based worldview forces Yael to abandon surface-based thinking. Specificity: "relationships between boundaries" is conceptually unique. Cost: her realization depends on understanding edges. Missing stronger middle dramatization—she learns it but does not use it to solve a tactical problem.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Benthic city: anchored early (paragraph 2: "four thousand meters beneath the Pacific"), supplies the neutrino navigation that Yael seeks, and the charting table where closure occurs. Three beats. Causal pressure: the deep-sea setting makes visible starlight impossible, forcing neutrino navigation as the alternative. The habitat module and charting table are tactile and used. Closure linkage: the bioluminescent gel (city technology) encodes the chain link in the final image. Specificity: abyssal plain, pressure, and spires are irreplaceable. Cost: Yael's isolation and the weight of the ocean charge the atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After discovering aliens: timeframe is mentioned ("Six weeks had passed since first contact") but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. The story unfolds in a single teaching session; no live clock or deadline. The "six weeks" provides context but is swappable with any post-contact duration. No payoff; the time does not shape the chain-link moment or closure. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>To learn to navigate by starlight: desire is stated early ("she needed to learn it") and dramatized through the chain-link teaching and the final curriculum. Setup, middle (chain-link realization), and payoff (writing new lessons). Causal pressure: her need drives the encounter with the Architects and forces her to confront the limits of her expertise. Closure linkage: the new curriculum ("Lesson one: forget the surface") is the visible outcome. Cost: abandoning her old pedagogical frame. Friction between her expertise (twenty-three years teaching visible stars) and her need to learn the unseen creates authentic tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Somber marvel: tone is coherent and modulates with pressure. Early: "benthic city...by hands that were not hands" establishes wonder. Middle: the weeping beat is charged with both sorrow and discovery ("Not from sorrow but from the somber marvel"). Closure: "she let herself be a student again in the dark" sustains the tone and charges the final image with quiet awe and cost. The tone shapes the emotional register of key turns (chain-link realization, curriculum writing) and deepens the closure without flattening into sentimentality. Irreplaceable: "excitement" or "curiosity" would not sustain the cost and renunciation.</comment>
