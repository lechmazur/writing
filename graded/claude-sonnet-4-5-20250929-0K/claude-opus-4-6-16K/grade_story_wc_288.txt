<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is densely rendered through embodied perception (ice fracturing metaphor, library as architecture of isolation). Her shift from isolation to independence earns conceptual weight, though the final choice—letting mist curl around texts—reads more as emblematic gesture than a decision with visible consequence that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction appears in her dual-life awareness, but the ending crystallizes stance rather than dramatizing a renunciation with on-page cost. Minor: the vaelkross memory ("I'm sorry") risks sentimentality without offsetting friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (tidal library, cloud plateau, brass sundial) are clear by paragraph two. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: memory fragments accrue, isolation reweights into independence, final image reconfigures the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—Maren stops moving texts, accepts the tide, becomes "a library unto herself." Cost is conceptual (she accepts ephemerality) but not viscerally felt as forfeiture or trade-off; the final image asserts wholeness rather than proving it through a decisive renunciation. One meaningful deepening (reincarnation memory cracks her open) tightens the dominant stake, satisfying the lens requirement, but the closure image lacks a sharp before/after legible through action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tidal library is vividly particular: basalt plateau, cloud-surge mechanics, damp shelves, brass sundial's atomic reflectivity. Setting pressures routine (moving texts before surges) and the final choice hinges on letting vapor in. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (sub-sonic hum through bones, velvet neck of vaelkross). The sundial and stone circle anchor both spatial and thematic weight, charging the closure image when Maren sees her reflection in the perfectly mirrored brass face. Micro-setting (the dial, the body in mist) satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Maren's stance toward her isolation/role as last witness. The reincarnation memory deepens her understanding (one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens), shifting isolation into independence. Escalation is conceptual rather than situational: she moves from protective routine to acceptance of ephemerality. The final decision—not moving texts—signals a stance crystallization, but the choice lacks immediate visible cost or trade-off; no live alternative is dramatized. Agency is present (she stops, she writes, she chooses acceptance) but the pressure coheres through reflection more than external constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (memory as archive, isolation vs. independence, witnessing extinction) emerges organically from image and action. The sundial's perfect reflection and the tidal rhythm metaphorically charge the ending without overt statement. Maren's internal shift from "abandoned" to "stationed" avoids the Thematic Echo pitfall by embedding the distinction in her micro-choices (writing her own observations, not just cataloging). The final image—"tidal, humming, awake"—offers a resonant answer to the central question of how to carry forward what no archive can hold, achieving non-literal closure. Minor: "contemporary of extinct species" risks abstract thematic claim in the penultimate paragraph, but it's rooted in prior particulars (vaelkross, chorus whales).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Maren's noticing is shaped by centuries of isolation, memory fracture, and archival precision. Diction is controlled and literary ("atomically reflective," "brittle awakening") without register mismatch. The prose modulates under pressure (shorter syntax when memory surfaces). One slip: "The distinction mattered" in mid-story reads as mild expository intrusion, but it's brief and voice-motivated. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Reflection is anchored to present stimuli (handling bestiary, touching sundial) and tilts present choices (beginning to write).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and dense with high information load: most sentences do double work (e.g., "brittle awakening, like ice fracturing across a lake at dawn"). Rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. One minor drag: "She had learned many things in the centuries she'd been keeper here" is scaffold that adds no new pressure. Figurative language (ice fracture, tidal architecture, origami wings) is coherent and purposeful. The final beat—"tidal, humming, awake"—compresses prior motifs without overwriting. Zero stock metaphors in peak moments. Syntax shifts with emotional weight (shorter fragments during memory surge).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tidal library and reincarnation-memory mechanics offer a fresh synthesis of archive fiction and witness-to-extinction themes. The atomically reflective sundial is a specific, verifiable detail that serves character and closure. Risk-taking in structure (extended reflection, lyric density) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the "isolated keeper" premise is familiar; the story transforms it through the reincarnation angle and the choice to accept ephemerality, but the emotional arc (loneliness → acceptance) follows a recognizable template. The ending's conceptual move (independence as wholeness) feels earned rather than inevitable, landing in the strong-but-not-transformative band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren is a contemporary of extinct species; this status drives her interior pressure and her shift from isolation to independence. She makes one key choice (writing her own observations, not just cataloging) and one closure choice (not moving texts, accepting the tide). Her witness role is present in setup, middle reflection, and ending image. Cost is conceptual (she accepts ephemerality of her archive) rather than a visible forfeiture, landing solidly in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The brass sundial appears in three beats: opening (Maren presses her palm against it), mid-story (description of atomic reflectivity and gnomon), and ending (her reflection stares back perfectly). It anchors both timekeeping and the stone-circle connection. Its reflective property charges the closure image (Maren sees herself preserved, distortion-free). However, the sundial does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as recurring motif rather than causal lever. Presence across setup, middle, and closure grants it essential status, but lack of active causal pressure limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" is introduced early (reincarnation memory "like ice fracturing"), recurs in mid-story ("The brittle awakenings continued"), and shapes Maren's split sense of self. It drives her realization that isolation can become independence and motivates her choice to write rather than merely catalog. The concept constrains her interior tactics (morning disorientation, prism metaphor) and charges the ending ("awake"). Cost is conceptual but clear: accepting fragmentation as wholeness. The element is indispensable to the story's emotional logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sundial's atomic reflectivity is described in detail ("polished to a precision that no human hand could achieve… every photon mirrored without loss") and returns at closure when Maren sees her face "atomically perfect, distortion-free." It enriches the thematic weight of preservation and witness, charging the final image. However, it does not constrain an on-page action or alter tactics; the property is descriptive and symbolic rather than causal. Two-gate presence (setup description, closure reprise) with lyric resonance but no cost tied to the trait itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Coexist" appears centrally when Maren writes "what it meant to coexist with beings whose time was finite… and to love them anyway." This motivates her shift from cataloging to personal writing, which is a micro-choice that alters her stance. The action recurs in her final acceptance (coexisting with the tide, with ephemerality). Setup in memory beat, development in writing choice, payoff in closure stance. Cost is implicit (she forgoes preservation for presence). The element shapes one key turn and the ending's charge, landing at the lower edge of essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The stone circle's hum is described early ("subsonic resonance that kept the library tethered") and sustains the tidal rhythm. It appears at closure ("The stone circle hummed"). However, the mechanism is explained rather than dramatized; it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic on the page. The hum functions as atmospheric anchor rather than active method. Present in setup and ending, but missing middle development beat where its mechanics matter to a choice. Cap applies for missing middle gate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tidal library pressures Maren's routines (moving fragile texts before surges) and supplies the final choice (letting mist curl around texts and sundial). The cloud-surge mechanics are present in setup, constrain middle activity (implied routine), and charge the closure when she stops moving texts. The setting is micro (sundial, shelves, mist) and macro (plateau, clouds), both constraining and enabling. The library-as-body metaphor ("felt the library breathe") charges the ending image. Essential across all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The reincarnation memory occurred "three days ago—or three weeks; time moved strangely" and frames the entire present action. The "after" timeframe drives Maren's fractured awakenings, her shift to writing, and her final stance. Time is somewhat vague ("centuries she'd been keeper") but the memory's recent arrival tightens decisions (she begins writing now, accepts the tide now). Present in setup, shapes middle choices, and charges closure. Cost is conceptual (she can no longer ignore her dual existence). Essential but not indispensable due to vague clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Translating isolation into independence is Maren's central drive. The distinction is introduced mid-story ("Where isolation said… independence answered"), dramatized through her choice to write her own observations, and crystallized at closure ("not isolated… independent, whole"). The motivation shapes two beats (writing, accepting tide) and directly charges the ending. Conflict between want (connection, preservation) and fear (being the last, ephemerality) creates authentic tension. Cost is conceptual (accepting solitude as capacity) and visible in her final gesture. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>
