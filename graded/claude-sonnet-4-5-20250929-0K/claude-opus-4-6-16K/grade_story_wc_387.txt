<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ozu is rendered through decades of embodied practice—bone needle, parapet ritual, tea-whisk test—but his internal life remains observational rather than conflicted. The desire "to appreciate hidden effort" is told and illustrated but never dramatized as a choice under pressure; he climbs, mends, tests, descends without foreclosing a path or paying a visible cost. Interiority is lyric and consistent, yet no contradictory impulses act in scene. The final folding gesture reads as completion of routine, not renunciation or agency that alters stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate (Ozu, parapet, firefly season, post-rain). The piece accumulates sensory and philosophical density through mending moves, moon-path technique, whisk test, whistle, and final net-raising, then closes on a resonant image of fireflies "burning with the modest conviction that being seen was not the point." The RR (Conceptual Repricing via the firefly coda) reweights prior material, but no on-page choice forecloses a path or imposes felt cost—Ozu completes his task as planned. The closure reads as thematic summation rather than a before/after with stakes-altering pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Parapet anchors every beat: wet flagstones catch moonlight, crevices whisper, the gutter supplies rainwater for the whisk test, and the ancient steps frame descent. Moon-path mechanics constrain method (stressed fibers glow differently), and the bamboo whisk's tines deliver a tactile hydrology test. Firefly season brackets the ritual temporally and charges the final image. No occupational excess; every detail pressures or illuminates mending choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: complete the seven-tear mend with full attention. The net is spread, threaded, tested (whisk/water pooling diagnostic), raised against moonlight, and folded—one meaningful deepening when the whisk test reveals micro-failure modes. No reversal, no competing option, no visible trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens one tightening suffices, but agency remains execution of method rather than a choice that narrows live options or forecloses a path with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—hidden patterns as architecture no one applauds—emerges from concrete particulars: knot philosophy, moon-honest illumination, whisk-bead hydrology, five-note whistle matching firefly pulse and parapet rhythm. The final firefly image ("shining, regardless, was") answers the thematic question through scene rather than statement. No thesis declared. Earned wisdom accrues from technique, and the ending reweights prior material without moralizing. One minor slip: "attention became a form of love" edges toward abstraction mid-passage but remains anchored in demonstrated practice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited, stable distance throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent—scholar's reading of damage, moon-honest versus sun-generous—and diction matches an elder craftsman's idiom without register drift. No dialogue to test. Purposeful compression in the firefly coda ("intermittent, astonishing silence") serves closure. Minor density: occasional filter-stack ("he realized as he whistled") and one expository aside ("he had discovered this technique twenty years ago and had never told anyone") that slightly dilutes immediacy but does not obscure focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances mending, reveals method, or layers sensory/philosophical texture. Rhythm varies (short declaratives, longer lyric sweeps). Two minor artifacts: "scintillatingly somber, like grief dressed in celebration, or celebration that had finally learned the weight of what it celebrated" stacks metaphor vehicles in one beat, risking coherence; "demure audacity" in the penultimate paragraph feels ornamental rather than earned by prior contradiction. No loops or template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor well. Figurative density in the firefly-season frame is purposeful and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Net-mending as philosophy, moon-path flaw detection, and bamboo-whisk hydrology testing synthesize into a fresh angle on craft-as-devotion. The five-note whistle matching firefly/parapet/knot intervals is a non-obvious connective leap that feels inevitable in hindsight. Tone and imagery avoid template Zen; specificity (bone needle, clay bowl, gutter rainwater) grounds the meditation. Risk: the piece leans into lyric accumulation without dramatic reversal, which heightens thematic resonance but limits narrative surprise. No close echoes of famous texts detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ozu is present throughout and his philosophy frames every beat (knots as questions, moon-honest vision, attention as love). He makes procedural choices (threading, whisk test, whistle) but no decision that narrows live options or forecloses a competing path. Observation dominates over conflict-driven agency. Setup early, beats throughout, present at closure, but the "philosopher" attribute remains thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bamboo tea whisk: introduced early ("owned longer than any net"), used mid-scene for the water-bead hydrology test (a discovery twenty years old, never spoken), and tucked into belt at closure. Two distinct functional beats (test, closure gesture). The whisk's tines enable a micro-diagnostic ("Where the water pooled, the mend was too tight") that shapes mending success. High irreplaceability—no generic tool would perform this test. Missing: the whisk does not return with reweighted symbolic charge in the final image; it is practical throughout.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Hidden patterns" is the organizing concept: moon paths reveal micro-tears, whisk-bead flow diagnoses tension, whistle intervals match firefly pulse and knot spacing, parapet whisper encodes overlapping voices. The concept shapes method (moon-alignment technique), drives the thematic question (appreciating hidden effort), and the firefly coda reprices it ("shining, regardless, was"). Present early, active in multiple beats, charges closure. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Scintillatingly somber" appears once, describing firefly glow as "like grief dressed in celebration, or celebration that had finally learned the weight of what it celebrated." It is vivid lyric coloring but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The attribute remains ornamental description; no choice hinges on this tonal quality. Late-ish arrival (after opening paragraph) and single decorative mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ozu whistles his grandmother's five-note tune mid-scene and realizes it matches firefly blink, parapet rhythm, and knot spacing—a discovery that validates the hidden-pattern thesis. One causal beat: the whistle crystallizes thematic recognition. It does not drive a major turn or redefine options; the mending would succeed without it. Present in closure neighborhood (late middle) and tied to the firefly motif that charges the ending, but the action itself is reflection-trigger rather than plot pivot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Following moon paths" is signaled early, mechanics detailed ("if he aligned his mending with these luminous paths…hidden patterns emerged"), and governs the entire repair sequence. Moon-honest light reveals stressed fibers versus sound ones; the technique is irreplaceable and shapes every tactical choice in the mending. Present at setup, active across beats, implicit in the final net-raising test against sky. The method is load-bearing for both plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The whispering parapet supplies rainwater (gutter → clay bowl → whisk test), its whisper establishes rhythmic motif, wet flagstones catch moonlight for the alignment technique, and the wide ledge provides the work surface. The setting constrains method (moon angle, water source) and charges atmosphere throughout. Anchored immediately, active in every beat, and the ancient steps frame the closing descent. Indispensable to both logistics and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Firefly season brackets the ritual, provides the bioluminescent motif (patient coded light, intermittent glow), and the fireflies escort Ozu down the steps in the final image, delivering thematic closure. The season does not tighten a decision clock or force tempo; it supplies symbolic architecture. Setup early, present at closure, charges the ending image with "modest conviction," but timeframe imposes atmosphere rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The desire "to appreciate hidden effort" is stated mid-piece ("not duty, not habit, but the quiet, almost impertinent desire") and demonstrated through Ozu's method: reading torn filaments as questions, moon-path revelation, whisk-test secrecy, whistle recognition. The motivation drives his nightly climb and frames thematic payoff. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted—no competing want, no cost to this choice. Functional across beats, integral to theme, but told rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Demure audacity" appears explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("folded the net with the demure audacity of a man who knew…") and is embodied throughout: quiet mastery (demure) paired with unspoken conviction (audacity) in the secret whisk technique, the "impertinent desire," and the fireflies' modest burning. Tone is coherent and modulates lyrically with the mending ritual. The late explicit naming risks telling what has been shown, but the tonal synthesis charges the final image and holds through descent.</comment>
