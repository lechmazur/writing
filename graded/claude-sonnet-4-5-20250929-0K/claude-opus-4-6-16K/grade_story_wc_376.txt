<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lien's physical wilting trait is well-embodied and drives several key choices, particularly her trembling with her mother and her steady hands in the vault. Her motivation to find lost conversations is concrete and rooted in painful experience. The piece maintains interior coherence throughout, though the final decision to transcribe and post letters feels slightly underdeveloped in terms of visible cost or resistance. Secondary characters (clerk, mother) function as pressures rather than dramatic presences, which fits the length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases as Lien moves from commission → fragments → map → vault, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where her transcription work reweights the premise with felt cost. Orientation anchors arrive early (greenhouse city, calligraphy quarter, Lien's trait). The map-reconstruction sequence and vault discovery link causally, and the final image—gold leaf adhering perfectly, letters flowing again—charges the closure with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening is present: the shift from solitary suffering to public candor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky, dried oasis, and sub-level postal vault are vivid and specific. The gold leaf and bone folder constrain Lien's work method, and the humid corridor setting shapes the final posting choice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lien's professional lens (fogged panes, pipe condensation, fungal bloom). The setting participates actively in closure: the greenhouse lights illuminate the posted letters, bracketing the toxic sky above and dry oasis below.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—is signaled early and tightens through the commission, fragments, map, and vault discovery. Lien's agency drives each escalation: she pries floorboards, pieces the map, descends, and chooses to transcribe and post. The final act reweights her isolation into public witness with visible cost (carrying bundles upward, exposing raw admissions). One turn is present: discovering the vault shifts her from searching to delivering. The cost is felt but not heavily dramatized in terms of resistance or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the vault discovery and Lien's trait: candor as aquifer, unsent letters as sediment. The final image—gold leaf adhering, something flowing again between toxic sky and dry oasis—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the wilting trait and the gap between polite fictions and raw admissions. The piece resists tidy resolution: the oasis remains dry, the sky toxic, but honest words circulate. Minor slip: "Candor in small moments was not small at all" edges toward thematic statement rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Lien's calligraphy work (gossamer, bone folder, zinc-etched). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the mother's death, cooler during the vault discovery. Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent, though "humid corridor where Lien worked, something flowed again—honest and ungilded and, at last, delivered" verges on elevated register. No head-hopping, clear focalization, and purposeful compression in the map-reconstruction sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong information density. Sentence rhythm varies naturally and supports scene pressure. Minor loop: "She pulled a letter at random and began to reread it, then another, then another" uses template cadence across three beats without clear progression. The metaphor "aquifer beneath the city" is apt but borders on stock environmental imagery. No major scaffold or clarity issues; the gold-leaf application details and sub-level navigation are concrete and legible. One filter-verb cluster ("began to reread") appears but does not flatten a peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The wilting-near-dishonesty trait is fresh and grounded in craft (gold leaf adherence), transforming a "truth-teller" trope into embodied physics. The vault of unsent letters synthesizes familiar ideas (archive, candor) through specific world logic (pneumatic tubes, sub-level sorting room). The final reconfiguration—posting letters on public walls—is earned but not fully surprising. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits to its premise without structural experimentation. Transformation test passes: plot and arc would collapse with generic substitutions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lien's choices drive all key turns: asking the clerk, prying floorboards, piecing the map, descending, and deciding to transcribe and post. Setup early, development across multiple beats, and closure participation via the posting decision. Causal pressure is high; her trait and motivation constrain every move. Cost is visible (bleeding fingers, carrying bundles upward). Irreplaceable: her wilting trait and calligraphy skill are unique to the premise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The postal plate fragment appears in one beat (commission from the clerk) and catalyzes the search, signaling "Bureau of Unsent Correspondence, Sub-level 9." It does not return or reweight at closure; the vault and letters dominate the ending. Setup present, middle development via the address clue, but no closure participation. Functional and causal but not charged at the end. Swappable with another archival clue (e.g., a ledger entry) without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The core concept—candor in small moments—shapes stakes throughout: Lien's trait rejects polite fictions, her search targets lost candor, the vault houses raw admissions, and her final act posts them publicly. Setup early via her wilting and mother's death, development through vault letters ("every word here was true"), and closure via the posting decision. Causal pressure is strong: the concept defines her ability, her quest, and her resolution. Irreplaceable: remove candor and the story collapses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wilting trait constrains Lien's work (clients avoid lies, she loses her mother's hand), enables the vault discovery (her hands steady with true words), and charges the closure (leaf adheres perfectly). Setup early, development across at least two beats (mother's death, vault steadiness), and closure participation via the adherence image. Visible cost: loneliness, lost relationships. Causal pressure is high. Specific and irreplaceable: the physical manifestation is unique to this premise.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Reread" appears once in the vault scene: Lien pulls letters and rereads them, absorbing their candor. This beat deepens her understanding ("Every word here was true") and primes the posting decision. Setup absent (no prior rereading), middle development present, closure linkage indirect. Swappable: she could have read them once or sorted them with similar effect. Functional but not irreplaceable. Cost connection weak: rereading itself does not impose visible price.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Piecing the shredded map under floorboards is signaled early (postal plate fragment → post office → shredded map) and executed in one sustained beat ("three days piecing together"). The method constrains Lien's path: she must reconstruct the route to reach the vault. Development present, but closure linkage is weak—the map does not return or reweight at the end. Specific and labor-intensive, but once solved it becomes inert. Causal pressure moderate; removing it would require a different discovery method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky frames the entire narrative: fogged panes, failing air filtration, dried oasis basin, sub-level tunnels. The setting pressures Lien's choices (post office skeletal, toxic air stings, sub-levels humid and fungal) and charges the final image: "Above her, the toxic sky pressed against the glass. Below her, the oasis remained dry. But between those two truths... something flowed again." Setup immediate, development across multiple beats, closure participation strong. Irreplaceable: the greenhouse/toxic dichotomy anchors theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The three-month mark since the oasis dried is mentioned early, and the piecing takes three days, but elapsed time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The timeframe provides context (systems failing, plants curling) but does not impose a live clock. Setup present, development weak (time does not narrow options), closure participation absent. Swappable: the story would function identically with "months ago" or no timestamp. No cost tied to duration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lien's motivation—to find where lost conversations go—is dramatized early (mother's death, her quiet obsession) and drives every choice: asking the clerk, following the map, descending, and posting letters. The motivation is conflicted (loneliness vs. truth-seeking) and incurs visible cost (bleeding fingers, isolation). Setup early, development across all beats, closure participation strong (posting is the culmination). Causal pressure high; remove the motivation and the arc collapses. Specific and irreplaceable.</comment>
