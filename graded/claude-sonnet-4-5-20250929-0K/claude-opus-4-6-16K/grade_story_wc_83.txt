<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nadia's interior is concrete and contradictory—grief has weight, physics became visceral after trauma, she hoards private discoveries while fulfilling institutional duties. Her choice to pocket the coordinates and return to scheduled work embodies earned stasis with visible cost: survival as pooled potential that warps everything around it. Minor slip: the geode-breaking backstory feels slightly over-articulated ("needed to see if the inside matched") where show would suffice, and the final paragraph's self-diagnostic tone ("A survivor is a pool of unused potential") edges toward therapy-speak, though it remains anchored in her scientific framework.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Nadia returns to scheduled work but is "different now," having found both cosmic pools and her own survival as pooled potential, with the cost legible in "what almost happened." Orientation is swift (floating observatory, eleven months, husband killed). The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through interleaved reflection, the forty-minute hunt, and the geode's symbolic weight, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. One meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes herself as a pool of unused potential. The hunt's perturbation-theory mechanics are told rather than dramatized, which keeps this below 8.8.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory at twenty-eight kilometers, tethered to nothing, suspended by helium and indifference, supplies both spatial constraint (forty minutes while breakers cool) and thematic charge (above war, below stars). The geode functions as micro-setting: handled twice (once to observe, once touched at the end), it charges the closure image with its cold, sharp reality and backstory of being cracked open. The body under stress is present ("lie beneath a collapsed table"). The console, terminal, and emergency lighting are purposeful anchors. Environment constrains the hunt and charges the final touch.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: finding where unused potential pools, both cosmically and personally. The forty-minute window tightens pressure, and her choice to save coordinates privately rather than share them institutionally is agency with visible cost—she has learned "what institutions do with potential they cannot control: they send a missile." The perturbation spike in Cygnus narrows her options (mark, save, keep). The final return to scheduled work forecloses the path of open confrontation but deepens her private hunt. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in her isolation and the unchanged rubble below.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—survival as pooled potential, the universe and self as reservoirs of what almost happened—emerges from concrete particulars: the geode cracked open, the perturbation models, the courtyard silenced mid-note. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "the only instrument sensitive enough to find them is a person who has been broken open herself." Subtext operates in the geode's double function (wedding gift and scientific metaphor), the private versus institutional drives, and the unstated accusation ("the same country that killed her husband"). Minor slip: "the bleak exhilaration floods her" and the penultimate paragraph's explicit articulation of the survivor-as-pool metaphor drift toward statement, though they remain tied to scientific idiom and embodied action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Nadia's perceptual signature throughout: physics terms ("perturbation theory," "mass-energy configurations"), grief as texture, sound with edges. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("helium cells and the indifference of stratospheric winds"). The breaker-reset and data-entry beats carry her purposeful compression. Minor register drift: "unfiltered awakening" and "intangibly tangible" in early reflection feel slightly prompt-adjacent, and the penultimate paragraph's philosophical exposition ("A survivor is a pool of unused potential") edges toward essayistic distance, though it remains rooted in her scientific framework and the story recovers with the final tactile beat (touches geode, returns to work).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the universe pours down its data, unfiltered by cloud cover or conscience"). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor artifacts: "That is what started it—the unfiltered awakening. Not enlightenment, nothing so clean" uses a scaffold hedge, and the penultimate paragraph contains a paraphrase loop ("Energy that was meant to dissipate in the blast but did not. A life that should have ended but pooled instead"). The metaphor stack in the reflection on grief ("intangibly tangible—grief had weight and texture... Sound had edges") is dense but coherent. No loops touch the closure beat, so deductions are capped at −0.4 under the non-closure rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of astrophysics and trauma through "pools of unused potential" is specific and non-obvious; the geode as wedding gift and scientific metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. The floating observatory and perturbation hunt avoid stock disaster-survivor frames. Risk is present in the reflective density and the quiet, renunciatory ending. Minor deduction: the "unfiltered awakening" and "intangibly tangible" phrases carry prompt-template echoes, and the premise (scientist grieves spouse via cosmic metaphor) is recognizable, though the perturbation-theory angle and the missile-institution accusation transform it. The ending's earned stasis—pocketing coordinates, touching the geode, resuming work—feels fresh and particular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nadia's survivor status is setup (established by paragraph two), drives the middle hunt (her sensitivity to pools of potential), and charges the closure ("A survivor is a pool of unused potential"). Her choice to pocket the coordinates and return to work is a direct result of what institutions did to her husband. Specific cost: isolation, private hoarding of discovery, and the unhealed wound shaping all perception.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The geode appears in beat one (on the console, wedding gift, carried from rubble), is used in backstory beat (cracked open with hammer to see inside), and returns at closure (touched once—"cold, sharp, real"—before she resumes work). The final touch reweights it: no longer just a keepsake but proof of her own cracked-open state. Specificity is high (amethyst interior, frozen light, compressed patience). Strong integration, though the middle use is told rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unfiltered awakening is named early and governs perception throughout: grief with weight, sound with edges, physics as bodies. It enables her sensitivity to perturbation anomalies and shapes the ending recognition (broken-open instrument). However, the concept is stated more than enacted in the middle hunt beats; the perturbation work itself is summary. Cost is present (isolation, the unchanged rubble) but the awakening's mechanics remain abstract. Lyric reprise with thematic charge, but limited causal pressure in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is introduced early ("grief had weight and texture, but you could never set it down. Sound had edges") and shapes her perception throughout. It recurs implicitly in the geode touch ("cold, sharp, real") at closure. However, it does not constrain a specific on-page choice or alter tactics; it colors interiority without forcing trade-offs. Present across beats but more atmospheric than causal. Lyric coherence without demonstrated cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The hunt is setup (paragraph four: "She is hunting for where unused potential pools"), occupies the middle act (perturbation models, the Cygnus spike), and delivers the closure recognition (herself as pooled potential, the private coordinates pocketed). The hunt's success forces her choice to save privately rather than share institutionally, with visible cost (isolation, defiance). Removing the hunt would collapse the story's structure and metaphor. Strong causal work and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is named early and explained (introduce disturbances, observe response spikes). It enables the Cygnus discovery and supports the thematic metaphor (hidden potential revealed by applied pressure). However, the method is summarized rather than dramatized; we are told she works fast and the data reshapes, but no specific perturbation choice or failed attempt appears. Present in setup and ending explanation, but minimal middle development. Functional but somewhat replaceable with another search method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory is anchored early (twenty-eight kilometers, helium cells, emergency lighting, drifting above war). It supplies the time constraint (circuit breakers, forty-minute window) that tightens the hunt and provides spatial/symbolic pressure (suspended above the country that killed her husband, below unfiltered stars). The console and terminal are handled. The setting shapes her institutional defiance and charges the final image of returning to "scheduled work" while privately transformed. Strong thematic and tactical integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The forty-minute cooling window is introduced in paragraph three, tracked at "Seventeen minutes remain," and closes with "The circuit breakers click. The cooling cycle completes." The timeframe shapes her urgency ("She works fast") and constrains the hunt to stolen moments. However, the elapsed time between the two checks is not dramatized with intermediate pressure or visible rush. Present in setup, middle mention, and closure, but the clock's tactical pressure is more declared than felt across beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to find pooled potential is setup early (paragraph four), dramatized in the middle hunt (perturbation models, Cygnus spike, saving coordinates privately), and reweighted at closure (recognition of herself as pooled potential). Friction is visible: her need to hunt during stolen time, her refusal to share with institutions, the cost of isolation. The motivation is both cosmic (finding anomalies) and personal (understanding survival), and it forecloses the path of institutional cooperation. Strong causal and thematic integration with legible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Bleak exhilaration is named explicitly ("the bleak exhilaration floods her") and present throughout: dim emergency lighting, the courtyard turned to silence, "finding something enormous while knowing it changes nothing about what was lost," yet she is "different now." The tone modulates under pressure—grief's weight, the hunt's intensity, the final touch of the geode before resuming work. The ending image holds both bleakness (rubble unchanged) and exhilaration (private discovery, transformed stance). Coherent and charged, though the explicit naming slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>
