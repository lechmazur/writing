<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marguerite's motivations are clear and her arc—from clinical inspector to emotionally engaged confessor—is legible. The pearl-crowning gesture feels abrupt and under-motivated; the shift from professional distance to radical vulnerability needs one more intermediate choice to feel earned. Interiority is generally specific ("the way tenderness sometimes grows around a wound"), though "I never once asked what they were hiding from each other" skirts diagnostic clarity. Embodiment is present but thin at the pivot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece follows a causal-accumulative hybrid: discovery → realization → action, with the final knock constituting a Decisive Change that forecloses her prior professional distance. Cost is legible (she confronts the families with evidence of their private confessions, risking rejection and professional breach), though the knock itself is more promised than dramatized. One meaningful tightening occurs when she pockets the shell and drives to the motel.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal cave is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("humming at a frequency just below hearing," "translucent columns"). The seashell and pearl are concrete objects that constrain choice: Marguerite reads the confessions, places the pearl on her head, and carries both into the climactic scene. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The micro-setting (shell, pearl, crystals) charges the final image and alters her stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Marguerite will remain professionally distant or engage with the residents' emotional truth—is signaled early and tightens when she reads the confessions. Agency is clear in the final choice to knock on the door, and the cost (professional exposure, vulnerability) is felt. Escalation is modest but sufficient for this length: one meaningful deepening when the pearl's glow intensifies and she speaks her own confession. Coincidence (finding the crack) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—authentic connection versus the illusion of safety—emerges organically from the shell's confessions and Marguerite's realization. The pearl functions as a charged image rather than a symbol-stamp: it accrues meaning through the confessions and reweights prior material when she crowns herself. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (holding out the pearl to the woman) without stating a moral. "I think the shelter worth saving isn't underground" is explicit but grows from prior particulars and serves the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Voice has texture ("the way she found everything else worth discovering—by following a failure") and modulates appropriately under pressure. The final paragraph's dialogue feels slightly over-articulated for the moment's stakes ("And I think the shelter worth saving isn't underground" reads thesis-like). Perceptual signature is present but could be more character-specific; some phrases lean toward universal lyricism rather than Marguerite's particular way of noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied rhythm and high information density. Minor scaffold appears: "She did not set it down. / Instead, she placed..." is a boilerplate pivot. "The pearl pulsed once, during the heartbeat of a hesitation—that fraction of breath where Marguerite almost set it down, almost walked away, almost chose..." stacks three "almost" clauses in template cadence. Figurative language is frequent ("cathedral of translucent columns," "nacre of a different kind of shelter") but mostly legible. Propulsion is strong until the final paragraph, where exposition slows the knock.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bunker-inspector frame and the confession-shell are fresh inflections on the "buried emotional truth" template. The pearl-crowning gesture is memorable and odd in a purposeful way. However, the core arc (professional discovers hidden humanity and crosses threshold to engagement) follows a familiar trajectory. The crystal cave and seashell arrive through coincidence; their specificity compensates somewhat, but the setup feels mildly convenient. The ending gesture (holding out the pearl) is evocative but the thematic statement slightly dilutes impact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marguerite's role as bunker inspector frames the opening and her condemnation report is the inciting setup. She makes the key decision to knock on the door at closure. However, her inspectorship does not constrain middle tactics; the cave discovery and confession-reading could belong to any character. Present across setup and payoff, causal in one beat, but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pearl is seeded mid-story, handled in two distinct beats (placed on her head, held out at the door), and charges the final image. Its glow and symbolic weight drive Marguerite's confession and the climactic offer. Removing it would collapse the ending's visual and thematic anchor. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement, though late first appearance (past 40%) caps upside slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Latent radiance" is described as the pearl's glow and metaphorically applied to the confessions ("waiting for someone willing to carry them back into the light"). It shapes the ending image but does not constrain choices or alter tactics on the page. Functions more as atmospheric theme than a mechanical force. Present in closure image with modest thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Acquires abandoned hopes" is articulated in Marguerite's reflection ("It acquires abandoned hopes...not to hoard them, but to prove they were never truly abandoned"). The pearl accumulates confessions, but this attribute is told rather than dramatized through a choice or tradeoff. Label-only use; no visible cost or tactical constraint tied to the attribute itself. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The act of crowning (placing the pearl on her head) triggers the crystals' flare and Marguerite's own confession, which in turn enables her final choice to knock on the door. Causally active in one major beat and present in setup to payoff. Removing the crown gesture would require only minor edits to achieve the same turn (she could simply hold the pearl). Functional and memorable but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The confessions etched inside the seashell's spiral are discovered mid-story, drive Marguerite's realization, and enable her confession. The method is specific and its mechanics (spiral, nacre, etching) are described and used. She reads the confessions, then speaks her own into the shell. Present in two beats, causally active, and integral to the thematic turn. Late arrival (second third) and modest middle involvement limit top-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The crystal caves are the site of discovery and confession; their "resonant hush" and "luminous air" set tone and pressure. The cave enables the shell/pearl discovery and Marguerite's private confession. It provides resources (the artifacts) that drive the ending choice. Setup and payoff are strong; middle development is thin (the cave itself does not constrain her tactics inside it). Solid integration with one beat of causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"During the heartbeat of a hesitation" is invoked explicitly at the pearl-crowning moment and structures that beat's internal timeline. It tightens the decision window and charges the gesture. However, it appears only in that single passage; no broader clock pressure or tracked elapsed time. One beat of clear temporal constraint, lyric resonance, but limited scope.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marguerite's desire to dissolve emotional walls is articulated in her confession ("I never once asked what they were hiding from each other") and enacted in the final knock. The motivation is dramatized through her choice to read the confessions, crown herself, and confront the families. However, the language leans explicit and the internal conflict (professional distance vs. engagement) is more told than embodied in contradictory impulses. Functional with modest friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" is seeded early ("a resonant hush that pressed against her sternum"), recurs at the ending ("in the resonant hush that followed"), and modulates with pressure (the crystals flare when she crowns herself). Tone is coherent, supports the accumulative design, and charges the final image. The phrase itself is used twice; the effect persists across beats. Strong closure linkage and tonal control.</comment>
