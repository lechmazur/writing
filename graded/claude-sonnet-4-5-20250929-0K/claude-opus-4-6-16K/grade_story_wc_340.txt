<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's arc from servitude-by-refusal to understanding herself as "chosen" is earned through concrete beats: her curiosity with the goggles, her embodied reaction to Halse's hidden words, her final reframing of burden. Interior states are specific—"the quiet thrill she always felt when pieces connected"—and the emotional progression from discovery to grief to acceptance reads credibly. The final insight risks mild abstraction ("something that felt less like burden and more like being chosen"), but it arises from prior particulars and the cost of carrying Halse's legacy is visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece is Accumulative/Textural: each floor adds diary entries that deepen Maren's understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration at the tenth floor where she internalizes Halse's legacy and reweights her own ascent. Orientation anchors quickly (servant, elevator, icebound spire). The closure is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid—she steps into blinding light with the diary against her ribs, the goggles amber-warming her view, and reframes servitude as vocation with felt cost (she must now carry what others refused). One meaningful deepening across the climb; cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The spire's ice-refracted light is not mere backdrop: it enables the decryption method (amber lenses filter scattered beams to reveal hidden script), and the tenth-floor breakthrough into cloud-top sunlight charges the closure image. Micro-setting details—crystalline walls, changing light quality per floor, frost on observation decks—anchor the POV and constrain the discovery to this exact ascent. Spatial choreography is clean, and the environment directly enables the protagonist's key choice to don the goggles and step into "blinding white."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maren's need to understand Halse's encrypted legacy—is signaled early and tightens floor by floor as diary entries move from Ulla to Maren herself. The reversal at floors 8–9 ("She asks everything with such warmth… I told her about precession") reweights her servitude into reciprocal connection. Agency is decision and attention: she chooses to look through the goggles, to read, to carry the diary close. The cost is visible—she accepts the weight of being "chosen" and the melancholy work others refused—and the final stance crystallization (ascending as vocation, not mere duty) forecloses her prior self-conception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the encrypted diary and the mechanics of decryption: only by looking through the lens of Halse's old love (the captain's goggles) can Maren decode the new, quieter love he felt for her. The locked-room metaphor ("inside the locked room there is a window") is dramatized through action—Maren literally unlocks hidden text—and the final image ("carrying what others could not bear to carry… less like burden and more like being chosen") answers the thematic question without stating a moral. The amber-warming lens charges the ending with resonance: Maren inherits both Halse's method and his reframed anguish, transforming servitude into care.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-limited POV is stable, voice distinct ("the world owes her answers and she expects it to pay gladly"), and psychic distance modulates purposefully—close at discovery beats, slightly elevated for thematic reflection at closure. Halse's diary entries provide tonal contrast without head-hopping; they remain object-text within Maren's frame. Diction fits the focalizer (concrete, warm, observatory idiom: "precession," "Kessler Straits") and syntax tightens under emotional pressure (short declaratives at "But she knew now"). No dialogue, so those bullets do not apply. Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices light, codes, connections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied sentence rhythm, high information density, purposeful cadence shifts (longer reflective beats at closure, tighter beats during discovery). Minor friction: "the quiet thrill she always felt when pieces connected" risks slight abstraction, and "something that felt less like burden and more like being chosen" in the final paragraph edges toward summary rather than image. The metaphor work is coherent (locked room/window, amber warmth, scattered light as search) and no loops or scaffold appear. Clarity and propulsion are maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—encrypted diary decoded via dead lover's goggles and ice-refracted light—is specific and non-obvious, wedding setting to method to theme. The emotional truth (servant discovers mentor's hidden affection posthumously) avoids sentimentality through concrete mechanics and the protagonist's agency. Mild derivative pressure: the "servant rises by accepting what others refuse" frame and the posthumous-letter trope are familiar, though the decryption method and the dual-love-lens twist freshen them. Risk-taking in structure (floor-by-floor accumulation) and the quiet ending elevate without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's servant role is signaled early, drives her access to Halse's quarters and diary, and her choices—looking through the goggles, reading the entries, carrying the diary close—create every key turn. The final reframing of servitude as vocation is earned by her agency across the climb. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The goggles appear in beat one (discovery in Halse's desk), are used actively in beat two (decryption via amber lenses), and return charged in the closure (Maren dons them, world turns "amber and warm"). They are irreplaceable—only these specific lenses reveal the hidden script—and their dual function (relic of Ulla, tool for Maren's insight) charges the thematic payload. All three gates with strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is the core stake-object: its discovery launches the conflict, its decryption provides the escalation beats (floor by floor), and its final placement "close against her ribs" anchors the closure image. The encryption method—requiring both scattered light and amber lenses—shapes tactics and is integral to theme (past love unlocks present understanding). All three gates with high irreplaceability and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is embodied in Maren's question to Halse about southern constellations (quoted in diary) and her instinctive choice to look through the goggles at refracted light. The trait enables the decryption discovery and Halse's recognition of her as kin to Ulla. Present in setup and middle with one on-page cost (she must now carry the emotional weight of his hidden regard), but the trait could be more visibly tested under pressure in the present-tense frame.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Unfold" operates literally (Maren unfolds the diary pages in light) and metaphorically (she unfolds Halse's emotional layers and her own understanding). The action recurs across multiple beats—floors 5–9—and directly enables the decryption. It shapes the ending's resonance ("unfold its secrets") and is inseparable from the method. All three gates with strong beat involvement and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The scattered-light method is established early (floor 3: "refracted beams picked out certain ink strokes"), demonstrated actively in beats 2–4 (Maren holds pages in shifting light as the elevator climbs), and its mechanics—prismatic beams plus amber lenses—are irreplaceable for decryption. The method shapes every middle attempt and charges the closure (tenth-floor sunlight "struck the ice in every direction"). All three gates with high causal specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire provides the scattered light necessary for decryption (crystalline walls refract sunlight), constrains Maren's timeline (ten-floor ascent), and supplies the closure image (breaking through clouds into "blinding white"). The setting is not postcard—light quality changes per floor, enabling progressive revelation. All three gates; the spire's physics are integral to tactics and the final charged moment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ten-floor climb structures all beats: each numbered floor marks a diary entry and tightens Maren's emotional arc. Time is tracked concretely ("Third floor. Fourth.") and the ascent's linear pressure forces her to process Halse's revelations in real-time. The timeframe is present in setup, shapes middle escalation, and anchors the closure arrival. Solid causal work, though the elevator's pace is more symbolic clock than urgent constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation—seeking joy beneath anguish—is Halse's explicit project (diary: "the locked room… a window… the joy that was always underneath") and becomes Maren's inheritance. It is dramatized through her reading, her tears, and her final acceptance of the "weight" as vocation. The friction between melancholy and warmth charges multiple beats and the closure image. Present in all three gates with visible cost (she must carry what others refused), though the motivation is more mirrored than directly contested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Affectionate detachment is consistent throughout: Maren observes Halse's life with warmth but no sentimentality ("astronomers who barely noticed her hands"), the prose maintains measured distance even at emotional peaks ("Maren wiped her eyes with her sleeve"), and the closure balances intimacy (diary against ribs) with slight remove ("if diaries could feel anything at all"). Tone modulates subtly—warmer at discovery, cooler at philosophical reflection—and the amber-lens imagery charges the final beat without breaking register.</comment>
