<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is embodied through precise routines and the physical world—"each lost second as a small betrayal" grounds her diligence in sensation rather than abstraction. Her choice to seek the grandmother's instructions and chip obsidian emerges from consistent traits (precision, ethical devotion). The internal contradiction between fear of failure and incremental absolution through patience is present but could act more visibly in a single pivotal beat. No diagnostic label-speak mars the peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (tower winder, pendulum crack, coastal village). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: seven visits to the ridge, each chipping obsidian, layer the particulate metaphor until the new bob restores balance—closure arrives as Earned Stasis when "Balance restored is invisible," reweighting the premise with the felt cost of unnoticed labor. One meaningful deepening (completion of the alloy on the seventh visit) tightens the stake. The cost is legible in the final paragraph's quiet acknowledgment that no one thanks her, which the piece explicitly frames as "exactly right."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge constrains her method (only accessible at low tide, sharp enough to require careful hands) and charges the final image (the new bob as "a piece of the ridge itself"). The clock tower's brass fittings, pendulum, and crucible all function as tools that alter tactics. Sensory detail—"searing light," "dark mirrors," "molten line"—is selective and reflects her reverent focus. The micro-setting (body, ridge, tower) meets the 9+ gate test by constraining choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore the clock's accuracy to preserve shared time and balance) is signaled in the first third and tightens across seven visits. One meaningful turn occurs when she completes the alloy on the seventh visit, foreclosing the path of endless searching. The cost—her unacknowledged labor and the worn rake handle she carries as earned absolution—is visible in the final paragraph. Agency is decision and endurance; no coincidence resolves the problem. The trade-off (patience and precision against the village's oblivion) charges the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (incremental absolution, shared balance, invisible restoration) emerges from the alloy process and seven visits rather than statement. The final image—"the village kept its shared time, second by careful second, balanced on the edge of a black glass world"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The rake handle's inscriptions function as a recurring motif that reweights meaning at closure (worn smoother, "each word a particle of absolution"). No thematic echo or prompt-label intrudes. One hairline slip: "absolution is not a single dramatic forgiveness but an incremental process" in the backstory leans slightly didactic, though it remains tied to the grandmother's practical formulae.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, diction controlled and distinct ("ethically diligent to a degree that others...found excessive" reads as narrator coloring Maren's self-perception). Perceptual signature is selective: she notices seconds lost, gear oil measures, the pendulum's apex pause. The piece teaches its lyric compression early (the ridge as leviathan spine, tiny inscriptions) and pays it off at closure. One minor register drift: "sacred gap where time forgives itself for passing" elevates slightly beyond the established idiom but remains coherent with the reverie tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information density is high: "threaded through the practical notations, a stranger text" does three jobs (reveals dual content, introduces absolution theme, sets up later visits) in one clause. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the alloy completion and breathing in the final paragraph. One paraphrase loop near midpoint: the grandmother "had known about the ridge" follows a paragraph already establishing her inscriptions' content; the repetition adds little pressure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of clockwork repair, tidal obsidian, and incremental absolution feels specific and earned. The grandmother's rake-handle inscriptions transform the "old woman keeping hands busy" trope into a purposeful legacy. The piece avoids the generic "restoration of balance" by grounding it in the village's shared time and the invisible nature of correct function. One derivative element: the "luminous pause" and "infinitesimal moment of stillness before gravity reclaimed it" echoes common clockwork metaphors without fresh inflection. The closing image (black glass world, seconds balanced) offers a non-obvious synthesis that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices drive all key turns: she sends for a replacement, consults the rake handle, chips obsidian across seven visits, smelts the alloy, installs the bob. Her precision (winding, oiling, polishing schedules) constrains her method and shapes the ending when she walks through the village carrying the rake handle. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (obsidian collection), and closure (installation and walk).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pendulum bob appears in setup (crack discovered), middle (melted with obsidian), and closure (new bob installed, pendulum swings without losing seconds). Its crack creates the inciting problem; the new bob's "veins of volcanic glass" reweights it as "a piece of the ridge itself." The final image of the pendulum's swing frames the village's restored balance. Irreplaceable: no other object could serve this function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Incremental absolution is dramatized through seven visits, each chipping obsidian and reading a line from the rake handle; the grandmother's text explicitly frames absolution as "particle by particle, like sediment becoming stone." This shapes Maren's method (patience, measured drops, careful hands) and the ending acknowledges "each word a particle of absolution she had earned." It alters tactics (multiple visits rather than a single retrieval) and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ethical diligence is shown through precise routines (exact intervals, measured oil drops, third-Tuesday polishing) and constrains her response to the crack: she cannot ignore two lost seconds per day. It enables her choice to seek an older answer rather than accept the foundry's refusal. Present in setup and middle, but the trait itself does not pay off visibly at closure beyond the walk through the village. One beat short of full causal involvement in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Emerge" governs the alloy's creation ("emerged from the crucible black and gleaming") and the theme's arrival ("emerges from events, images, and motifs"). The new bob's emergence enables the resolution. However, the verb itself could be swapped for "arose" or "appeared" with minor edits; the concept is more integral than the exact word. Setup and closure presence, but the action is not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rake handle is signaled early (first third: grandmother's broken rake handle with tiny inscriptions), its mechanics matter across the middle (formulae for smelting, ratios, absolution text read on each visit), and it appears at closure (carried in coat pocket, inscriptions worn smoother). It shapes her method (following exact ratios, seven visits to read each line) and its progressive wear tracks cost. Removing it would break the story's causality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The obsidian ridge supplies the essential resource (shards for the alloy), constrains access (only visible at low tide, twice daily), and pressures her method (careful chipping, seven visits). It charges the final image: the new bob as "a piece of the ridge itself, torn from the earth's dark spine." Present in setup (revealed twice daily), middle (chipping across visits), and closure (tide returns, ridge vanishes, bob hangs). The ridge's tidal rhythm mirrors the pendulum's swing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pendulum's pause is invoked twice with strong specificity: "that infinitesimal moment of stillness before gravity reclaimed it" during the seventh visit, and "the pendulum swung and paused and swung again" at installation. The pause frames her suspended reverie on the ridge and the "sacred gap where time forgives itself." It does not tighten a mid-story decision but it charges the closure image. Two-beat involvement; closure linkage present but the timeframe itself does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The desire to restore shared balance is dramatized through her response to the crack (felt as "small betrayal," "debt accumulating"), drives her obsidian collection and alloy work, and is fulfilled at closure when "the village kept its shared time." The friction between her devotion and the village's oblivion (no one thanks her, "which was exactly right") creates a visible cost. Present in setup, middle, and closure with clear trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Searing reverie is embodied in "searing light off the obsidian made her eyes water," "everything took on the quality of reverie," and "luminous pause...suspended." The tone modulates: precise and controlled in the tower sections, expansive and incandescent on the ridge, quiet and satisfied in the final paragraph. It charges the closure image ("balanced on the edge of a black glass world") without static repetition. Coherent through all turns.</comment>
