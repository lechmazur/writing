<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's perceptual particularity—filtering by texture rather than meaning—is concrete and drives her collecting behavior with clear internal logic. The notebook work and eavesdropping show micro-choices under her erasure constraint. However, the final choice to write her own fragment lacks sufficient friction or cost; it reads as therapeutic closure rather than a decision that forecloses a live alternative. The piece earns strong marks for embodied interiority but the ending renunciation arrives without sufficient visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by the opening paragraphs (death certificate, morgue, container yard). The accumulative lens is inferred and held: layering fragments builds pressure through density increase until the protagonist adds her own story, creating a pattern break that reweights her stake. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she chooses to remain erased and finds presence in that choice—but the cost is more asserted than shown; "more present than she had ever been" tells the reconfiguration rather than dramatizing a visible forfeiture. One meaningful deepening occurs, satisfying length scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vivid, purposeful, and actively shapes her routines (tides dictate access, acoustic privacy from crane noise). The blue container, spigot, charity kitchen, and seawall are concrete anchors. Sensory detail—salt air, rust, formaldehyde—filters through her perceptual bias. The environment constrains her movements and charges the final image of "steel and salt" surrounding her archaeology, meeting the 9+ gate test for setting integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering textural verification of memory in a world that has erased her—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through her listening, notebook layering, and the questions in margins. The turn to writing her own fragment is a deepening, not a reversal, and it narrows her stance by committing to third person ("a claim she no longer had authority to make"). However, the cost of that choice remains oblique; we see no tactical alteration or visible sacrifice, only asserted emotional reward. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens but the final trade-off lacks sharp edge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: erased identity, the reliability of unwitnessed memory, and presence through collection. The notebook margins ("What does it feel like to be remembered?") and the poison-bottle label as proof of a night's reality are concrete motifs that avoid thesis-statement preaching. The ending offers a resonant answer—she becomes more present by documenting absence—without overt moralizing. The third-person choice and the final line ("more present than she had ever been when she was officially alive") skirt thematic echo but earn it through prior layering. Minor penalty for the slightly over-articulated final assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steadily with tight perceptual filtering: she understands conversations "by their texture," not meaning. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("the grain of a whispered confession, the smooth coolness of a practiced lie"). The single POV never leaks. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close sensory detail and brief reflective pulls. The overheard dialogue fragments (Aram, the customs inspector, the ship's engineer) are rendered with subtext and goal-driven implication. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the prose rhythm tightens appropriately under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. The opening ("They declared her dead on a Tuesday") anchors voice and stakes immediately. Minor loop: "erased from every official history" and "every database that mattered" restate the same concept across adjacent lines. A template-cadence run appears mid-piece: "A dockworker named… A customs inspector whose… A ship's engineer who…" across three consecutive paragraphs, though each portrait adds distinct content. One stock phrase: "corrugated steel" and "salt air" are functional but unearned. No muddy metaphors or major artifacts touch the closure beat, so non-closure accumulation cap applies: −0.6 for the template run, placing the score in the strong 7-range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—bureaucratic erasure forcing life among "dead places"—transforms a familiar invisibility trope through the container-yard setting and the textural-perception lens. The poison-bottle label (borrowed from an overheard story) as proof of invisible history is a fresh, specific detail. The choice to write in third person because first "felt like a claim she no longer had authority to make" is a non-obvious synthesis of erasure and voice. However, the emotional arc (invisible woman finds deeper presence through documentation) follows a recognizable template, and the safety of the ending—affirmation without sharp cost—hedges risk. The piece earns originality through specificity and perceptual angle but does not fully escape the comfort zone.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The death certificate error survivor is present from the opening and frames the entire premise. Her choice to "stay among the dead places" rather than correct the error is a key decision that enables all subsequent action. The final turn—writing her own fragment and choosing third person—traces directly to her erased status. She appears in three beats: morgue waking, container life, notebook closure. However, the final choice lacks sharp consequence; it is contemplative rather than tactical. Gates: setup (paragraph 1), development (container routines shaped by erasure), payoff (writes her own story). Causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, beat involvement (3+) +1.4, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The poison-bottle label appears once, in a single overheard anecdote: the ship's engineer carries it as proof his brother's suicide attempt happened. It is a vivid, thematically resonant detail—unwitnessed history needing material proof—but it does not recur or alter any choice. The protagonist does not handle it, and it does not return in the closure image. Gates: setup (absent; arrives mid-piece), development (ornamental; no middle choice constrained), payoff (absent from ending). Single beat +0.4, thematic coherence +0.3, but ornamental use −0.7, late first appearance −0.3, swappability −0.5 (any memento could serve the same function). Base 3.0 + 0.4 + 0.3 − 1.5 = 2.2, but the thematic charge and specificity lift it slightly: 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Erased histories shape every beat: her death certificate propagates through "systems that do not forgive clerical errors," voiding her identity; she collects fragments of vanished lives because her own past "became a fabric she could not verify by touch"; the closure hinges on writing her erasure in third person because first person "felt like a claim she no longer had authority to make." The concept constrains her tactics (living off-grid, listening rather than speaking) and charges the final image ("private archaeology of erased histories"). Gates: all three. Causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, beat involvement (entire piece) +1.4, specificity +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.1 = 8.1, rounded to 8.6 for irreplaceability and felt cost in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently" is signaled early ("understood conversations not by their meaning but by their texture") and enables her core tactic: collecting story fragments by listening for grain and coolness rather than semantic content. It constrains her social options (she cannot correct the error because she processes bureaucracy texturally, not logically) and charges the ending (third person as textural humility). Gates: setup (paragraph 3), development (listening at high tide), payoff (third-person choice reflects her filter). Causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.9, beat involvement (2) +0.9, early signal +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3, lifted by specificity to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Layering is the action that defines the piece: she layers overheard fragments in her notebook, builds "composite portraits," and finally layers her own fragment atop the stack. The action drives the middle (collecting Aram's, the inspector's, the engineer's stories) and the closure (placing her own notebook "on the stack with the others"). It is irreplaceable; no other action could support the mosaic structure or the final reconfiguration. Gates: all three. Causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, beat involvement (entire piece) +1.4, specificity +0.8, early signal +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.6 = 8.6, minor swappability concern (stacking vs. layering) −0.2 = 8.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories is signaled early ("She listened. That was how she built her world now") and executed across multiple beats: eavesdropping on longshoremen, customs agents, the ship's engineer. The method shapes her tactics (moving during high tide for solitude, positioning near workers at low tide) and culminates in the closure when she adds her own fragment to the collection. The mechanics are shown, not merely asserted. Gates: all three. Causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, beat involvement (3+) +1.4, early signal +0.7. Base 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7, lifted by irreplaceability to 8.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly rendered and actively shapes her choices: "corridors formed between them, narrow and echoing, reconfiguring with every shipment so that the labyrinth never held the same shape twice." The tides control access (high water grants solitary passage, low tide brings workers she can overhear). Her blue container near the seawall is a concrete anchor. The setting charges the final image: "labyrinth of steel and salt, surrounded by the murmuring cargo of other people's lives." Gates: all three. Causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, beat involvement (entire piece) +1.4, early signal +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.4 = 7.4, rounded to 7.9 for micro-setting detail (spigot, charity kitchen) that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tides are signaled early ("Across the rhythm of tides, she measured her days") and structure her routines: high water empties the yard for solitary movement, low tide brings workers for eavesdropping. The timeframe appears in one evening closure beat ("One evening at high tide, water lapping at the container's steel floor"). However, the tides do not tighten a decision or create urgency; they provide rhythm, not pressure. Gates: setup (paragraph 2), development (tidal access mentioned), payoff (evening high tide frames writing scene). Beat involvement (2) +0.9, causal enabling +0.6, early signal +0.5, but no cost connection −0.3, no escalation −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.2 = 4.2, lifted by closure framing to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of memories" is articulated mid-piece and shown in action: she collects fragments to "feel whether they were rough or silk," compensating for her own unreliable, unverifiable past. The desire drives her notebook work and the final choice to write her own scene "with the honesty she had learned from eavesdropping." Friction appears in the margin questions ("Is a history that no one can corroborate still real?") and the third-person constraint. Gates: all three. Causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.2, beat involvement (2) +0.9, early signal +0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.6 = 6.6, lifted by visible cost (third-person renunciation) to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Nameless identity as tone is coherent and sustained: she is "a woman the world had already finished mourning," living in "dead places, where no one checked names," and writes in third person because first "felt like a claim she no longer had authority to make." The tone modulates with pressure—quiet in the tidal description, sharpening in the margin questions, resolving in the final assertion of presence without recognition. The tone charges the closure image: "She had no name the world would recognize." Gates: all three. Coherence +1.0, closure charge +1.4, modulation +0.8, early signal +0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8, rounded to 8.1 for tonal integrity across the entire piece.</comment>
