<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mirael's interior is vivid and grounded: her sensory map-reading through skin creates embodied contradiction ("gasped," "teeth"), and the stillpoint revelation lands with earned emotional weight (loneliness, rage, stubborn love). The final choice—drawing the map as melody and carrying silence "like a seed"—forecloses her forty-year search with visible cost. Minor slips: the reflective block on her emotional geography ("never once located herself") verges on diagnostic label-speak, though it's anchored to present action. The weeping and kneeling read genuine, not performed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mirael reaches the stillpoint, feels everything she suppressed, and etches the first map with musical notation—a decisive reweighting of her cartographic quest with felt cost (forty years mapping externals, never herself). The lens is Accumulative/Textural: dowsing steps accumulate sensory density (C to E-flat turns, quartz hum) until silence breaks the pattern, and the final "Here" title reconfigures all prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs on-page. Orientation anchors (blind cartographer, ultrasonic forest, platinum ring) arrive early. The "pause of shifting constellations" metaphor introduces minor time vagueness but doesn't obscure causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest constrains navigation (scrambled compasses, disorienting emissions) and charges the closure: the sentinel pine's bark transmits the musical map, the quartz ridge hums against her shins, and the stillpoint's "oceanic silence" reweights all prior noise. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mirael's blindness (touch, vibration, temperature dominate; no visual cues). The body-as-setting (her palms absorbing language, bones aching) functions as micro-setting. Minor slip: "constellations above shifted in their ancient precession" is visually oriented for a blind POV, though it reads as lyric compression rather than POV leakage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—locating the stillpoint as emotional coordinate—is signaled early and tightens through dowsing steps that narrow options (veer left, descend, climb). The resolution is protagonist-driven: Mirael's absorbed tree-language and resonance compass lead her to silence, where she confronts suppressed loneliness and rage, then etches the map with visible cost (forty years seeking external validation, now titled simply "Here"). One meaningful deepening (sensory accumulation to absolute silence) suffices at this length. The platinum ring's resonance mechanic and the forest's ultrasonic pressure create genuine escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—mapping interior geography versus exterior conquest—emerges through Mirael's dowsing, the musical notation replacing coordinates, and the final "Here" title that reweights her forty-year cartographic career without stating a moral. The stillpoint as "emotional coordinate" and the silence carrying forward "like a seed" offer resonant, non-literal answers. Subtext operates in the compass needle "pointing nowhere and everywhere" and the forest's song as "map." Minor risk: "stubborn, quiet blaze of love" in the silence paragraph verges on abstract, though the surrounding embodied grief (weeping, rage, loneliness) anchors it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable and controlled; Mirael's perceptual signature (touch, vibration, temperature) is distinct and consistent. The prose shifts register under pressure: sensory density increases ("harmonic relationships stacked in impossible chords") as she nears the stillpoint, then simplifies at closure ("Here"). Filter verbs ("felt," "suspected") are voice-motivated and fit the reflective tone. Minor slip: "constellations above shifted" implies visual access for a blind character, though it reads as lyric compression of elapsed time rather than true POV leakage. Diction remains within her cartographer's lexicon throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short beats at the stillpoint: "Absolute, oceanic silence. She stood in the stillpoint."); information density is high (compass ring mechanics, dowsing, musical intervals all advance plot). Zero paraphrase loops. Minor overwriting: "the language she had absorbed from the bark began to resolve" and "the language that flooded her" within three paragraphs recycle "language" without added pressure. The final "carrying the silence inside her like a seed" risks stock metaphor but earns its place through prior musical-map logic. "Ancient precession" and "liminal breath" add elevated diction in peak beats without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blind cartographer absorbing languages through skin and translating tree-song into musical notation is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The stillpoint as emotional coordinate rather than physical location transforms the quest trope through specific detail (platinum resonance compass, interval-by-interval navigation). The musical-map closure—notation instead of coordinates—feels inevitable in hindsight. Minor proximity concern: "stubborn, quiet blaze" and "carrying the silence inside her like a seed" echo familiar lyric phrasing. The piece commits fully to its synesthetic premise without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirael's blindness and skin-language ability drive every beat: she traces bark (setup), dowses by touch (middle), and draws the musical map at closure. Her choices—following the resonance needle, parsing tree intervals, kneeling to etch—create the key turns. Removing her would break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The platinum compass ring appears in setup ("pointed toward resonance"), middle (needle swings southeast, guiding her into deep timber), and closure (goes still "pointing nowhere and everywhere" when she arrives). It constrains navigation and charges the ending image with reweighted meaning (arrival = omnidirectional pointing). Two functional beats plus closure payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The stillpoint shapes every tactic: Mirael's theory (emotional coordinate), the resonance compass pointing toward it, the dowsing steps, and the silence scene where she confronts forty years of loneliness. The closure—titling the map "Here"—crystallizes the concept with undeniable cost. Removing it collapses plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Absorbing languages through skin enables the inciting action (pressing hand to sentinel pine), drives middle navigation (parsing tree-song intervals: C to E-flat, G-flat to A), and supplies the closure mechanic (drawing musical notation). Visible cost: she gasps under the flood of intervals, her bones ache from ultrasonic pressure. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dowsing is the core action: setup (arms extended, palms open), middle (step-by-step following currents), and closure (kneeling to draw after the dowsing completes). It defines her method, differentiates her from sighted cartographers, and enables the stillpoint discovery. Swapping it would require total structural rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The musical-note trail is signaled early (trees sing a map), operationalized in middle beats (C to E-flat: veer left; E-flat to G-flat: descend; G-flat to A: climb), and resolves at closure (she etches musical notation, titling it "Here"). Mechanics matter: intervals guide navigation and replace coordinates. Removing this method breaks causality and the synesthetic premise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest pressures every choice: disorienting emissions scramble instruments (setup), thickened roar felt in teeth forces dowsing navigation (middle), and the sentinel pine's bark delivers the map-language. The silence at the stillpoint charges the closure. Environment supplies the problem (unmappable interior) and the solution (musical intervals). Essential across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "pause of shifting constellations" appears once mid-story ("Hours passed, or perhaps years. The constellations above shifted...") and supplies lyric compression of elapsed time, creating a liminal quality that supports theme. It does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page, and the vague "hours or years" softens urgency. Present in one beat, thematic resonance only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Mirael's desire to locate herself emotionally is dramatized: she believes the stillpoint is "interior geography of grief and wonder" (setup), pursues it despite physical pain (middle friction), and confronts loneliness, rage, and love in the silence (closure with visible cost). Her forty-year external mapping versus internal void creates the conflict. Want and cost are inseparable; removing this motive collapses stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tone is coherent: restrained wonder at the tree-song, escalating sensory intensity ("bones ached," "blood sang"), stillness at the silence beat, and quiet resolve in the final walk back. "Stubborn, quiet blaze of love" and "carrying the silence inside her like a seed" anchor the tone in the closure image. Modulates with pressure (crescendo to silence to resumption) without tonal whiplash.</comment>
