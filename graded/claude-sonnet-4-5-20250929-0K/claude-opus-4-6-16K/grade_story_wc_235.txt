<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied—jealousy of past selves and "feral" nostalgia drive contradictory impulses that act simultaneously in scene. The gravestone discovery and dream-transcription anchor motivated choices throughout. Internal conflict between cataloguing dreams and the "chronological confusion" is sustained, though the final beat ("The grave could have its dates. She would keep the dreams") edges toward assertion rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Backstory/reflection is substantial (~25–30%) but remains anchored to present stimuli (the scroll, the window, the pen) and interleaved with on-page micro-choices (unrolling the scroll, picking up the pen, writing down the howl).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Anchors (who, where, when) arrive by ~80 words; orientation is clean. The ending offers a clear before/after—Maren shifts from being consumed by temporal confusion to claiming the dreams as hers, reweighting the gravestone's authority—but the cost is more asserted ("she felt the feral thing in her chest howl") than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible price. One meaningful deepening occurs (the soaring dream reframes her relationship to time and selfhood), and the lens holds. Closure lands on the page, but the conceptual cost remains oblique rather than undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cabin (pine resin, rough-hewn table, single window) and the Cascade Range anchor setting early and purposefully. The birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting, handled twice (unrolling, writing) and charged at closure. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("brutal and indifferent and staggeringly beautiful," "last light caught the snowline and turned it gold"). The scroll and the gravestone constrain Maren's choices (cataloguing vs. surrender), and the final image of writing charges the scroll with new weight. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting subtly guides the stance crystallization at the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: distilling chaos into narrative versus surrendering to temporal confusion. Pressure accumulates through the gravestone discovery, dream-memory blurring, and the soaring dream, culminating in the decision to "keep the dreams." One meaningful deepening occurs when the soaring sensation follows her out of sleep and reframes her relationship to time. Agency is present (she picks up the pen, writes), but the final choice feels more like endurance than a trade-off with visible cost. The tightening is legible under the Accumulative lens, and "jaded wonder" operates as a persistent constraint that shapes the final stance, though no live option is explicitly foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—mortality, consciousness, and the impossibility of ordering chaos—emerges organically from the birch bark scroll, the gravestone, and the soaring dream. "Jaded wonder" and "feral nostalgia" accumulate pressure without thesis statements. The final lines ("The grave could have its dates. She would keep the dreams") offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how to live with the knowledge of your endpoint) without moralizing. Subtext operates in the image of the "thermal" and the distinction between flying and soaring. The ending reweights prior material (the scroll, the jealousy, the howl) with quiet force, and the conceptual cost—accepting impermanence while refusing to stop recording—is felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and intimate, with controlled psychic distance. Voice is distinct—elevated, lyric, with a philosophical bent ("cosmic joke of consciousness," "grief and wonder had fused into a single updraft")—and modulates with emotional intensity. Perceptual signature is strong: Maren notices dreams, time, and selfhood through the lens of her cataloguing practice. No head-hopping. Elision is purposeful (we don't see the initial gravestone moment, only its aftermath), and the compression serves the accumulative design. Filter verbs ("she'd dream," "she could still feel") are voice-motivated and legible. Diction remains within Maren's plausible lexicon (chronicler, thermal, soar vs. fly). Rhythm tightens under pressure in the final paragraph without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, information-dense, and propulsive. Figurative language ("time had become unreliable," "getting jealous of past selves was… a particular kind of poison," "feral thing in her chest") is frequent but purposeful and coherent. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. One minor scaffold line: "Dream by dream, she was building something. Not a monument. Not a legacy. Just a record…" reads as rhythmic emphasis rather than churn. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the scroll and howl motifs. Clarity and concision are strong; no filter-verb stacks or register drift. Zero loops or muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—lucid dream chronicler confronting her own grave, temporal confusion as liberation, jealousy of past selves—feels specific and non-obvious. "Feral nostalgia" and "jaded wonder" are fresh coinages that deepen the emotional texture. The distinction between "flying" and "soaring" is elegant and thematically earned. Tropes (cabin in the mountains, a character alone with their work) are transformed through Maren's particular lens. The final image (writing down the howl) feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (heavy reflection, accumulative pressure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous lines; voice and vision cohere.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren (lucid dream chronicler) is introduced early and her chronicling practice shapes two key beats: unrolling the scroll and picking up the pen at the end. Her decision to "keep the dreams" is the closure action. The trait constrains her response to temporal confusion (she writes rather than flees) and charges the final image. Present in setup, middle (scroll unrolling), and payoff (writing the howl). Causal pressure is moderate—her identity as chronicler enables the closure stance but does not narrow options with sharp cost. Two-gate minimum met; three-gate eligibility reached. Specificity is high (fifteen years of lucid dreaming, birch bark scroll). Cost is implied (she accepts the grave's authority while claiming her record) but not sharply dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll appears in setup ("unrolled the birch bark scroll"), is handled in the middle ("its surface already covered in her cramped handwriting"), and returns at closure ("she picked up her pen and began to write again"). It functions as both record and micro-setting, constraining Maren's choices (to catalogue or surrender). Two distinct beats (unrolling, writing again) with a charged reprise at the end. The scroll's "continuous record" property is specific and irreplaceable. Causal pressure: her relationship to the scroll shifts from confusion to commitment. Closure linkage is strong—the final writing act is the resolution. Cost is tied to the scroll (she chooses recording over certainty). Early signal, beat involvement (two touches), closure linkage, and specificity all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" is named explicitly and described ("not the gentle kind that warms you at holidays, but something with teeth—a wild, aching hunger for selves she could no longer reach"). It shapes Maren's internal conflict (jealousy of past selves) and is echoed in the "feral thing in her chest" at closure. However, it does not constrain a specific on-page choice with visible cost—it remains a thematic texture rather than a tactical pressure. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is atmospheric rather than causal. Lyric reprise (first third → final line) reweights the stake. Two-gate minimum met. Specificity is high ("with teeth," "wild, aching hunger"). Cost is felt but oblique.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is introduced early ("Time had become unreliable," "chronologically confused now in a way that felt almost liberating") and recurs in the middle ("she couldn't tell which dreams she'd had last week and which she'd transcribed a decade ago"). It enables the soaring dream ("she had been all her ages at once") and shapes her final stance (accepting temporal scrambling while continuing to record). Two distinct beats (confusion about dream dates, all-ages dream). Present in setup, middle, and implied at payoff. Causal pressure is moderate—the trait alters perception but does not force a sharp trade-off. Cost is oblique (she surrenders linear time but gains "liberating" confusion). Specificity is high. Three-gate eligibility reached.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Soar" appears once in a key beat (the meadow dream: "she had begun to soar. Not fly—soar"). The distinction is thematically charged and carries forward into the closure ("that buoyancy, as if grief and wonder had fused into a single updraft"). It reframes Maren's relationship to time and selfhood, enabling the final stance. Present in middle (dream) and payoff (buoyancy felt at closure). One distinct beat with a charged reprise. Causal pressure: the soaring sensation "followed her out of sleep" and primes the decision to write. Closure linkage is strong—the "thermal" and "upward pull" recur in the final paragraph. Specificity is high (soar vs. fly). Cost is implied (surrender to a thermal). Two-gate minimum met; lyric reprise qualifies.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Getting jealous of past selves" is introduced early ("She'd dream of herself at nineteen… and she'd wake up jealous. Genuinely, corrosively jealous") and described as "a particular kind of poison—it turned every version of you into a rival." It shapes Maren's internal conflict and recurs in the middle ("she'd wake up envious of that carelessness too"). Present in setup and middle; payoff is implied (the final stance accepts all versions without jealousy). Two beats (jealousy of nineteen-year-old self, jealousy of thirty-year-old self). Causal pressure is moderate—it intensifies her temporal confusion but does not force a sharp choice. Cost is felt (she is "corrosively jealous") but not tied to a forfeited option. Specificity is high ("turned every version of you into a rival"). Two-gate minimum met.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin is introduced early ("The cabin smelled like pine resin and old ink") and recurs throughout (rough-hewn table, single window, "alone in the cabin"). The setting constrains Maren's choices (isolation enables reflection; the window frames the Cascade Range, which triggers "jaded wonder"). Two distinct beats (unrolling the scroll at the table, watching the snowline through the window). Present in setup, middle, and payoff ("Outside, the last light caught the snowline"). Causal pressure is moderate—the cabin's isolation and altitude "loosened something feral in her memory." Closure linkage: the final paragraph integrates the cabin, window, and mountains. Specificity is high ("pine resin and old ink," "rough-hewn table"). Cost is oblique (solitude sharpens confusion). Three-gate eligibility reached.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after seeing your own grave") is introduced early ("she'd stood before the granite marker bearing her own name, her own dates—born and died, the second date only three years from now") and recurs in the middle ("The gravestone had made it worse. Or maybe better"). It shapes the dominant stake (how to live with the knowledge of your endpoint) and is implied at closure ("The grave could have its dates"). Two beats (initial shock, reflection on its effect). Present in setup, middle, and payoff. Causal pressure: seeing the grave scrambles Maren's timeline and primes her final stance. Closure linkage is strong—the grave is referenced in the final lines. Specificity is high (three years from now). Cost is felt (temporal confusion, "feral" nostalgia). Two-gate minimum met; lyric reprise qualifies.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to distill the chaos of a thousand recorded dreams into something resembling narrative" is stated early and recurs in the middle ("Dream by dream, she was building something. Not a monument. Not a legacy. Just a record"). It drives the closure action (picking up the pen and writing). Two distinct beats (scroll unrolling, final writing). Present in setup, middle, and payoff. Causal pressure: the desire to distill chaos conflicts with temporal confusion and primes the final stance (accepting chaos while continuing to record). Closure linkage is strong—the final act is writing. Specificity is moderate (the motivation is stated rather than dramatized through a trade-off). Cost is oblique (she accepts that "the scroll would not save her" but writes anyway). Three-gate eligibility reached.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Jaded wonder" is named explicitly ("jaded wonder—that was what she'd started calling this feeling in her notes") and defined ("The capacity to be astonished by a world you no longer trusted"). It modulates throughout: the mountains trigger it each morning, and it recurs in the closure beat ("she watched with eyes that had seen too much and somehow not nearly enough"). Present in setup, middle, and payoff. Two distinct beats (mountains at morning, final snowline image). Causal pressure: the tone shapes Maren's stance toward time and mortality. Closure linkage is strong—the final paragraph embodies jaded wonder ("the feral thing in her chest howl its beautiful, inconsolable howl"). Specificity is high. Cost is felt (she cannot escape the tension between astonishment and distrust). Three-gate eligibility reached; tone charges the final image.</comment>
