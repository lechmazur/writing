<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's skeptic-affectionate stance is established early and embodied throughout ("Show me the peer review," holding on despite doubt). Her micro-choices under pressure—adjusting the sliver, tracking somatic markers, refusing easy answers—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost. Jonah's transformation is well-dramatized through concrete symptoms (fractally precise pupils, flinching at proximity) rather than labels. Minor gap: the progression from initial hopelessness to measured recovery could show one more contradictory impulse acting simultaneously in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; density increases through weeks of studio work, pattern discovery, and photo accumulation until the final exchange reweights the premise with felt cost (his doubt, her steady presence, the hopeful but fragile closure image). Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: options crystallize ("I don't know if this is working" / "That's just you" / "I'm always the data") and the shutter-click finale reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure even as outcome remains uncertain. Orientation anchors cleanly (Maren, studio, post-shock), one meaningful deepening occurs, and cost is legible in his grip, her patience, and the twelve-percent improvement that carries no guarantee. One hairline slip: the transition from recall announcement to studio work compresses weeks without a single on-page obstacle or tactical shift mid-process, slightly flattening escalation texture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The studio environment actively constrains and enables: blackout curtains soothe Jonah, muscovite's layered silicate properties matter mechanically (splitting light into spectral whispers, dendrite patterns), and micro-setting elements (fiber-optic wand, penlight, worktable geode) are handled across beats and charge the final shutter-click image. Spatial choreography remains clear (Jonah seated in dark center, Maren moving the sliver through space). The fractally precise irises and muscovite refractions create a tight visual motif that constrains her method and charges closure without becoming ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover Jonah's boundaries from telepathic bleed—is signaled early and tightens through weeks of studio work. One meaningful deepening occurs in the final exchange: his doubt ("I don't know if this is working") tests her commitment, and her response ("I'm always the data") forecloses retreat with visible emotional cost (holding on despite uncertainty). Agency is renunciation and endurance rather than decisive cure, fitting the Accumulative lens. Minor limitation: the middle section compresses weeks without showing a single failed adjustment or tactical pivot that would demonstrate escalating difficulty before the final poise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—mapping brokenness into navigability through patient, embodied method versus certainty—emerges from concrete studio work and somatic tracking without thesis statements. The final exchange ("That's not data" / "I'm always the data") and shutter-click image offer a resonant, non-literal answer: presence and slow cartography replace cure, reweighting prior material with fragile hope and undeniable cost. Muscovite and neural-map photographs constrain method and charge closure without symbolic convenience. One exceptional touch: "I'm always the data" transforms skepticism into intimate method without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren's perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: "affectionate skeptic," "ask for your sources," clinical observation layered with intimacy. Diction remains controlled and purposeful ("fractally precise," "dendrites of refracted color," "willow glass") within her artist-researcher idiom. Dialogue feels natural and advances goals with subtext (the final exchange carries weight in implication). Minor slip: "belief had always been his currency, spent freely and without receipts" and "stubbornly, persistently luminous" edge toward elevated phrasing that slightly exceeds immediate embodied perception under pressure, though they remain voice-plausible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high (most lines do multiple jobs), and figurative language (fractally precise, dendrites, willow glass) remains coherent and tied to concrete action. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor texture slip: "the slow, patient work of mapping what was broken until it began to resemble something navigable, something like a way home" in the penultimate paragraph slightly abstracts the closure stakes that the final shutter-click image then re-concretizes, creating a brief momentum dip before recovery. Scaffold-free and propulsive otherwise.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—light-painting studio as neurological recovery lab, somatic markers isolated through refracted wavelengths, muscovite as signal filter—feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding telepathy-pill template outcomes. The transformation of tropes (telepathy recall into embodied cartography rather than cure-quest) is earned through grounded detail (galvanic skin response, micro-expressions, dendritic photo maps). The final image reweights premise without safety-hedging: no full recovery promised, only the stubborn work of presence. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, quiet ending with Charged Poise) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting +0.3 within-band bonus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's "affectionate skeptic" trait is seeded early (coffee laugh, "Show me the peer review"), constrains middle tactics (reads Damasio, tracks somatic markers rather than accepting vague hope), and charges the final exchange where skepticism transforms into intimate method ("I'm always the data"). Her choices create the key turn from hopelessness to measured cartography. Present in setup, middle choice-shaping, and closure; causal pressure and irreplaceability evident. Cost: weeks of patient work without guarantee.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The muscovite geode sliver is handled in multiple beats (penlight examination, angled during exposures, moved through space nightly) and its layered-silicate properties mechanically enable the method (splits light into spectral whispers, creates dendritic patterns). Returns with reweighted meaning in the final shutter-click image where scattered light paints "branching, hopeful lines." Setup, middle beats, and closure linkage all present; high specificity (only muscovite's translucent layering works) and causal pressure (without it, the mapping method fails). Cost: the fragile, persistent process depends on this exact object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Synapsin recall frames the inciting crisis (static shock, neurological cascade, telepathic bleed) and constrains recovery options (no cure, unmapped territory forces Maren's improvised method). Present in setup and implicitly throughout middle (the bleed is the problem she addresses), though the pill itself vanishes after framing. Payoff: the final poise acknowledges no pharmaceutical fix, only slow cartography. Two-gate presence (setup, closure implication) with clear causal role; swappable with other neurological injury premises but the telepathy-bleed specificity does sharpen the somatic-marker solution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears in Jonah's pupils post-shock, muscovite's dendritic photo patterns, and implicitly in the final "branching, hopeful lines." The trait constrains method (Maren seeks pattern in chaos) and charges closure imagery without becoming ornamental. Setup, middle use (photo maps described as fractally branching), and closure reprise all present. Cost: the precision is symptom and solution, both fragile and essential. Irreplaceability moderate (other geometric terms could substitute, but fractal recursion fits the neural/crystal parallel tightly).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Devise a method no one had tried" is the story's central action, seeded when Maren "decided to devise" after noticing light-response patterns. Drives all middle beats (reading Damasio, designing studio sessions, tracking somatic markers) and culminates in the final cartography that offers poise, not cure. Setup, development, and payoff all present with high causal pressure; removing this action collapses the entire middle and closure. Cost: weeks of experimental labor with no guarantee. Irreplaceability: the method's specificity (light + somatic markers) makes "devise" indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Somatic markers are seeded via Damasio reading, explained as "the body's own signaling system, the gut feelings and skin-prickles," then used on-page (heart rate, galvanic skin response, micro-expressions tracked nightly). Method shapes middle tactics and validates progress in the final exchange ("your heart rate's down twelve percent"). Setup, middle use, and closure validation all present. Mechanics matter: without somatic tracking, Maren has no signal to isolate. Cost: data-driven patience without certainty. Moderate swappability (other biofeedback methods could substitute, but somatic markers' embodied specificity fits the theme).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The light-painting studio supplies blackout curtains that soothe Jonah, enables long-exposure method, houses the muscovite and camera, and appears in every middle beat and the final shutter-click image. Setup (studio introduced as "the only place Jonah still seemed calm"), development (nightly sessions there), and payoff (final "shutter clicked" in studio dark) all present. Causal pressure high: no other setting would permit this light-based recovery method. Cost: the studio becomes both sanctuary and laboratory, isolating them. Irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the static shock" is established in the opening (March Tuesday) and structures all subsequent action; the entire story unfolds in the unmapped recovery period. Setup clear, middle development implicit (weeks of studio work compress but remain post-shock), and closure sustains the timeframe (he still flinches some mornings, progress is incremental). The frame constrains options (no cure exists, only improvisation) and charges the poise ending where recovery remains partial. Two-gate presence with causal role; the timeframe is essential but does not tighten tactics beat-to-beat as a live clock would.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Illuminate hidden pathways" is dramatized through Maren's studio work (moving sliver, tracking responses, accumulating photo maps) and verbalized in backstory ("pattern by pattern, pathway by pathway, she began to illuminate hidden pathways"). Desire drives middle beats and culminates in the final exchange where illumination becomes "just you" / "I'm always the data," reweighting the motivation from scientific recovery to intimate presence. Setup, development (weeks of mapping), and closure reconfiguration all present. Cost: no certainty promised, only stubborn cartography. Friction: the motivation is stated more than shown conflicting with competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope"—fragile, precise, stubbornly luminous—coheres across the story: Maren's doubt layered with commitment, Jonah's "almost smiled," the twelve-percent improvement that carries no cure guarantee, and the final "fragile as willow glass, precise as fractals, and stubbornly, persistently luminous" image. Tone modulates with pressure (hopelessness at the recall, patient accumulation in middle, charged poise at end) without flatlining. Setup (her affectionate doubt), middle (the slow work), and payoff (the shutter-click finale) all tonally aligned. The exact phrase "willow glass" charges the final image with brittleness and light, making the tone indispensable to closure.</comment>
