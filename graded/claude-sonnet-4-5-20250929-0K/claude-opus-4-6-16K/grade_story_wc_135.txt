<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular—"every absence that had accumulated in her chest like silt in a channel"—and her choices (sorting fragments, accepting offerings, placing the valve) are earned by her vocational identity. Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous grief and professional focus, embodied through the valve she "turning it in her fingers during sleepless nights." The young woman's presence feels functional but brief; no secondary pressure complicates Maren's path, and the final choice (showing that gaps are part of the record) feels more thematic declaration than a path foreclosed with visible cost. Minor deduction for the ending leaning toward insight-statement rather than embodied renunciation or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Maren, Ivory Harbor, post-exile Tuesday). The piece reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through fishermen's offerings, the valve placement, and the final exchange; the cadence shift from solitary cataloging to communal fragment-gathering reweights the dominant stake (compiling fragments into meaning). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Maren's stance crystallizes in "the gaps are part of the record," and the final image ("the ocean continued its patient, fractured dictation") reconfigures her exile and return as ongoing work rather than restoration. Cost is conceptual and felt: she cannot restore what was lost, only acknowledge absence as data. One micro-turn when fishermen arrive; the tightening is legible and sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ivory harbor, swollen door, disordered archive, and green mooring posts create a setting in decay that mirrors Maren's work of navigating loss. The valve as micro-object constrains her gesture at closure (placing it beside Oran's name) and charges the final act. Sensory selection is purposeful: "wet mineral air," "streaked with years of neglect," "tarnished green." The archive's physical disorder (jumbled slides, cracked wax) supplies both obstacle and workspace, shaping her sorting tactic. The environment is not postcard; it presses choice and anchors the ending image of light on ivory and ocean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—compiling fragments into meaning—is signaled early and braided with navigating human absences (Oran's death). Pressure accumulates through the disordered archive, the fishermen's hesitant arrivals, and Maren's sorting; one meaningful deepening occurs when she tells the young woman "the gaps are part of the record," reconfiguring her task from restoration to acknowledgment. Agency is attention and endurance; the cost is conceptual (she cannot make it whole again) and felt in the valve's placement. No explicit antagonist or reversal, but the Accumulative lens holds and the tightening forecloses the fantasy of full restoration. Entering high 7s; lacks a visible trade-off or tactical price to reach 8.5+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—meaning built from fragments and absences as data—emerges organically through the archive work, the valve, and the fishermen's offerings. The final exchange ("the gaps are part of the record") answers the implicit question without moralizing; it reweights her exile as part of the ongoing dictation rather than a rupture to be healed. The ocean's "patient, fractured dictation" functions as a recurring image that shifts from exile's silencing to ongoing work. Subtext operates in Maren's silent handling of the valve and the young woman's slow nod. No thematic echo; the insight is earned through concrete cataloging and the placement gesture. The piece resists tidy closure and invites reflection on incompleteness as method.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, close to Maren's perceptual signature: she notices "green with algae," "ivory facade streaked," "turning it in her fingers"—details filtered through archival attention. Narrative distance is consistent; no head-hopping. The young woman's brief dialogue feels natural and purpose-driven; Maren's reply carries subtext (acceptance of limits). Diction fits a literate, reflective narrator without register drift; "reactively visionary" and "navigating absences was its own kind of literacy" read slightly elevated but remain voice-motivated and legible. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: shorter beats during the sorting, longer reflection on Oran. One minor filter stack ("felt every absence") acceptable in context. No POV leakage or elision that withholds known facts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density: "pale stone of the docks still glistening like bone left in the sun" does sensory, thematic, and tonal work simultaneously. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes. One paraphrase loop: "She had been gone seven years. Seven years since..." could condense, but the echo feels voice-motivated (−0.2). Figurative language ("silt in a channel," "pulled teeth," "patient, fractured dictation") is coherent and earned, not overwritten. No scaffolding, synonym churn, or template cadence. Grammar and punctuation are clean. The final line ("the listening was enough to hearten her") lands the core action but leans slightly toward summary; a more concrete image might sharpen closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of archivist as grief-worker, oceanic dictation, and fragments-as-methodology feels specific and non-obvious. The valve as proxy for unprocessed grief and the fishermen bringing their own fragments are fresh inflections on exile-and-return. However, the emotional arc—returning exile finds purpose by acknowledging loss—echoes familiar templates; transformation arises more from occupational detail (ocean-spray patterns, wax impressions) than from a bold premise twist. The reactively visionary method and "navigating absences" offer conceptual originality, but the story does not take a structural or perspectival risk that heightens stakes beyond the expected. Solid within-band freshness; lacks the synthesis inevitability or risk premium for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ocean-spray archivist: Maren's vocational identity drives every beat—she returns to the archive, sorts slides and wax impressions, accepts fishermen's offerings, places the valve, and articulates the gaps-as-record insight. Her sorting tactic ("staggered intervals") and final stance crystallize through archival logic. Setup in paragraph one, development across sorting beats, payoff in the dialogue and valve placement. The occupation is irreplaceable; removing it breaks the closure image and thematic weight. Cost is tied to her professional lens (she cannot restore, only catalog absence). High integration with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Herald's trumpet valve: introduced in paragraph four (Oran's proxy), handled physically ("turning it in her fingers"), and placed on the shelf beside Oran's name in the registry near the end. Two distinct beats (carrying/reflection, placement). The valve embodies unprocessed grief and functions as a fragment she compiles into the record. Its placement is the closure gesture that enacts her new understanding (gaps as data). Setup early, development through reflection, payoff at closure. The specific object is irreplaceable; a generic memento would lack the occupational and ceremonial specificity. Cost is relational and conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Navigated absences: the concept shapes every tactic—Maren catalogs "missing entries," acknowledges Oran's death as information she was denied, and tells the young woman "the gaps are part of the record." It appears in paragraph three ("navigating absences was its own kind of literacy"), structures the archive work (disorder as legible absence), and charges the ending stance. Setup by paragraph three, development through sorting and fishermen's offerings, payoff in the dialogue and final dictation image. The concept is not ornamental; it defines both problem and method, constraining her approach and enabling the Resonant Reconfiguration. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Reactively visionary: signaled in paragraph six ("seeing the pattern not by staring at it but by stepping away and returning with fresh eyes") and enacted through staggered sorting. The trait enables her method and mirrors the tide, but its constraint is implicit rather than dramatized with visible cost. Setup at midpoint, development through sorting description, modest payoff in the rhythm of work. One beat of enactment. The trait is specific but could be replaced with "patient" or "iterative" without breaking story logic. Functional integration; lacks causal pressure or a moment where this exact trait forecloses an option or charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Hearten: appears only in the final line ("the listening was enough to hearten her"). It names the emotional result of the work and closure stance, but does not drive a beat or constrain a choice. No setup, no development, payoff as summary label. The story would function identically if the line read "remind her" or "steady her." Present in closure but not causally active or reweighted; it labels rather than enacts. Swappable with a near-synonym. Late first appearance, summary-only use, and low irreplaceability cap the score despite closure proximity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Through staggered intervals: signaled in paragraph six ("Through staggered intervals, she sorted and re-sorted, spending an hour on one shelf before moving to another") and enacted across the archive work. The method shapes her tactic (approach and retreat mirroring tide) and is thematically tied to her reactively visionary trait. Setup at midpoint, development through the sorting description, modest payoff in the rhythm that restores coherence. One extended beat. The method is specific and purposeful but does not constrain a key choice or charge the final image directly; her success follows from patience rather than from this exact interval pattern. Functional integration with thematic resonance; lacks high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor after rain: anchored in the opening line ("pale stone of the docks still glistening like bone") and sustained through empty berths, algae-green mooring posts, the archive tower's streaked facade, and the final light on ivory and ocean. The setting supplies disorder (swollen door, jumbled slides) that pressures Maren's work and provides the late-afternoon light that frames closure. Setup immediately, development through archive decay, payoff in the ending image. The harbor's emptiness and neglect mirror the absences she catalogs. Removing the specificity (ivory, rain's aftermath, harbor geography) would weaken thematic charge and sensory anchoring. Strong integration with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>After the exile ends: the timeframe anchors the opening ("The exile ended on a Tuesday") and contextualizes Maren's return and the seven-year gap (Oran's death, archive decay). It sets the before/after for her reentry but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Setup in paragraph one, background in paragraph two, no development pressure. The exile's end is the occasion, not a constraint; Maren works at her own pace with no urgency imposed by timing. Functional but replaceable with "after years away" without structural loss. Present in two beats (opening, Oran's timeline) but does not shape tactics or the final image causally.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>To compile fragments into meaning: Maren's explicit motivation in paragraph three ("She had come back to compile fragments into meaning. That had always been her work") and enacted throughout—sorting slides, accepting fishermen's offerings, placing the valve, articulating "the gaps are part of the record." Setup early, development across multiple beats (sorting, fishermen, dialogue), payoff in the closure stance and final dictation image. The desire is dramatized through repeated choice (what to sort, where to place, how to answer) and friction appears when she must accept that meaning includes absence, not restoration. The motivation is irreplaceable; removing it collapses the story's logic and closure. Cost is conceptual (limits of compilation) and relational (she cannot resurrect Oran, only catalog him).</comment>
