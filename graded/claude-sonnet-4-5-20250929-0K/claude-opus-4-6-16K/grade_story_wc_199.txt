<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirren's orderliness and cataloging motivation are established early, and her transformation is signaled throughout. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstractions ("moss-green delight," "deep change") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to build monuments feels assigned by external forces (the arbor's message) rather than emerging from internal conflict, weakening agency. Micro-choices exist but the protagonist remains more vessel than actor with contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly (who/where/when by the opening paragraph). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern recognition → decoding → monument-building → arbor response forms a coherent progression with one meaningful deepening when the moonstone reveals the message. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lirren becomes "the translator" and begins again, crystallizing her role with undeniable pressure. Cost is conceptual (she surrenders her grandmother's treasured folklore page, transforms from sorter to bridge) but the emotional price feels somewhat distant and the final image of sitting down to "begin again" risks circularity without visible friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (petrified wood platform, ghost-white trees, pale branches like veins). The moonstone cabochon physically constrains a key choice (held over leaves to refract symbols), and the monuments use materials from the setting (bark, resin, spores). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The arbor's shuddering response and leaf-eruption charge the final image, elevating setting beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the arbor's message—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when leaves fall in deliberate patterns and Lirren arranges them with the moonstone to assemble meaning. The monument-building sequence narrows options (she must honor forgotten things to earn the arbor's response). However, escalation is largely cooperative: the arbor speaks, Lirren obeys, the arbor rewards. No reversal or trade-off where competing goods force sacrifice; the cost (giving up the folklore page) feels more symbolic than viscerally constraining.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory, preservation, and transformation—emerges organically from monument-building and the Moth Queen folklore without overt statement. The moonstone, folklore page, and monuments recur with shifting weight, and the final image (fresh leaves to sort) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the cycle of remembering renews rather than exhausts. "Moss-green delight" and "architecture of grief transformed into celebration" risk poetic abstraction, but the specificity of bristlecone seeds for lost villages and the resin arch for the vanished river ground the theme in particulars. The ending reweights prior sorting as sacred translation without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters perception through Lirren's orderly, cataloging sensibility ("Everything in order. Everything accounted for"). Diction is elevated and consistent, with purposeful lyricism ("sky the color of spent hearths," "spiral-and-tooth"). However, psychic distance is uneven: "moss-green delight" and "the deep change, the one the folklore had promised" lean toward tell-heavy abstraction rather than immediate perception. Dialogue is absent. Free indirect style mostly clean, though "her entire purpose… had always been in service of a deeper motivation" reads like scaffolding exposition mid-reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with strong imagery ("veins against a sky the color of spent hearths") and varied sentence rhythm. However, several runs exhibit template cadence and paraphrase loops: "Everything in order. Everything accounted for." is immediately echoed by "That was her way, and it had been her way…" The phrase "She had always been orderly about it" frontloads a summary that the next paragraph dramatizes, creating redundancy. "Transformed as she always emerged transformed" is a circular construction. Figurative density is high in peak beats ("moss-green delight," "architecture of grief") without always grounding in concrete action, risking overwriting. Information density is strong overall, but scaffold and synonym churn ("sorted seeds," "sorting table," "sorting tradition") accumulate. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor and message-in-leaves offer a fresh angle on preservation narratives, and the monuments-to-forgotten-things conceit is specific. However, the Moth Queen folklore and wise-grandmother tropes lean familiar, and the "one who sorts becomes the one who translates" arc follows a well-trodden template. Emotional specificity (bristlecone seeds for villages, fern arch for the river) adds freshness, but the transformation feels more asserted ("became the translator") than demonstrated through risky choices. The story commits fully to its lyric premise, yet the closure—Lirren smiling and beginning again—opts for cyclical comfort over bold consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirren is present throughout and her sorting habit frames the story. She makes key choices: arranging leaf-symbols, using the moonstone to decode, building monuments, and placing the moonstone atop the final throne. These actions drive beats and enable closure. However, her decisions feel responsive to external prompts (the arbor speaks, she obeys) rather than internally conflicted or costly in the moment. Early signal strong, beat involvement across three segments, closure linkage clear, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are moderate—another careful observer could fill the role. Cost is conceptual (folklore page given up) but not viscerally felt. Swappability slight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The moonstone appears in two beats: mid-story when Lirren uses it to refract leaf-symbols and reveal the message, and at closure when she places it atop the final monument-throne. Both uses are causal and specific (refracting, crowning). Setup is early (grandmother's backstory), development constrains a key choice (decoding), and payoff charges the final image (throne for the Moth Queen). However, the object's mechanics are more mystical than grounded—how it "catches meaning" is abstract—and its irreplaceability is asserted ("the one object she never sorted") rather than demonstrated through unique properties under pressure. Cost linkage is present (she surrenders it atop the throne) but the emotional weight is muted. Score ~6.7 for strong setup/development/payoff with moderate causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Regional folklore (the Moth Queen tale) is introduced early via the envelope Lirren folds and recurs at closure when she builds a throne for the Moth Queen. The spiral-and-tooth symbol from folklore unlocks the arbor's message, shaping mid-story tactics. However, the folklore functions more as atmospheric texture and thematic echo than as a constraint that alters options under pressure. It frames Lirren's worldview but does not create friction or cost. Setup strong, development present (symbol recognition), closure participation clear (throne, wings in sky), but causal pressure is modest—the story could function with generic "ancient symbols" instead. Score ~5.4 for one key turn plus closure reprise, with limited irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is asserted as Lirren's trait early ("she always emerged transformed from every task") and at closure ("this was different from the small daily transformations"). However, the trait is told rather than shown constraining or enabling a specific action with cost. It labels her character arc but does not create on-page friction or tradeoff. The trait is present and thematically consistent, but ornamental—it describes what happens rather than shaping how decisions unfold. Swappability high; cost linkage absent. Score ~4.8 for functional label without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Prodding the leaf with the bone stylus occurs once mid-story and causes the symbol to "shift" or "deepen," which leads Lirren to use the moonstone for further decoding. This action enables a key turn (message assembly) and is specific in tool and gesture. However, the action is brief, its mechanics are vague ("as if the leaf were still alive"), and it does not recur or shape closure. Setup is mid-story (not early), development is functional, but closure participation is absent. Swappability is moderate—another investigative gesture could serve. Score ~5.2 for one key turn with modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Monument-building is signaled mid-story when the arbor's message directs Lirren to "Build for what is forgotten." She constructs cairns, arches, obelisks from seeds, spores, petals—three distinct monuments named and described. The method shapes her transformation ("hands… discovered a new precision") and directly triggers the climax (arbor shudders, moth appears). Setup is clear, development spans multiple beats with specific materials and architecture, and payoff is causal (final monument → arbor response). Mechanics matter (bristlecone seeds for villages, resin arch for river) and are irreplaceable to theme. Cost is visible (folklore page consumed, emotional labor of grief). Score ~7.3 for essential role across beats and ending with strong specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is established early with vivid detail (pale branches, petrified wood platform, ghost-white trees, permanent haze). It supplies materials (bark, moss, spores) that Lirren uses for monuments, constraining her choices. The arbor's shuddering and leaf-eruption at closure charge the final image. However, the arbor functions more as responsive environment than as a constraint that pressures tactics—it cooperates rather than resists. Setup strong, development present (resource provision), closure participation clear, causal pressure moderate. Score ~6.9 for essential presence across beats with solid specificity but limited friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "the hush where past meets prophecy" (the Moth Queen's Inhale) is introduced early and frames the entire action as a liminal season when "time thinned and meaning seeped through." Lirren has "waited years for this," establishing urgency. However, the timeframe does not impose a visible clock or deadline that alters tactics—there is no sense of waning opportunity or pressure to act quickly. It functions as atmosphere and thematic context rather than a constraint. Setup strong, development thematic, closure participation implied (transformation occurs within this season), but causal pressure is low. Score ~5.6 for one key framing with limited tactical effect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lirren's motivation to decode the message is stated early ("her entire purpose… had always been in service of a deeper motivation: to decode the message in falling leaves") and drives her actions: watching patterns, arranging symbols, using the moonstone, building monuments. The motivation is sustained through closure when she becomes "the translator." However, the desire is told more than dramatized—there is little friction between competing wants or costs that test her commitment. She pursues the goal without visible sacrifice or doubt. Setup strong, beat involvement high, closure linkage clear, but conflict within the motivation is absent. Score ~6.6 for clear drive across beats with moderate dramatization of friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" appears once mid-story ("moss-green delight of it first in her chest") and the tone throughout is contemplative, reverent, and textured with organic imagery (moss-covered railing, damp joy, things growing over ruins). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly as wonder builds, but it remains a single register—calm enchantment—without sharp turns or pressure-driven modulation. The final image (Lirren smiling, sitting down) sustains the gentle tone rather than charging it with new friction. Setup present, development consistent, closure participation weak. Score ~6.2 for coherent single mood that supports theme but lacks dynamic charge.</comment>
