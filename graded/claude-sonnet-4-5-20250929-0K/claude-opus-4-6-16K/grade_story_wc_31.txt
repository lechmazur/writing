<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Oren's interior life is concrete and well-embodied—he carries the key tag, tracks the waterline, hides behind cataloging facts. The lamp-lighting ritual, wade into cold water, and discovery in the hull all arise from his grief-driven commitment to the promise. The final whispered "Golden" and return to his route show endurance with visible cost (he remains alone, still searching, but now carrying luminous understanding). Minor: the crowd remains faceless and the relationship with "her" is told rather than shown in micro-choices, but the solitary focus fits the piece's lyric design.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (pier lamplighter, dusk, annual festival). The piece accumulates through lamp-lighting ritual → festival crowd → solitary descent into wreck → acoustic color discovery → return to routine, with each beat reweighting the promise. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Oren realizes the key tag signifies "a frequency to keep carrying," sees her voice as golden, and resumes his route with luminous truth—cost is visible (solitude, endless vigil) and the final image recharges all prior lamp-amber. One meaningful deepening (the hull's synesthetic revelation) tightens his understanding and reconfigures his nightly labor from search to embodied vow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pier lamps, corroded hull, water depth, and standing ankle-water all anchor the space concretely. The wreck's "resonance chamber" iron hull constrains and enables the climactic discovery—sound becomes color only there. Sensory hierarchy is strong: cold biting through wool, violet tremor in water, red-gold bloom from crowd murmur. The brass key tag's tactile presence (cold, worn smooth) and the recurring amber lamplight charge the final image. Minor: the library's "fused sculptures of pulp" are vivid but don't alter a choice; the setting earns high marks by making the hull's acoustic properties indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: fulfill the luminous vow to discover the color of sound. Pressure accumulates through nightly ritual, lowest tide of the year, and purposeful descent into the wreck. The hull discovery is a meaningful deepening—Oren finally perceives sound as color, realizes the key tag's symbolic weight, and understands her voice was golden all along. Agency is renunciation and endurance: he resumes lamp-lighting with no expectation she'll return, accepting the solitary cost. The cost is visible (isolation, endless vigil) and forecloses the path of abandoning the promise. One clear tightening under the Accumulative lens; no second reversal required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—fidelity to promises as living frequency rather than fixed memory—emerges organically from lamp ritual, key tag as "frequency," and the hull's synesthetic discovery. "Luminous vows...promises made under lamplight that burned brighter than ordinary words" is thematic shorthand but earned by the nightly lamp-lighting and the iron chamber's acoustic payoff. The ending offers a non-literal answer: sound does have color when filtered through grief's architecture, and the tag signifies ongoing commitment rather than a place to return. Subtext in "hides behind truth" (facts as armor) and the crowd's obliviousness. Final image—blue ring drifting toward lanterns—reweights all prior amber without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds cleanly; all perception filters through Oren's grief-steeped attention (amber = her voice, facts as wall, waterline tracking). Diction is lyric and controlled: "slow meteors in reverse," "warm shifting red-gold," "frequency to keep carrying." The hull passage modulates beautifully—sensory compression under discovery's pressure, then the whispered "Golden" breaking into a pale blue ring. Brief purposeful elision (we don't see "her" death) works because the promise and vigil are the present stakes. Minor: "He hid behind truth" is slightly diagnostic; "pressed the hotel skeleton key tag into his palm" uses a filter verb but stays voice-coherent. Rhythm and texture are distinct throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, vivid sensory anchors ("cold biting through wool," "violet tremor," "pale blue ring"). No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image, state, or pressure. Metaphors land cleanly: "slow meteors in reverse," "resonance chamber," "sculptures of pulp and salt." The lamp-amber / her-voice-golden linkage builds across the piece without redundancy. Opening and closing images charge each other. Minor: "He had discovered this by accident one night while mapping the wreck" is brief tell that compresses backstory efficiently, and "The crowd pressed...faces upturned" leans slightly toward stock phrasing, but neither dulls momentum or clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise—synesthetic discovery inside a sunken ship's resonance chamber during a lantern festival—is specific and non-obvious. The lamp-lighter role, acoustic architecture, and key-tag-as-frequency synthesis feel fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity (grief as nightly ritual, facts as shield, color emerging from collective murmur) avoids generic grief templates. Risk: the lyric/sensory design and iron-hull physics could drift into ornament, but both constrain the closure (only in the hull does sound bloom as color). Minor: the annual festival and "luminous vows" phrase approach thematic convenience, but the piece earns them through concrete lamp work and acoustic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Oren (lamplighter) drives every beat: lights lamps at dusk, slips away from crowd, wades to wreck, descends into hull, realizes key tag's meaning, whispers discovery, resumes route. His choices create all key turns—purposeful descent, staying until tide returns, carrying the luminous truth forward. Decision to enter the hull and then return to lamp-lighting forecloses abandoning the promise (visible cost: solitude, endless vigil). Present in setup, middle descent, and closure image; indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Key tag appears in opening (pressed into palm, Room 7), carried in coat pocket during lamp-lighting, pulled out in the hull ("cold and familiar against his thumb"), pressed to chest as he grasps its meaning ("frequency to keep carrying"), and implicitly carried as he resumes his route. Two distinct on-page uses (opening memory, hull realization) plus the ending carry-forward. Reweighted at closure from "room to return to" to "frequency to keep carrying." Shapes the dominant stake (luminous vow) and charges the final understanding. Indispensable to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" is named early, frames the stake (promises under lamplight), and returns at closure when Oren realizes "the truth he carried now was luminous." It shapes his nightly ritual (lighting lamps = honoring the vow) and the hull discovery redefines what luminous means (her voice as golden color, frequency carried forward). The concept constrains his choices (he cannot abandon the promise) and the ending image ("hummed in a color he could finally name") directly pays it off. Strong integration, but slightly abstract; the lamp-lighting action does more causal work than the vow label itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" is established early (tells tide schedule, water temp, vessel names "so that no one would ask what he was really looking for") and enables his solitary search (the crowd doesn't question his absence). It constrains social pressure—he remains isolated—and recurs at closure ("He would have told them the truth if they had...But the truth he carried now was luminous"). The trait alters tactics (deflection via facts) and charges the ending with irony (the luminous truth is now his to carry alone). Cost: isolation persists. Present in setup, middle deflection, and ending reflection; causal role in two beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Signify" appears explicitly when Oren "understood, finally, what it was meant to signify. Not a room to return to...A frequency to keep carrying." This realization is the story's conceptual turn and charges the closure, but the action itself (understanding/interpreting) is interior and singular. The key tag and lamp-lighting do the on-page causal work; "signify" names the cognitive shift rather than driving multiple beats. Present at closure and essential to thematic payoff, but the beat is one reflective moment rather than a sequence of external actions. Strong closure linkage, modest beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" is demonstrated in the opening ("moving from post to post by wandering purposefully along a route that looked aimless but never was") and implicitly present in his methodical wreck-mapping and nightly routine. The method reflects his search strategy (systematic yet grief-driven) and mirrors the piece's own accumulative structure. It doesn't constrain a specific choice—he could light lamps linearly—but it characterizes his endurance and charges the return to routine at closure ("resumed his route along the pier, lamp to lamp, post to post"). Early signal, thematic resonance, modest causal pressure; the mechanics matter less than the lamp-lighting and hull descent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The sunken library is introduced at midpoint, but its iron hull and resonance-chamber properties are indispensable: only there does sound bloom into color, enabling Oren's discovery. The corroded stairs, ankle-deep water, curved hull, and standing water are handled concretely (he wades, descends, stands still, listens). The setting enables the climactic synesthetic perception (crowd murmur → red-gold bloom, his whisper → pale blue ring) and charges the closure (her voice as golden). Removing the wreck would collapse the story's causal and thematic logic. Setup (hatch found months ago), development (descent and discovery), payoff (realizes her voice's color). Specific mechanics (acoustic amplification) matter decisively.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sky Lantern Release frames the evening, creates the crowd pressure Oren slips away from, and provides the collective murmur that becomes red-gold color in the hull. The festival's timing (annual event, lowest tide) tightens the window and motivates this specific night's descent. Lanterns rising above while he listens below creates the acoustic input for his discovery. Time is tracked (dusk lamp-lighting, crowd gathering, lanterns launching, "stayed until the tide returned," "crowd had thinned"). The festival is causally active in two beats (departure, acoustic discovery) and shapes the closure's charged image (blue ring drifting toward lanterns). Essential to pressure and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The desire to discover the color of sound drives every choice: nightly lamp-lighting (amber recalls her voice), pier wandering (tracks waterline for clues), descent into wreck (seeks acoustic revelation), and the hull vigil. Friction is visible—she laughed at his claim, he promised anyway, she's gone but he persists—and the cost is isolation and endless searching. The motivation is dramatized through action (wade into cold water, stay until tide returns) and the closure delivers both fulfillment (sound does have color) and renunciation (he resumes the solitary vigil). Want (discover) conflicts with loss (she's gone) and the resolution (luminous understanding carried forward) has visible emotional cost. Indispensable across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" (implied by "slow meteors in reverse," "that particular silence when hundreds...hold their breath," "the universe holding its breath") is coherent from opening dusk to the hushed crowd to the underwater vigil. Tone modulates purposefully: measured lamp-lighting → crowd gathering → solitary cold descent → synesthetic wonder → quiet return. The final image ("hummed in a color he could finally name") maintains the luminous, breath-held quality and charges the ending without breaking into sentimentality or loudness. Tone pressures Oren's interiority (grief, wonder, endurance) and supports the Accumulative lens. Consistent, modulated, and deeply integrated with closure.</comment>
