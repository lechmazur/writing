<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied through his ritual tracing of door scuffs and nightly confessions to the lattice. His obsessive documentation emerges from coherent motivation: the son inheriting a liar's curse, driven to carve undeniable testimony. The final stance—patient waiting for the dead to surface—feels earned by sustained pressure. Minor issue: the harbormaster's brother as murderer is told rather than shown creating friction on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (lighthouse prison, eleven months, Maren). Closure lands as Charged Poise: Maren waits, carving his labyrinth while the tides shift toward vindication; the cost is his confinement and obsessive labor, legible in "finish his labyrinth" and "scored into oak and stone, impossible to deny." The accumulative design—copperlight ritual, lattice confessions, carving testimony—deepens through cadence and recurrence to reweight his patient stance at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison is vividly particular: copperlight flooding curved walls, the confessional lattice bolted between cells, scuffs on the narrow door as readable text. The reef ("the Teeth"), fog-swallowed tower, and weighted bodies in the shallows create a coherent sensory world. The lattice constrains Maren's confession ritual (speaks without seeing a face) and the copperlight's amber glow charges the final image of repose. Spatial choreography across three landings remains clear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Maren must carve his testimony into the tower before the bodies surface and vindicate him. Pressure tightens through the copperlight ritual, nightly carving, and his conviction that "winter storms will drag the shallows bare." The accumulative lens means escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift; the final image reconfigures his imprisonment as purposeful preparation rather than mere confinement. Agency is endurance with visible cost (eleven months, obsessive labor). No external antagonist needed; the world's disbelief is the constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance (the son of the boy who cried wolf) and the cost of being believed emerges through concrete particulars: weighted fishermen, carved testimony, the lattice from a wrecked chapel ship. "Chasing hush" operates as subtext in his nightly confessions seeking the "stillness after confession when the world holds still." The ending image—copperlight holding him, the dead patient beneath water—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. No thematic echo or sermonizing; the labyrinth metaphor is lived through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Voice is distinct and controlled: "He is chasing hush. Not silence—hush" demonstrates precise diction and perceptual signature. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during copperlight meditation, zoomed slightly out for backstory). No dialogue present, so those bullets don't apply. The prose reflects Maren's obsessive, patient mindset through recurring structures (copperlight returns, lattice confessions) without becoming mechanical. Reflection anchors in present stimuli (tracing scuffs, pressing forehead to lattice) and primes closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively: short declaratives ("Maren knows this") followed by long, layered accumulations ("He is the son of the boy who cried wolf..."). High information density throughout; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or thematic pressure. Minor template cadence in opening paragraph ("He reported... He told... He described") but the pattern doesn't recur. Zero paraphrase loops. Figurative language (lattice diamonds as "small suns," hair like seagrass) is coherent and embodied. Strong opening and closing images.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of inherited disbelief, lighthouse-as-prison, and confessional lattice from a wrecked chapel ship feels specific and non-obvious. The "boy who cried wolf" premise is transformed through literal inheritance and the weighted bodies create fresh stakes. Risk-taking in structure (heavy reflection, no dialogue, accumulative design) serves the material. The copper-light ritual and carving testimony distinguish this from generic wrongful-imprisonment frames. Slightly formulaic vindication-by-nature element (winter storms will reveal bodies) keeps it from the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren, the cry-wolf boy's son, drives all key turns: his insistence that led to imprisonment, his nightly carving and confession ritual, his decision to "finish his labyrinth" before vindication arrives. His inherited curse shapes every tactic. Present throughout; multiple beats; shapes closure stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The confessional lattice appears in setup (described, salvaged from chapel ship), development (Maren presses forehead to it nightly, confesses through diamond shapes), and payoff (copperlight turns diamonds into "small suns" in the final passage). Handled physically, enables his ritual, and charged in the closing image. Essential to his isolation and testimony method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is named explicitly and operationalized: Maren seeks "the particular quality of quiet that follows a truth finally spoken aloud." It shapes his nightly confessions and frames his patient stance at closure. The concept constrains his tactics (must finish testimony before bodies surface) and charges the ending ("somewhere beneath the dark water, the dead are patient"). Present in setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is attributed to the lighthouse ("That is its nature") and exemplified: light above water, stone seeming to hover when fog swallows the reef. It enables Maren's sense that "the building itself is alive" and supports the thematic frame of his impossible-to-believe testimony eventually becoming undeniable. Present and conceptually integrated but doesn't constrain a specific on-page choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hover" recurs throughout: the tower seems to hover when fog swallows the reef, Maren "hovers between despair and something almost like repose" in the copperlight. The action encapsulates his suspended state—imprisoned but purposeful, waiting for vindication. It defines his final stance at closure (held by copperlight, sustained in liminal patience). Not a physical act that turns plot but central to the emotional and thematic architecture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" is Maren's method of reading prior prisoners' stories and adding his own marks. Introduced early, it becomes his nightly ritual: "He traces them nightly... to thread a labyrinth with his own story." The method shapes his testimony project ("carve another line into the door each night") and frames closure ("threaded through every surface"). Integral to his goal and tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison off the jagged reef (the Teeth) pressures every choice: Maren's isolation enables obsessive carving, the three landings and lattice structure his ritual, the copperlight schedules his repose, the reef holds the weighted bodies that will vindicate him. Setting supplies constraints (narrow door, bolted lattice) and resources (carved surfaces, copperlight warmth). Geography drives stakes (bodies in shallows east of reef). Indispensable to plot, atmosphere, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" creates urgent timeframe: Maren must "finish his labyrinth" before winter storms expose the weighted fishermen. The clock is implicit (eleven months counted, tides shifting, winter approaching) and tightens his nightly labor. The temporal pressure shapes his patient stance at closure ("time is his"). Not tick-by-tick but coherent and consequential across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with your own story" is Maren's explicit motivation, dramatized through his nightly carving, lattice confessions, and determination to score testimony "into oak and stone, impossible to deny." The desire conflicts with his inherited curse (no one believes him) and costs him obsessive labor. Drives setup, middle beats, and closure stance. Embodied in repeated action with visible trade-off (confinement, solitary ritual).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" anchors tone throughout: the amber warmth "every evening at the same hour," Maren hovering "between despair and something almost like repose," the glow that "holds him" in the final lines. Tone modulates with pressure (desperation when describing disbelief, patient intensity during ritual) but the copperlight returns as tonal anchor. Charges the final image and coheres across the arc. Essential to atmosphere and emotional cadence.</comment>
