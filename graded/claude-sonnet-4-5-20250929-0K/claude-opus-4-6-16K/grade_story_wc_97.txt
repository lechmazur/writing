<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and voice-particular: "strategically creative, always had been, the kind of mind that heard counterpoint in traffic noise" grounds her perception. The tremor-as-silence metaphor embodies her crisis without diagnostic label-speak. Her progression from hiding to choosing an "unplanned encore" is earned by the flickering compasses' challenge to her passivity. The embodied contradiction—"trembling was not silence, and a wavering note was still a note"—drives the final choice with visible cost (descending through clouds into an indifferent city).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Elena, arbor, three weeks) land early. The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural: the film reel's hidden maps, the clock's winding, and the cloud-tide convergence build density toward a Charged Poise closure where Elena crystallizes her stance ("ready to begin again") with felt cost (trembling hands, steely resolve, indifferent strangers). The ticking clock and westward compass reweight prior material—time unfrozen, direction chosen—making the before/after legible. One meaningful deepening (from refuge to junction to choice) tightens options under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The arbor's latticed arches, silver condensation vines, and twice-daily cloud tide create a vivid micro-setting that constrains Elena's window ("until the horizon invited night"). The projector bolted to the center post and the iron staircase behind the Criterion booth ground spatial logic. The clock's corroded backing plate and winding key are tactile anchors. The westward horizon in "molten copper" charges the final descent, making setting participate in closure without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Elena's choice between hiding from diagnosis or surprising fate. The flickering compasses pose the question "what if the song wasn't over?" which tightens when the clock starts ticking and the compass holds steady—narrowing her window to the horizon. Her descent with trembling hands and steady heart is agency as stance crystallization with on-page cost (facing indifferent strangers, playing unscheduled). One meaningful deepening (refuge → junction → choice) coheres under the Accumulative lens; no false reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: frozen time restarted, flickering compasses pointing to unmade choices, the encore as defiance of "fate's rigid timetable." The clock's winding and compass's steadying avoid stated morals while reweighting prior material—"trembling was not silence" offers a resonant answer to the tremor's verdict. The strategically creative attribute shapes Elena's method of discovery (noticing spliced frames, hearing counterpoint in traffic). "Steely longing" modulates to "something fiercer" at closure, charging the final image without platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Elena hears "counterpoint in traffic noise," notices frames "spliced between scenes so briefly they registered only as flickers." Diction stays within her lexicon ("wistful," "reckless, unscripted place," "encores nobody expected"). No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. Compression at the end ("each step ringing on iron, the steely longing...transmuting") heightens pressure without obscuring her interior texture. Minor slip: "the horizon invited night" recurs three times in the final third, a small template echo that doesn't touch closure but nudges line rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Strong density and rhythm: "a silence she could not fill," "trembling was not silence," "a wavering note was still a note" compress motivation efficiently. Figurative language (silver condensation vines, molten copper sun) is selective and legible. Two small slips: "the horizon invited night" appears three times in quick succession, creating a minor loop; "strategically creative, always had been" uses a tell-then-illustrate structure that slightly lowers momentum. Proofreading clean; no scaffold or major opacity. Information density high; most lines do double work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal arbor setting and flickering-compass conceit offer a fresh angle on fate-versus-choice. The pianist's tremor as literal and metaphoric silence, resolved by "a wavering note is still a note," synthesizes physical and thematic particulars without generic template. The anniversary clock frozen at birth-time, wound at the arbor, charging the descent is specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking in the atmospheric setting and compression of backstory heightens coherence. Minor deduction: the "hidden staircase behind projection booth" and "impossible" arbor lean slightly toward convenience magic without full constraint integration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's choices create key turns: she threads the reel, hand-cranks the projector to discover maps, winds the clock, and descends. Setup by paragraph two; middle development (discovering compasses, winding clock); closure participation (descending "ready to begin again"). Two distinct beats (discovery, descent) plus closure linkage. Her occupation colors perception (counterpoint, key changes) but does not constrain final action heavily. Causal pressure moderate; cost present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clock handled in three beats: placed on railing (paragraph four), interior winding key discovered and wound (paragraph eight), tucked in coat pocket at descent (paragraph ten). Setup, development (winding unlocks compass direction), closure (ticking against her chest). The frozen-at-birth-time detail and corroded key add irreplaceability. Reweighted meaning: time unfrozen enables choice. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; one step below indispensable because the compass could theoretically point without it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Compasses appear in paragraph six (maps with wavering needles pointing to moments/choices), reappear in paragraph eight (one stops flickering, holds steady west), and implicitly shape the descent (walking "in a key the flickering compasses had chosen"). Setup, development (they narrow her window and clarify direction), closure participation. The concept redefines her refuge as a junction and forces the timed choice. Causal pressure high; irreplaceable—story logic collapses without them. Strong cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" labeled in paragraph three, illustrated immediately (hearing counterpoint in traffic, finding key changes in birdsong), enables her slowing the projector to discover hidden maps. Setup and development present; no direct closure mention but tacitly underpins her method. One distinct beat (discovery); visible cost low. Swappable with "perceptive" or "pattern-seeker" without major structural change. Mid-band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Refuge framed in paragraph two; arbor described as refuge and then reframed as junction (paragraph seven). Setup and reweighting present; drives one major turn (from hiding to choosing). Closure participation indirect (she leaves refuge to descend). The reframe ("not just refuge...a junction") is thematically central but the action itself (arriving, staying) is told rather than shown. One beat involvement; causal role moderate. Swappable with "sanctuary" or "haven" at slight cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Film reel introduced paragraph three, threaded paragraph four, hand-cranked to reveal maps paragraph six, rewound and tucked under arm paragraph ten. Setup, development (method of discovery that changes her knowledge), closure (she takes it with her). Three beats; high causal pressure—without the reel's hidden compasses, no junction logic or choice. Mechanics matter: hand-cranking, spliced frames, projector bolted to post. Near-indispensable; one small deduction for the projector's unexplained presence ("impossibly").</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Arbor setup paragraph one (latticed arches, platform drifting, cloud tide). Development: twice-daily tide and alignment window tighten her timeframe (paragraph nine). Closure: iron staircase descent through clouds (final paragraph). Setup, development, closure participation present. The setting supplies the timed constraint (cloud tide alignment) and the atmospheric path. Two beats plus closure linkage; causal pressure moderate. Swappable with another liminal elevated space at some cost but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe introduced paragraph nine ("until the horizon invited night"), repeated paragraph ten and final paragraph. Setup late (60% mark); cap at 4.6 would apply, but the phrase does charge the descent and create urgency at closure, lifting it. Development: the ticking clock and westward compass sync with this window. Closure participation strong. One beat (descent under time pressure); causal role moderate. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but arrives too late for high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation crystallizes paragraph seven ("she wanted to surprise fate with an unplanned encore"), prepared by prior reflection on invisible station performances and encores "nobody expected." Setup implicit (paragraph three), development (paragraph seven articulation), closure (playing "the encore that no program had listed"). Two beats; causal pressure high—the desire drives winding the clock and descending. Friction between trembling hands and steady heart dramatizes cost. Told rather than purely shown at the articulation beat; one small deduction for expository phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone present throughout: wistful opening (invisible pianist), longing for meaning, steely resolve emerging ("steely longing...transmuting into something fiercer"). Setup, modulation under pressure (paragraph eleven), closure charge (final image balances trembling hands and steady heart). Coherent mood progression; the phrase "steely longing" appears once late, making it a descriptor rather than a motif that recurs across beats. One beat plus closure; tone supports final image but is not mechanically indispensable. Mid-high band: shapes atmosphere without constraining plot.</comment>
