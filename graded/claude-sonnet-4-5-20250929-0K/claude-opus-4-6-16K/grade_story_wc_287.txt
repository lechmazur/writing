<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular—her wistful pragmatism governs micro-choices (cleaning the pot, stealing the jasmine cutting) that embody contradictory impulses without therapy-speak. The gauge tooth functions as both inherited tool and emotional anchor, grounding her grief in tactile action. Her faith-vs.-preparation tension is lived through planting gestures rather than stated, and the final stillness ("It would grow, or it wouldn't. She would be here either way") earns stasis with visible cost. Minor: the "certain kinds of beauty justified certain kinds of risk" framing edges toward summary, but surrounding embodiment keeps it anchored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors immediately (fire escape, harbor, rosebush) and the accumulative lens is taught by paragraph two: loss of the petal creates a quivering hush that reweights every subsequent gesture. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Maren plants the jasmine with full knowledge it may fail, foreclosing hope of guaranteed outcome but committing to the work anyway; the cost is felt in "naked" faith and the trembling cutting. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds without contradiction, and the single tightening (final petal → replanting under that hush) reweights the dominant stake (tending beauty amid risk) with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fire escape functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (five stories up, east-south light exposure, mirrors angled to bounce harbor-light) and charges the final image (new cutting trembles in wind off water). Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific: locksmith's daughter sees mechanism and measurement, gardener notices soil depth and drainage. The harbor's luminous moonlight is woven through action—she matches planting tempo to unseen oars—and the spatial choreography (pot, gauge tooth, milk jug, alley below) tracks cleanly. The mirrors and white flowers that "reflect light into dark corners" ground her motivation in physical design rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (tending life amid failure and risk) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful on-page action: after the rosebush dies, Maren cleans the pot and plants jasmine despite knowing "it would grow, or it wouldn't." The cost is her naked faith made visible in the act itself—"embarrassed her"—and the final image (cutting trembles, then holds still) reconfigures the question from "will it survive?" to "will she persist?" Agency is renunciation of guaranteed outcome with visible commitment. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens; no reversals are required and none forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme (faith amid uncertainty, reflecting light into darkness) emerges from particulars—mirrors angled downward, white flowers, the gauge tooth scoring drainage—without thesis statement. The final image (cutting trembles, holds still; "she would be here either way") offers a non-literal answer to the central question: survival is less important than the act of tending. The rosebush-to-jasmine shift quietly reprices permanence without moralizing. The "looking up" reflex and harbor-light metaphor accumulate pressure across the piece and resolve in the ending's earned stasis. No thematic echo or late summary mars the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited distance remains stable; Maren's perceptual signature (mechanism, measurement, "architecture of things that open and close") is consistent and character-specific. Diction stays within her register—"wistfully pragmatic," "naked faith"—and modulates naturally under pressure. The rhythm varies purposefully: longer reflective sentences open, shorter action beats at the planting. Filter verbs ("she watched," "she wanted") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping, no register drift. Minor: "the looking up. The noticing" fragment pair edges toward editorial summary but recovers quickly in concrete action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary, rhythm breathes with scene pressure, and information density is high—most lines do double work (e.g., "oars in water" rhythm for planting, gauge tooth as inheritance and tool). Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Figurative language is controlled: "mercury and glass" harbor, moonlight in "sheets," each image clean and motivated. Minor friction: "a quivering hush settled over everything—the water, the distant boats, even the wind" stacks three near-synonyms for atmospheric totality without tight necessity, and "ancient and meditative" leans slightly abstract. These do not touch closure and trigger only −0.3 cumulative.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The locksmith's-daughter-as-gardener synthesis is specific and non-obvious, and the gauge tooth's repurposing (scoring drainage, testing soil, prying seeds) feels inevitable in hindsight. The fire-escape garden + mirrors reflecting harbor-light transforms the "small beauty amid risk" template through occupational and spatial particulars. The emotional truth (faith that embarrasses her, planting anyway) avoids sentimentality. Risk-taking is modest but coherent: the piece commits fully to its quiet accumulative design without retreat. No proximity echoes, no derivative premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (fire escape gardener) is present from the opening, her choices drive two key beats (watching the petal fall, cleaning and replanting the pot), and she shapes the closure through the decision to plant jasmine despite uncertainty. Early signal +0.6, two distinct beats +0.9, causal pressure (renunciation of guaranteed outcome) +1.0, closure linkage (her stance crystallizes in final image) +1.2, irreplaceability (locksmith's daughter traits matter) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.2 = 7.2, round down to 7.2. Adjust +0.6 for strong embodied micro-choices and cost visibility = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gauge tooth (lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth) appears in three beats: inheritance memory, scoring drainage holes, tamping soil. It is handled on the page, its use evolves (measure-keys → garden tool), and it charges the closure by being "warm in her palm" as she watches the cutting. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables planting acts) +0.8, closure linkage (held at end, reweights inheritance) +1.0, irreplaceability (its notched intervals and her father's craft matter) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5, adjust +0.6 for strong tactile specificity = 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A quivering hush" is established immediately after the petal drops and governs the piece's atmospheric pressure—it recurs implicitly ("the quivering hush still held") and charges the final stillness when the cutting "hold[s] still." It does not constrain a tactical choice but reweights the stake by making silence and cessation palpable. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (one atmospheric turn) +0.4, closure linkage (hush → stillness payoff) +0.9, lyric resonance +0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3, adjust +0.5 for strong lyric coherence = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is named in paragraph one and demonstrated on-page: she knows the fire escape isn't hers (wistful) yet plants anyway (pragmatic); she takes the jasmine cutting "not entirely legally" (pragmatic risk) yet fills pots with "acts of faith so naked it embarrassed her" (wistful). The attribute constrains the replanting choice with visible cost. Early signal +0.7, one beat (replanting decision) +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, cost connection (embarrassment, naked faith) +0.5, irreplaceability +0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.8 = 5.8, adjust +0.9 for tight embodiment = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Instill" governs Maren's motivation ("she wanted to instill that reflex in them. The looking up") and shapes her design choices (mirrors, white flowers) but does not create the major turn—the replanting does. It is present in reflection and drives setting choices but is not the pivot at closure. Early signal +0.5, one beat (mirror/flower design) +0.4, causal pressure (motivates tactics) +0.6, closure linkage (implicit in final tending) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.9 = 4.9, adjust +2.3 for strong thematic coherence and motivational clarity = 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"With the rhythm of oars in water" is invoked once during the planting ("pull, lift, return—steady and ancient and meditative") and matched to an unseen rowboat's tempo. It does not constrain mechanics but supplies a cadence metaphor that charges the planting act. Mid-story first appearance −0.3, one beat +0.4, closure linkage (tempo holds through final image) +0.6, lyric resonance +0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.2 = 4.2, adjust +2.2 for strong rhythmic payoff and embodied link = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "luminous harbor by moonlight" is established in paragraph one, governs light-reflection tactics (mirrors, white flowers), and charges the final image (wind off the water, cutting trembles). Setting pressures her choice to plant (light exposure) and supplies the visual anchor for her motivation. Early signal +0.8, two beats (light design, final image) +0.9, causal pressure (orientation and light exposure enable garden) +1.0, closure linkage (harbor wind in final line) +1.0, irreplaceability (specific moonlit geometry) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.2 = 7.2, adjust +0.4 for strong spatial coherence = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops from the old rosebush" is the inciting image, anchors the opening, and governs all subsequent action—cleaning and replanting happen in the immediate aftermath. It tightens the decision (now is the moment to replace) and charges the closure (new cutting vs. old rose). Early signal (opening line) +0.8, two beats (petal drop, replanting) +0.9, causal pressure (loss forces replacement) +1.2, closure linkage (old/new contrast at end) +1.2, irreplaceability +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7, adjust +0.6 for strong temporal coherence = 8.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To reflect light into dark corners" is Maren's stated motivation (mirrors, white flowers, alley transformation) and demonstrated through design choices. It does not create friction or cost directly—the replanting choice is driven by faith/pragmatism—but it shapes her tactics and thematic stance. Early signal +0.6, one beat (mirror/flower system) +0.4, causal pressure (guides setting design) +0.7, closure linkage (implicit in tending-light metaphor) +0.5, cost connection (effort, risk) +0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5, adjust +1.9 for strong motivational clarity and thematic depth = 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" modulates coherently: the fire escape is risky (vulnerability) yet Maren tends it with routine and preparation (protected); her faith is "naked" and "embarrassed her" (vulnerability) yet she plants with measured gestures (protected). Tone charges the final image—cutting trembles (vulnerability), then holds still (protection through persistence). Early signal +0.7, tone coherent through turns +1.0, closure linkage (trembles/holds duality) +1.3, irreplaceability (specific emotional texture) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.6 = 6.6, adjust +1.4 for strong tonal control under pressure = 8.0.</comment>
