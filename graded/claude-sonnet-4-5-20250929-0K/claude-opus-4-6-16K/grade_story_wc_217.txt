<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interior moves from paralysis (weeks circling an incomplete poem) to productive engagement through concrete stimuli (feather's split barb, kite's snap). The realization that beauty lives in fracture rather than completion is earned by accumulating particulars, though the final epiphany risks slight over-articulation ("The beauty she sought was not in completion but in the fracture"). Embodied emotion appears in "her pen idle," "fingers closing around the wet quill," and "wiping tears with a sandy fist." Agency crystallizes in the decision to write by harmonizing discord, accepting incompleteness as strength—a renunciation of the perfect rendering she sought, foreclosing the path of seamless wholeness with visible cost (the poem will never be finished).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren accepts the poem will remain unfinished, a stance crystallized by the feather's crook and kite's snap, foreclosing the pursuit of seamless completion. The cost is legible in "would never be finished" and "unfinished poem like a lantern," reweighting the dominant stake (completing the dawn poem) through density increase and pattern break (split barb, snapped string, open net). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (Maren, lagoon, post-rain, notebook open). One meaningful deepening: the kite-snap moment triggers the shift from paralyzed circling to warmly attentive writing. Minor penalty: the epiphanic statement "The beauty she sought was not in completion but in the fracture" slightly tells what the images have shown, reducing the closure's opacity by a fraction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lagoon's post-rain stillness, the feather's tactile crook, and the kite's red diamond against bruised clouds are vivid and selective. The feather's "faint crook, as if the drake had once caught it against stone" and the water's "dark water" filling footprints constrain perception and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent (Maren at water's edge, child up the shore, kite descending to water). Micro-setting qualification met: the feather as object-as-setting constrains the on-page choice to press it into the notebook and charges the closure by representing imperfection as generative. Sensory selection reflects urgency: crisis narrows to feather and kite; calm moments admit "copper" clouds and "burnished hush."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: complete the dawn poem. One meaningful tightening occurs when the kite string snaps, triggering Maren's insight that beauty lies in fracture, which narrows her options from seeking seamlessness to accepting incompleteness. Agency drives the turn: she chooses to "write by harmonizing discord," a renunciation with visible cost ("The poem would never be finished"). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through pattern break (idle pen → patient accumulation). Minor issue: the escalation relies heavily on one external trigger (kite snap) rather than a second protagonist-driven complication, landing the tightening near the sufficient threshold for this length but not deeper into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (beauty in brokenness) emerges through concrete particulars: split barb, snapped string, child's tears, the net with "deliberate holes." The final image of the unfinished poem as lantern offers a resonant answer without stated moral, reweighting prior material. Minor penalty: "The beauty she sought was not in completion but in the fracture" and "that was precisely its strength" veer close to thematic statement, reducing the work the images must do. The phrase "woven dawns" recurs but remains slightly abstract, not fully grounded in a second on-page choice it constrains. Subtext operates in gesture (child wiping tears, feather pressing a crease) and the lagoon holding "everything and reflected nothing back but sky."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization through Maren's perceptual signature: "the kind who arrived before anyone else," "warm attentive now to every imperfect thing." Diction remains character-particular ("cathedral," "hymn fading into silence," "dark water behind her") without register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from reflective ("she had been trying to write about dawn") to immediate ("She reached for it without thinking"). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control under pressure: short declaratives at the kite-snap beat ("The string snapped—a quick, silent severance") accelerate momentum, then return to longer, layered syntax in the resolution. Minor texture convergence: "burnished hush" appears twice in the final third, a slight echo that does not disrupt voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Its surface carrying the last tremors of the storm like a hymn fading into silence" anchors tone, setting, and thematic seed). Rhythm varies naturally with some purposeful parallelism ("grief beside wonder, breakage beside iridescence"). Modest deductions: "the half-finished poem in her notebook ached like one [wound]" is a register bump ("ached like one" feels slightly constructed); "the incompleteness gnawed at her" is near-paraphrase of the prior sentence's ache metaphor, a minor loop. The phrase "burnished hush" appears verbatim twice in the final paragraphs without reweighted meaning, a small density slip. Template-cadence check: no three-sentence runs of identical stems detected. Overall propulsion is strong, but the two minor loops and one register bump prevent entry into the 7.5+ zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of nature observation → creative breakthrough via fractured beauty is familiar in artist-struggle narratives, yet the piece specifies it through the feather's crook and kite's snap rather than generic epiphany. The "net with deliberate holes" image and the decision to let the poem remain unfinished offer a fresh inflection on the perfectionism trope. Transformation test: swapping lagoon for forest or feather for leaf would require moderate rewrites, suggesting moderate integration. Proximity check: "cathedral," "hymn," and the lantern metaphor echo common lyric strategies but are not close lifts. The piece commits to its premise without retreat but does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that would elevate it into the 7.5+ band; the arc remains within a well-trodden template (artist seeks completion → learns to accept incompletion).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren (quiet shoreline poet) is present throughout and makes two key choices: reaching for the feather (paragraph 4) and beginning to write by harmonizing discord (paragraph 7). These choices create the central turn from paralysis to productive engagement. She appears in the setup (paragraph 1), drives middle development (feather press, paragraph 5), and shapes closure (walking home with unfinished poem, final paragraph). Causal pressure: her decision to press the feather and later write forecloses the path of seeking seamless completion. Closure linkage: strong—she carries the unfinished poem "like a lantern" in the final image. Cost: visible in "would never be finished, she realized, and that was precisely its strength." Specificity: "quiet shoreline poet" is somewhat generic; the phrase could apply to many contemplative artist figures without altering the arc. Swappability: −0.3 (could be "reclusive painter" or "solitary sculptor" with minor adjustments to setting). Early signal +0.5, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.4. Deductions: mild swappability −0.3, slight abstraction in the phrase "quiet shoreline poet" −0.2. Total: 3.0 base +4.0 positives −0.5 frictions = 6.5, round down to 6.2 per specificity gap and no unique trait that another artist-type could not supply.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drake's tail feather appears in paragraph 4 (Maren reaches for it), is handled and pressed into the notebook in paragraph 5 ("pressed it between the pages"), returns with reweighted meaning in paragraph 7 ("The feather's crook pressing a faint crease into the page"), and charges the final moment (she "closed the notebook around the drake's tail feather"). Four distinct beats. Its split barb and rachis crook embody the fracture-as-beauty theme and directly trigger the insight in paragraph 6 ("looked down at the drake's tail feather pressed against her unfinished lines and understood something"). Causal pressure: the feather's imperfection shapes the realization that beauty lies in brokenness, altering Maren's stance from seeking seamlessness to accepting incompletion. Closure linkage: strong—it is enclosed in the notebook at the final action beat. Specificity: high—"split barb" and "faint crook" are irreplaceable details that no generic object could supply without losing thematic charge. Early signal +0.6, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5. No major frictions. Total: 3.0 +6.0 = 9.0, capped at 7.8 due to the feather's thematic role being slightly told in paragraph 6 ("understood something she had been circling") rather than left fully implicit, reducing irreplaceability by a margin.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The phrase "woven dawns" appears at the top of Maren's notebook page (paragraph 2) and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("Another dawn was already weaving itself into the fabric of this one"). Setup present by first third. Middle development: weak—the concept does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic in the middle beats; it remains thematic. Closure participation: the final recurrence reweights the opening seed by linking today's fading glow to tomorrow's light, a lyric reprise that deepens meaning without direct action. Causal pressure: minimal—no on-page decision hinges on "woven dawns" as a mechanism; it frames the thematic question but does not alter tactics. Specificity: moderate—"woven" is evocative but could be swapped for "layered" or "interlaced" with minor edits. Early signal +0.5, closure reprise (lyric) +0.8, thematic resonance +0.4. Frictions: no middle beat involvement −0.8, swappability −0.5, ornamental in middle third −0.6. Total: 3.0 +1.7 −1.9 = 2.8, lifted to 5.1 by the stronger-than-minimal closure reprise that ties the ending image to the opening phrase, qualifying under the lyric-resonance allowance at the upper 5.5 neighborhood; round to 5.1 given mild swappability and lack of mid-story constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The attribute "warmly attentive" appears explicitly in paragraph 7 ("She began to write, warmly attentive now to every imperfect thing around her"). Setup: late first appearance (70% mark) −0.6. Middle development: none—attribute is introduced after the key turn. Closure participation: the writing act in paragraph 7 is shaped by this stance, and the final image of carrying the poem "like a lantern" echoes the attentive glow, a mild reprise. Causal pressure: the shift to warm attention enables the productive writing choice, altering her stance from paralyzed to engaged. Cost connection: accepting incompleteness forecloses perfectionism. Specificity: "warmly attentive" is somewhat abstract; "attentive to small fractures" would be more irreplaceable. Late arrival −0.6, one-beat involvement +0.4, mild causal link +0.6, closure echo +0.5, label-only phrasing −0.3. Total: 3.0 +1.5 −0.9 = 3.6, lifted to 5.9 by the undeniable shift in paragraph 7 where her attentive stance drives the writing decision and the closure's "lantern" image charges the trait retrospectively, qualifying under lyric-resonance. Round to 5.9 given late signal and moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action "tend" appears in the opening ("She had come here to tend something she could not name") and recurs in paragraph 7 ("She tended each line the way she tended the shoreline itself, picking up what the water offered, setting down what did not belong"). Setup: first third. Middle: the feather-press in paragraph 5 is an act of tending (she "pressed it between the pages, careful not to crush it further"), though not explicitly labeled. Closure: the final tending action in paragraph 7 drives the writing choice, and the ending posture of carrying the poem home embodies ongoing care. Causal pressure: tending as method shapes her decision to accept incompleteness and write patiently. Specificity: high—"tend" connotes care, patience, and selective curation distinct from "fix" or "complete." Early signal +0.7, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6. Friction: the explicit recurrence in paragraph 7 borders on over-articulation ("tended each line the way she tended the shoreline") −0.4. Total: 3.0 +4.3 −0.4 = 6.9, round to 6.7 given the mild redundancy in the final reprise and the fact that the tending decision is more internal reorientation than a visible, costly external action that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The method "by harmonizing discord" appears explicitly in paragraph 7 ("She wrote by harmonizing discord, letting the poem hold contradictions without resolving them"). Setup: none—first mention at 75% mark. Middle: no signal that this method is under consideration; the feather and kite trigger the insight but do not demonstrate harmonizing discord in action before the phrase is introduced. Closure: the method shapes the final writing stance and the net-with-holes metaphor, but it arrives too late to be tested or constrained. Causal pressure: minimal—it names the solution rather than shaping prior attempts. Specificity: moderate—"harmonizing discord" is evocative but slightly abstract; "weaving grief beside wonder" would be more concrete. Late arrival −0.7, one-beat involvement +0.4, closure linkage +0.6, label-only use −0.3. Total: 3.0 +1.0 −1.0 = 3.0, lifted to 4.8 by the undeniable presence at closure where the method articulates the poem's stance and the net metaphor extends it, qualifying at the functional-but-late threshold. Round to 4.8 given late signal and lack of middle development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon after rain anchors setting in paragraph 1 ("cobalt lagoon lay still beneath a sky bruised with retreating clouds") and recurs as "lagoon's glassy skin" (paragraph 4), "lagoon's deep cobalt memory" (paragraph 8), and the final image where "the lagoon held everything" (paragraph 9). Four distinct beats. The post-rain stillness provides the reflective context that enables Maren's contemplation; the water's surface catches the feather and later the kite, supplying the visual stimuli that trigger her insight. Causal pressure: moderate—the setting enables observation but does not constrain a choice (she could reach the same insight elsewhere with different objects). Closure linkage: strong—the lagoon holding "everything and reflected nothing back but sky" charges the final image with thematic weight. Specificity: "cobalt" recurs three times, anchoring color and mood distinctly. Early signal +0.7, three-beat involvement +1.4, mild causal role +0.8, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.6. Frictions: postcard description in places ("bruised with retreating clouds" is vivid but conventional) −0.4, the lagoon enables rather than constrains −0.3. Total: 3.0 +4.8 −0.7 = 7.1, held at 7.1 given strong presence and closure charge but moderate causal pressure—remove lagoon, insert forest pond, and the arc holds with minimal rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "as a kite string snaps" is metaphorical rather than a literal clock. The phrase appears in Maren's interior thought (paragraph 6: "As a kite string snaps, Maren thought, everything rearranges") and the kite-snap event occurs on the page in paragraph 5. Setup: kite introduced early (paragraph 5), snap occurs mid-story. Middle: the snap event triggers the key insight, functioning as a pressure point. Closure: the aftermath ("The child had gone. The kite had sunk.") marks elapsed time and reinforces the snap's consequence. Time pressure: weak—no live clock constrains decisions; the snap is a one-time event that enables realization but does not create ongoing urgency. Specificity: high—"kite string snaps" is a concrete, irreplaceable image tied to sudden severance. Early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement (snap event + aftermath) +0.9, causal trigger +1.0, closure echo +0.8, specificity +0.7. Frictions: no ongoing time constraint −0.8, metaphorical use dilutes literal timeframe function −0.5. Total: 3.0 +4.0 −1.3 = 5.7, lifted to 6.4 by the snap's undeniable causal role as the pivot moment that reweights Maren's stance, though it functions as a single trigger rather than a sustained temporal frame that narrows options across beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover beauty in the incomplete" is implicit in Maren's circling of the half-finished poem (paragraph 2) and becomes explicit in paragraph 6 ("The beauty she sought was not in completion but in the fracture"). Setup: present by paragraph 2 as the ache of incompleteness. Middle: the feather's split barb and kite's snap dramatize the incomplete as generative, testing and reweighting her initial desire for seamlessness. Closure: she accepts the poem will never be finished, embracing incompletion as strength. Desire is conflicted: she wants wholeness (weeks trying to complete the dawn poem) but the cost of perfectionism (paralysis, "gnawed at her") forces the shift to valuing fracture. Causal pressure: strong—her recognition that "the poem would never be finished" forecloses the pursuit of seamless completion. Specificity: "beauty in the incomplete" is somewhat abstract; "finding iridescence in the split barb" would be more concrete. Early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.1, cost connection +0.5. Frictions: slight abstraction −0.3, the final articulation borders on told insight −0.4. Total: 3.0 +4.3 −0.7 = 6.6, round to 6.3 given the motivation is more discovered than pursued with ongoing friction; she circles it rather than dramatizing competing wants that force a hard trade-off mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone "burnished hush" appears explicitly twice: paragraph 2 ("the storm like a hymn fading into silence" establishes hush) and paragraph 9 ("in the burnished hush of that incomplete evening"). Setup: established by paragraph 2 with "still," "quiet," "fading into silence." The tone modulates under pressure: the kite's "frantic joy" and child's cry (paragraph 5) introduce brief agitation, then return to "patient accumulation" (paragraph 7) and "burnished hush" at closure. Coherence: strong—tone holds through turns without static flatness. Closure charge: the final "burnished hush" reweights the opening stillness by adding "incomplete," tying tone to theme. Causal role: minimal—tone supports but does not constrain a choice. Specificity: "burnished" is evocative but "copper" and "glow" overlap, risking slight redundancy. Early signal +0.7, modulation under pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, coherence +0.8. Frictions: no causal constraint −0.5, slight redundancy ("burnished" echoed by "copper" glow) −0.2. Total: 3.0 +3.6 −0.7 = 5.9, lifted to 7.3 by the undeniable coherence and the fact that "burnished hush" charges the final image by fusing tone with thematic acceptance of incompletion, though it remains primarily atmospheric rather than a tactical force.</comment>
