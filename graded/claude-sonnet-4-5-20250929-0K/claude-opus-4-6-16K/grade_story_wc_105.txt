<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is concrete and particular—she seeks to map the frequency of trust breaking after her divorce—and her method (collecting absences) reveals character through obsessive action. The synesthesia trait is embodied (burgundy hum in molars) and her weeping among the apples carries contradictory weight: grief and purpose intertwined. The final choice to build a warning system is earned by the accumulation of her work, though the leap from personal wound to functional hearing aid feels slightly undercooked in terms of trade-off visibility. Internal contradiction operates well: she seeks the sound "not to relive the pain, but to understand it," yet the weeping confirms unresolved emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Maren's collection of absences builds density until the greenhouse layers Elda's loss onto her own, and the closure reconfigures her grief into utility ("a small warning, a chance to intervene"). The opening anchors who, where, and premise by the second paragraph. The final beat—packing equipment, carrying absences toward usefulness—lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: she will encode heartbreak into technology, a choice that both honors and instrumentalizes pain. One tight reversal: she sought her own burgundy and found Elda's, which validates her method and deepens her stake on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse, shipwrecks, and ashen forge anchor the setting with specific, pressure-loaded detail: glass panels level with barnacled ribs, salt-stunted apples, mud that swallows footprints. The forge serves as a spatial marker under the aurora and metaphorically holds "the shape of every tool it had ever repaired," charging the final image of Maren's repair work. Sensory hierarchy filters through Maren's synesthetic perception (aurora as E minor chord, burgundy frequency). The setting constrains her recording setup and the orchard's decay mirrors Elda's abandonment, making the environment inseparable from theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding and mapping the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and tightens when Maren recognizes the burgundy frequency beneath Elda's absence, validating her method and her grief simultaneously. The escalation is accumulative: each site visit builds her archive until this one yields both emotional confirmation and practical application. The cost is legible in her weeping and in the choice to encode trauma into hearing aids, foreclosing pure catharsis in favor of instrumentalized memory. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes trust breaking has a universal frequency, not just hers.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—trust as cellular division, "the faith that both halves would survive"—emerges from concrete image (dividing apple-tree cells) without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution: Maren will build a warning system, but cannot undo her loss or Elda's. The burgundy frequency returns with reweighted meaning: first her wife's betrayal, then Elda's abandonment, finally a universal acoustic shadow. The closing image—greenhouse sinking, orchard swallowing footprints—offers resonant reconfiguration without stated moral, inviting reflection on repair, memory, and the cost of foresight. The synesthesia grounds abstraction in embodied perception throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable, filtering all perception through Maren's synesthetic lens (colors hum, aurora sings E minor). Diction remains consistent—technical precision ("calibrated the microphones") balanced with lyric compression ("battered and marvelous architecture of her grief"). The prose reflects her designer's mind: she maps, records, builds. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the weeping beat. The final paragraph modulates into quiet declarative rhythm that matches her resolve. One brief filter-verb cluster ("she thought") in the aurora description is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character, setting, or theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully—longer accumulative sentences in description, clipped declaratives at closure. Minor issues: "battered and marvelous architecture of her grief" verges on overwriting in a high-pressure beat, and "the colors of the aurora whispered their chord" slightly repeats the earlier E minor observation without added pressure. The cell-division reflection is purposeful but dense for the emotional peak. No loops or scaffolding; syntax propels. The opening and closing images anchor and recharge cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia, acoustic archaeology ("collecting absences"), and the sunken orchard is specific and non-obvious. The premise—that trust breaking has a mappable frequency—feels fresh and is pursued with committed logic. The greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks, Elda's voice imprinted in tree growth, and the leap to hearing-aid design cohere as a singular vision. Minor proximity concern: the "negative space that still vibrated with memory" has echoes of well-worn language around absence and trace, though the execution through sound recording particularizes it. Risk-taking in the metaphysics of sound and memory heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's profession as hearing aid designer is signaled early, shapes her method (sensitive recording equipment, frequency mapping), and drives the closure choice: she will build a warning system into her next design. Her technical expertise enables the entire quest and forecasts the application. Present in setup, middle (calibrating microphones), and payoff (taking frequencies home to the workbench). The decision to instrumentalize grief is hers and redefines her professional purpose.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ashen forge appears twice: first described as Elda's husband's tool-repair site under the aurora, then in the closing summary ("holding the shape of every tool it had ever repaired"). It anchors spatial choreography and accrues metaphorical weight (repair, memory of function) that parallels Maren's goal. However, it is not handled or used by Maren; it remains descriptive. The reprise in the final paragraph reweights it thematically but does not constrain a choice. Present in setup and closure; minimal middle development.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Memories as imprint drive the entire premise: Maren records "the acoustic shadow of subtraction," Elda's voice persists in tree growth, and the final choice is to encode memory into technology. The concept shapes stakes (finding and mapping a memory-frequency) and tactics (visiting sites of absence, using custom equipment). It alters options: Maren forgoes personal catharsis to pursue instrumental memory. Present throughout and decisive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Synesthesia (hearing colors) is embodied early (burgundy hum in molars), enables her to recognize the burgundy frequency in Elda's absence, and validates her method on the page. It constrains her perception—she "hears" the aurora as E minor—and is causally active at the climax when she catches the burgundy beneath the recordings. The trait is not merely decorative; it is the mechanism by which she identifies trust breaking and decides to encode it. Present in setup, middle, and payoff with visible function.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Imprinting is the story's central action: Maren imprints absences onto recordings, her grief imprints onto her equipment and memory, and the final act is taking imprinted frequencies home to build them into a device. The verb recurs with escalating stakes—from technical description to emotional embodiment to functional application. The closure hinges on this action: imprint becomes useful. Swapping "imprint" for another verb would weaken the thematic recursion and the technical-emotional fusion. Present across all beats and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Collecting absences is Maren's method, signaled early (church bell silence, felled oak, music box gap) and demonstrated on the page at the greenhouse. She sets up equipment, calibrates microphones, and presses record to capture "what was no longer there." The method shapes her tactics throughout and yields the burgundy frequency at closure. It is specific, irreplaceable, and causally active: without this method, she cannot find or map the sound. Present in setup, executed in the middle, and delivers payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks anchors every beat: Maren walks among salt-stunted apples, sets equipment on the anvil, and the glass throws aurora light across branches. The setting supplies the absence (Elda's voice), the resource (dividing tree cells as metaphor and evidence), and the constraint (mud, brackish water, decay). Spatial choreography is precise and the orchard's sinking bookends the story, charging the final image. The setting is indispensable to stakes, method, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The phrase "while cells divide" appears once as a lyric meditation on trust and commitment, reframing the orchard's ongoing growth as evidence of biological faith. It seeds the trust-as-division theme and the closing image of trees "dividing their cells toward another season." However, it does not function as a ticking clock or tighten decisions; it is conceptual rather than temporal pressure. Present in setup and reprise at closure with thematic weight but minimal tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—to find and map the sound of trust breaking—is dramatized in every choice: traveling to the greenhouse, setting up equipment, pressing record, weeping when she recognizes the frequency. The desire is conflicted: she seeks understanding "not to relive the pain," yet the discovery triggers tears. Her final choice to build a warning system shows the motivation driving action with visible cost (instrumentalizing grief, foreclosing catharsis). Present and pressured throughout, indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tone as "battered marvel" is coherent and modulated: the greenhouse is "sunk three feet," trees drink "brackish water," fruit tastes of "salt and perseverance," yet the architecture of grief is "marvelous" and the orchard keeps "becoming." Diction sustains this duality—decay and resilience intertwined—without tipping into sentimentality. The closing image ("salt and fruit and silence") crystallizes the tone and charges the final beat. The tone shapes perception at every turn and is indispensable to the story's emotional register.</comment>
