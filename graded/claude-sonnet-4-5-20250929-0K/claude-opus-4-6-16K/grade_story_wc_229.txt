<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior is embodied through tactile detail (palms on stone, vibrations) and her sustained renunciation of the title "head keeper" reveals humility as a lived value. Her final choice—pouring seawater on the lens while knowing she will "never know" the effect—demonstrates contradictory impulses (desire for proof vs. acceptance of mystery) acting simultaneously. The shift from isolation to service is earned through seven years of ritual, though Donal's pivot remains entirely off-stage, weakening the felt cost of Maren's wager. Backstory is interleaved with present action (garden scent, lens cleaning) and tilts her stance toward whispered invitation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the second paragraph; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. The ending image—Donal choosing to hear the whisper and returning home—reweights the premise (warning vs. beckoning) with conceptual cost: Maren's work succeeds in secret, and she remains the assistant to forces larger than herself. The seawater vial recurs with reweighted meaning (purification ritual → light-fractured tenderness → unseen rescue), and the persistent constraint of solitude shapes her tactics. One minor causality slip: the vial's properties ("changed over the years, or perhaps she had changed it") hover between metaphor and claim without grounding the mechanism on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt tower, dawn light, and night-blooming garden function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the scent signals weather shifts, the lens is the canvas for Maren's ritual, and the harbor town below provides spatial pressure (Donal's unseen presence). Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional attention (vibrations through stone, concentrated jasmine scent, copper sky). The vial and lens are handled tactilely across beats. Spatial choreography is clean (spiral stairs, lantern room, harbor below), and the garden's night-blooming cereus anchors both time and Maren's perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers beckon rather than warn—is signaled early and tightens when Maren pours the seawater onto the lens, a micro-choice that forecloses passivity. The Donal beat provides a concrete test: his pause and decision to return demonstrate the lighthouse's effect, though the payoff occurs entirely off-stage and without Maren's knowledge, diffusing the felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs (ritual → unseen rescue → acceptance of secrecy), and the persistent constraint of isolation shapes her final stance. Agency is clear (pouring the drops, corking the vial), but the lack of on-page friction between her desire for proof and the whisper's secrecy keeps the pressure conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The whisper-vs.-shout premise emerges through concrete particulars (vibrations, seawater, fractured light) and reweights prior material at closure: "whispers travel farther than shouts because they require you to lean in." The final image—Maren pressing palms to cobalt stone, assistant to "all of it"—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The vial, garden scent, and dawn ritual recur with accumulated meaning, and Donal's unseen rescue dramatizes the cost of whispering (efficacy without proof). One brief thematic echo ("That was the nature of whispers") hovers near summary but is anchored by the concrete image of his burning eyes and choice to board the boat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with free indirect coloring ("she believed in the humility of it"); narrative certainty matches what Maren can know, and inference reads as inference ("or perhaps she had changed it"). Perceptual signature is distinct: vibrations, concentrated scent, ritualized touch. Diction fits her contemplative voice ("tender and screaming need"), and no head-hopping occurs. One brief register lift ("accumulated tenderness of every night") reads slightly elevated but remains voice-plausible. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer reflection during lens-cleaning, compressed syntax during Donal's pause. No dialogue appears; interiority and embodied action carry the narrative cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at closure, longer cadences during reflection), and information density is high (most lines advance character, setting, or theme). One minor loop: "The heat wave was over. The air was clean." paraphrases the opening break without added pressure. Figurative language is controlled (cobalt tower "glowing like something not entirely real," light "invited the lost") and rooted in Maren's perceptual filter. No filter-verb stacks, template cadence, or ambiguous pronouns appear. The phrase "vibrations of intent" recurs three times but functions as a charged motif rather than scaffold. Propulsion is steady; no beats stall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise (lighthouse as beckoning rather than warning) offers a fresh angle on a familiar setting, and the seawater ritual provides specific, non-obvious texture. Emotional truth (Maren's acceptance of secrecy, Donal's grief-driven pause) avoids templates. The vial's dual claim (purification ritual and metaphor) and the off-stage rescue read as minor safety hedges that keep risk contained. The ending's quiet acceptance of "assistant to all of it" feels inevitable in hindsight, and the whisper-vs.-shout calculus commits fully to its implications. One friction: the conceptual elegance of the premise slightly outpaces the on-page stakes, as Donal's pivot occurs in a single paragraph without prior setup.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (assistant lighthouse keeper) drives the entire narrative arc: she climbs the stairs, performs the ritual, pours the seawater, and accepts the secrecy of her work. Her choice to remain "assistant" shapes her stance at closure, and her final act (pressing palms to stone) charges the ending image. The character is indispensable; remove her and the story collapses. Early signal (first paragraph), beat involvement (at least three: climbing, pouring, closure), causal pressure (ritual enables unseen rescue), closure linkage (final palms-to-stone image), and specificity (her seven-year tenure and humility) all converge. Swappability is nil.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The vial cork appears twice: "stopped with a cork worn smooth by years of handling" (setup) and "She corked the vial again" (closure beat). The worn-smooth detail charges the first mention with history, and the re-corking anchors the ritual's completion. However, the cork itself does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as a closure-adjacent prop that marks the ritual's boundaries. Two-beat presence and closure proximity lift it above ornamental, but specificity is modest (any stopper would serve the same function). Early signal, lyric reprise, and closure framing place it in mid-band; lack of causal pressure or cost connection prevents higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core concept (vibrations of intent) is named explicitly and frames Maren's worldview: "Every action carried a frequency beneath its surface, a tremor of purpose that others could feel." It shapes her ritual (holding the vial with care to settle impurities, pouring drops to scatter tenderness) and the Donal payoff (he feels "a pull, gentle as a hand on his shoulder"). However, the mechanics remain metaphorical; the concept does not constrain a specific on-page choice with visible cost. Early signal (within first third), thematic presence throughout, and closure linkage (Donal's response) qualify it as functional. Swappability is moderate (any "intentionality shapes perception" frame would work); specificity lifts it slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The attribute (purifies intentions) is tied to the seawater vial: "The water, she believed, purified intentions—not through magic, but through the slow, patient work of holding something with care until the impurities settled and only clarity remained." This belief motivates her ritual, but the on-page action (pouring three drops) does not dramatize a cost or constraint tied to purification itself. The attribute is stated rather than tested; no beat shows what happens if intentions are impure or if the purification fails. Early signal, thematic presence, and closure proximity place it in functional range, but lack of causal pressure or visible tradeoff keeps it mid-band. Swappability is high (any "patient care yields clarity" claim would serve).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The action (beckon) is the story's conceptual spine: "The lighthouse beckoned ships home, and there was a difference between a scream and a whisper." It drives Maren's ritual (scattering tenderness via light) and is dramatized in Donal's beat: "the light whispered... telling him he was seen." The entire premise hinges on beckoning as distinct from warning; swap it for "guides" or "warns" and the thematic calculus collapses. Early signal (within first third), beat involvement (ritual, Donal's response, closure reflection), causal pressure (the whisper enables his choice), and closure linkage (final image of Maren as assistant to the beckoning) converge. Specificity and irreplaceability are high. Minor deduction: Donal's response is off-stage, diffusing the action's felt immediacy.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method (by the scent of a garden at night) is signaled early: "By the scent of that garden at night, she had always been able to feel the shift of seasons, the turning of weather." It shapes Maren's perceptual signature and anchors the timeframe (night-blooming cereus, jasmine exhaling "a scent so concentrated it seemed to have weight"). The scent also brackets the closure beat ("the scent of night-blooming flowers rising from the garden below"). However, the method does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as environmental texture that supports mood and setting. Two-beat presence (dawn approach, closure reflection) and closure framing place it in mid-band; lack of causal pressure prevents higher placement. Swappability is moderate (any sensory anchor would work).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn is indispensable: the tower's vibrations teach Maren its moods, the lantern room is the site of her ritual, and the dawn light ("copper and pale fire") charges the final image. The setting constrains her choices (she must climb to the lantern room, clean the lens, pour the seawater) and supplies the resources (lens, light, spatial remove from Donal below). Cobalt is a charged detail (the tower "caught the light in a way that made it glow like something not entirely real") that recurs in the closure beat. Early signal (first paragraph), beat involvement (at least three: approach, ritual, closure), causal pressure (the lens enables the ritual's effect), closure linkage (Maren presses palms to "the cobalt wall"), and specificity converge. Minor deduction: dawn functions more as mood anchor than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe (after the heat wave breaks) is signaled in the opening line ("The heat wave broke at 3:47 in the morning") and brackets the story (closure: "The heat wave was over. The air was clean."). The break enables the scent's concentrated sweetness and Maren's renewed ritual, but it does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the story would function identically if set on any calm dawn. Early signal and closure reprise place it in functional range, but lack of causal pressure or tactical constraint keeps it mid-band. Swappability is high (any post-storm or seasonal shift would serve). The specific time (3:47) adds texture but does not alter options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation (to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts) is dramatized through Maren's ritual and Donal's unseen response. Her pouring of the seawater is a micro-choice driven by this desire, and the closure reflection ("the whisperer never demanded proof") shows her acceptance of the cost: efficacy without validation. However, the motivation is stated more than tested; no on-page beat shows friction between her desire for proof and the secrecy the whisper demands. Early signal (within first third), beat involvement (ritual, Donal's response, closure acceptance), and closure linkage converge. Lack of visible conflict between competing wants and the off-stage payoff keep it from higher bands. Specificity is strong (whisper-vs.-shout calculus is unique to this premise).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tone (screaming tenderness) is coherent and purposeful: "the tender and screaming need of every soul at sea" crystallizes the oxymoron. Diction layers urgency and care ("whispered word," "burning eyes," "gentle as a hand on his shoulder"), and the rhythm modulates with pressure (longer reflection during ritual, compressed syntax during Donal's pause). The tone charges the final image: Maren as assistant to forces both tender and desperate. Early signal (within first third), sustained through beats, and closure linkage converge. One minor friction: the explicit phrase "screaming tenderness" arrives late (final third), risking label-only use, but the diction and rhythm establish the effect earlier. Specificity and irreplaceability are high; swap for "urgent compassion" and the edge dulls.</comment>
