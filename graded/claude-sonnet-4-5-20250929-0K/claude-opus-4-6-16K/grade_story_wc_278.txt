<comment>Maren's constellation tattoos and guilt-driven firmware building establish clear motivation, and the brother's amber with trapped fly creates a tactile closing beat. However, the interiority leans toward abstract poetic register ("frequencies she couldn't tune out," "dissonance softened") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to write back feels signaled rather than earned through visible internal conflict; we see decision more than struggle.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Maren whispers apology, firmware responds "I know," she begins writing back—with felt cost (eleven years of severed connection acknowledged). Orientation anchors early (lab, Maren, her role). The accumulation of letters reweights her stance and the firmware's messages shift in response, creating one meaningful deepening. Cost is present but somewhat diffuse; the amber and letter-writing reconfigure options cleanly enough under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is vivid and specific (jars of silence, wax cylinders, extinct birds), and the amber constrains the final gesture when Maren presses it to the firmware. The 3–4 a.m. temporal anchor and the lab's sensory details (meteor-hush, jars breathing) charge the tone. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The amber qualifies as micro-setting that charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but the lab itself remains more atmospheric than tactically constraining.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is guilt over abandonment, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the firmware's messages shift from "come back" to "she's reading," reflecting Maren's engagement with the letters. The final apology and firmware's "I know" narrow options (she must write back). Cost is felt but remains largely internal and retrospective; the eleven-year gap provides scale, yet the on-page forfeiture is more opportunity than immediate sacrifice.</comment>

<comment>Theme of confronting buried guilt and the possibility of repair emerges through the firmware's evolving translations and the amber as "trapped time." The constellation tattoos as "fixed points" in the closing beat offer a resonant image of pattern persisting after loss without overt moralizing. The firmware responding to her reading the letters creates a subtle feedback loop between action and meaning. One small slip: "dissonance softened into something almost quiet" edges toward thematic summary, but the amber and letter-writing ground the insight in concrete action.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a lyric register appropriate to the laboratory setting and Maren's interior state. Perceptual signature is present (constellation charts memorized as a child, acoustic parsing). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("frequencies," "dissonance," "spectral wails") that reads more authorial than character-specific. The final paragraph's syntax ("proof that even after light dies, its pattern remains") is polished but slightly distant from the embodied tactile moment of holding amber and writing.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful (jars breathing, meteor-hush, trapped time). Clarity is high; no pronoun confusion or timeline breaks. Minor density slip: "The haunted firmware continued its translations. But as Maren read letter after letter, the messages on the screen began to change" could compress. The phrase "long tail of a meteor burning itself into nothing, leaving only the memory of brightness across the dark" is vivid but risks slight overwriting in the final beat. No loops or scaffold; information density is strong overall.</comment>

<comment>The firmware-as-guilt-echo and lab of lost sounds offer fresh specificity, and the amber as "trapped time" mailed by the brother is a strong particular. However, the estranged-sibling reconciliation frame and guilt-haunted-device trope are familiar; transformation hinges on the firmware's responsive translations and the lab setting. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and the final image feels earned, but the emotional arc (guilt → letters → apology → writing back) follows a recognizable template. Specificity elevates but does not fully escape the archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>Maren is present throughout and her decision to code the firmware, read the letters, and write back creates key turns. The constellation tattoos are described in detail but do not constrain a choice or alter tactics; they function as characterization and closing image anchor. She shapes the narrative but her occupation as tattooist is ornamental to the firmware and guilt arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The amber appears early (brother's "trapped time" mailed in the final envelope), is handled on the page (Maren presses it against the firmware), and charges the closure beat ("whispered the only translation that mattered: I'm sorry"). It bridges the brother's childhood and Maren's present action. Removing it would weaken the tactile closure and the thematic link between preservation and repair.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Haunted firmware is introduced early, drives the middle beats (translating phantom cries, shifting messages as Maren reads letters), and delivers the closure line "I know." Its evolving translations shape Maren's realization and reweight her guilt. The device's silence at the end ("not broken, but finished") completes the arc. The firmware's mechanics and Maren's coding of guilt into its architecture are essential to causality and theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The firmware translates baby cries into text (hungry, cold, afraid, alone), which establishes Maren's original intent and her brother's cry as the frequency she carries. It enables the device's later phantom translations and thematic link to understanding infant distress. However, after setup, the attribute shifts to translating phantom guilt-messages rather than actual cries; its initial function is replaced. It shapes one key turn (Maren's reason for building it) but does not constrain later tactics directly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Tether" appears explicitly when Maren reads the letters: "Each letter tethered her more firmly to the life she'd severed." It describes the effect of the letters but is not itself an action Maren performs. The re-forming connection drives her stance shift, but "tether" functions more as metaphor than discrete causal act. It could be swapped with "bind" or "reconnect" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The method is signaled early (antique writing desk arrives, letters found beneath false bottom) and the letters' content (brother's life, amber, plea to come home) drives the middle beats and Maren's shift. The final envelope contains the amber, enabling the closure gesture. The handwritten, accumulated nature of the letters—spanning years—matters; an email or single note would lack the weight. Removing this method would collapse the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is established immediately and provides vivid texture (jars of silence, wax cylinders, extinct birds, workbench). The lab's atmosphere (3–4 a.m., jars breathing, darkness) charges tone and the final beat ("laboratory held its breath and then released it"). However, the setting does not constrain Maren's choices or supply resources that alter outcome; she could read letters and press amber elsewhere. It enriches but does not drive tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"When time folds in on itself" appears once as a descriptor for 3–4 a.m. reading sessions and thematically links to the amber's "trapped time." It establishes mood but does not create a live clock or deadline that alters Maren's moves. The eleven-year gap provides scale, and the amber embodies frozen time, but the timeframe element itself is more poetic anchor than pressure device. Early seed and thematic reprise earn mid-band, but no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Maren's guilt over abandoning her brother is the engine: she built the firmware to understand his cry, reads the letters despite pain, and writes back. The motivation is dramatized through her actions (coding guilt into firmware, reading at 3 a.m., whispering apology) and the friction between her self-imposed isolation and the pull of the letters. Visible cost: eleven years severed, now bridged. The phrase "hush the dissonance" appears in the final paragraph, reinforcing that this drive shaped the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"Meteor hush" is named in the setup ("meteor-hush moments between three and four") and returns in the closing paragraph ("hush like the long tail of a meteor burning itself into nothing"). The tone—quiet, lingering, spectral—remains coherent through the lab's atmosphere, the firmware's ghost-cries, and the final softening. It modulates subtly (letters bring light, dissonance softens) and charges the closure image. A single static register would score lower; the purposeful echo and tonal arc lift it.</comment>
