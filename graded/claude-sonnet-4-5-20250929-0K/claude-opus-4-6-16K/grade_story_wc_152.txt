<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is rendered with specificity through her embroidery work and listening practice, but remains largely static—no meaningful internal contradiction or choice under pressure is visible on the page. The final candle-tilting is a tactical move that arrives without prior conflict or cost visible to the reader. Backstory about her mother provides motive but doesn't alter present stance. The piece delivers a coherent portrait but not the embodied struggle or foreclosed path required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (who, where, when anchored early). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: density builds through whispered conspiracies, candle mechanics, and the network of listeners. Closure is Charged Poise—Maren signals the coup's timeline and returns to her needle, crystallizing her stance as documenter rather than warner. However, the cost remains largely told ("her mother had been erased") rather than felt in the final image; no on-page trade-off or visible price shapes the closing beat. One meaningful deepening (the synchronization sequence) is present, satisfying length requirements, but the conceptual cost at closure is oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is vividly particularized (oxidized dome, sound-channeling architecture, embroidery alcove) and constrains Maren's method—she uses the building's acoustic properties and the dome's slit for signaling. The eternal candle and autumn wind are woven into action. Setting shapes tactics (listening posts, light pulses) and charges the final image (dome's breath, flame's persistence). Achieves the 9+ gate test cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: document the coup to prevent erasure. Pressure coheres through accumulated intelligence fragments and the tightening timeline ("four days out"). The synchronization beat narrows options and the ending reaffirms her stance. However, no on-page reversal or visible cost accompanies the final choice—she simply continues her work. Under Accumulative lens one deepening suffices, but the lack of felt trade-off or foreclosed path in the closure moment limits upper range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (witnessing, preservation against erasure, the underestimated as chroniclers) emerges organically from the embroidery metaphor and the listener network. The mother's erasure grounds the stakes in concrete history rather than abstraction. The final image—"she heard everything"—resonates without moralizing. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the ending. The piece earns its reflection without forcing a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and filtered through Maren's perceptual signature (listening between echoes, stitching as charting). Diction is controlled and elevated but voice-appropriate for an observatory keeper; no register drift. No dialogue is present. The prose modulates purposefully from descriptive texture to operational detail (candle signals). Psychic distance remains consistent. Perceptual filtering ("disguising wisdom as foolishness was not a skill she had been born with but one she had cultivated") is character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, and sentence openings are distinct. Minor issues: "the silence grew heavier" and "listening was everything" trend toward stock intensifiers; "the way a single pulled stitch could unravel an entire pattern" is functional but leans into overwriting. The metaphor density in the opening paragraph (bruise, holding breath, deep space, decorative nonsense) approaches saturation without muddling clarity. No loops or scaffold present. Propulsion is steady but a few lines could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The disabled-listener network is a fresh synthesis; the embroidery-as-conspiracy-map conceit is specific and purposeful. However, the premise (secret historian documenting coup via coded art before it happens) follows a recognizable template. The transformation lies in execution—sensory particulars, the eternal candle mechanics, the acoustic architecture—but the emotional arc and thematic territory are well-trodden. The ending reaffirms rather than transforms.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout, her embroidery work frames the piece and drives the synchronization beat. Setup clear, middle development (charting constellations as conspiracies), and payoff (returns to needle after signaling). Her choice to document rather than warn is stated but the cost is told (mother's erasure) rather than felt in a present trade-off. Strong integration but not indispensable—role could be filled by another archivist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The eternal candle appears in three beats: beside her in the alcove, used for signaling (tilted behind lenses), and in the closing image (dancing but not dying). Early signal, middle use (synchronization), and closure participation all present. The flame's persistence charges the final image with thematic weight (fires older than institutions). Cost link: maintaining the candle is a duty tied to her role. Specificity high; removing it would break the signaling mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Conspiracy is the dominant stake and shapes her method (stitching meetings, troop movements). Setup by end of first third, middle development (webs of connection), and the ending declares "four days out." However, the unraveling is mostly told—we see her charting but no on-page moment where she decodes a key link or discovers a contradiction. The concept frames but doesn't drive a turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The disguise is stated early ("disguising wisdom as foolishness") and contextualizes her role as Observatory Fool. It enables her invisibility and listening access. However, no on-page scene tests the disguise—no moment where a diplomat dismisses her and she leverages it, or where maintaining the guise costs her. Present and functional but not dramatized with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Synchronization is the story's operational climax: tilting the candle behind colored lenses to send the timeline message. Setup (three other listeners introduced), development (her need to synchronize tonight), and payoff (three pulses, pause, two, pause, one long glow). The action is specific and irreplaceable; removing it would eliminate the story's only on-page decision moment. However, it arrives without friction or cost—she simply does it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Adjacent possibilities" is explicitly named and demonstrated: "one meeting led to another. One reassigned regiment implied a second." The method shapes her charting work throughout. Setup and development clear. However, it doesn't constrain a choice or force a cost; it's descriptive of her process rather than a pressure point. Lyric reprise (threading connections) is present but the method is swappable with "pattern recognition" or "inference."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is indispensable: its sound-channeling architecture enables her listening, the dome's slit permits light signaling, and "autumn" recurs in the opening and closing images (autumn sky, autumn wind). Setup immediate, middle use (whispers drift down, stairwell pools sound), and closure (wind through the slit, flame dances). The building's unique properties are irreplaceable; no other setting could sustain this exact method. Specificity and causal pressure both high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Before the coup" is the framing condition; the timeline tightens on-page ("four days out"). Setup and development clear, the timeframe shapes urgency (final documentation begins now). However, the four-day window is declared at the end without prior on-page countdown or narrowing choices. The coup's imminence is more thematic backdrop than live pressure that alters her tactics beat by beat. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Listening is Maren's core activity and the story's operational spine. Setup immediate ("listening was everything"), middle (catching fragments, charting connections), and payoff ("she heard everything"). The motivation is dramatized through action and anchored by her mother's erasure. However, no on-page conflict tests the desire—she listens without cost or temptation to intervene. Motivation is consistent but unchallenged.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" recurs as motif (opening: "the building's famous echoed silence"; closing: "in its echoed silence, she heard everything") and modulates with pressure—early described as what most hear, later as the medium through which she hears conspiracies. Tone is coherent and charges the final image. The paradox (silence that carries sound) is sustained and reweighted at closure. Strong lyric integration.</comment>
