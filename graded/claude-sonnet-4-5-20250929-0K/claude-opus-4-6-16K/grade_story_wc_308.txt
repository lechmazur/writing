<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and drives her multi-week stillness practice, with embodied detail ("dust settled on her shoulders"). Internal experience is distinct and filtered through her professional lens as a harmonic stone skimmer. The final choice—letting the pulse pass through rather than capturing it—is earned by weeks of observation and carries visible opportunity cost. Minor gap: the emotional stakes of her renunciation could be more viscerally contradictory in the moment of release.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through layered observation over 43 days, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where she achieves navigation-through-stillness and releases the pulse with visible cost (she does not possess it, only understands). Orientation anchors who/where/what by the second paragraph. The tightening is subtle but legible: her method resolves from fragmented echoes to a spiraling pattern, and the final beat delivers understanding without capture. Cost is conceptual but felt in "let it go"—she forecloses possession to honor the ancient practice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon constrain her method throughout: their acoustic properties shape the wandering pulse, the swifts' nesting sites provide her appraisal tool, and the 43-day timeline is tied to the pulse's orbit through the architecture. Micro-setting (the flat stone where she sits, dust accumulating on her) grounds her stillness practice. The arrowhead as object-setting charges the final image when it "trembled in her open hand." Sensory hierarchy is controlled: sound dominates, but sight (swifts' flight) and touch (vibration) layer purposefully. The setting is indispensable to the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning to navigate without moving, finding the wandering pulse) is signaled in the opening and tested across 43 days. One meaningful deepening occurs: fragmented echoes resolve into a spiraling pattern, narrowing her options to "sit at the right tower at the right moment." Agency is renunciation with visible cost—she releases the pulse rather than capturing it. The price is felt in "some things were not meant to be caught, only understood." The escalation fits the Accumulative lens: density of observation increases until the final vibration arrives and she achieves stillness-based comprehension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (understanding versus possession, stillness as navigation, reverence for the past) emerges organically from the bone towers' function, the swifts' patterns, and her 43-day practice. The final image—"she let it go"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: mastery is release, not capture. Subtext operates in the contrast between "historically reverent people" and her own embodiment of that stance. The arrowhead, swifts, and pulse recur with shifted meaning at closure. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the ending; the emotional cost (letting the pulse continue its ancient orbit) is specific and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-person limited with tight psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices acoustic and architectural detail ("nine echoes," "spiraling orbit"), filters the world through her professional reverence, and her diction ("appraise," "murmuration") fits her expertise. Voice modulates subtly under pressure—sentence rhythm shortens at the climactic vibration. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. The prose reflects her mind: patient, precise, attuned to frequencies. Compression in the final beat ("less than a whisper, more than silence") heightens rather than obscures.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density with purposeful rhythm variation; opening and closing lines anchor and resolve through image. Clarity is strong throughout, though one paraphrase loop appears ("struck and watched. Struck and watched"). Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("pulse left wandering," "compass rose drawn in feathers"). No scaffold, no register drift. Sentence openings vary; paragraph structure breathes with the protagonist's patience. Minor density slip: the phrase "as clearly as if she had walked each one" slightly restates the prior sensory unfolding. Otherwise, zero artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of echolocation via bird-flight patterns, bone-tower acoustics, and centuries-old navigational pulses is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms a familiar quest structure (finding a lost signal) through the constraint of absolute stillness and indirect observation. Emotional truth (reverence, renunciation) avoids template resolution. Risk-taking is present in the 43-day compression and the protagonist's near-invisibility to the swifts, both of which heighten stakes without gimmickry. The ending resists capture-as-victory, committing fully to the thematic stance. A fresh inflection on patience and mastery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The harmonic stone skimmer's choices (walking 11 days, stopping, sitting 43 days, striking the arrowhead, watching swifts, releasing the pulse) drive all major beats and the closure. Early setup, middle development through observation, and payoff in renunciation. Causal pressure is high: her professional identity constrains her to stillness-based navigation. Closure linkage is direct. Irreplaceable: her expertise and the title anchor the logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stone arrowhead is handled in at least three beats: initial description as tuning instrument, repeated striking to map echoes, and trembling in her hand at the pulse's arrival. It returns with reweighted meaning in the final image (open palm, vibration). Causal pressure: without it, she cannot tune to the bone towers or feel the pulse. Closure linkage is strong. Specific mineral property (chipped from canyon walls) matters. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The wandering pulse shapes all tactics: her stillness, her appraisal method via swifts, her 43-day wait, and her final renunciation. Setup is immediate ("pulse left wandering"), middle development shows her tracking its spiraling orbit, and payoff occurs when it passes through her. Causal pressure is maximal: the pulse is the object of her quest and the constraint on her method. Closure turns on her decision to let it continue. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" constrains her on-page actions: she treats the arrowhead "with the reverence it demanded," honors the ancient navigators' practice, and releases the pulse rather than capturing it. Setup in paragraph 4, development through her patient method, payoff in "let it go." One visible cost: she forgoes possession to preserve the pulse's ancient orbit. Specificity is moderate; the trait could be slightly more individuated beyond the cultural label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Appraise" is the method she uses to isolate the pulse: "she had learned to appraise the pulse through the patterns in a flock of birds." Setup in the middle third, development through weeks of striking and watching, payoff when the pattern resolves and she achieves comprehension. The action is irreplaceable: passive listening fails, so she must evaluate bird-flight indirection. Causal pressure: without appraisal, she cannot map the invisible. Closure depends on her final appraisal of the vibration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Bird-flight patterns are the core method: swifts erupt in formations that map frequencies, their turns and clustering reveal acoustic interference, and the final "perfect ring" signals the pulse's arrival. Setup early (paragraph 6), middle development through weeks of observation, payoff in the compass-rose murmuration at day 43. Causal pressure is high: "she could not isolate it by sound alone." Closure depends on the swifts lifting in concert. Irreplaceable: no other method would honor the stillness constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon are indispensable: they hold and reflect the wandering pulse, constrain her to acoustic navigation, and define the 43-day orbit she must decode. Setup immediate, middle pressure through their "acoustic instruments" function, payoff when she feels the canyon "unfold inside her." Micro-setting (flat stone, dust) grounds her stillness. The towers charge the final image: "she opened her eyes to the bone towers and the echoing dust." Environment shapes every tactic and the closure beat. Fully integrated.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Centuries of layered dust" and the ancient pulse establish deep time as thematic backdrop and constraint on the protagonist's reverence. Setup early, middle pressure through "weeks" and "43 days" marking her patient orbit-tracking, payoff when the pulse "passed through her and continued on its ancient way." The timeframe tightens her tactics (she must wait for the orbit to complete) and charges the final release. Cost is visible: 43 days of stillness. One fewer beat of active constraint keeps this below the 7+ threshold.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To learn to navigate without moving" is dramatized immediately (she stops walking on day 11), shapes all middle choices (stillness, appraisal via swifts), and is fulfilled at closure when she "had not moved in weeks, and she knew the shape of everything." Setup in paragraph 2, development through embodied stillness (dust on shoulders, swifts landing on her), payoff in the final comprehension. Causal pressure: the motivation constrains her method and forbids pursuit. Friction between wanting to find the pulse and the cost of absolute stillness is visible. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Weathered resolve" is coherent from opening ("she stopped walking") through the 43-day vigil to the final release. Tone modulates subtly: patient observation in the middle, quiet intensity at the pulse's arrival, and calm closure in "exactly where she needed to be." The tone charges the final image by anchoring her renunciation in earned certainty rather than triumph. No tonal breaks under pressure. The descriptor itself is slightly generic, but execution is strong and the ending gains weight from the sustained steadiness.</comment>
