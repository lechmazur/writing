<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied—"hands trembled as she transcribed," "pressed it against her chest"—but her internal conflict between logic and intuition is more narrated than dramatized in scene. The final beat "She was not cold. She was not unreliable" reads as self-reassurance rather than contradiction acting simultaneously. The micro-choice to use the starling pattern is present but arrives without meaningful resistance or foreclosed alternatives. The transformation itself remains off-page tomorrow, so the cost visible here is anticipatory rather than paid.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered preparation and pattern-recognition rather than causal reversals. Closure is Charged Poise: "two halves of herself align" crystallizes the stakes with visible cost (eleven years, rejection from both worlds) and the orchard "held its breath, waiting." Orientation anchors quickly (orchard, waterfall, Elara kneeling). One meaningful deepening occurs when the starlings reveal the missing variable, reweighting her decade of work. The tomorrow-transformation stakes remain legible but the cost is felt rather than paid on the page, which fits Charged Poise but keeps this just under 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall constrains and charges every beat: "fractured light," "prisms across every surface," "colors travel through the crystal's geometry." The frozen dew crystal functions as micro-setting, its geometry splitting light into unnamed spectra, and the silver dish + flint interaction is tactile and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling among roots, holding vial up, setting it on dish). The waterfall's prismatic spray serves as the medium through which the starlings' pattern becomes legible, directly enabling the final insight. The final image—"waterfall shifted its colors in the fading light"—charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and early: prove alchemy can bridge logic and intuition, with tomorrow's Great Conjunction as the test. The starlings provide one meaningful tightening—they reveal "the final variable," the oscillation frequency—but this arrives as gift rather than earned through Elara's agency under pressure. The consequence of failure (consume everything) is declared but not tested on the page. The dew crystal's preparation demonstrates patience but no visible trade-off or foreclosed path here. Escalation is present via the ticking clock and the eleven-year buildup, but the pivotal turn is observational luck, not protagonist-driven choice with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—bridging reason and wonder—emerges through concrete particulars: the brass scale vs. hedge-witch mysteries, transcribing wingbeats into wavelengths, the dew crystal that "sang." The final image "wonder was not the enemy of reason but its oldest, most faithful companion" states the thesis overtly, a −0.3 penalty in the final paragraph. The starlings' spiral as both motion and equation is a strong non-literal answer. The grandmother's whisper "The waterfall remembers what we forget" seeds the motif effectively. Subtext operates in the gesture of pressing the notebook to her chest. The overt summary line in the penultimate paragraph keeps this from reaching 8.0+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "fractured light," "spectra she had no names for," filtering the world through alchemical and sensory lenses. Psychic distance is stable and purposeful—close during the crystal's transformation, pulling back for the grandmother's memory. "Secretly sentimental, she had kept every failed formula" is clean free indirect thought. Rhythm modulates well: short declaratives at the starling moment, longer syntactic waves during reflection. The phrase "ancient freshness" in the final beat is evocative but borders on oxymoron without grounding. No dialogue to judge. No head-hopping. The prose texture—"wild poetry of things that could not be measured"—is voice-consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high and propulsive: most lines advance setting, character preparation, or stakes. The opening "She had always read the world in two languages" is a strong anchor. Minor template cadence appears in the reflection block: "too willing… too eager" parallel stems, and "She was not cold. She was not unreliable" repeats structure without added pressure (−0.3). "Auburn-haired alchemist" in the penultimate paragraph feels like a tag rather than organic interiority. One paraphrase moment: "transformation requires patience" after showing the controlled heat. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "moss seemed to breathe with color" works, though "ancient freshness" is borderline contradictory. No major loops or scaffolding. Clarity remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—alchemist bridging science and intuition on the eve of a critical experiment—is familiar but executed with specific sensory and procedural detail (Mount Arenne summit, three winters to harvest, starlight conspiring). The starlings-as-equation moment offers a fresh synthesis. The kaleidoscopic waterfall and frozen dew crystal are particular rather than generic. However, the "rejected by both camps" setup and the "two halves align" resolution follow a well-worn arc without a bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus. The emotional truth is present but the transformation is more proclaimed than tested. Specificity in the dew crystal's harvest and the oscillation-frequency insight elevate above template, but the core journey remains recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, makes the choice to transcribe the starling pattern and to melt the dew crystal. Setup is immediate (paragraph one). Development: she observes starlings and acts on the insight (middle). Payoff: "two halves of herself align" in the ending. However, the key turn—recognizing the spiral—is observation rather than a choice under pressure with cost. The final alignment is self-assessment, not a decision that forecloses a path. Two beats (observation, crystal preparation) but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Frozen dew crystal appears early ("last ingredient"), is handled in multiple beats (held up to waterfall, slides onto dish, melts with flame), and its transformation—"sang, a high, thin note"—directly stabilizes the tincture in the exact spiral the starlings drew. Setup, development (transformed on page), and payoff (mixture stabilizes) all present. The crystal's unique lattice properties matter (splits light, harmonizes with waterfall). It could be replaced by another calibration ingredient conceptually, but the three-winter harvest and singing transformation give it specificity. No cost tied directly to using it here, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"The touch of wonder" is named explicitly once as "the moment when knowing and feeling became the same gesture," present during the dew crystal observation. The theme permeates (starlings as equation, fire and frozen dew), but the phrase itself does not constrain a choice or shape tactics. It frames the stakes conceptually and recurs implicitly in the ending ("wonder was not the enemy of reason"). Lyric reprise with thematic resonance but no mid-scene causal pressure. Setup (named early), closure linkage (implicit in final image), but missing middle development as a tactic-altering force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Secretly sentimental" is stated once in a reflective paragraph: "she had kept every failed formula, every scrap of encouragement." The gesture of pressing the notebook to her chest dramatizes it briefly. Setup is mid-story (after the 40% mark). It does not constrain or enable a key on-page action with cost—it colors interiority but does not alter tactics or choices. No payoff at closure. Present and consistent with character but largely ornamental to the main escalation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Flame is used to melt the dew crystal in a focused beat: "struck her flint and held the resulting flame beneath the dish, controlling the heat with the steadiness." This action is necessary to liquefy the crystal and advance the preparation. Setup (flint mentioned), development (flame applied with controlled patience), and payoff (crystal sings and turns dawn-colored, mixture stabilizes). The flame itself could be replaced by any controlled heat source with minor edits. It demonstrates her patience but does not redefine options or stakes. One key turn shaped by it, but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Starlings appear mid-story, their patterned flight reveals "the shape she had been missing, the final variable," and Elara transcribes wingbeats into wavelengths. Setup is implicit (she needs an oscillation frequency), development occurs on-page (observation and transcription), and payoff is immediate (mixture stabilizes in the exact spiral). The method is signaled as the missing piece and its mechanics matter (spiral tightens, loosens, tightens). However, the method arrives as observational gift rather than a tactic Elara pursues; she almost sets the vial down when they arrive. Strong development and payoff, but low setup and agency cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hidden orchard behind the kaleidoscopic waterfall is anchored early and permeates every beat: light filters through it, the waterfall's hum harmonizes with the crystal's note, and the final image returns to it shifting colors. Setup (paragraph two), development (waterfall light enables pattern recognition through starlings), payoff (waterfall in closing line). The setting supplies sensory texture and the prismatic medium but does not constrain a choice with cost—Elara could perform this preparation elsewhere. Micro-setting (pear tree roots, silver dish) is present but does not alter tactics. Strong atmospheric charge, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"The day before the final transformation" is stated early and "Tomorrow, at the solstice zenith" anchors the deadline. The timeframe tightens the urgency conceptually (this is the last chance to calibrate) but does not alter on-page tactics or compress decisions in real time. The scene's pacing is deliberate rather than pressured by the clock. Setup and thematic framing are clear, but the time constraint does not force a visible trade-off or shape the ending. Present and consistent, but the clock does not tick on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The desire to harmonize logic and intuition is stated early ("eleven years trying to harmonize") and dramatized in the starling moment: "Logic and intuition, married at last in a single observation." Friction is shown via rejection by both Academy and hedge-witches. Setup and closure linkage are strong ("two halves of herself align"). However, the on-page conflict is more retrospective summary than live choice under opposing pulls. The final alignment is self-assessment rather than a dramatized trade-off between competing goods. Thematic coherence is high, but the want vs. cost tension is told more than shown in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Ancient freshness" is stated once in the penultimate paragraph: "bathed in ancient freshness, the air tasting of mineral spray and green bark and possibility." The tone—reverent, deliberate, luminous—is coherent throughout and modulates subtly from preparation to anticipation. The waterfall's "ancient" presence and the "ancient bark" recur. However, "ancient freshness" as a specific tonal phrase is introduced late and does not charge earlier beats or return at the final image. The tone supports the ending's poise but the exact phrase does not reweight closure. Lyric coherence is strong, but the named tone lacks early signal and closure reprise.</comment>
