<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maret's interiority is concrete and specific—the fidgeting anchored in chess-tutor muscle memory, the seven-year endurance legible through isolation details. The internal arc from pride-driven failure to "slow and brutal grace of forgiving herself" is dramatized through persistent action (thread-work) rather than declared, and her final choice to guide the prince's hand is motivated by accumulated patience. The epiphany moment ("the tapestry's final lesson was not the counter-sequence at all") risks thesis-statement framing but remains tethered to on-page particulars. Minor: the prince's single line of dialogue feels slightly generic for a character held in stasis for seven years.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a causal payoff. The piece teaches its pattern early (frozen village, years of solitary work) and tightens through Maret's decoding process to a decisive physical act (guiding the hand, board rings, village unfreezes) that lands cleanly on the page with visible cost—seven years of exile and the internal forgiveness earned through patience. The closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the world unfreezes because of protagonist action, and the thematic weight ("forgiving herself for having been proud and human and wrong") is earned through prior causality. One micro-orientation slip: "northern provinces" and "royal court" appear without spatial anchoring, but the chapel/village frame is legible early and the disorientation does not obscure the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen village as micro-setting constrains Maret's every action for seven years and directly pressures the closure: she must decode the tapestry in the chapel to undo the freeze. Sensory details (rain suspended like glass beads, platinum warmth despite stillness, thunder circling but never arriving) are filtered through her chess-tutor precision and isolation. The tapestry's frayed border functions as both setting object and tactical resource; the platinum board and chapel architecture shape the final move. The storm breaking "honest and warm and free" at closure charges the ending image with thematic weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled in paragraph three: undo what her teaching wrought, or remain exiled among the still. Escalation unfolds through seven years of failed attempts (year two reversal mentioned) to the breakthrough realization (border threads encode the counter-sequence), culminating in the platinum knight move that rings the board and unfreezes time. Agency is clear: Maret decodes, approaches, and guides the piece—protagonist action drives the resolution. The cost is visible on the page: seven years of solitary exile and the internal transformation ("forgiving herself") required to find the answer. The price of pride (teaching a reckless prince) is paid through endurance and earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—forgiveness of self, the cost of pride, patience as teacher—emerges through concrete particulars: the seven-year solitude, the fidgeting that atones through movement, the frayed threads that require meticulous attention. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: "neither did you lose" reweights the binary of winning/losing through shared human fallibility without moralizing. The tapestry's "final lesson" risks thesis-statement framing but is anchored in years of on-page failure and the slow decode work. The storm's breaking at closure provides a charged image (constraint lifted, honesty restored) rather than a stated moral. Subtext operates in Maret's hand-stilling—"truly stilled, for the first time in seven years"—and the boy's oblivious "Did I win?"</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV locks cleanly to Maret's perceptual signature: chess-tutor precision ("positioning pieces," "the Seventh Gambit"), sensory filtering through isolation and expertise. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tightest during thread-decoding ("Pull, read, release"), pulling back for the thematic insight at closure. The prince's single line of dialogue ("Did I win?") feels slightly generic but serves the irony. Diction remains consistent to Maret's lexicon (platinum, gambit, labyrinth, notation) with one minor elevation: "woven hush, a silence made textured and deliberate" pushes register slightly but reads voice-motivated for a tutor's precision. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("could almost hear") are minimal and voice-appropriate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively: short declaratives at the freeze ("Time seized. The village froze.") contrast with longer accumulative syntax during reflection. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Minor template-cadence slip in paragraph five: "Pull, read, release. Pull, read, release." is purposeful patterning but borders on mechanical repetition. One stock phrase: "slow and brutal grace" leans slightly purple without harming clarity. The opening anchor ("The village of Asthen had not moved in seven years") and closing storm-break create strong bookends. Proofreading clean; no loops or scaffolding detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Premise—time-frozen village, chess sequence as temporal mechanism—synthesizes familiar fantasy tropes (magical board, exile-until-redemption) through specific chess-tutor particulars and the tapestry-border decode method. The frayed-threads-as-notation twist and the complementary-resolution logic (not reversal) offer a non-obvious angle. Emotional arc (pride → patience → self-forgiveness) feels earned rather than generic. Risk: the magic-chess-board premise leans toward high-fantasy convention, and the "teach the prince a dangerous thing" setup echoes mentor-regret templates; transformation comes through the years-of-solitude specificity and the thread-decode method rather than a novel conceptual core. The ending "neither did you lose" offers a fresh moral inflection but does not radically subvert expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maret as exiled chess tutor is signaled in paragraph three, drives every beat (isolation, fidgeting, thread-decoding, guiding the prince's hand), and her final choice (placing hand over his, moving the knight) is the decisive act that unfreezes time. Her occupation (chess tutor) directly enables the method (reading board notation in threads) and frames her guilt/redemption arc. The exile and tutor identity are indispensable to both causality and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth board is introduced in paragraph three (housed in chapel, played by Edric), returns as the frozen tableau Maret studies for years, and is physically engaged at closure when she guides the knight placement; the board then "rang like a bell," triggering the unfreeze. Appears in setup, middle reflection, and closure action. The platinum specificity matters (warmth despite stillness, auditory ring). Not indispensable—a different magical object could serve—but deeply integrated across beats and charged at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Woven hush" is defined in paragraph six as "a silence made textured and deliberate, the quiet not of absence but of concentrated attention so fierce it consumed all sound." It frames the thread-decoding work tonally and links to the tapestry's woven medium. It shapes Maret's method (patient, meticulous attention) and recurs implicitly in the still village. Present in setup (frozen silence), middle (thread work described as woven hush), and thematically charges the patience required for resolution. The concept constrains tactics (slow decode versus brute reversal) but is primarily atmospheric rather than a hard plot gate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" is introduced in paragraph two, embodied throughout (folding coat, tracing threads, "her fingers never idle"), and resolved at closure when her hands "trembled, then stilled—truly stilled, for the first time in seven years." The trait externalizes guilt and atonement, drives her method (hands working threads), and its cessation marks transformation. Present across setup, middle action, and closure. The fidgeting is character-specific and causally tied to her tutor past; removal would flatten her physicality and the earned-stasis payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Winnow" appears once explicitly ("winnow truth from ornament, separating the essential sequence from the decorative noise") and defines the central problem: distinguish counter-sequence from background threads. The action shapes every middle beat (cataloging frayed filaments, decoding positions) and the breakthrough (platinum thread in lowest corner). The verb choice is precise and irreplaceable—sifting/sorting would dilute the agricultural/textural metaphor that ties to weaving. Present in method description and closure logic; the story hinges on this editorial process.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Decoding frayed threads in the tapestry's border is signaled in paragraph five, taught in paragraph six (pull/read/release rhythm, notation system), drives the climactic beat (final platinum thread decoded), and produces the counter-sequence move. The method is irreplaceable—no other solve path is viable on the page. Mechanics matter: threads as language, decay as code, the lowest corner's platinum strand. Present in setup (years studying the board versus the tapestry), developed through action, and executed at closure. The specificity (frayed border, not the woven image) is essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is the dominant constraint from the opening line, pressures every choice (Maret walks among statues, exiled until she fixes it), and supplies the central problem and its resolution mechanism (chapel, tapestry, board). The freeze is setup, sustained across middle beats (dog's bark, rain beads), and broken at closure when "rain resumed its falling." Spatial choreography is clear (village, chapel, nave, board). The setting is indispensable—removal would erase both stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" opens paragraph five and frames the decode scene; the storm "circled Asthen endlessly but never arrived, trapped in their own kind of frozen approach," then breaks at closure ("the thunder finally broke over Asthen"). The timeframe is more atmospheric container than pressure mechanism—no ticking clock tightens Maret's actions within this particular moment. Present in setup mood, middle frame, and closure release, but does not constrain tactics. The lull allows her to work undisturbed, but the same scene could unfold at dawn or dusk with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maret's need to forgive herself is stated in paragraph three ("exiled… until she undid what her teaching had wrought") and dramatized through seven years of solitary penance, the fidgeting as atonement, and the climactic realization: "the tapestry's final lesson was not the counter-sequence at all. It was the patience required to find it… the slow and brutal grace of forgiving herself for having been proud and human and wrong." The motivation is conflicted (pride versus guilt), drives her method (years of study rather than giving up), and is resolved on the page through action and insight. Visible cost: seven years and the internal transformation required to find the answer.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is not labeled but enacted throughout: the intensity of Maret's thread-work ("concentrated attention so fierce it consumed all sound"), the stillness surrounding violence (frozen mid-leap, mid-bark), and her final hand-stilling after trembling. Tone modulates from stasis-dread (opening beads of rain) to focused calm (decode work) to release (honest rain, warm thunder). The oxymoron of fierce stillness charges the closure image (village resumes, but Maret's hands truly still). Present in setup mood, method description, and ending. Not indispensable—story could hold a different tonal palette—but coherent and purposeful.</comment>
