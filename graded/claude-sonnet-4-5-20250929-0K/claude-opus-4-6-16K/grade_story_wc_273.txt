<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable is strongly characterized through embodied emotion ("holding a scream between her teeth"), concrete action (deliberate ink spilling), and a clear arc from research-driven obsession to risk-taking action. Internal contradiction appears in her "calm fury" and the pull between scientific method and visceral need. The final choice—reaching into the ink—is well-earned by prior causality and carries visible cost (risking her own disappearance). Minor slip: Maren remains largely abstract, a motivating absence rather than a fully embodied relationship that would elevate the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clear Causal lens held throughout: Sable spills ink → patterns form → time thickens → she reaches through → retrieval succeeds. Orientation is anchored early (albino tracker, wind-carved encampment, post-eclipse). The closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: Sable crosses into the temporal anomaly and pulls Maren back, forging a path through "wildness" that answers her three-year obsession. One meaningful tightening (ink patterns accelerate, time slows) narrows options to a single irreversible action. Cost is legible in the final image: two figures where there had been one, ink gone, the gamble paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is vividly rendered and meaningfully constrains Sable's choice: she chose a "consciously wild" landscape that mirrors her internal state and provides the isolation needed for dangerous experiments. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("flames burned sideways in the gusts," "dust motes," "bass note so low it became vibration"). The ink on sandstone becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Minor limitation: no detail from the environment directly alters a tactic or blocks an option during the climax.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve Maren from temporal erasure—is signaled early and drives every beat. Escalation is clear and causal: ink spills → patterns form faster than before → time thickens → Sable places her hand against the ink, risking dissolution. Agency is decisive: Sable's choice to reach through (rather than observe) forecloses safety and forces the gamble. Cost is unmistakable on the page: "her fingers thinning into light, into language" and the lived risk that she could vanish as Maren did. The protagonist's alteration—from passive tracker to active crosser—earns the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the physics of crisis-slowed time, the door opened by disappearing ink, and Sable's refusal to accept erasure. The central question—"why time slows in crisis"—receives a resonant, non-literal answer: the stretched seconds become a bridge that anger and will can traverse. Final image reweights prior material without stating a moral: two women standing where there had been one, the ink entirely gone. Subtext operates through "wildness," "calm fury," and the mirrored landscape. Minor note: the "exploitable physics" framing occasionally tilts toward thesis rather than lived pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close on Sable with controlled psychic distance; no head-hopping. Diction is distinct and purposeful ("ghost of totality's chill," "patient erasure," "serenity" of anger). Perceptual signature is strong: Sable notices with a scientist-tracker's eye (drone recordings, temporal-reactive polymers, "eighty beats per second"). Compression under peak stress is voice-consistent: "The ink climbed her wrist in vanishing script." Minor slip: the phrase "the particular stillness of someone holding a scream between her teeth" is vivid but skirts slight over-articulation for a moment of raw tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, sentence openings are diverse, and information density is high. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is coherent and serves pressure: "time screamed to a halt," "vanishing script," "resin." Clarity is strong throughout. Minor deduction for occasional elevated register that brushes against the POV's scientific lexicon without grounding ("ephemeral alphabet," "consciously wild" as descriptor risks abstraction). The final image is crisp and propulsive. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of disappearing ink, temporal distortion, and crisis-stretched time offers a fresh angle on retrieval-quest premises. Sable's "calm fury" and the wind-carved setting avoid stock tropes. The turn—protagonist as crosser rather than observer—feels earned in hindsight. Specificity in drone construction and squid-melanin polymers grounds the speculative. Minor limitation: the "anger as anchor" motif and the eclipse-as-catalyst lean on familiar SFF scaffolding without full transformation; the emotional core is strong but the conceptual frame is mid-band fresh.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable (albino tracker) is introduced in the opening line and drives every beat: she spills the ink, watches patterns, trains herself into "calm fury," and makes the decisive choice to place her hand against the ink, risking dissolution. Her observation is fused with decision throughout (deliberate spilling, trained breathing, the final reach). Her choices create the central turn. Cost is visible: she risks becoming what took Maren. Early signal, causal pressure across beats, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The artificial hummingbird drone appears in three beats: lifting from Sable's shoulder, hovering to record the ink, and its wings slowing as time thickens. It is built from "salvaged surveillance parts" and described as "the closest thing she had to a colleague." It enables the scientific method (recording patterns) and later provides the footage proof of success. Its causal role is functional but the object does not constrain a key choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure; it remains instrumental rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Disappearing ink is the core mechanism: Sable synthesized it from "squid melanin and temporal-reactive polymers," spills it deliberately to test the eclipse effect, and the patterns it forms are the door through which Maren vanished and Sable retrieves her. The concept shapes stakes (temporal erasure), tactics (timing the spill to eclipse), and the entire plot arc. It is irreplaceable: no other substance could generate "ephemeral patterns" tied to time distortion. Early signal, beat involvement across all major turns, closure participation, and high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" describes both the encampment ("a landscape that refused domestication") and Sable's internal state ("the thing inside her she could not name but would not quiet"). The trait motivates her choice of location and her final gamble: "let the wildness in her answer the wildness in the world." It appears in the opening third and returns at closure as an enabling force. However, it remains partly abstract; a clearer on-page cost or constraint tied specifically to "wildness" would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Disappearing (vanishing into temporal patterns) is the story's pivot: Maren disappeared through the ink during the last eclipse, Sable seeks to reverse it, and the climax hinges on Sable's own partial disappearance ("her fingers thinning into light") to effect retrieval. The action redefines options: from passive research to active crossing. Early signal (Maren's vanishing recounted), middle pressure (Sable observes the forming door), and closure participation (Sable's arrival/retrieval) all hinge on this exact action. Irreplaceable and charged with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method—"through ephemeral patterns in spilled ink"—is signaled early (Maren's disappearance), demonstrated in the present action (Sable spills the compound, patterns form "like living calligraphy"), and shapes the climax (Sable places her hand against the ink, patterns dissolve). Mechanics matter: the ink must be timed to eclipse, the patterns must align into "spiral, door, absence," and contact triggers temporal crossing. The method is not merely decorative; it constrains attempts and alters tactics across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is introduced early, vividly detailed ("canyon walls scooped into alcoves," "cookfire pit hollowed so deep"), and chosen deliberately by Sable because it is "consciously wild" and matches her internal state. It provides isolation for dangerous experiments and mirrors the thematic wildness. The setting does not, however, directly constrain a choice or block an option during the climax; its role is atmospheric and motivational rather than tactical. Strong setup and thematic fit, but closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after the eclipse ends"—is anchored in the opening line and structures the entire action: the eclipse creates the temporal conditions for ink-pattern formation, and Sable has timed her experiment to this window. The ending notes "the eclipse's shadow already a memory retreating," marking the closure of opportunity. Time does not tick as a visible countdown during the climax, but the eclipse's role in enabling the attempt is clear and causal. Moderate tightening effect rather than a live clock that alters moment-to-moment moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation—"to discover why time slows in crisis"—is explicitly stated and drives Sable's three-year research, her choice of this location, and her decision to spill the ink during the eclipse. It is dramatized through concrete action (synthesis, observation, drone recording) and conflicted with risk (she could vanish as Maren did). The final gamble ("let the stretched seconds become a bridge") directly enacts the motivation. Friction between scientific method and visceral need is present. Strong causal role and closure linkage; not merely told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The tone—"serene anger"—is coherent and embodied throughout: Sable's "calm fury," "particular stillness of someone holding a scream between her teeth," "anger [as] the anchor," and "terrible patience" all instantiate the paradox. The tone modulates under pressure: calm observation → rising pulse deliberately slowed → time screaming to a halt → decisive reach. The final image retains the serenity (two women standing, ink gone) charged by the prior anger. The tone supports the closure without stating itself. Strong fit and control.</comment>
