<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and her method distinctive, but her interior life remains largely static—she observes and interprets with professional competence but shows minimal internal conflict or contradictory impulses. The ghost whisperer premise is delivered through exposition rather than embodied choice under pressure. The final smile and relief are asserted rather than earned through a visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path. Backstory dominates without altering present tactics or testing her values on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is solid: who (Maren), where (glacier shrine), and what (ghost-whisperer investigating Ailani's death) anchor by the first two paragraphs. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode—evidence gathering and pattern recognition—but lacks a meaningful turn or deepening; Maren arrives with the solution already assembled and simply seals the case. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (relief, window open) but the cost is implied rather than legible on the page: no visible sacrifice, no foreclosed path, no tactical price paid. The candle flicker is atmosphere, not a reweighting of stakes or knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is vivid and purposeful: "walls of ancient glacier ice catching the candle flames," borrowed starlight through ice, the tactile cold against Maren's skin. The melted snow globe is handled twice (examined, then sealed), and the ice setting charges the final image. Sensory detail is well-filtered through Maren's professional focus, though spatial choreography of the seventeen candles and transcribed pages could be tighter. The environment constrains action (cold, isolation) and participates in closure (candles flicker, walls carry her voice upward).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing the truth behind the Karelian Star sinking—is signaled early, but Maren faces no opposition or complication on the page. She arrives at the shrine with the puzzle already solved; no reversal or tightening narrows her options. The resolution (sealing evidence, speaking Ailani's name) involves no visible cost, no trade-off, no foreclosed path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or pressure point is required; here the intensity is static from opening to close.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: voices silenced, truth returned to the air, windows between living and dead. The recurring window motif (palms on glass, knocking, pressing from inside) accumulates well and charges the final "window between them" moment without overstatement. However, "to salvage something pure from the wreckage" becomes slightly thematic echo in Maren's reflection, and the ending's relief feels tidy rather than resonant with ambiguity. The conceptual repricing of the snow globe (artifact → evidence → communion vessel) is effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable single-focalization, third-limited on Maren. Voice is controlled and atmospheric: "borrowed starlight," "pale constellations," "ghost whisperer, though she hated the term" gives texture. Psychic distance is consistent. One minor slip: "She was a ghost whisperer, though she hated the term" tells Maren's stance rather than showing it through her actions or word choice. Diction stays apt (glaciologist, cargo manifest, waterproof case) without drift. No dialogue, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and vivid with strong sensory specificity ("jellyfish pulled from the sea," "frosted pane," "trembling warmth"). Rhythm varies well. Two issues: paraphrase loop in paragraph 3 ("far more deliberate" / "threading together fragments") restates her method without added pressure. Template cadence in dream catalog ("In a fisherman's dream… In a child's dream… In an elderly poet's dream") reads list-like rather than accumulative. Information density is high in the investigation paragraphs but slackens in the reflection-heavy middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core synthesis—wreck diver as ghost whisperer who reads dream cameos to solve a cover-up—is fresh and specific. The glacier shrine, melted snow globe, and dream-journal triangulation feel particular to this story. However, the "corporate cover-up of a whistleblower's death" frame is familiar, and Maren's method (analyze patterns, expose truth, deliver evidence) follows a conventional investigator arc without complication or subversion. The emotional truth (relief, communion) is understated but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her professional method (ghost whispering via dream analysis) shapes the investigation. She makes one on-page choice: sealing the evidence and speaking Ailani's name. However, this decision is not a key turn—it's the inevitable conclusion of off-page detective work. She observes and interprets but does not alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears in three beats: examined in detail (warped glass, fused figure), turned in candlelight with Ailani's face superimposed, and sealed in the waterproof case. It is linked to Ailani's identity and the ship's secret cargo. Its warped glass mirrors the window motif and charges the closure moment. Removing it would weaken the artifact-to-evidence arc, though the investigation could pivot to another personal object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Windows of connection structure the investigation: every dream features Ailani at a window (pressing palms, knocking, mouthing words). The final line—"The window between them, for one trembling moment, was open"—reprises the motif. However, windows function thematically rather than constraining Maren's tactics or altering her options. The concept is taught early and returned at closure, earning lyric-resonance credit but lacking causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is mentioned once ("she wove truth carefully, threading together fragments") and described through the dream-journal method. It does not constrain an on-page action or impose a visible cost. The trait is told as professional competence rather than dramatized through a choice where care versus speed, or truth versus expedience, creates friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Exposure is the story's goal and its resolution: Maren will "deliver everything to the families, to the press." The undeclared samples and corporate sponsor discrepancy are exposed via Maren's off-page research. However, the act of exposure occurs in summary (tomorrow she will surface) rather than on the page. The shrine ritual (speaking Ailani's name) functions as communion, not exposure. Swappable with "reveal" or "testify" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The method is signaled early and in detail: Maren collects dream journals from strangers who report Ailani's cameo appearances, triangulates intention from where and how she appears. The mechanics shape the investigation's structure (dream catalog, cross-referencing cargo manifest). However, the method is presented retrospectively—Maren arrives with the work complete—so it does not constrain live attempts or alter tactics under pressure. It drives two beats (dream analysis, discrepancy discovery) and participates in closure (the window between them).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is present throughout: ancient ice walls, seventeen candles, borrowed starlight, cold against Maren's skin, transcribed pages weighted with stones. It supplies atmosphere and isolation (no opposition can interrupt). The ice reflects candle flames and dream-page images, and the walls "carry [Ailani's name] upward" at closure. The setting charges the final moment and constrains Maren's ritual action (she must dive, surface tomorrow). Removing the shrine and relocating to a generic room would flatten the tone and weaken the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To salvage something pure from the wreckage" is stated explicitly as Maren's goal and appears in two beats: "that was always the goal" and the final ritual (sealing evidence, speaking the name). The motivation drives her career choice (diving wrecks for remnants) and the current investigation. However, it is delivered through exposition rather than tested by friction—no competing desire, no cost that challenges purity versus pragmatism. The trait shapes her stance but does not create on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" anchors the shrine's visual texture throughout: reflected through ice, mingled with candle warmth, washing over Maren at closure. The tone is elegiac and contemplative, modulating appropriately with the investigation's discovery (dread at corporate cover-up) and the final communion (relief, the candle flicker). The phrase recurs purposefully and charges the ending image ("carry it upward… toward the stars"). Coherent and resonant without static monotony.</comment>
