<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's characterization carries voice-specific interiority ("fingers stained with oil and sap") and her shift from tinkerer to singer is dramatized across clear beats: trying mechanical fixes, finding the journal, singing tentatively, then with conviction. The grandmother's deathbed warning provides motivation, though the interiority occasionally edges toward explanatory ("she realized") rather than lived contradiction. Internal conflict between making and singing is present but could show more simultaneous tension in peak moments rather than sequential resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the arbor bears fruit after Elara sings the gathering song under the harvest moon, with visible cost (she must return each dawn, sustaining the covenant). Orientation anchors early (arbor at dawn, eastern gate, dying vines). The causal chain holds: mechanical failure → journal discovery → tentative song → vine response → full harvest, with one meaningful tightening when the tendril uncurls. The lens reads Causal with Accumulative texture (song as remedy), coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arbor is vividly anchored (copper trellis, mother vine, eastern gate) and the vine tendril becomes a micro-setting element that constrains Elara's choice—its pale, curled state signals the problem, its trembling response validates the remedy. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered ("rough and uncertain," "intervals that felt wrong to modern ears"). The arbor's physical state drives the inciting need and charges the closure image when fruit appears, satisfying the 9+ gate test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: restore the arbor before the harvest moon (three nights away). One meaningful tightening occurs when mechanical solutions fail and Elara must overcome her identity as "a maker of things, not a singer of songs" to try the old songs. The cost is legible—she must sing each dawn, embodying the covenant her ancestors held. Agency is decision-based (choosing to sing despite feeling absurd), and the price shapes the final image. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the covenant between land and people, technologies older than metal, the necessity of remembering encoded practices. The final image (Elara singing under the harvest moon, villagers humming fragments) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The journal and song function as thematic anchors that reweight prior material. One minor slip: "some technologies are older than metal and more precise than any clock" edges toward thesis statement, though it's positioned as storytelling rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature is consistent (tinkerer's lens: "clockwork," "synthesized mineral compounds," "frequencies"). Diction modulates appropriately from technical to lyric as she shifts from wrench to song. One register slip: "Elara spins golden stories" appears twice identically, reading more like prompt echo than organic voice. Psychic distance is controlled, and the final paragraph's shift to broader view (villagers, children) feels intentional rather than head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Two paraphrase loops: "spins golden stories" appears verbatim twice; "the arbor holds its breath" bookends without reweighting. Template cadence in the climax paragraph: "She sang louder. The melody was strange... As her voice steadied, the arbor seemed..." uses similar stems in close sequence. Figurative language is mostly controlled, though "golden stories" risks stock metaphor. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap limits deduction to −0.8 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of tinkerer identity with ancestral song practices offers a fresh angle on heritage-restoration narratives, and the frequencies-as-engineering detail is specific. However, the core arc (practical protagonist learns to honor old ways through journal discovery) follows a recognizable template. The emotional specificity (feeling "absurd," intervals "wrong to modern ears but right to something deeper") elevates execution. Transformation is present but not radical; the story would function with different names/settings, suggesting mid-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive all key turns: attempting mechanical fixes (first third), finding the journal (midpoint), choosing to sing despite feeling absurd (climax), and committing to return each dawn (closure). The "whimsical tinkerer" trait shapes her initial failure (wrong tool for the job) and her final synthesis (tinkering with sound). Present in setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The vine tendril appears in three distinct beats: Elara lifts it pale and curling (setup, ~10% in), it trembles when she sings (turn, midpoint), and it uncurls in her palm as the first fruit appears (closure image). Its physical state constrains diagnosis and validates remedy. Specific, irreplaceable, and causally active across the arc with closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The harvest moon sets the deadline ("three nights away") and anchors the closure scene ("under the harvest moon, the arbor was heavy with fruit"). It shapes temporal stakes but does not alter tactics mid-scene. Present in setup (timeframe established early), absent in middle development (journal discovery is not moon-driven), returns at payoff. Two-gate presence with moderate causal pressure but no middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Spins golden stories" is mentioned twice identically but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost until the final paragraph, where it subtly reframes her evening storytelling as covenant-teaching. Setup present (early mention), middle development weak (attribute does not enable or block the singing attempt), payoff present (stories "are different. Now they are true"). Lyric reprise without mid-scene pressure, placing it in the 5.5–6.3 range per the allowance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The remedy—singing the forgotten songs—is the story's central action, dramatized across the climax and closure. Elara tries it tentatively, the vines respond, she commits, and fruit appears. Present in setup (grandmother's warning, journal discovery foreshadow it), drives the turn (singing makes the tendril tremble), and resolves at closure. Removing it would break the plot. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The forgotten songs are seeded early (grandmother's warning about "a voice, not a wrench"), discovered in the journal (middle beat), and their mechanics matter on the page: notation, old tongue, intervals "that felt wrong to modern ears." The method constrains Elara's first attempt (she hums "tentatively," voice "rough and uncertain") and validates the remedy when the vine trembles. Present in setup, development, and payoff with causal necessity and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The verdant arbor at dawn is anchored immediately (opening line) and its physical state—dying vines, copper trellis, mother plant—supplies the problem and resources. The setting pressures Elara's choices (mechanical fixes fail because the vines "were waiting for something older") and charges the closure image (arbor "heavy with fruit" under the harvest moon). Dawn recurs as the frame for her daily covenant. Setup, development, and payoff with moderate causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"When everything aligns" appears as the timeframe concept: the harvest moon deadline (three nights away) creates urgency, and the final scene occurs "under the harvest moon." The alignment of "moon and voice and intention" is stated but not tested as a tactical constraint—Elara does not fail on an earlier night and succeed only when all elements converge. Present in setup and payoff, weak in middle development. Two-gate presence with thematic resonance but limited tactical tightening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to restore sacred practices is dramatized through Elara's mechanical attempts (rejecting the old way), her reluctant discovery of the journal, and her choice to sing despite feeling "absurd." Internal friction is present: "a woman of gears and solder singing to plants in a dead language." The grandmother's deathbed warning primes it early, and the closure shows Elara teaching the children about the covenant. Setup, development, and payoff with moderate friction and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Gathering hush" as tone is established in the opening line ("The verdant arbor at dawn held its breath") and modulates coherently: stillness when Elara arrives, tentative uncertainty as she begins to sing, crescendo as her voice strengthens, and communal resonance at the harvest ("Some of the older ones wept"). The final line returns to the breath-holding motif, charging the image. Coherent across beats with purposeful modulation; one gate shy of essential (could be replaced with another tone without breaking logic).</comment>
