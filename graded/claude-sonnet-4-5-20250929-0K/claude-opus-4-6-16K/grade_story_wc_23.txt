<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is vivid and particular—"None of it made her qualified for anything official. All of it made her qualified for this"—and her actions (building the receiver, using the censer foot as tool and talisman) embody contradictory impulses to hold and release. The patchwork credentials and the nightly ritual demonstrate agency under pressure. Minor slip: the final turn toward "raw solace" feels slightly declared rather than fully earned through on-page choice, though the listening itself is a credible stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren commits to perpetual listening with visible cost—acceptance that "the signal was not a rescue"—and the final image of her turning "slowly, toward something she could almost name" reweights the opening stasis. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, held cleanly: the pattern of calls/coordinates/signal builds density until the moon-full night crystallizes her stance. One minor orientation note: the phrase "reverse migration" and the caller's voice arrive without concrete anchoring in Maren's prior experience, creating brief ambiguity, but the effect pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The signal station is rendered through purposeful detail—frozen dishes, gantry, "stars pressed down like a weight"—and the censer foot functions as micro-setting, constraining multiple choices (paperweight, plumb bob, sternum anchor). The northern Manitoba isolation and the hydraulic failure frame the entire pressure system. Sensory hierarchy is excellent: Maren's technical focus (frequency charts, receiver housing) and emotional filter (bronze cold traveling "up her arms into her chest") never blur.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding Lila's trace) is signaled early and tightens through the coordinate calls, the dish repair, and the midnight Listen command. The escalation is Accumulative: each night of soldering narrows her world until the full-moon signal offers not rescue but "proof that the distance...was not empty." Agency is renunciation with visible cost—she accepts perpetual searching over closure. One brief note: the caller's mechanics (who, why) remain opaque, but under the Situational/Accumulative lens this complicates rather than resolves, which is permissible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the censer foot's weight as proxy for holding her child, the dishes' "ghost motion," the signal as "the geography of loss itself." The final image—Maren turning toward "something she could almost name"—reweights the opening hydraulic failure without stating a moral. "Raw solace" is embodied rather than declared, and the piece resists tidy resolution (she will chase the signal "tomorrow night, and the night after") while offering resonance. No thematic echo or late moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "patchwork navigator" as self-descriptor, the technical precision ("patina bronze," "plumb bob") layered with grief's idiom ("the ache travel up her arms into her chest where it belonged"). POV remains stable third-limited; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during soldering, wider for the sky's "savage" stars). The prose reflects Maren's mind under pressure—compressed, technical, elegiac—and no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping appear. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences do double work (the censer foot as tool/talisman, the coordinates folding back on themselves). Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives ("The hydraulics had failed") against longer accumulative sentences. Minor friction: "a patina bronze censer foot she'd found in her daughter's apartment—the only object left behind when Lila vanished" is efficient setup, but "patina bronze" recurs as "the bronze" and "cold bronze" in later beats, creating slight synonym churn. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality; opening and closing lines anchor cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Reverse migration" as disappearance phenomenon and the moon-phase signal offer a fresh synthesis of grief-work and radio astronomy. The patchwork credentials and decommissioned station feel specific rather than generic. Risk-taking in the unresolved caller and the signal's nature (not Lila's voice but her "presence, encoded") heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight friction: the "geometry of loss" and "invisible meridian" language edges toward abstraction, though grounded enough in Maren's technical frame to avoid full derivative drift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (patchwork navigator) drives every beat: her decision to come to the station, her nightly building and soldering, her choice to listen at midnight and climb the gantry. The final turn—accepting perpetual search over rescue—is hers alone. Present in setup (first paragraph), shapes middle action (repair work), and anchors closure (listening stance). Specific skills (amateur radio, astrophysics, maritime charts) matter on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The censer foot appears in at least four distinct beats: keeping it on the console, using it as paperweight against wind, as plumb bob for leveling, and pressing it against her sternum at closure. Its weight and cold embody her connection to Lila and charge the final image. Introduced early (first third), returns with evolving use, and is causally active at the ending. Irreplaceable: no generic object could carry the same biographical and tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reverse migration" frames the mystery (people walking away "followed some invisible meridian south, then east, then into silence") and the coordinate pattern that leads Maren to the station. It shapes her tactics (plotting the line, aiming the dish) and reweights at closure when the signal maps "the geography of loss itself—every parent who had searched, every child who had walked away." Present by midpoint, drives choice, participates in closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The signal "fluctuates...with the moon" and "Tonight the moon was full, and the signal was strong" directly enables the climactic listening beat. Maren's understanding that the pattern "rose and fell like breathing" with lunar phases constrains her ongoing search (she will chase it "tomorrow night"). Introduced late (final third) but transforms prior material (the nightly work) and articulates the cost (perpetual cycle). Cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Build" is the story's spine: Maren came "to build a receiver from salvage," spends weeks soldering and splicing, frees one dish, levels the housing, and finishes on the night of the call. The act of building is dramatized across multiple beats and the completion enables the closure beat (powering the receiver, hearing the signal). Her identity as builder ("build the instrument patient enough to hear it") defines her agency. Swapping "build" for "repair" would alter the thematic charge (creation vs. restoration).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cryptic midnight calls provide the coordinate pattern that guides Maren to the station and frame the escalation ("The calls had started four months ago"). The final call delivers the new word "Listen" that triggers the climactic beat. Mechanics matter: "unlisted numbers," "burst of static," voice reading coordinates. Present in setup (backstory anchor) and active at closure. Slight swappability: another mysterious message method could serve, but the phone-call ritual fits the remote-station isolation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The signal station's remoteness ("so remote that the stars pressed down like a weight"), frozen dishes, gantry, and receiver housing all constrain Maren's tactics and charge the final image. The decommissioned array's "ghost motion" mirrors her search for Lila's trace. The station is why the coordinate line ends here ("you are already where you need to be"). Environment is causally active: she climbs the gantry, powers the dish, uses wind and elevation. Irreplaceable setting for this exact closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the hydraulics fail" opens the story and marks the threshold (dishes freeze, ghost motion gone). The timeframe creates urgency: Maren arrived "three weeks after the decommission notice," worked "night after night," and the midnight call on "the night she finished" triggers closure. The full moon tightens the window. Time is tracked and pressures choices, though not a second-by-second clock. Solid causal role; lyric reprise (hydraulics failed / "nothing turned anymore except Maren herself").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Navigate the geography of loss" is dramatized through Maren's concrete actions (building the receiver, plotting coordinates, listening for Lila's trace) and conflicted in her acceptance that "the signal was not a rescue." Her desire to hold Lila (via the censer foot) conflicts with the open-ended search. Friction between hope and perpetual deferral is embodied on the page. The phrase itself is used once at closure but grows from prior beats; the motivation shapes every choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Raw solace" is embodied throughout: the cold bronze anchor, the "knowing" that distance holds texture, the acceptance of perpetual listening. Tone modulates with pressure—technical focus during repair work, elegiac expansion under the stars—and charges the final image ("sat in the raw solace of that knowing"). Coherent across turns, never static. The exact phrase appears late but the tonal texture is consistent and purposeful from opening to close.</comment>
