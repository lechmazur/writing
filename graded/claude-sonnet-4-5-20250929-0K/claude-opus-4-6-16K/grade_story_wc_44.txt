<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's character is well-grounded through her observational traits and deliberate actions. Her motivation to solve the shadow-disappearance mystery drives her choices, and the final decision to close the loop reflects earned agency under pressure. Internal contradiction is present in the tension between scholarly caution and decisive risk-taking. Minor deduction: the interiority occasionally leans toward summary ("She understood then") rather than fully embodied perception during the key revelation beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly through a Decisive Change (waking the automaton) with visible cost signaled by the shadow's return—the price of intervention versus letting the thing wake on its own terms is legible on the page. The causal lens holds: spoons bend → runes scramble → key discovery → loop-closing → automaton wakes. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren realizes the key is not for a door but for the thing below. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. No cap-triggering issues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting pressures the plot: the orrery jams with the key, the refractor tracks stellar runes, and the floating isle's position above the Ashenmere makes the submerged shape visible at the closure beat. Micro-setting elements (desk, lamplight, copper dome) anchor action without postcard padding. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Maren's scholarly focus. The final spatial image—shadow stretching across the observatory floor—charges the ending and meets the 9+ gate requirement for constraint participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: stop the thing in the Ashenmere from waking on its own terms by solving the shadow-disappearance mystery. Escalation tightens through causal steps: discovery of the key, recognition of sealed awakenings, plotting shadow-patterns, and the final binary choice (close the loop or break the key). Agency is unambiguous—Maren's choice to close the loop drives the resolution. Cost is legible: she intervenes despite uncertainty, and the automaton wakes under her terms rather than its own. One meaningful pressure point (the climax choice) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tension between control (sealed awakenings, deliberate scholarship) and inevitability (reality bending, the thing feeding). The loop-rune motif recurs with escalating meaning: historical curiosity → active tool → closure mechanism. Maren's final act offers a resonant answer to the implicit question—whether to impose order or let chaos unfold—without moralizing. The shadow's return as the final image reweights prior material (dimensional weight, the seam in the world) with conceptual clarity. No thematic echo or sermon mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>POV is stable and tightly controlled; Maren's perceptual signature (noticing, quiet deliberation, scholarly precision) colors every observation. Diction remains consistently character-specific: "burning alphabets of old gods," "some place worse than scratch." Free indirect style is clean throughout. Rhythm modulates purposefully—longer, detailed sentences during scholarly work compress to shorter beats at the climax ("She chose"). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure moments. Voice remains distinct and purposeful under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with strong information density and purposeful rhythm. Opening and closing images anchor effectively ("spoons had bent" / "shadow return, stretching long and certain"). Minor scaffold present: "She was quietly deliberate" repeats the phrase verbatim from earlier description, and "The loop closed. Light poured upward" could be compressed. One paraphrase loop: the "sealed awakening" concept is restated across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Figurative language is controlled and avoids muddle. Syntax varies appropriately. Deductions kept modest as artifacts do not touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of clockwork automaton, rune scholarship, dimensional shadows, and recursive loop-grammar feels coherent and specific to this world. The premise (sealed awakening as a thing rather than a spell) offers a fresh angle on familiar fantasy-scholar tropes. Transformation test passed: swapping names/setting would strip much of the resonance. Risk-taking in the recursive-loop mechanics and the ambiguous final choice (waking the automaton may not be safer) elevates the piece. Minor cap: the "shadows vanish at noon" mystery and the floating observatory, while well-executed, echo established fantasy motifs without radical transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as budding rune scholar shapes every key turn: her cataloging work reveals the scramble, her knowledge of sealed awakenings decodes the key, and her decision to close the loop drives the climax. Her scholarly precision ("tweezers," "journal," star-chart plotting) appears in at least three distinct beats and is causally active at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost is tied to her choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The clockwork automaton key appears in discovery (orrery jam), analysis (tracing engravings through the night), and climax (pressed against the final rune). Its engraved loop-runes are causally essential—without them, Maren cannot solve the pattern or close the loop. Specificity high: "brass and bone," spiral engravings, vibration at the threshold. Closure linkage strong. Irreplaceable. Setup, development, payoff all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sealed awakenings shape the core stakes and tactics: Maren's realization that "no one remembers how to close the loops" frames the challenge, her relearning work structures the middle escalation, and the concept's redefinition (the key wakes a thing, not a spell) reconfigures the ending. It constrains her options (only closing the loop will stop the automaton from waking on its own terms). Setup early, development through scholarship, payoff at climax. Causal pressure strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" is demonstrated on the page through her method of extracting the key with tweezers, copying glyphs carefully, and working through the night "until her fingers ached." It constrains her approach (no impulsive action) and enables her success (precision matters for loop-closing). Visible in at least two beats. Setup present; development and payoff less distinct—the trait does not visibly alter a late-stage tactic or cost. Mid-band: functional causal role but not indispensable to closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Relearning is the hinge: Maren must relearn scrambled rune sequences, then relearn the loop-runes by tracing the key's engravings. This action drives the middle escalation and enables the climax (she cannot close the loop without mastering the grammar). Setup early (runes scrambled), development across the night-work beat, payoff implicit in her ability to close the final loop. Causal and irreplaceable. Minor cap: the relearning itself is summarized in one paragraph rather than dramatized across multiple distinct beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Closing loops" is signaled early (sealed awakenings lock power in recursive patterns), structures the middle work (tracing loops until each hums), and is the literal mechanism of climax ("The loop closed"). Method shapes tactics: she must arrange twelve loops in the correct sequence. Setup, development, payoff all present. Causal pressure solid. Minor deduction: the exact mechanics of loop-closing are gestured at ("each loop she closed on paper produced a faint hum") rather than shown in granular, embodied detail.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on the floating isle supplies multiple resources: the orrery where the key is found, the window view of the Ashenmere below (enabling discovery of the shape), and the copper dome that rattles at the climax. Spatial positioning (above the water, rotating with the stars) is causally relevant. Micro-setting elements (desk, lamplight) anchor action. Setup early, development through star-chart work, payoff in the final view of the shadow. Constraint: floating above the Ashenmere makes the thing visible. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after spoons bend reality" anchors the inciting incident and tracks progression: three days ago the spoons bent, on the fourth night Maren finds the key, she works "through the night" until dawn, then makes her choice "for the first time in four days." Time progression is legible and sequential. Setup present, development tracked across beats. Payoff modest: the four-day marker at the end signals closure but does not tighten a tactical window or impose a live deadline that alters her final choice. Mid-band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren's desire to find where shadows go at noon is dramatized on the page: she plots shadow-disappearance patterns on star charts, works through the night relearning loop-runes to answer the question, and the ending directly resolves it ("for the first time in four days, Maren saw her shadow return"). Motivation is causally active in at least three beats and shapes the climax choice. Setup early ("where do shadows go?"), development through scholarship, payoff via the shadow's return. Cost present: she must risk waking the automaton to reclaim the shadows.</comment>

**Drive Lens Inference:** Causal. The piece progresses through because/therefore linkage: spoons bend → runes scramble → key discovery → loop-pattern work → closure choice wakes the automaton and returns the shadow.

**Closure Unit:** Decisive Change with visible cost. Maren closes the loop, the automaton wakes, and her shadow returns—implying she has imposed control rather than letting the thing wake on its own terms. The cost is legible in the act of intervention and the uncertain consequence (light pouring upward).

**High-Band Entry Gates (Q2 ≥8.8, Q4 ≥8.2, Q7 ≥8.2):** Not all met (Q2=8.4, Q7=8.0). High-band categories capped at 8.7 per the rubric. Applied to Q3 and Q6, which otherwise might exceed 8.7.

**Cross-Category 9+ Standard:** Not satisfied. While closure lands with cost and the lens holds, fewer than two elevating features are undeniable on the page (environment/constraint participation is strong in Q3; diction/rhythm control and recurring-object recharge are present but not exceptional). No category awarded ≥9.0.
