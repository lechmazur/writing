<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is sharply particular—the chanting as sonar, sulfur-stained hands, defiance as fuel—and her motivation to manufacture light against hopelessness drives observable choices (cleaning moss, copying the formula, resuming the chant). The embodied emotion is strong: "serious delight," filtering fragrance to avoid drowning, pressing the kerosene knot against stone. Minor slip: the final paragraph's articulation of her work philosophy ("not to wait for light, but to manufacture it") tilts slightly toward explicit self-awareness rather than remaining implicit through action, though it stops short of diagnostic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren departs the fortress with the formula on her arm, chanting the new ratios, carrying "her own" stars into a night that now feels like "a canvas waiting" rather than oppressive. The cost is visible—she anticipates "small fires in inappropriate locations," adjusting "three times, maybe seven," a patient willingness to fail—and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds: the mosaic discovery deepens her existing defiance into a concrete next act. One quibble: the starless night as constraint is more atmospheric than mechanical; the formula's discovery feels inevitable rather than wrested from genuine risk of failure, slightly softening the earned quality of the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The fortress blooming with wisteria and jasmine at dusk is vivid and purposeful, filtering through Maren's need to find "the mineral tang of old glaze" beneath organic sweetness. The mosaic wall—moss-covered tiles revealed by scrubbing—becomes a micro-setting that constrains her search and charges the final image when its ratios weave into her chant. Sensory detail (petals stuck to hands, kerosene smell, sulfur) is selective and POV-filtered. The starless night closes the visual sky, making the metaphorical "darkness answer" more resonant at the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding and decoding the mosaic formula to create unnamed colors—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation reads under the Accumulative lens as a meaningful deepening: discovery of the mosaic shifts her from rumor-chasing to possessing a concrete, actionable recipe that will require experimentation and failure. The choice to copy it onto her forearm and resume her journey is agency-driven with visible cost (the anticipated failures, "small fires in inappropriate locations"). Slight limitation: the discovery itself faces no genuine obstacle or reversal; she arrives, searches, finds, which flattens the pressure curve slightly even as the thematic charge accumulates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: defiance as manufacturing light, spectacle as labor against hopelessness, the dead pyrotechnician's secret as inheritance and burden. The kerosene knot's traded wisdom—"fire is a conversation, not a command"—and the mosaic as "recipe written for people who thought in light" avoid abstraction. The final image ("carried her own" stars) answers the central question without moralizing, reweighting prior material (the starless night, the chant, the formula) into a stance of stubborn creation. No thematic echo or sermonic intrusion; the work's purpose is shown, not stated, until the controlled summation in the penultimate paragraph which stays grounded in concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is sharply distinctive: "sulfur and wonder," "defiance worked better," "serious delight," "flesh as notebook." Perceptual signature is consistent—Maren filters sensation carefully, uses the chant as sonar, notices geometric interruption among bloom. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains voice-motivated even when elevated ("petals drifting down like soft ammunition," "the held breath before ignition"), fitting a character who thinks in combustion chemistry and poetic ratios. The prose modulates effectively under pressure (scrubbing, laughing, chanting) without slipping into generic registers. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or loops. Information density is high—nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or the search. The mosaic description ("ratios expressed in colored relationships") is concise and vivid. Minor friction: "petals drifting down like soft ammunition against anyone who dared feel nothing" in the opening and "the hush wasn't emptiness—it was the held breath before ignition" late in the piece edge toward Purple; the metaphoric vehicles (ammunition, held breath) are coherent but slightly elevated for a character mid-task. No filter-verb stacks or paraphrase loops. Propulsion is strong; the prose breathes with the action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—wandering pyrotechnician decoding a centuries-old mosaic formula—synthesizes familiar quest elements through specific, grounded choices: chanting as rhythm and sonar, the kerosene knot as talisman and tool, the formula written in color relationships rather than text. The transformation test passes: swap names and places and the emotional arc loses its sulfur-and-jasmine texture. The ending's refusal to wait for light but to "manufacture it, stubbornly, beautifully" feels earned rather than imposed. Slight limitation: the "starless night / carry her own" motif, while effective, brushes close to a writing-craft commonplace (inner light vs. outer darkness); the execution rescues it through specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her profession structures every choice: she arrives because of the rumor, interprets the mosaic through combustion chemistry, copies the formula with "serious delight," and anticipates the experimental failures ahead. Her decision to scrub the wall, decode the ratios, and resume her chant with the formula integrated drives the entire arc and shapes the closure—she walks out carrying the secret, ready to "fire them into a starless sky." The role is indispensable; remove it and the stakes, method, and thematic charge collapse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The kerosene rag knot appears in two distinct beats: introduced mid-story as a traded talisman with the wisdom "fire is a conversation, not a command," then used physically to clear moss from the mosaic tiles. It reappears at closure tied back to her belt as she departs. The wisdom it carries subtly informs her patient willingness to fail ("adjust, recalculate, argue with the chemistry"), but the knot itself does not constrain a choice or narrow options; it functions more as symbolic tool and anchor than causal lever. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is functional but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The "note in mosaic"—a formula encoded in colored tile ratios—is the story's engine: the rumor draws Maren to the fortress, the search for it structures the middle, and its discovery provides the closure's actionable payload. The concept is deeply integrated: the mosaic is described as "a recipe written for people who thought in light," making Maren's profession and the concept inseparable. The final image (formula on her arm, ratios in her chant, "those unnamed colors" she will fire into the sky) shows the concept has redefined her immediate future. Remove it and the entire narrative collapses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The chanting appears in the opening, is described as "a low percussive murmur that matched her footfalls" and "syllables she'd collected from every town," functions as sonar during the search ("Her chanting shifted, slowed, became a kind of sonar"), and resumes "at full rhythm now, the new formula's ratios weaving into her cadence" at closure. The trait enables her search method and charges the ending by absorbing the discovered knowledge. It constrains her approach (rhythmic, accumulative) and the cost is implicit in the years of collection. Setup, development, and payoff are all present with clear causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Filter" drives the middle act: Maren must "filter sensation carefully, letting the fragrance pass through her without drowning in it, searching through ambient awareness for something sharper beneath the sweetness." This is the method by which she locates the mosaic amid overwhelming sensory input. Later she "filtered each revealed tile through her understanding of combustion chemistry" to decode the ratios. The action is specific, irreplaceable (swapping it would require rewriting her method entirely), and essential to both discovery and characterization. Setup is early (the fortress's overwhelming flowers), development is the search itself, payoff is the decoded formula. The verb recurs with technical precision and shapes the entire middle sequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Through ambient awareness" frames Maren's perceptual method: she filters fragrance, uses chant as sonar, and searches for "geometric interruption of intentional pattern among organic bloom." The phrase itself appears once but the mechanics—sensing through layered input rather than direct sight—are demonstrated across multiple beats (filtering scent, feeling where vine gives way to tile, scrubbing in circles until tessellated edges appear). The method enables the discovery and is setup early, developed in the search, and implicit in the payoff (the formula she carries forward). It is not ornamental but could be articulated more distinctly as a constraint or trade-off to reach higher integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "blooming fortress at dusk" is anchored immediately, provides the overwhelming sensory pressure Maren must filter through, and supplies the hidden mosaic that becomes her prize. The wisteria and jasmine create the obstacle (drowning sweetness) she must navigate to find "the mineral tang of old glaze." The fortress gate frames her departure at closure. The setting is purposeful and specific, shaping her search tactics (scrubbing moss, using the kerosene knot) and charging the final image ("The wisteria trembled in her wake"). Setup, development, and payoff are all clear; the setting constrains her method and participates in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"During the hush of a night with no stars" is established early and sustained as atmospheric pressure: "the darkness didn't sparkle—it pressed," making the sky unavailable for her usual work. The starless condition motivates the shift to seeking the mosaic (no sky to paint tonight) and charges the closure metaphor ("make the darkness answer," "carried her own" stars). The timeframe does not create a ticking clock or narrow her tactical window during the search itself; it functions more as thematic contrast than mechanical constraint. Setup and payoff are strong; middle constraint is lighter, placing it in the mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To defy the gravity of hopelessness" is articulated explicitly ("defiance worked better" than belief, "her entire career was built to defy the gravity of hopelessness") and dramatized through her choices: arriving on rumor alone, working for an hour to clean the mosaic, laughing at copying the formula on her arm, anticipating failures without hesitation. The motivation is in friction with her poverty and the world's dismissal ("color was frivolous, that spectacle fed no one") and drives the closure—she will "manufacture" light "stubbornly, beautifully" rather than wait. The desire is embodied in action and charged with visible cost (anticipated failures, "sulfur-stained hands," perpetual poverty). Setup, development, and payoff all engage the motivation with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Serious playfulness" coheres across the piece: "serious delight" at the mosaic discovery, "laughing softly at the absurdity of flesh as notebook," the playful metaphor "petals drifting down like soft ammunition," and the closing line's gravity balanced by whimsy ("carried her own" stars). The tone modulates under pressure—focused and technical during the search, ebullient at discovery, resolute at closure—without losing its hybrid quality. The tone charges the final image by holding both the weight of her work and the joy in it. It is consistent, purposeful, and integrated into voice and theme throughout.</comment>
