<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oracle is embodied through concrete choices—climbing nightly between towers, trading prophecies for the astrolabe, retelling silences aloud. Her obsession drives every move, yet the piece leans heavily on her solitary interior; no friction from another character tests her stance under immediate pressure. The final beat (opening the booklet, writing the darkness) shows her completing the task, but no contradictory impulse surfaces in the moment—she simply performs the ritual she has trained for. Still, her perceptual signature (seeing silence as "ambered hush," stones in pockets) is distinct and her renunciation of asking the star to stay carries understated cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an **Accumulative/Textural** lens: density increases as the sky thins over decades, the booklet accumulates entries, and the final storm reveals one star, reweighting the map's purpose. Closure is a **Conceptual Repricing**—the map was never about stars but "the spaces stars leave behind," and the oracle completes it with the notation of that last silence. Cost is legible in the image of gold leaf flaking like "last confetti" and her stones still heavy in her pockets, signaling endurance with no escape. The orientation is clear (ridge fort, decades of watching, tonight's storm breaks), and the because/therefore linkage holds under accumulative logic: each vanished star adds weight until the final notation closes the cartography.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ridge fort constrains her vantage (eastern tower charts what remains, western marks what vanished) and the storm's breaking exposes the final star, directly enabling the closure beat. The booklet, stones in pockets, and towers are handled across multiple beats and charge the ending image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: she notices "marbled hush," "ambered tone," the "frequency just below hearing"—details specific to someone listening for cosmic silence rather than tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (completing the map of vanishing) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through decades of thinning stars, culminating in the storm's break revealing only one. The oracle's agency is renunciation: she does not ask the star to stay, simply watches and completes the notation—an Earned Stasis that forecloses hope with visible cost (gold flaking, stones heavy, voice retelling the "long story" of quiet). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "this was the entry she had always been working toward," narrowing all prior nights to this singular act. No antagonist or reversal is required under Accumulative; the pressure is existential and coherent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the map was never of stars but of absence, the booklet documents silence, and the oracle's retelling transforms emptiness into "ambered hush." The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing—"a universe learning, with terrible gentleness, how to go quiet"—reweighting all prior charting as an act of witness rather than prevention. No thematic echo or prompt-language intrudes; the final image (stones, voice, one star) carries cost and refuses tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: "ambered hush," "marbled hush," silence as texture and weight. Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring causality ("flaking gold leaf," "scoured to the color of bone"). No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The prose compresses decades into purposeful elision ("decades," "years") and then slows for the closure beat, modulating rhythm to match the oracle's final ritual. Voice remains interior and particular throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every line advances the map, the booklet, or the oracle's ritual. Rhythm varies (short declaratives at the climax, longer contemplative clauses earlier) and figurative language ("confetti," "resin," "spine of the ridge") is coherent and voice-motivated. Minor scaffold: "she meant the final one" restates what the prior clause already implied, and "a tone preserved and golden, suspended in time, neither whisper nor speech but something caught between the two like an insect in resin" stacks modifiers without adding new information (−0.2). No loops or contradictions touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise (mapping not stars but their absence, documenting silence as substance) is fresh and the oracle's voice is specific. The emotional arc avoids template satisfactions: she does not lament or celebrate, only completes the notation and retells. The combination of cartography, astronomy, and existential witness feels organic rather than checklist. Minor familiarity: the lone-watcher-in-ruined-tower and the "last star" trope are not entirely transformed, though the focus on silence as measurable substance distinguishes the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pebble-shore oracle is present in setup (she "had come up from the coast"), drives middle beats (pacing nightly, retelling silences, studying the booklet), and her choice at closure (opening the booklet, writing the darkness, not asking the star to stay) is causally necessary. Her decisions alter tactics: the decades of charting, the trade for the astrolabe, the nightly ritual. Without her obsessive agency, no map exists and no final notation occurs. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; cost visible in stones, voice, endurance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gold leaf booklet appears in setup ("flaking gold leaf booklet no larger than her palm"), is handled in middle beats (she studies it nightly, retells its entries aloud), and returns at closure when she opens it to its last empty page and writes the final notation. It is irreplaceable: the booklet's prior astronomer and the "summarizing silence" method are unique. Gold leaf flaking "like the last confetti" charges the ending image. Without it, the closure notation has no vessel and the act of completing the map lacks its anchoring tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Ambered hush" appears once as a descriptor of her voice ("a tone preserved and golden, suspended in time"), enriching texture but not constraining a choice or altering tactics. It does not return at closure or shape the map's logic. Present and consistent with tone, but ornamental—swappable with another synesthetic phrase without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Mildly obsessed" is signaled early ("mildly obsessed with a task no one had asked her to perform") and manifests in repeated on-page actions: nightly pacing, charting absence, retelling silences, trading prophecies. The trait enables the decades-long project and the final notation. Cost is visible in isolation and endurance (stones, voice, the fort's ruin). It does not intensify dramatically at closure—the obsession remains steady—so it stops short of indispensability, but it drives multiple beats and is causally necessary.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Retell" is established in middle beats ("learned to retell the astronomer's observations aloud") and enacted on the page ("Her voice in those moments took on a quality she thought of as ambered hush"). The final line loops back: "her voice still carrying that ambered tone through the ruined corridors, retelling the long story of a universe learning…" The action frames her method and charges the closure image, but the peak turn (writing the final notation) does not hinge on retelling itself—observing and writing the darkness does. Present across beats, but not the pivot of the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"By summarizing silence" is signaled early (the booklet "documented them all… by summarizing silence itself: measuring the weight and texture of what did not happen") and mechanics appear in the closure beat when she writes "what the darkness around it felt like… summarized the silence of every extinguished point, compressed it into a single careful notation." The method shapes her approach across beats and is enacted at closure. Without it, the final notation loses its unique logic. Present in setup, development, and payoff; causally active but its mechanics are told more than shown in micro-steps.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ridge fort is present in setup ("climbing until the land broke into the jagged spine of the ridge fort"), its dual towers constrain her method (eastern charts what remains, western marks what vanished), and the fort's exposure enables the closure beat (storm breaks, revealing the sky from the eastern tower). The setting is handled on the page ("half-collapsed," "storm-tossed," "ruined corridors") and its height and vantage are irreplaceable for the map's logic. Without the fort's towers and exposure, she cannot chart or witness the final star.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The timeframe ("when only one star remains") is the story's climax and anchors the closure beat: "One star. Only one remained in the dimming sky." The decades of thinning ("each year fewer points of light") build pressure toward this moment, and tonight's storm breaks to reveal it. The temporal narrowing (decades → tonight → one star) tightens the map's completion. The timeframe drives escalation and the final notation depends on this exact moment. Strongly integrated across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation ("to draw a map of an endless night") is signaled in the first paragraph and dramatized across beats: she paces nightly, charts absence, studies the booklet, writes the final notation. Friction surfaces in the cost: isolation, endurance, stones heavy in pockets, and the acceptance that "no one else seemed to be keeping records." The map's purpose shifts at closure (not stars but "the spaces stars leave behind"), charging the ending with conceptual cost. The desire drives every move and the closure reweights it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Marbled hush" appears in the closure beat ("a marbled hush of deep indigo and black, swirled like stone") and is consistent with the story's tonal palette ("ambered hush," "silence," "quiet"). The tone modulates from decades-long accumulation to tonight's storm break to the final contemplative notation, coherent under pressure. It charges the final image by naming the sky's texture, but does not constrain a prior choice or recur with reweighted meaning—it arrives at closure as descriptor. Present and purposeful, but not indispensable across beats.</comment>
