<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's characterization is embodied and purposeful: "diligently curious" drives her through the investigation with concrete micro-choices (charting starling avoidance, cross-referencing phrasebook and hopscotch grid). Internal texture is consistent—observant, methodical, sociable even in solitude. The final untethering reads as earned agency that forecloses waiting, though the cost remains more anticipatory than visceral on the page. Minor slip: the letter to Harwick feels like narrative tidying rather than a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure is a Charged Poise/Decisive Change hybrid: Sable untethers the airship and follows the convergence, a choice that forecloses passive waiting and crystallizes her stance as discoverer. Causality is clean through the investigative beats (phrasebook → hopscotch → charts → starling patterns → composite map). Orientation anchors quickly (Sable, airship, eleven days alone). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural with causal backbone: density increases through pattern layering, then one decisive tightening (the convergence) narrows to action. Cost is felt in the departure but not yet paid on the page; the poise charges the image without a visible forfeit in the final lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The airship micro-setting (observation deck, lower deck, navigation console, engine housing) constrains and enables Sable's investigation; the hopscotch board on iron plating is a tactile discovery that drives plot. Sensory details are filtered through cartographic POV: "pooled like spilled ink," "ionized air," "bioluminescent fog banks." The starlings function as environmental pressure and living instruments that guide the final bearing. The glacial cirque as unmarked convergence charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across decks and the final ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: chart the stranded luminance. Pressure accumulates through investigative tightening (each clue narrows the search), culminating in the composite map that points to one location. The untethering is a protagonist-driven escalation with agency; it forecloses waiting and commits resources (the airship, provisions, the journey). Cost is opportunity and safety, legible in "Harwick… should have taken three [days]" and the solitary departure into "bruised twilight." One meaningful deepening occurs when Sable realizes the convergence and acts on it. The escalation fits the Accumulative lens with a decisive final move.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of stranded luminance as discovery and the cost of curiosity emerges through particulars: the dog-eared phrasebook, the hopscotch grid as scripture, starlings as living compass. "Diligently curious" is tested by solitude and departure without Harwick; the final image—following birds toward "the next bright unknown"—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in "sociable even in absence. Connected even through silence." The piece resists easy resolution; the ending is poise rather than arrival, reflecting the thematic question of what curiosity demands. Minor slip: "light that could not move, luminance stranded" risks abstraction, though the convergence anchors it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and cartographic: "la lumiere echouee," "portolan charts," "atmospheric annotations." POV is stable third-limited with close access to Sable's perceptual signature (she names birds, notes patterns, cross-references). Distance modulates purposefully from intimate observation ("she whispered to the starlings") to wider framing at closure. Diction remains within a literate apprentice's lexicon; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The phrasebook's polyglot texture and the hopscotch-as-scripture conceit sustain voice under pressure. Dialogue to the starlings reads as solitary habit rather than convenience. Minor slip: "the kind who… would chart the next great discovery" in paragraph three edges toward helpful-narrator summary, though it primes closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and information-dense: "murmurations that drew shapes she almost recognized" layers image, action, and mystery in one clause. Overwriting appears in the opening ("evening light pooled like spilled ink," "bruised twilight") but does not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. The hopscotch-grid description is clear and propulsive. Minor scaffold in paragraph three: "the worrying kind… the kind who" repeats stem structure without functional gain. Figurative language is controlled (the phrasebook's "small wings") and the closure image is clean. No artifacts touch the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hopscotch-board-as-map synthesis is fresh and earns its specificity through layered investigation (symbols as bearings, numbers as page markers). The polyglot phrasebook and starling murmurations as parallel navigation tools offer a non-obvious angle on discovery. The piece avoids template cartographer-quest by grounding stakes in solitude, pattern-reading, and the physicality of the airship. Risk-taking in the quiet, process-driven escalation and the open-ended departure elevate originality. Minor deduction: the "stranded luminance" conceit edges toward allegorical abstraction without full dramatization of what luminance *does* on the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable present throughout; her observation and cross-referencing drive three beats (phrasebook discovery, hopscotch recognition, composite mapping) and her decision to untether creates the closure. The apprentice frame constrains her method (charting, not adventuring) and her curiosity shapes every turn. Setup immediate, development spans investigation, payoff is the untethering choice with cost (departure without Harwick, risk). Swappability low; the apprentice role and curiosity are causally necessary.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Phrasebook appears in three distinct beats: discovery (day four), cross-reference with hopscotch (days six onward), and closure (open on helm, "pages fluttering like small wings"). Its dog-eared pages provide the method (pointing to phrases, matching numbers) that drives the investigation. Specificity high: polyglot structure and marginalia are irreplaceable. Setup early, development constrains tactics (Sable must decode the pattern), payoff charges the final image. Cost connection: decoding takes days of solitary work. Very strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stranded luminance frames the investigation and appears in the phrasebook phrases, old charts (ionized air, bioluminescent fog), and the unmarked cirque as the goal. It shapes stakes (what to find) and the final bearing. Setup via phrasebook (day four), development through chart cross-reference, payoff as the destination Sable pursues. Swappability moderate: "lost relic" or "hidden phenomenon" could substitute with edits. Cost connection weak; the concept is goal rather than constraint. Lyric resonance present but causally thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" enables the multi-day investigation (cross-referencing, noticing starling avoidance) and the final untethering choice. The trait constrains by requiring solitary patience and attention to detail; it enables by letting Sable see patterns others missed. Setup immediate (Harwick's attribution), development in observation beats, payoff in the departure ("curious enough to read a hopscotch board as scripture"). Cost: solitude, departure without Harwick. Specificity moderate; "persistent" could near-substitute. Trait visible in action, not label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Noting drives four beats: charting starlings, recognizing hopscotch grid, plotting convergence on composite map, and recording all patterns. The action is the investigative method and directly creates the closure choice (the map reveals the location). Setup early (charcoal pencil in hand, paragraph one), development spans investigation, payoff is the composite map pinned to the wall that points northeast. Swappability low; "observing" or "recording" lack the cartographic precision. Cost: days of solitary work. High causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The hopscotch board is discovered mid-investigation (day six), its numbered sequence and symbols provide the decoding method (bearings, page numbers), and Sable's realization ("someone was mapping something before me") shifts her from passive waiting to active triangulation. Setup second sixth, development in cross-reference beat, payoff as the composite map crystallizes the convergence. Mechanics matter: symbols = bearings, numbers = phrasebook pages. Swappability low; the board's specific wrongness (sequence skips, repeats) is irreplaceable. Cost: interpretive labor. Strong integration despite late setup.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Meridienne provides isolation (eleven days alone), archives (phrasebook, charts), spatial layers (observation deck, lower deck, navigation console, engine housing), and the final resource (untethering, burners, ascent). Setting enables investigation and the departure; tethering/untethering brackets the action. Setup immediate (paragraph one), development through spatial moves and archive use, payoff is the ascent. Micro-setting (the hopscotch board on iron plating) drives a key turn. Swappability low; a grounded archive would remove the departure agency. Cost: leaving before Harwick returns.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Starling murmurations recur nightly, provide pattern data (avoidance corridors), and guide the final bearing ("a living compass needle swinging northeast"). Timeframe is atmospheric and rhythmic but does not tighten choices; Sable works at her own pace across eleven days. Setup immediate (paragraph one), development through observation beats, payoff as the starlings lead at closure. Swappability moderate: other migratory or atmospheric phenomena could substitute. Cost connection weak; the murmurations enable rather than constrain. Lyric resonance high, causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Chart the next great discovery" is stated early, tested through the investigation, and fulfilled in the departure toward the cirque. The motivation is dramatized in Sable's choices (cross-referencing, noting patterns, untethering) and frictions with waiting for Harwick. Setup immediate (paragraph two), development through investigative persistence, payoff in the final line ("toward the next bright unknown"). Cost: solitude, departure without provisions or master's approval. Swappability moderate: "solve the mystery" could near-substitute. Friction between curiosity and prudence is present but understated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sociable isolation is coherent throughout: Sable speaks to starlings, names birds, leaves a letter for Harwick ("sociable even in absence"), and the tone modulates from companionable observation ("You're doing it again") to quiet departure. The tone charges the final image (solitary yet connected, following birds as company). Setup immediate, development through voice choices (addressing absent others), payoff as the tone reweights the solitary ascent with connection rather than loneliness. Swappability low; the specific blend of solitude and sociability shapes every beat. Minor slip: the tone risks becoming static in middle paragraphs before the departure shifts it.</comment>
