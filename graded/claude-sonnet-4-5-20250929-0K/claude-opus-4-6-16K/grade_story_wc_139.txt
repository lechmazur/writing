<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—finding "the mathematics of a fair trade"—is concrete and drives her ultimatum. Her micro-choices (calling the consulate, threatening FBI exposure) narrow options with visible cost. Desmond's shift feels earned by the ink pot's symbolic weight and Mara's pressure, though his interior contradiction could be more embodied. The chess-player framing and "waiting actively" anchor her agency, but the final "Okay" arrives quickly after minimal on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a Decisive Change: Desmond agrees to broker real asylum, foreclosing his grift with visible cost ("I'm exposed"). Causal lens holds: Mara's discovery → threat → Desmond's calculation. Orientation is swift (funeral home, midnight meeting, scheme file). The ink pot seeds early and returns charged at closure. One tightening (the ultimatum) narrows options cleanly. Minor: Desmond's capitulation feels compressed; a beat showing his internal war would deepen the hinge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prep room's "formaldehyde and lavender" and "fluorescent lights" with "deathly vitality" anchor tone and charge the standoff. The embalming table functions as symbolic altar. Micro-setting (steel stool, the room's function) pressures the confrontation. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting does not mechanically constrain a choice, holding it below the 9-band gate, but it charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stopping the con and saving Anatol—is signaled early. The ultimatum tightens options with clear cost: exposure versus complicity. Mara's active waiting and the FBI threat create genuine pressure. Desmond's "I'm exposed" lands as a felt price. The reversal (con artist does the honest thing) is earned by prior causality. Minor: the final choice compresses quickly; one additional beat showing Desmond weighing the trade-off would deepen escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—fair trade, the architecture of trust—emerges through the ink pot, the grift mechanics, and Mara's demand for balanced math. The prep-room setting (bodies made to look alive) mirrors the con's false presentations without stating it. The final image (Desmond cradles the ink pot, calculates a fair price) reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: one honest act within a network of fakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature (chess architecture, math of fair trade) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("You know" / "I know"). Diction is controlled; "liquefies rigid thinking" and "deathly vitality" fit the elevated register. No head-hopping. Filter verbs are minimal. Psychic distance is tight. Minor: Desmond's interior at the hinge is shown through externals (jaw tightens, stares) but could afford one line of embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid monotony. Information density is high: most lines advance character, stakes, or atmosphere. "Waiting actively" and "architecture of consequence" are fresh and concrete. The prep-room imagery (fluorescent hum, steel table) propels without ornament. Minor scaffold: "She had waited actively, and the waiting had worked" in the penultimate paragraph loops the concept without adding pressure. "Somewhere in Moldova…and the math, for once, would balance" tilts toward thematic summary. No major line-level debt, but the ending could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The inversion—con artist's child forcing honesty—is fresh and earned. The prep-room setting (death industry meets deception) offers a non-obvious crucible. "Mathematics of a fair trade" and "liquefies rigid thinking" are specific coinages. The ink pot's role (honest object in a dishonest household) charges the standoff. The piece resists safety-hedging: Mara's ultimatum is bold, and the ending stakes genuine exposure. Minor: the diplomat-asylum plot is a familiar con; the transformation is character-driven rather than premise-novel.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mara (con artist's honest child) drives both key turns: discovering the scheme and issuing the ultimatum. Her choices (calling the consulate, threatening FBI exposure) narrow options and force Desmond's capitulation. She appears early, carries interior pressure, and her final stance crystallizes the closure. Removing her agency would collapse the story.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ink pot appears in three beats: Mara holds it opening, sets it on the table during ultimatum, Desmond cradles it at closure. It is the "one honest object," anchoring her mother's belief and Mara's demand for fairness. Its charged reprise at the end reweights Desmond's calculus. Strong integration, though its causal pressure is more symbolic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Political asylum is the scheme's spine: Desmond's con, Mara's discovery of Anatol, and the ultimatum's stakes (save him or face exposure). It shapes tactics (file research, consulate call) and the ending's cost (Desmond must broker real asylum). Present early, drives middle and closure. Could score higher if asylum mechanics appeared on the page rather than as declared stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" is told ("watched the idea breach his defenses, watched it liquefy the rigid thinking") at the hinge rather than shown through embodied hesitation or micro-choices. It labels Desmond's shift but does not constrain an earlier action. Present at closure, but the lack of prior setup and visible struggle caps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Breach" appears in the scheme context (breach of trust) and at the hinge ("watched the idea breach his defenses"). It frames the thematic architecture but does not constitute a single pivotal physical action. The story's major turn is the ultimatum, not a discrete breach-event. Functional and thematic, but swappable metaphorically without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Waiting actively" is signaled early ("she was waiting actively, the way a chess player waits"), shapes Mara's entire stance (building the ultimatum architecture), and pays off at closure ("She had waited actively, and the waiting had worked"). The method defines her agency and distinguishes her from passive hope. Removing it would hollow her characterization and the story's tactical logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is established immediately (formaldehyde, lavender, embalming table, fluorescent lights) and charges tone throughout. "Bodies made to look alive" mirrors the con's false presentations. The table serves as symbolic altar for the standoff. It does not mechanically constrain a choice (no tool or exit limits), but it pressures atmosphere and the final image. Strong tonal and thematic fit.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Mathematics of a fair trade" is Mara's stated want ("That was what she'd always wanted") and dramatized through her ultimatum: "do the math…two hundred thousand dollars, and you actually broker the asylum." It creates friction (fair deal versus con artistry) and drives the closure choice. Present early, tested at the hinge, resolved with cost. Slightly told in phrasing, but the desire shapes every beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" is coined on the page ("fluorescent lights hummed with a deathly vitality") and sustained through the prep-room imagery (formaldehyde, bodies made alive, lavender, steel table). Tone coheres across beats and charges the ending: life-from-death mirrors the honest act forced from the con artist. Modulates with pressure without breaking. The phrase itself is fresh and the tonal execution is consistent.</comment>
