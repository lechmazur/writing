<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is distinct and embodied through her centuries of wakefulness and compulsive verse-making. The final choice to sleep carries weight earned by the postcard's news, though the emotional progression—longing held for centuries, released in one moment—compresses the turn sharply. Internal contradiction appears in her "shyly unstoppable" nature and the refusal to let hours pass unwitnessed, but the ending choice feels slightly too frictionless given the scale of her prior compulsion. The cost is present (foreclosing the witness-everything stance) but could be more viscerally fought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early: Maren in the shell, centuries of insomnia, poems on walls. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: layers of longing, verse, and witness accumulate until the postcard arrives and permission to rest crystallizes. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (permission to sleep after centuries)—a Charged Poise moment where the cost (releasing vigilance) is felt though not yet paid on the page. One tightening: postcard news → hum → final poem → sleep. The causal link from news to rest is clean, though the ease of the shift (centuries of refusal released in one night) slightly undercuts the felt struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is vividly realized: logarithmic curve, coral walls, bioluminescent ceiling, the tight alcove where Maren ensconces herself. It functions as both setting and emotional anchor, the architecture mirroring her spiral of longing. The postcard's galaxy image echoes the shell's form, tying micro-setting to the closure image. The shell constrains her choice to remain and charges the final moment of sleep within its resonant walls, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Maren allow herself rest after centuries of compulsive witness? The postcard complicates by offering the exact permission she needs (war ended, orchards blooming). One meaningful tightening occurs when she reads the news and feels "the possibility of sleep"—options narrow from endless vigilance to earned release. Agency is present (she writes "bloom," tucks the postcard, closes her eyes) but the escalation is more lyric accumulation than dramatic pressure. Cost is legible (foreclosing the witness-everything stance) but the turn arrives gently rather than through hard-won struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of pain pressed into beauty, darkness in conversation with light, emerges organically through Maren's verse-making and the "reef-shadow joy" formulation. The blossom armistice enacts the theme: beauty stops war without defeating darkness. The final word "bloom" and the metaphor of photosynthesizing pain avoid didactic summary, instead trusting image and action. The postcard as "a stamp from a universe that had learned…the same lesson" hovers near thematic echo but stays grounded in the dramatic moment. The ending reweights prior material (centuries of longing, poems as light-making) without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and elevated, consistent throughout: "a throat that had swallowed the night sky," "shyly unstoppable…the way roots are impossible to silence." POV remains stable third-limited to Maren. Diction is poetic but controlled, matching the premise of an insomniac poet. The line "joy that existed not despite the darkness but because of it" and the explanation of "reef-shadow joy" edge toward essayistic register in a high-pressure beat, though the metaphor work generally stays embodied. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices spirals, logarithms, constellations, poems. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm and imagery are strong: "logarithmic curve," "calcified into myth," "unspool her." Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—which risks overwriting in an accumulative piece, though most images cohere. Minor loop: "She thought of the orchards. She thought of blossoms…She thought of how pain…" in the penultimate paragraph uses identical stems. The phrase "the way roots are impossible to silence as they split stone" and "the way deep water is not less dark but more full of strange light" repeat the "the way X is Y" construction. Scaffold is minimal, clarity high, but the density without breathing room triggers a small deduction for texture saturation in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of centuries-old poet in a shell + postcard news of blossom armistice is specific and non-obvious. The "blossom armistice" and "reef-shadow joy" phrases feel fresh. The insomniac poet is not merely sleepless but compulsively witnessing, which adds dimension. The galaxy postcard echoing the shell's spiral is a purposeful mirror. Risk is present in the lyric, meditative pacing and the lack of external antagonist. The transformation test holds: plot and arc depend on this exact shell, this exact poet, this exact war and orchard news.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout. She ensconces herself, catches the postcard, reads it, hums, writes the final poem, tucks the postcard, and closes her eyes to sleep—each a micro-choice advancing the arc. The decision to sleep is the closure turn, and her prior centuries of insomnia set the cost. Setup early, middle choices (ensconce, read, hum), and closure participation all present. Causal pressure: her compulsion to witness is the problem the ending resolves. Specificity: "insomniac poet" is not generic; her verse-making and refusal to let hours pass unwitnessed matter. Cost: she forecloses the witness-everything stance. Two gates clearly met (setup, closure); middle development is lighter (she reacts more than decides until the end). Score reflects strong setup and closure linkage with modest middle causal work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The postcard appears mid-story, is read multiple times, pressed to chest, and tucked into the wall beside the final poem at closure. Two beats: arrival/reading and the final tuck. It carries reweighted meaning: initially news, finally a "stamp from a universe" joining her lesson. The galaxy image echoes the shell's spiral, adding specificity. Causal role: the postcard's message (blossom armistice) is the trigger that allows Maren to consider sleep. Closure linkage strong. Setup slightly late (past first third) but not penalized heavily due to the piece's structure. Irreplaceability moderate—news could arrive another way, but the galaxy/spiral visual link and physical tuck add unique weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The blossom armistice is the news on the postcard that releases Maren from her vigil. It frames the central stake (can she rest now that the war has ended?) and appears in the key turn. Setup: mentioned early via backstory of the war. Development: the postcard delivers the news. Closure: she writes "bloom" in response. The concept shapes options (war's end = permission to sleep) rather than merely echoing as theme. Specificity: "blossom armistice" (trees blooming simultaneously) is concrete and tied to Maren's origin story. Causal pressure present but the concept operates more as trigger than ongoing constraint. Cost connection: her release from witness-duty. Two gates (setup, closure) met; middle touch is via the postcard reading.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" is defined in the text: "never loud, never declarative, but impossible to silence, the way roots are impossible to silence as they split stone." It characterizes her centuries of verse-making. The trait is present throughout (her quiet compulsion), but no single on-page action hinges on the shy/unstoppable tension with visible cost. The trait colors her behavior (she hums off-key, writes one word) but does not constrain a choice in a way that another trait couldn't. Setup early, lyric development (her humming and final poem are quiet yet persistent), but no distinct beat where shyness conflicts with unstoppability to alter tactics. Ornamental coloring more than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Maren ensconces herself in the tight alcove at the story's opening, which is where the postcard finds her and where she performs the key actions (reading, humming, writing, sleeping). The action is signaled early and the setting (alcove as held space) matters to the emotional tone. The ensconcing itself does not create a major turn—it's staging for the postcard's arrival. One beat clearly tied to this action (the alcove scene), and it sets the intimate container for closure. Swappability: she could be in another part of the shell without major change. Setup strong, modest closure linkage (she's still in the shell at the end), but the action is more frame than engine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Maren hums, and the sound travels via the shell's curved walls and fissures to the ocean, where "fish paused, and the jellyfish dimmed their lanterns as if listening." The "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" phrase describes the transmission method. Setup: none until it occurs late (past midpoint). Development: one beat (the humming). Closure: not directly present, though it precedes the final poem and sleep. Mechanics: the shell's acoustics and the wind carry the sound. The method is ornamental—removing it would not break the arc; the humming itself matters, but the specific transmission via wind and fissures does not alter tactics or cost. Late appearance, no closure participation, and swappable method cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is Maren's home, prison, and witness-chamber. Setup immediate (first paragraph). Development: the shell's logarithmic curve mirrors her spiral of longing; the alcove where she ensconces herself is the setting for the key turn; the walls hold her poems; the crack in the apex lets the postcard in. Closure: she writes on the innermost wall and sleeps within the shell's resonant hum. The shell is irreplaceable—its architecture (spiral, alcove, coral, bioluminescent ceiling) shapes mood, constrains her (she stays inside for centuries), and charges the final image (the shell hums around her as she sleeps). Causal pressure: the shell is both refuge and cage, and her decision to sleep is made within its confines. Cost: she accepts the shell's enclosure as her final resting place. All three gates met with high specificity and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Centuries of longing" is stated and Maren's arrival "so long ago that the memory…had calcified into myth." The timeframe establishes scale (her vigil is ancient) and stakes (can she finally rest after so long?). Setup early. Development: the vast time span is referenced repeatedly ("centuries," "longer than memory") and the postcard news ends a war from her youth. Closure: "for the first time in longer than memory" she sleeps. The timeframe does not function as a live ticking clock that tightens decisions—it's backdrop scale rather than tactical pressure. The length of time matters thematically (the weight of her wait) but does not alter her moves in the present scene. Lyric resonance (first paragraph to final line) present, but no middle development where time constrains a choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—to photosynthesize pain into beauty—is dramatized through her centuries of verse-making, taking wars and drownings and pressing them into poems. Setup early: "each one an attempt to photosynthesize pain into beauty." Development: her poems line the walls; she writes one final word, "bloom," enacting the process. Closure: the final poem and her permission to sleep both reflect the transformation of pain (war, longing) into something luminous (art, rest). The motivation is shown in action (writing poems, humming, final word) not merely told. Friction: the compulsion to witness versus the need to rest. Cost: she must release the pain-fuel to sleep. All three gates met with causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy" is defined late: "Joy that existed not despite the darkness but because of it, the way color exists more vividly at the edge of a shadow cast by living coral." The tone is lyric, meditative, and melancholic throughout, with the joy arriving only at the end. Setup: implied early through the bioluminescent creatures and the shell's beauty-in-darkness, but the phrase appears late. Development: the tone modulates from longing to humming to quiet joy. Closure: the final image ("the ocean outside was quiet, and the blossoms…continued their gentle, unstoppable work") carries the reef-shadow tone—quiet, luminous, shadowed. The tone charges the final image and is coherent, though the explicit naming of "reef-shadow joy" in the penultimate paragraph risks thematic echo. Two gates (development, closure) met; late setup and near-essay register in that beat limit the score.</comment>
