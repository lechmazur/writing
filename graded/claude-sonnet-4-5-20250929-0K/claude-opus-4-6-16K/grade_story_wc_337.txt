<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction between pride and fracture is concretely embodied through her shaking hands and the embedded vibration of Aldric's scream. The choice to unravel the net is well-motivated by her professional failure and persistent unrest. Confession as method creates genuine vulnerability that earns the gradual steadying of her hands. The transformation reads as Earned Stasis rather than cure, which fits the scope and avoids false resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren's hands steady through active confession and silence-work, foreclosing the path of denial with visible cost (years of fractures acknowledged). The accumulative lens holds cleanly—each knot released layers pressure until breath comes without trembling. Orientation anchors quickly (sanctuary, Maren kneeling, mask restorer). One meaningful deepening occurs as confession enables the unraveling, which grounds the restless spirits and her own trembling; cost is legible in "years of fractures to mend."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: starlight through crystal columns creates the violet and silver geometry that marks her hands steady at the end. The net itself—knotted fiber held in a stone basin—becomes tactile setting that constrains her action (confession required to release each knot). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through her restorer's attention: the dense coolness of accumulated silence, the needle's curve, the hum of released hush.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grounding her own unrest and the spirits she failed) is signaled early and tightens through each confession. The escalation is accumulative: each knot releases silence that layers pressure against the embedded scream, dimming Aldric's wail and steadying her hands. Agency is active—she chooses to exhume, confess, and unravel—with visible cost in admitting pride and unreported cracks. The ninth knot marks meaningful deepening where spirits settle and her breath steadies, foreclosing the path of evasion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (repair through confession, silence as structural force against grief) emerges organically from Tessaly's net and Maren's unraveling without direct statement. The final image—breathing without trembling under indifferent stars while holding accumulated silence "like a promise she was only beginning to understand"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether fracture can be mended. Interlaced hush operates as earned concept, not metaphor: silence woven so tightly it bears weight. No moralizing; ambiguity persists (years left to mend) without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: Maren notices through a restorer's lens (fracture lines, glaze, knots). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at confession beats. Diction remains controlled and voice-particular ("interlaced hush," "spider-steel," "lucid, sleepless unrest"). Filter verbs ("could feel," "told the darkness") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches her knowledge throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character state, or the unraveling action. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting appears in a few beats: "dense and cool, like water pooling in her palms" followed immediately by "had been accumulating it for three hundred years, drinking quiet" layers metaphor without adding clarity. The closure image is clean and propulsive, untouched by any artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of mask restoration with net-mending through accumulated silence is specific and non-obvious; the premise transforms familiar "broken healer" material through the concrete mechanics of knotted hush and confession-as-method. The fisherman's-net lineage and spider-steel needle are particular enough to resist template feel. Risk is present in the accumulative structure and the quiet ending, which trust silence itself to carry closure weight. Transformation test passes: swap names/places and the emotional arc collapses because the restorer craft and Tessaly's legacy are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren appears early, her broken state (shaking hands, embedded scream) frames expectation. Her choice to exhume the net and begin unraveling drives the entire sequence. Each confession-and-knot cycle is her decision under pressure, altering her physical state (hands steady) and foreclosing evasion. Present in closure: her breathing without trembling is the final proof of agency with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears at the unraveling's start and is used across multiple knot-loosening beats. Its curved eye and spider-steel filament are specific. It enables the method (stitching silence, now reversed) and reappears implicitly in "the needle moved surely now." Two-gate coverage (development, closure) with causal pressure, but late first appearance (~40% mark) and modest closure linkage prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Interlaced hush is defined early, shapes the net's function (silence woven structurally to bear grief), and directly alters Maren's options: only confession can release each knot's stored hush. The concept drives every beat of unraveling and delivers the closure effect—layered silence pressing against her vibration until she breathes steadily. Specificity (not mere quiet but "active, accumulating silence") and cost (years to mend) make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The net's attribute (accumulates silence for three centuries) is established early and enables the entire resolution: each knot holds stored hush that Maren releases to ground the spirits and her own unrest. The accumulation supplies the material pressure that steadies her hands. Cost is visible—she must confess to access it, and the sanctuary's undisturbed centuries are the resource. Constraint and payoff are both on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Exhumation frames the inciting action (coming to the sanctuary tonight to retrieve the buried net) and sets up the reversal from Tessaly's original binding. The act of lifting the net from the stone basin triggers the tactile experience of accumulated silence. Major turn: choosing to exhume rather than continue failing. Removing "exhume" would require a different premise; it defines the night's stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Unraveling knots is signaled early, its mechanics detailed (needle curve, confession required per knot), and executed across nine distinct beats. The method shapes every attempt: she cannot release silence without speaking a secret. Constraints are specific (each knot holds a pocket of hush; the tapestry needle reverses Tessaly's binding). Payoff is the closure itself—ninth knot, spirits settled, hands steady. Irreplaceable and load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary's columns catch starlight and scatter it into geometries that mark Maren's knuckles and later slow at peak accumulation; this environmental detail charges the final image. The stone basin holds the net. Starlight and crystal interplay with the released silence to create the sensory pressure of the ending. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring light) constrains and rewards throughout. Present in closure with conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe (across sharing a secret) is enacted repeatedly: each confession unlocks one knot, creating a rhythmic escalation from first to ninth. The method requires spoken secrets, so time is structured by vulnerability rather than clock. Not a ticking deadline, but the confessional cadence tightens pressure and shapes the closure—by the ninth secret, her hands no longer shake. The frame is conceptual yet clearly tracked and payoff-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation (ground restless spirits, including her own fracture) is dramatized early and drives every choice: she exhumes, confesses pride, and unravels to press silence against the embedded scream. Friction is visible—confession costs her, and the work will take years. Her trembling hands and Aldric's wail anchor the need; the ninth knot's dimming effect and her steady breath show the stakes met. Want (repair) conflicts with cost (admitting failure) throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Lucid unrest suffuses the voice from the opening (shaking hands, embedded scream, sleepless drive) and modulates with each released knot: the hum of silence thickens, starlight slows, her breath steadies. Tone remains coherent through pressure and charges the final image—indifferent stars, accumulated silence as promise, breathing without trembling. The prose maintains restless clarity (specific, embodied) even as the sanctuary's hush accumulates, creating a tonal arc that supports the Earned Stasis closure.</comment>
