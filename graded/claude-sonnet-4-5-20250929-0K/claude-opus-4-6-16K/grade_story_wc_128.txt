<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear—guilt over invisible labor—and the final shift to recognition program is causally grounded. However, the transformation happens largely off-page ("Over the following weeks") via summary rather than dramatized pressure. Oren's interiority remains thin; his emboldened reading circle feels like a plot requirement rather than an earned contradiction. The midpoint lacks the micro-choices under competing pressure that would lift this into high bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (concert hall, boardwalk, library terrace by paragraph three). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren's calculus shifts from profit to visibility, and Oren starts the reading circle—both actions foreclose prior paths. Cost is conceptual (her commissions fund the program) but the "different kind of music" line veers into stated theme rather than image. The weeks-long summary flattens what should be on-page escalation, and the drive lens (accumulative/textural) wobbles when causal because/therefore is needed but elided.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The library terrace under fairy lights and the locket photo of the Yeongdo dock ground the encounter with vivid, purposeful detail. The photo anchors shared geography and charges the final bulletin-board moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting constrains the choice to stay and talk, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the concert hall and port directory feel like set-dressing rather than pressure points.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Maren's need to acknowledge invisible labor—is signaled early and tightens when she decides to deliver the envelope in person rather than return it. The recognition program and Oren's reading circle provide a tightening, but it happens in summary ("Over the following weeks") rather than a single on-page reversal with visible cost. The lack of a dramatized middle choice or visible sacrifice keeps this mid-band under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "cycles of compassion" theme emerges organically from Maren's recognition program and Oren's reading circle, avoiding overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph. However, "compassion moves in cycles—offered, received, then offered again" is near-thematic summary. The locket photo as invitation and the "different calculus" image carry weight, but the final paragraph's "music was just beginning—tentative, imperfect, and resonant with the cautious exuberance" borders on explaining the theme rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored in Maren; psychic distance is controlled with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct literary texture—"rifled through the open stacks like an impatient reader," "shrewdness was only half a life"—that reflects Maren's precise, broker's-eye observation. Dialogue is minimal but natural: "That's us. Before I came here." The final paragraph's elevated register ("cautious exuberance of lives finally heard") stays coherent with the established voice, though it tilts toward summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the opening third. However, the middle contains scaffold: "She told him so, and his eyes widened, and something cautious but exuberant passed between them" is a summary placeholder. "Tentative, imperfect, and resonant with the cautious exuberance" in the final line recycles "cautious exuberance" from earlier without reweighting it. The phrase "whose diligence underwrote every profitable voyage" is slightly elevated but coherent. No loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mistaken-address envelope as inciting incident is fresh and the Yeongdo dock callback adds specificity. However, the "recognition program for invisible workers" premise is well-worn in literary fiction, and the "cycles of compassion" frame follows a predictable template: guilt → meeting → mutual recognition → institutional change. The locket photo and library terrace provide texture, but the emotional arc (Maren learns to listen, Oren is emboldened) could transfer unchanged to another setting with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren's shrewdness enables her to spot the port directory margin note and trace Oren, driving the inciting turn. Her broker skills underpin the recognition program at closure. Present across all three gates and causally essential to two beats, but "shrewd" itself could swap for "meticulous" or "detail-oriented" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The locket photo appears when Oren opens the envelope (beat one), prompts shared geography discussion (beat two), and is pinned to the bulletin board as invitation at closure (beat three). It reweights meaning—proof that "everyone begins somewhere small"—and charges the final image. Strong integration, though the bulletin-board use is slightly told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The concept appears explicitly only in one sentence mid-story: "compassion moves in cycles—offered, received, then offered again." Maren's program and Oren's circle enact the pattern, but the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized. Setup is implicit, middle shows one example (Maren → Oren), closure gestures to the next turn, but no on-page cost or tactical constraint is tied to the cycling structure itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Whimsically attentive" is demonstrated when Maren notices the "cramped, earnest" handwriting and looks up Oren rather than returning the envelope—this choice creates the story's first turn. However, the trait is not tested under pressure or traded off later; it enables one early decision and then vanishes as a shaping force.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Initiate" drives the inciting action—Maren decides to deliver the envelope and say thank you—and that choice launches the friendship. The recognition program and reading circle are also initiations that land at closure. Present across all three gates, but the word "initiate" could swap for "reach out" or "approach" with no structural change, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mistaken-address envelope is signaled in paragraph four, seeds the first encounter (beat one), prompts Oren to share the locket photo (beat two), and the friendship it kindles culminates in the mutual programs at closure. Removing this exact method breaks causality. The mechanics—postal error, handwriting observation, directory lookup—all matter and are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The library terrace provides the meeting place and the fairy lights frame the scene, but the "breezy" quality and stars are atmospheric rather than constraining. The terrace becomes the site of Oren's reading circle at closure, a purposeful reprise. However, the setting could swap for a coffee shop or park bench without major rewrites; it shapes tone more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the symphony ends" appears in the opening line and establishes Maren's Friday-night routine. No temporal pressure or ticking clock shapes choices. The timeframe is orientation rather than constraint; removing it would require only a small edit to the opening sentence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to "uplift silent contributors" is dramatized when Maren decides to deliver the envelope and thank Oren, and again when she funds the recognition program from her commissions. The motivation drives two beats and shapes closure. However, internal conflict is light—Maren's guilt sits "like a stone" but does not block her; she moves smoothly from realization to action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is present when Maren sits down uninvited ("not because she was invited but because the photo asked her to"), in Oren's "guarded warmth," and in the friendship's growth. The tone is consistent and modulates slightly—wariness gives way to tentative connection. It charges the final image ("cautious exuberance of lives finally heard"), but the phrase is repeated rather than transformed, and the tone does not shift under pressure.</comment>
