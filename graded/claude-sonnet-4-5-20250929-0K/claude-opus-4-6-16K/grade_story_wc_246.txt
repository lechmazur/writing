<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vesper's interiority is concrete and specific ("confidently uncertain"), with embodied emotion through the pen-handling ritual and her shift from filtering distortions to listening to them. The internal arc from "planting the wrong seeds" to "unbending assumptions" is earned through weeks of lattice-mapping work. Minor weakness: the final paragraph's "thrashing meaning from the noise" slightly over-articulates the character's insight in a way that edges toward label-speak, though it remains anchored in her mother's legacy and the pen as talisman.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Vesper's realization that "history had never been fixed" and her acceptance of the anomaly's revision work crystallizes her stance with visible cost—she abandons months of calibration effort and her rigid frameworks. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: the piece builds through density of reflection and image (anomaly as wound, pen as talisman, lattice as nervous system) toward a cadence shift in the final paragraph where she "felt, for the first time in eleven months, that she was not alone." One meaningful deepening through the middle weeks of mapping, one clear closure effect. The orientation anchors (Vesper, station, eleven months, anomaly above) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The anomaly functions as active setting: it scrambles timestamps, bends frequencies, and forces Vesper to revise her method, directly constraining her interpretive work. The pen's iridium-osmium nib, "shaped like a bird's talon," charges the closure image when it "caught the light from the anomaly's halo" and its purpose shifts "from tool to talisman." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Vesper's professional lens (radio bursts, gamma whispers, halos like aureoles). The station's isolation and eleven-month duration ground the stakes without excess exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: Vesper must parse meaning from signals distorted by the anomaly, with her professional identity and her mother's legacy on the line. The escalation is Accumulative: she spends months pruning distortions as errors (wrong seeds), then realizes "the distortions were the message," forcing her to unbend her assumptions and map contingent relationships for weeks. The final stance—accepting mutability and feeling "not alone in the work of rewriting"—is earned by the lattice-building work and forecloses her old rigid framework with visible cost (months of barren analysis). One meaningful tightening; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—mutability of meaning and history, the work of revision—emerges organically from Vesper's signal-interpretation struggle and her mother's legacy without overt thesis. The pen's shift "from function to meaning" and the anomaly's "slow gravitational breath" are recurring images that reweight at closure: "the harvest comes not from the seeds you intended to plant but from the ones that actually grew" offers a resonant answer to the question of how meaning is made. Subtext operates in the particulars (dried ink, talon nib, lattice as nervous system) and avoids label-speak or sermonizing. The final image—starlight bent into crowns, Vesper revising herself—charges the thematic question without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; narrative distance remains consistent. Voice is distinct and purposeful: "the universe spoke less like a god and more like someone trying to remember a dream" and "confidently uncertain" show character-specific diction. Perceptual signature is selective (celestial interpreter's focus on signals, timestamps, frequencies). The elevated register ("gravitational anomaly," "electromagnetic noise," "contingent relationships") fits Vesper's professional identity without drift. Slight density in the final paragraph where multiple metaphors stack (thresh, grain from chaff, harvest, seeds) without quite overwhelming, but the rhythm holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "wound in spacetime," "bones from eroding soil," "mobile trembling," "lattice...like a living nervous system." Minor overwriting in the final paragraph where "thresh meaning from experience" recurs as "thrashing meaning from the noise" and stacks with harvest/seeds/grain metaphors in quick succession, creating mild pattern saturation without full opacity. Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs (anomaly as setting and metaphor, pen as object and thematic anchor). No loops or scaffold; sentence variety is strong. One paraphrase near the end: "revise itself" / "revised herself alongside it" within two lines, but the echo is purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial signal interpretation, gravitational time distortion, and the mother's xenolinguist legacy feels specific and non-obvious. "Editing history" through spacetime warping is a fresh angle on the revision theme, grounded in Vesper's professional method (mapping contingent relationships) rather than abstract philosophizing. The "confidently uncertain" paradox and the shift from filtering distortions to listening to them are earned turns. Risk: the piece leans heavily on metaphor and reflection, but the particulars (talon nib, iridium-osmium alloy, eleven months, lattice-mapping) anchor the vision and prevent generic drift. Transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend on these exact details.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vesper's choice to stop filtering distortions and instead map contingencies drives the middle turn; her final acceptance that "the anomaly was not destroying information" shapes the closure stance. Present early, constrains method across weeks of work, and her stance crystallization at the end hinges on her interpretive agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pen appears in two beats: Vesper turns it between her fingers while reflecting on her mother, and it catches the anomaly's light at closure, its purpose shifting "from tool to talisman." The shift is thematic and charges the final image, but the pen does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics. Lyric reprise with reweighted meaning, but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Editing history" is signaled early ("The phrase had lodged in her mind weeks ago"), shapes Vesper's realization that "the past was as mutable as the future," and drives her shift from treating signals as errors to understanding them as the message. The concept alters her method (mapping contingencies instead of filtering) and charges the closure insight that "history had never been fixed." Present across setup, development, and payoff with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is introduced early as Vesper's defining paradox ("she trusted her instincts absolutely while acknowledging they might be wrong"), enables her best-in-field success, and constrains her socially ("the loneliest person on the station"). It surfaces again at closure when she listens "confidently uncertain," tying the trait to her final stance. The trait shapes her willingness to unbend assumptions with visible professional and emotional cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unbend" appears as Vesper's key action: she tries "to unbend what the anomaly had curved" and realizes she must "unbend her own assumptions, to flatten the rigid frameworks." This choice drives the middle turn from filtering to mapping and shapes the closure stance. The action is specific to the gravitational metaphor and not easily swappable; removing it would weaken the thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Contingent relationships" is named and explained: "Each signal existed not in relation to others, and those relationships shifted...Meaning emerged not from any single transmission but from the web of dependencies." Vesper maps these for weeks, building "a lattice of interdependence," and the method directly enables her realization that the anomaly reveals mutability. Signaled in the middle third, shapes tactics, and supports closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The anomaly is present from the opening line, pressures every signal Vesper interprets (scrambles timestamps, bends frequencies, makes messages arrive before they're sent), forces her method shift, and charges the final image when its "slow gravitational breath" bends "starlight into crowns." It constrains her work across all beats and supplies the metaphor (bending/unbending) that organizes the closure insight. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After planting the wrong seeds" frames the backstory (early months calibrating equipment to filter distortions) and primes the realization that "the distortions were the message." The timeframe is not a live ticking clock but a retrospective frame that enables the turn. Present in setup and development with thematic payoff, but does not tighten decisions in real time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To thresh meaning from experience" is introduced as Vesper's core motivation, inherited from her mother who pressed "alien phonemes into paper with an almost devotional care." It drives Vesper's work mapping contingencies and surfaces again at closure: "thrashing meaning from the noise with the patience of someone who understood that the harvest comes not from the seeds you intended to plant but from the ones that actually grew." Dramatized through her weeks of lattice-building and the visible cost of abandoning her rigid frameworks.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Strange comfort" arrives explicitly in the middle: "slowly, a strange comfort settled over her" as she realizes "the anomaly was not destroying information." The tone modulates from isolation and frustration (eleven months alone, barren analysis) to acceptance and connection at closure ("she felt, for the first time in eleven months, that she was not alone"). The tonal shift charges the final image and is earned by the lattice-mapping work.</comment>
