<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's borrowed-personality mechanism is vivid and specific—the widow's grief as "a second pair of hands"—and her interior access is clean. However, the personality-switching feels more ornamental than constraint-generating; she drops personas at will without visible cost until the final moment. The shipwright transition mid-crisis briefly demonstrates contradictory impulses (builder vs. griever), but the closure choice—setting the fragment among letters—feels more symbolic gesture than earned renunciation with clear foreclosed options. Embodied emotion is strong ("turbulent, unbearable clarity"), but the arc reads more as gradual insight than a decision under pressure that alters her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the vanishing stars, prismatic equations, and halo fragment build density and pattern toward a conceptual repricing at closure. The ending lands a clear before/after—Maren shifts from chasing formulaic proof to recognizing empathy as "turbulent clarity" and nests the fragment among type as a tool rather than an answer. Cost is felt (stars gone cold, sky solved for grief) but largely atmospheric; no tactical path is visibly foreclosed on the page. Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the stars follow the grief waveform, tightening her understanding and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The topaz floor as prismatic lens and the roofless workshop under vanishing stars constrain Maren's nightly work and charge the closure image effectively. Micro-setting details—cut stone, composing stone, drying line between pillars—are woven through action. The fragment's warmth-then-cold transition supplies a tactile pressure point that alters her final choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (equations "lean closer," fragment hums below hearing), avoiding catalog mode. The setting's optical mathematics directly enable her conceptual shift at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding emotion's mathematics—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the vanishing stars (tightening her data window) and deepens when she recognizes the sky is "solving for grief." However, escalation is conceptual rather than driven by protagonist agency with visible trade-offs; the stars vanish on their own clock, and Maren's responses are observational until the final nesting gesture. The closure reconfigures her approach (formulaic proof → turbulent clarity), but no live tactical option is foreclosed with on-page cost—she could theoretically continue composing tomorrow under the new understanding. One meaningful tightening present, but agency and felt price remain modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: empathy as "standing in a doorway…and refus[ing] to choose a room," grief compounding via waveform subtraction, the fragment enabling transposed rather than replicated feeling. The final image—fragment nested among letters, counting spaces between stars—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the halo fragment's cooling, the widow/shipwright pairing, and the disorienting broadsheet as architecture. Minor slip: "this is the equation" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, though it's immediately grounded in embodied sensation. No forced recurrence; motifs (stars, equations, fragment) all constrain or charge closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "grief sharpened perception," "feeling was…a calculable waveform," equations as "interference patterns." Diction remains elevated but consistent with Maren's technical-lyric register. Filter verbs ("she noticed," "she thought") are sparse and voice-motivated. Minor register drift in phrases like "transposed empathy—emotion relocated, not replicated" feels slightly expository mid-paragraph, closer to essay than focalizer thought under pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tightens during the shipwright personality shift). No dialogue present to assess. Compression and ellipsis are taught early and serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences layer image, world-rule, and character motive. Figurative language is vivid ("sorrow sat behind…eyes like a second pair of hands," "melody follows you down a street") but concentrated in early exposition; peak beats are clearer. Minor paraphrase loop: "the stars were vanishing" / "stars weren't vanishing randomly" revisits the same content without added pressure. Template cadence in the opening: "Tonight she wore…she'd met…she was" stacks three consecutive openers. No filter-verb clusters in high-pressure moments. Syntactic variety supports the lyric mode. Proofreading is clean. Slight scaffold feel in world-rule exposition reduces propulsion mid-piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination—cryptic letterpress, transposed empathy via halo fragment, topaz optics, personality-borrowing—synthesizes into a coherent premise that feels specific rather than template-derived. The vanishing-stars-as-grief-waveform and broadsheets-as-disorientation are fresh angles. Emotional truth (the cost of feeling what the universe feels) anchors the lyric mode. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative design, abstract stakes) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. Slight proximity echo to "stars going out" tropes, but the mathematical-empathy frame transforms it. The transformation test passes: swapping names and setting would gut the piece's conceptual integrity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her choices shape the broadsheet composition and final nesting of the fragment. Setup early, beats in composing and personality-switching, closure linkage when she places the fragment among type. However, most choices are observational or symbolic rather than high-pressure decisions that narrow options; she composes nightly regardless, and the final gesture reads more as thematic capstone than tactical turn. Causal pressure modest; cost connection felt but oblique.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears early (tailings pile discovery recounted, then on composing stone), used in two distinct beats (pulsing during composition, going cold at closure), and charges the final image when nested among letters. Its properties—warmth, hum, transposed empathy—enable Maren's conceptual shift. Strong closure linkage and specificity (unique properties matter). Minor cap: the fragment's transposed-empathy function is asserted more than dramatized in choice-altering action; its cooling signals the shift but doesn't force a tactical trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is named and explained early, tied to the fragment's mechanics, and drives the thematic question. It shapes Maren's stake (understanding emotion as waveform) and reappears at closure when she feels "what the universe feels." However, it remains more thematic lens than on-page tactical constraint; no scene turn hinges on transposed versus replicated feeling. Present across beats but not forcing choices with visible cost. Mid-band for lyric reprise and thematic integration without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Habitually borrowing personalities is signaled early, demonstrated in two beats (widow, shipwright), and explicitly dropped mid-scene ("she dropped the widow's personality like a coat"). The trait enables her emotional range and constrains her perception (borrowed lens required). Minor cost visible when she reaches instinctively for another after dropping one. However, no on-page scene turn depends on this exact trait; she could perceive keenly without the borrowing mechanism. Functional but partially replaceable; tradeoff modest.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears in the broadsheet's intended effect ("most disorienting yet," readers "feel momentarily disoriented") and ties to the closure theme ("uncertainty was the point"). Setup present, thematic payoff clear. However, no major plot turn traces to disorientation as dramatized action on the page; it remains Maren's artistic goal rather than a mechanics-driven beat. Shapes the stake but does not redefine options in a causal chain. Lyric presence without beat-level pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Deliberate ambiguity is signaled early ("architecture," "corridors in language"), demonstrated in her type composition ("read as elegy or instruction manual depending on which eye you closed"), and tied to the thematic closure ("empathy required not knowing"). The method shapes her nightly broadsheet work across multiple beats and charges the final stance. However, the mechanics remain largely asserted rather than tested under pressure with visible cost; we see the intent more than the tactical friction. Strong thematic integration, modest causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is anchored immediately (title and opening line), used across beats (floor as lens projecting equations, composing stone, drying line, pillars), and charges closure (roofless exposure to vanishing stars, counting spaces between them). The setting's optical properties enable her mathematical pursuit and the stars' disappearance tightens her window. Environment constrains her work (no roof = live exposure) and the prismatic equations guide her nightly study. Strong causal and atmospheric integration; indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The vanishing-stars timeframe is present early, recurs across beats ("another star vanished" x2), and tightens Maren's data window, driving urgency. The fragment going cold for the first time marks a threshold. However, no scene clock tracks elapsed minutes or forces a tactical deadline; stars vanish on their own schedule without Maren racing to finish before the next loss. Time pressure is conceptual (data loss) rather than dramatized countdown. One causal tightening, closure linkage solid, but live-clock test not met.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maren's desire to understand emotion's mathematics is stated early, drives her nightly work (type arrangements, studying projections), and culminates in recognizing the equation as "turbulent clarity" rather than symbols. Friction is visible: eleven years of study, running out of data, and the final renunciation of formulaic proof. The goal is tested on the page (composing under star loss) and resolved with felt cost (fragment goes cold, she accepts uncertainty). Strong thematic and causal integration; cost legible at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Lucid turbulence" coheres throughout: precise technical language ("cryptic letterpress," "interference patterns," "waveform") layered with emotional intensity ("unbearable clarity," "insistent mathematics of collapse"). Tone modulates with pressure—calm exposition early, tightening syntax during the star-vanishing beats, breath at closure when she counts spaces. The final image ("precise, turbulent, unbearable clarity") explicitly names and embodies the tone, charging the ending. Distinct, purposeful, and integral to the piece's effect.</comment>
