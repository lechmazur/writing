<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's internal state is embodied through physical action (tears falling upward, following water) and her motivation threads through concrete choices across eleven years. The epiphany about resilience risks abstraction but remains anchored in the tactile discovery of the arrow tip and its resonance. Her grief and isolation are asserted rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses, keeping the piece in the strong-but-not-exceptional band. The final renunciation—carrying knowledge rather than artifact—earns the closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: water-following expeditions layer toward convergence, and the inversion provides a decisive deepening that reweights all prior searching. Orientation anchors (orchard pilot, floating arches, eleven-year quest) land cleanly within the first 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the arrow-tip's brokenness reframes resilience with felt cost (she carries only knowledge, no artifact). One persistent constraint—gravity inversion—shapes the discovery and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ proximity test but held back by the epiphany's slight tilt toward statement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating arches, inverted gravity, and moss-acceleration detail constrain Maren's navigation and enable the climactic discovery. Sensory specificity (moss thick as fur, water streaming upward in silver columns) is vivid and purposeful. The hollow sphere and bioluminescent stone charge the final image without postcard excess. The body-in-harness detail (tears falling upward) functions as micro-setting that anchors the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and tightens through the water-convergence method. The inversion provides one meaningful reversal that forces the discovery with agency (she follows the inverted flow). The ending forecloses her search with visible cost: she leaves the source intact and carries only understanding. Escalation is clean under the Accumulative lens, but the turn arrives primarily through circumstance (early inversion) rather than a protagonist decision that narrows options, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme—resilience as accumulated breaks rather than absence of fracture—emerges through the arrow-tip's wound-as-engine and avoids direct moralizing until the penultimate paragraph. "Its brokenness was the source" borders on thesis statement but is anchored in concrete image (bioluminescence, echo-resonance). The final paragraph's "frequency" metaphor risks abstraction yet remains specific to Maren's interior world. The ending reweights the premise without stating a moral, satisfying the 9+ test in principle, but the near-articulation of theme in "she understood" and the closing line's "what was broken in her" edges toward Thematic Echo, capping the score at 7.9.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during inversion, wider during exposition). Diction is distinctive ("hollowed bone," "whirling silence," "roots of her hair") and consistent. The water-navigation conceit and moss-thick-as-fur specificity create a perceptual signature. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The phrase "she believed that whatever force kept this world regenerating...might teach her something about endurance" tilts briefly toward exposition but serves setup rather than peak pressure, so it does not trigger heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high (every paragraph advances). Minor overwriting in "the whirling silence closed around her like an embrace" and "tears falling upward" (a strong image slightly diluted by context). The phrase "she had spent years tracing" and "the other pilots called the Gathering" are scaffold-light expositions that serve clarity without drag. One stock metaphor ("echoes...becoming the force") in the climax triggers −0.3, but overall propulsion and clarity hold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating-orchard-planet premise and water-navigation method offer fresh synthesis. The arrow-tip-as-wound motif transforms the "broken object teaches resilience" template through specific world logic (echo-gathering, bioluminescence, gravity inversion). Risk-taking in the inversion sequence and the choice to leave the source undisturbed elevate the piece. However, the resilience-from-brokenness theme closely matches widely used templates, and the final articulation ("what was broken in her was not a failure but a frequency") edges toward self-help phrasing, applying a −0.5 derivative-premise adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as orchard pilot frames the premise and her method (water-following) shapes the discovery. Her decision to follow the inverted flow drives the climax, and her choice to carry only knowledge (not the artifact) defines the closure. Present in setup, middle navigation, and ending; causal pressure evident. Slightly held back by circumstance (early inversion) sharing agency, but the pilot's expertise and eleven-year quest earn strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arrow tip appears only in the climax but redefines all prior material: its ancient brokenness is the wound the planet heals repeatedly, creating the fertility engine. It charges the final image (bioluminescence, resonance) and enables Maren's realization. Missing early setup and middle development caps ceiling, but the transformation of prior searching and closure linkage push it into the essential range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gathering-of-echoes concept is the story's engine: every sound converges at the arrow tip, feeding growth. It shapes Maren's search (tracing convergence), the planet's impossible fertility, and the climactic realization. Present implicitly in setup (water convergence), explicitly in the discovery beat, and charged in the final image (frequency metaphor). The concept constrains her understanding and enables the thematic repricing, meeting all three gates and demonstrating high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accelerated plant growth is signaled early (seeds become orchards in weeks), motivates the planet's value, and underpins the mystery Maren seeks to understand. It does not directly constrain a tactical choice but enables the core discovery: the echo-resonance drives the growth. The trait is causally active in setup and payoff, meeting two gates, but lacks middle beat involvement, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The action "discover" is the story's climax: Maren finds the hollow sphere and arrow tip, redefining her understanding of resilience. The discovery is earned by prior water-tracing and enabled by the inversion. It cannot be swapped; removing it collapses the plot. Present in setup (eleven-year search), middle (following water), and closure (the find itself). Strong causal role but slightly shared with circumstance (early inversion).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Navigating by water flow is Maren's signature method, established early (compasses spin uselessly; water still obeys truth). It shapes every expedition, guides the climactic inversion chase (following silver columns upward), and defines her expertise. The method is present in setup, middle beats, and closure, with visible cost (years of tracing). Mechanically integral and irreplaceable, meeting all gates with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The floating rock arches and orchard planet define every choice: navigation hazards, gravity inversion, moss-growth zones, and the hollow sphere at the core. Setting pressures Maren's path (labyrinth of suspended geology), provides the convergence structure, and charges the final image (inverted water, bioluminescent stone). Present in all beats with high specificity and irreplaceability; removing the arches breaks story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The inversion timeframe is signaled early (twenty minutes warning) and arrives early to force the discovery. The hour-long window shapes the climax (trees rip upward, water reverses) and enables Maren to reach the convergence. The clock is live and alters her tactics, meeting setup and middle gates. Slightly diminished by the early trigger (less sustained pressure) and brief closure participation, but causal role is clear.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—to find the source of resilience—is dramatized through eleven years of searching and anchored in her grief and erosion of purpose. It drives every beat, from water-tracing to the inversion chase to the final realization. The motivation is present in setup, shapes middle choices (following convergence despite danger), and defines closure (carrying knowledge as consolation). Slight friction: the grief is asserted rather than shown in contradictory action, and the epiphany tilts toward statement, but the cost (leaving the source, accepting brokenness) is visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tone "whirling silence" is introduced early and recurs at closure ("the whirling silence closed around her like an embrace"). It modulates with pressure: stillness precedes inversion, sensory intensity peaks during the climb, quiet reflection follows. The tone charges the final image and coheres across turns, meeting setup and payoff gates. Slightly diluted by the phrase's proximity to cliché ("closed around her like an embrace") and mid-story exposition that lacks tonal control, keeping it in mid-high band.</comment>
