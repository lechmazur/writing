<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Luma's interior state is concrete and embodied—the "fishhook" image, the throat tightening at the fresco, the surprised laugh. Her motivation to find joy is rendered through specific micro-choices (switching on the flashlight, pulling out the projector) rather than exposition. The daydream sequence functions as both perception and decision trigger, dramatizing the shift. Minor weakness: the final epiphany about joy as "exposed film" leans slightly toward articulated insight rather than pure dramatization, but the subsequent action grounds it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (Charged Poise variant—the protagonist crystallizes a stance about joy's nature). Orientation anchors early (fog, orchard district, Luma's practice). The daydream beat reweights the fresco fragment from artifact to catalyst, and the projector action narrows her path from seeking to creating/sharing. Cost is conceptual and felt: joy requires exposure and sharing, foreclosing hoarding or solitary possession. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fog functions as micro-setting throughout, shaping perception ("field of tiny, hovering lenses") and the projector's effect (scattering light into the air). The ruined workshop constrains the discovery and frames the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "mineral and sweet, like licking a wet stone." The portable projector as tool charges the closure by enabling the ephemeral orchard. The fresco fragment anchors spatially and emotionally, constraining the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Luma seeks lost joy. The fresco discovery tightens her understanding (beauty as civic duty), and the daydream deepens it into action. The projector choice forecloses hoarding or waiting—she commits to transience and documentation. Pressure is textural: fog, ruin, memory, and the battery's limited life create urgency. Cost is visible in the acceptance that the work will vanish, with only the fragment and network documentation remaining. One clear tightening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: joy as exposed film that needs light and sharing. The fresco fragment, fog-as-lens, and temporary projection interlock without thesis statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the blooming metaphor and the network documentation choice. The "civic duty" phrase reappears transformed. Subtext operates in the laugh, the daydream fold, and the quiet return of delight. No moralizing; the cost (transience, vulnerability) is woven into the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "exposed film made architectural," phosphorescent pigments, the fog tasted. Diction stays consistent with an artist's lexicon without jargon excess. The daydream sequence is clearly framed as liminal ("within the fold of a daydream"), avoiding head-hopping. Rhythmic control under pressure: the short laugh, the projector setup, the floating orchard. POV distance remains stable; no filter-verb stacks. Minor note: "light-painted" and similar compounds recur but serve voice rather than clog.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>High information density: most lines do double work (e.g., fog as sensory detail and thematic vehicle). No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Sentence openings vary; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Minor figurative density in the opening third ("fog had owned," "sensitive surfaces") is purposeful and voice-consistent. The "exposed film" metaphor anchors early and recurs transformed at closure. Propulsion is clean; no template cadence. One slight register drift: "collaboratively maintained archive" reads slightly elevated mid-paragraph but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premise synthesizes mural art, phosphorescent materials, ruin exploration, and collaborative archiving into a fresh whole. The light-painting technique is specific and verifiable. Emotional truth (joy's return after loss) avoids generic templates through the daydream mechanism and transience acceptance. The fog-as-lens and fragment-as-seed are non-obvious. Risk: committing to a quiet, textural ending without dramatic confrontation. Slight dock: the "exposed film" conceit, while apt, carries faint echoes of photography metaphors in literary fiction; transformation through the civic-duty and network-sharing angles restores freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Luma's choices create the key turn: she moves from passive observation to active projection and documentation. Setup early; development in the daydream and projector beats; closure participation direct. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong. Specificity high (phosphorescent pigments, portable projector).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fresco fragment appears in discovery beat, triggers the daydream, anchors the projector placement, and remains in the final image as the durable counterpoint to transience. Three distinct beats; closure linkage clear. Irreplaceability high: its survival and "stubbornly remembered word" phrasing charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Exposed film concept frames Luma's practice early ("Critics...called her work 'exposed film made architectural'") and returns transformed in the epiphany ("Joy...was exposed film—it needed light...and...to be shared"). Two beats: framing and closure insight. Cost connection: the transience and sharing requirement. Mid-band: the concept shapes theme more than tactics; it does not narrow options in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paints-with-light trait established early, used in the projector action, and charges the closure image (the floating orchard). Two beats; closure participation strong. Constrains method: she must use projector and pigments, not traditional paint. Cost: battery life and transience. Specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Display action (projecting the orchard) is the climactic turn, redefining her stance from seeking to creating/sharing. Setup via practice description; development implicit in carrying the projector; closure direct. Causal pressure: the action forecloses hoarding. Cost visible: the work will vanish. Irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Knowledge network explained early, used to find the workshop (causal role in setup), and returns at closure (documentation choice). Two beats; closure linkage present but softer. Method matters: without it, no discovery or sharing path. Mid-band: the mechanics are told rather than dramatized; the final mention is brief.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Ruined orchard district frames the entire piece, supplies the fresco and fog, and charges the final image. Setup immediate; development throughout (fog scatters light, ruin isolates); closure direct. Micro-setting (workshop interior, ivy, calcium deposits) alters tactics. Irreplaceability high: the setting's decay and fog are integral to the ephemeral-art theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Daydream timeframe named and used as the mechanism for the vision beat. Setup implicit (she arrives seeking); development in the daydream fold; closure indirect (the vision informs the projection). One strong causal beat. Mid-band: the daydream is a single moment rather than a tightening clock; it does not pressure other choices beyond triggering the projector action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation to rediscover joy stated early, dramatized in the fresco response (throat tightening, laugh), and resolved at closure (delight returns). Three beats; closure linkage strong. Friction visible: joy left "the way fog leaves a valley," and the search involves accepting transience. Cost connection clear. Specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pensive-mirth tone established early ("small, pensive laugh, almost a question"), modulates through the daydream (wonder), and charges the ending ("quiet, like a tree deciding...to bloom"). Coherent across beats. The tone fits the stakes (loss and return) and supports the textural lens. Minor: the phrase "pensive mirth" itself is not on the page, but the effect is sustained.</comment>
