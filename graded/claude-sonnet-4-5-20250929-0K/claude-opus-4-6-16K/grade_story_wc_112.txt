<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-specific, with grief sharpening rather than breaking her reasoning. Her motivation to prove lateral temporality is embodied through the nexus construction and operationalized in twelve-minute windows. The renunciation of reversing time in favor of proving adjacency creates genuine internal complexity. Minor slip: the "mechanically warm hum...that vibrated in her molars and sternum" reads slightly over-articulated for peak technical focus, though it doesn't flatten the closure choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece accumulates through velith observation, nexus activation, data capture, and the waveform recognition, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise + Earned Stasis hybrid) where Maren's proof crystallizes options with visible cost: publishing will expose her grief-driven methodology. The magnetospheric alignment constraint and twelve-minute window tighten pressure. One slight friction: the velith's sympathetic stirring during nexus activation hints at causal linkage but remains ornamental to Maren's arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kepler-442b's perpetual twilight and slow rotation create atmospheric specificity. The transparent observation deck floor and Sublevel 7's vacuum chamber are spatially coherent and purposeful. The magnetic nexus constrains Maren's experimental window to twelve minutes during magnetospheric alignment, directly shaping her tactical choices. The velith migration functions as both setting pressure and thematic mirror. Minor gap: the station's internal geography (spiral staircase, sublevel numbering) is clean but doesn't constrain a pivotal choice beyond providing workspace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving lateral temporality to validate that Elise's seventeen seconds persist adjacently. The twelve-minute alignment window creates immediate tactical pressure. The nexus activation sequence escalates through power-up, lever pull, holographic collapse/expansion, and waveform resolution—each beat narrowing options and raising interpretive cost. The closure reconfigures Maren's stance from private obsession to public declaration via the paper title and acknowledgment, foreclosing retreat with professional and emotional exposure. The velith's temporal-gradient navigation enriches thematic texture without diluting the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of grief, scientific rigor, and the holographic principle that nothing is truly gone—only adjacent. The "subdued awakenings...arrive like frost forming on glass" image perfectly captures the quiet validation Maren seeks. The velith navigating temporal gradients functions as natural metaphor without forced symbolism. The acknowledgment line "For Elise, who is not behind me, but beside me" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The piece resists tidy closure while making the conceptual cost of publication—exposing grief as methodology—undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains tightly controlled through Maren's technical and emotional lens. Perceptual signature is consistent: "mechanically warm," "frozen breath," "sideways proof" filter sensory input through her engineer's precision and grief-sharpened focus. Narrative certainty stays calibrated; the waveform recognition reads as inference ("looked like sound, like a voice, like a laugh") rather than omniscient declaration. Diction remains within Maren's technical lexicon without register drift. One minor slip: "cathedral of glass and titanium" in the opening leans slightly toward tourist catalog before the POV fully locks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances technical procedure, emotional state, or thematic resonance. Rhythm modulates effectively from the opening velith observation through nexus activation to the quiet post-experiment reflection. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. The "mechanically warm hum" phrase recurs purposefully across two beats to anchor sensory memory. Minor friction: "She had twelve minutes each cycle to prove what she believed: that time moves sideways" lands as slight scaffold—the colon construction over-explicates what the subsequent narration will demonstrate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "time moves sideways" premise offers a fresh inflection on grief-and-physics narratives by rejecting reversal in favor of adjacency. Holographic encoding of temporal information via magnetic interference synthesizes speculative physics with emotional specificity. The velith as temporal-gradient navigators provide non-obvious biological corroboration. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging. Slight deduction: the "cathedral of glass and titanium" and "living sail of bioluminescent membrane" descriptions, while vivid, trend toward familiar SFF lyricism without transforming the tropes through Maren's specific grief-engineer lens as effectively as later beats do.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's obliging nature is established early ("never refused a task, never complained") and her hidden motivation recontextualizes that compliance as strategic cover. Her decision to activate the nexus, pull the lever, and ultimately write the paper creates two key turns: technical proof and professional exposure. However, the "obliging" trait itself doesn't constrain the climactic choice—her grief and scientific conviction drive the lever pull, not her habitual accommodation. Present across beats but not indispensable to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus appears in setup (construction mentioned, vacuum chamber described), development (powered, lever pulled, fields collapsed/expanded, holographic pattern resolved), and payoff (data saved, paper titled). It enables the waveform detection that validates Maren's theory and constrains her experiment to twelve-minute windows. The device's specific mechanics—superconducting rings, dimensional encoding, holographic interference—are irreplaceable; no near-synonym could substitute. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Misses 9.0+ because the nexus itself doesn't impose a visible cost at closure—Maren's choice to publish does.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Subdued awakenings" frames the story's tonal expectation in the opening and returns explicitly at closure: "Subdued awakenings don't arrive with fanfare. They arrive like frost forming on glass—silent, intricate, undeniable." The concept shapes Maren's emotional arc from private obsession to quiet validation, altering her tactics from secrecy to publication. It charges the final image by making the proof's understated nature thematically coherent. The concept is signaled early, developed through the nexus activation's lack of pyrotechnics, and pays off in the acknowledgment line and paper submission.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Mechanically warm" appears twice: the nexus hum "not hot, not cold, but something in between that vibrated in her molars and sternum" and later "mechanically warm vibrations still humming in her chest." The attribute provides sensory specificity and recurs to anchor Maren's embodied memory. However, it doesn't constrain an on-page action or impose cost—it enriches texture without altering tactics. Functional across two beats but replaceable with another synesthetic descriptor. Lyric reprise without middle causal involvement caps scoring in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lever pull is the story's decisive physical act: "She pulled it, and the magnetic fields collapsed inward, then expanded in a pattern that shouldn't have been geometrically possible." It triggers the holographic interference that produces the lateral temporal readings and waveform resolution. Maren's manual override choice ("she didn't trust automated systems") personalizes the action. The lever is present in setup (installation mentioned), executed at the climax, and its consequence (data capture) enables the closure decision to publish. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; removing the lever would require complete rewrite of the experimental sequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Holographic principles" are signaled early ("encode information holographically across dimensional boundaries"), shape the experimental design (magnetic fields creating holographic interference, "lattice of light that looked like frozen breath"), and enable the data interpretation ("holographic pattern resolved into something coherent"). The method constrains Maren's approach—she needs intersecting magnetic fields of precise geometry. It appears in the paper title at closure. However, the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; the reader doesn't see Maren adjust holographic parameters or troubleshoot interference patterns on the page, limiting felt tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station provides the magnetospheric alignment necessary for the nexus (setup), houses Sublevel 7 where the experiment occurs (development), and its orbital position creates the twelve-minute window constraint (pressure). The station's location on Kepler-442b enables velith observation, which led Maren to choose this posting after reading Dr. Huang's paper. Spatial choreography is clean (observation deck → spiral staircase → Sublevel 7 → back up). The setting's specific properties (atmospheric sensors, hull breaches from velith collisions) enrich verisimilitude. Strong integration across beats and ending, though the station's constraints are temporal/positional rather than spatial/resource-based.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Within the hush of beating wings at rest" anchors the opening's temporal moment and establishes the velith's quiescence during Maren's experimental window. The twelve-minute alignment window creates tactical pressure (must activate, capture data, and power down within that span). However, the "hush" itself doesn't track as a live clock—we see the nexus power-up and data capture, but no second-by-second pressure or explicit moment when the hush ends. The timeframe is functional in setup and creates backdrop pressure but doesn't tighten decisions beat-by-beat. Mid-range for present-but-not-decisive temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to prove lateral temporality is established early ("designed to generate intersecting magnetic fields...that time moves sideways"), dramatized through the nexus construction and activation, and crystallized in her choice to publish despite professional vulnerability ("grief had not broken her reasoning, only sharpened it"). The motivation is conflicted: she rejects time reversal ("She wasn't building a machine to undo death") in favor of proving adjacency, revealing both acceptance and refusal. Visible cost: exposing her grief-driven methodology in "Lateral Temporality: Evidence for Orthogonal Time via Holographic Magnetic Interference." Strong setup, middle pressure, and closure linkage with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Icy warmth" modulates across the story: the opening's "perpetual twilight" and station "catching" light establish cool luminosity; "mechanically warm" hum provides the warm note; "frozen breath" lattice and "icy warmth" of the lateral echo synthesize the oxymoron explicitly. The tone charges the final image: "mechanically warm vibrations still humming in her chest" as she writes the paper. Coherent through turns and purposefully paradoxical, matching the story's central tension between grief's cold loss and validation's quiet heat. Strong integration, though the explicit "icy warmth" label arrives late (past midpoint), limiting tactical constraint in earlier beats.</comment>
