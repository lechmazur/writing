<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular, rooted in her map-framing profession; her attention to care over perception shows specificity. The discovery of the underdrawing drives a meaningful choice to document revelation rather than just damage, with embodied tension ("she sat back"). Internal contradiction is present but mild—her methodical nature coexists with growing emotional engagement—and the final threshold pause demonstrates earned alteration. No secondary character pressure or dialogue limits relational crucible work, but the solo-POV execution remains clean and motivated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: rain's slow work → video comparison → underdrawing discovery → map of revelations → threshold exit, with each beat deepening the concept of silence-as-scream. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's threshold pause and decision to let silence hold what words cannot reweights her prior documentary stance with conceptual cost (she accepts incompleteness). The cost is felt in her restraint and the chapel's acoustic containment. One meaningful tightening (the underdrawing reveal) sufficiently escalates under the Accumulative lens, and the final image charges prior motifs (silence, whisper, rain).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The vault's henge stones, rain-worked plaster, and acoustic properties constrain Maren's perception and choices throughout. The stones "swallowed sound," the frescoes' damage guides her task, and the chapel's acoustics shape her final decision to withhold speech. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through professional attention (cup-and-ring marks, sarsen pillars). The micro-setting—her laptop between pillars, the threshold at story's end—charges the closure by making silence a tactile, spatial force. Environment is not ornamental; it actively shapes her interpretive stance and final act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: document what rain has taken, which evolves into documenting what it reveals. The underdrawing discovery (woman's cry painted over) tightens pressure by reframing her task from loss-mapping to truth-recovery. Maren's agency is decision and attention; she saves the timestamp and begins a new map, foreclosing the purely technical role. The cost is visible: she chooses documentation over speech, accepting the chapel's containment. One meaningful deepening—her realization that "silence was not always peace"—narrows options and charges the ending under the Accumulative lens. No antagonist required; the vault's revelations provide coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: silence as concealment versus revelation, care as a form of witness, and the honest underdrawing beneath sanctioned beauty. The underdrawing's scream-then-silencing anchors the conceptual question without stating a moral. Maren's final choice—to let silence hold rather than articulate—offers a non-literal answer that reweights her documentary stance with embodied restraint. The map metaphor (known/unknown, tear/frontier) recurs purposefully, and the ending image (stepping into rain, shielded and open) resonates without thesis. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the closure; earned wisdom arises from her discovery on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and clean, filtered through Maren's professional lens ("maps were just another way of saying: here is where the world holds, and here is where it breaks"). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices borders, margins, frontiers, and technical anchors (sarsen, cup-and-ring marks). Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated; no register drift or filter-verb stacks. One brief slip: "she understood why the chapel had earned its name the moment she descended" reads slightly expository when the acoustics could be dramatized more immediately. No dialogue, so naturalism bullets do not apply. Psychic distance is intentional and modulates appropriately at the threshold pause, tightening focus for the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive and dense, with high information load per sentence and no paraphrase loops. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template cadence. The opening metaphor ("the way grief works a face—slowly, then all at once") is vivid and coherent, setting textural tone. Minor figurative density in the opening third (rain/grief, maps/frontiers, silence/breath) is pattern-taught and pays off at closure, so no overwriting penalty applies. The "shielded and open in equal measure" closing phrase is precise and character-specific. No scaffolding, synonym churn, or filter-verb stacks; grammar and sequencing are clean. One hairline note: "she would include it in her conservation report, but she also began sketching a new map" could tighten by cutting "but she also."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—comparing silent video footage to chart fresco damage—feels specific and non-obvious, transformed through Maren's map-framing lens. The underdrawing reveal (serene face concealing a scream) offers fresh insight into silence as erasure rather than peace. The vault's acoustic properties and henge stones anchor originality in verifiable detail without quirky ornament. Risk-taking is moderate: the quiet, accumulative structure and threshold ending trust the reader to infer cost. The synthesis of conservation work, acoustic silence, and emotional honesty reads inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of famous images, and the emotional truth avoids generic templates. One point of friction: the "terra incognita" cartographic trope is familiar, though Maren's professional application personalizes it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (perceptive map framer) is signaled early and drives key turns: she compares footage (setup), discovers the underdrawing mid-story (development), and chooses to document revelation over loss, then withholds speech at the threshold (closure). Her professional perception enables the underdrawing discovery, and her decision to sketch "a new map" alters her interpretive stance with visible cost. Three distinct beats; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Specificity is high (her care-over-perception distinction, methodical frame-by-frame work). Swappability is low; a generic conservator would not frame the discovery through cartographic metaphor or the care/attention duality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ancient henge stones appear in setup (pillars with cup-and-ring marks between which Maren sets her laptop) and at closure (they "hummed at some frequency below hearing" as she exits). They enable the vault's acoustic properties, which shape her final choice. Two beats, but middle development is thin—stones are described more than causally active mid-story. Closure linkage is present (the hum charges her threshold pause). Moderate specificity (sarsen, Neolithic marks), but the stones could be replaced with other ancient pillars without breaking plot logic. Lyric reprise (early description → final hum) reweights silence but does not impose a direct tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The whispered chapel (core concept) is signaled in the opening third, shapes Maren's descent and work environment (middle: the acoustics dissolve her footsteps and explain why no audio equipment functioned), and determines her final choice to withhold speech. Three beats with strong causal pressure: the acoustics are not ornamental but constrain her documentary method and ending action. Closure linkage is decisive—her decision to "let the silence hold what words could not" is only legible because the chapel returns speech as whisper. High specificity and irreplaceability; removing the acoustic property would break the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Methodically curious is introduced early ("She was methodically curious by nature, the kind of person who would spend three hours realigning a single border") and enables her frame-by-frame comparison (middle). At closure, her curiosity drives the underdrawing discovery and the decision to sketch a new map. Two beats, moderate causal pressure. The trait constrains her approach (meticulous comparison rather than summary assessment) and charges her final interpretive shift. Swappability is moderate—"attentive" or "careful" could substitute with minor edits. Cost is present but oblique: her methodical nature delays broad conclusions, forcing her into deeper engagement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reopen" is signaled early ("reopen an investigation that was not, technically, an investigation") and structures the entire task: compare 2001 footage to current footage. It enables the underdrawing discovery (middle: only by reopening/comparing does the erasure become visible) and generates the closure choice (she reopens the interpretive frame from loss to revelation). Two to three beats; strong causal pressure. Swappability is low—without the comparison premise, the underdrawing discovery lacks mechanism. Closure linkage is strong: her new map is a literal reopening of the documentation task with altered stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method (comparing silent video footage from decades apart) is signaled early, demonstrated in the middle beat (left screen 2001, right screen now; angel's mouth gone, saint's hand fading), and enables the underdrawing discovery that drives closure. Three beats with high causal pressure: the method is not summary-only but shown in action, and its mechanics matter (silent video, no audio, frame-by-frame). Closure linkage is decisive—without the comparison, Maren never sees the preliminary cry. High specificity and irreplaceability; the silent-video constraint ties to the chapel's acoustic properties, creating thematic coherence. Visible cost: the method's slowness forces prolonged attention.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault is present throughout: rain's forty-year damage frames the task (setup), the plaster's degradation reveals the underdrawing (middle), and Maren steps into rain at closure. Three beats; the vault's material state constrains her work and supplies the key resource (eroded pigment exposing truth). Closure linkage is strong: the vault's revelations justify her interpretive shift, and stepping into rain mirrors acceptance of ongoing change. High specificity (limestone seams, porous plaster, water's slow work). Swappability is low—a dry vault would eliminate the discovery mechanism and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe (at the spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown) is metaphorical rather than literal but is signaled early and recurs at the underdrawing discovery: "the exact margin she thought of privately as the tear in the map, the line dividing documented from undocumented." It shapes one key turn (the frontier runs through the woman's throat, prompting deeper inquiry) and charges the closure (her new map redefines the tear as a site of revelation). Two beats, moderate causal pressure. Swappability is moderate—the "frontier" or "threshold" could substitute. Lyric reprise reweights the concept but does not impose a live deadline or tighten time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To interpret silence with empathy" is introduced mid-story ("To interpret silence with empathy, she realized, meant understanding that silence was not always peace") and directly shapes the closure choice: she withholds speech, letting silence hold meaning. Two beats (realization + enactment), strong causal pressure at the end. The motivation is dramatized through her discovery (the silenced scream) and enacted in her threshold pause. Friction is present: empathy requires restraint, not articulation, which costs her the satisfaction of naming what she found. Swappability is low—removing this interpretive lens would flatten the ending into mere documentation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Shielded openness (tone) is established early through the chapel's acoustic containment (sound swallowed and returned as murmur, "prayers entered the air and came back as breath") and sustained through Maren's measured, attentive narration. The tone modulates at the underdrawing discovery (wonder, recognition) and charges the closure image: "shielded and open in equal measure" explicitly names the tonal stance as she exits. Three beats; coherent through turns. The tone is not static—it tightens from documentary neutrality to emotional resonance—and the final phrase makes the tone's dual quality legible and essential. High specificity and irreplaceability; the phrase reconfigures the chapel's acoustic metaphor into a lived ethical stance.</comment>
