<comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular: she collects fragments and they displace her own chronology. The embodied moment of the camera wheel cracking something inside her chest is specific, and the ghost as peripheral presence avoids cliché. Internal contradiction operates well—she stopped wanting to remember yet hasn't fully stopped—but the final stance (keep collecting until the ghost speaks) reads more as persistent state than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Minor slip: "the vocabulary she needed to negotiate with her own ghost" edges toward therapeutic abstraction.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors (Maren, lagoon edge, post-carousel halt) land cleanly by paragraph three. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments accrue, the camera wheel reweights her collection impulse, and the final image (pocketing the wheel, resolving to collect) offers Charged Poise—options crystallize with undeniable pressure. Cost is felt but oblique: she will remain a scavenger feeding the ghost rather than confronting the dissolution directly. The tightening is meaningful but subtle; a sharper on-page trade-off (what she forgoes by continuing to collect) would clarify the price and lift this into the 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The kinetic lagoon, halted carousel, and alkaline mineral deposits are vivid and specific. The camera wheel as micro-setting object constrains her choice: its barnacled state mirrors her corroded life, and pocketing it becomes the gesture that charges the ending. Sensory detail (vapor against boots, churning eddies) is purposeful and filtered through her scavenger's attention. The setting supplies both resource (the wheel) and atmosphere (fractured stillness) that drive the final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—negotiating terms with the ghost of her younger, ambitious self—is signaled early and accumulates through fragment-collection and the camera wheel discovery. One meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes that other people's sorrows have rooted in her own chronology, making the ghost negotiation necessary. Agency is present (she chooses to keep collecting), but the ending is Charged Poise rather than a decision that forecloses a visible path; the cost (remaining a scavenger, deferring confrontation) is felt but not sharply dramatized as a trade-off in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—eroded ambitions and the haunting of unlived futures—emerges from the halted carousel, corroded camera wheel, and collected fragments without overt statement. The final image (pocketing the wheel, listening for the next sentence) offers a resonant answer: the ghost won't speak directly, so Maren brokers meaning through borrowed words and relics. Subtext operates well in the shutter-click heard inside her chronology. The piece resists tidy resolution; ambition doesn't return whole, and the negotiation remains open with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Maren notices rust, mineral deposits, toothed plastic—scavenger details filtered through her temporal confusion. Diction and syntax ("the tenses tangled in her mind like wet rope," "the practical mathematics of survival") carry consistent texture. The reflection-heavy design remains anchored to present stimuli (the wheel, the lagoon, the ghost at the periphery) and each memory block tilts her present stance. POV stays stable; no head-hopping. Minor density in the middle risks slight momentum drag, but voice control under lyric pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "the altitude did something to memory, or maybe it was the stories" establishes both setting and stake). Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (carousel ribs, wet rope, ghost vocabulary) is coherent and voice-motivated. Two small loops: "She had owned disposable cameras once. Dozens of them" followed immediately by restating the documentarian ambition; and "stopped carrying a camera… stopped looking… stopped remembering" reads as template cadence across three beats. These prevent entry to the 8.5+ band but don't obscure closure. Propulsion is steady, if occasionally meditative.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—chronological confusion from altitude and overheard stories as both symptom and method of negotiating with one's ghost—is specific and non-obvious. The camera wheel as both relic and currency feels inevitable in hindsight. The piece commits fully to its lyric, accumulative design without retreat. Risk-taking (temporal fluidity, ghost as peripheral negotiation partner) heightens stakes and coherence. A slight proximity to "haunted by younger self" templates is offset by the particular mechanics (fragment collection, tense confusion) and the kinetic lagoon setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Maren's resolute stance ("She would keep collecting until the ghost agreed to speak") is signaled early, developed through her scavenging and fragment-listening, and crystallizes at closure when she pockets the wheel and moves along the lagoon edge. Her choices (crouching at the edge, pulling the wheel, pocketing it, continuing to collect) shape the narrative arc and enable the final Charged Poise moment. Cost is present but oblique: she forgoes confrontation in favor of continued accumulation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The camera wheel appears in two distinct beats: discovery ("she pulled a small object from the shallows") and closure ("She pocketed the wheel"). Its physical state (yellow, cracked, barnacled) mirrors her corroded ambitions. The wheel's teeth pressed against her thumb trigger the shutter-click memory, linking past promise to present negotiation. It charges the final image by becoming the currency of her barter with the ghost. Specificity (disposable camera wheel, the toothed disc that advanced film) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Eroded ambitions shape stakes throughout: "The ambitions had not vanished all at once. They had eroded…" drives Maren's need to negotiate with her ghost. The concept alters tactics—she collects fragments as vocabulary for negotiation rather than documenting the world. It constrains her present (scavenging for survival) and charges the closure (the ghost offering back "one frame of possibility" for each fragment). Cost is undeniable: she has become what she didn't mean to be, and the ending accepts that corrosion while seeking terms within it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Chronological confusion is signaled early ("the tenses tangled in her mind like wet rope," "Chronology had become unreliable") and constrains her perception: fragments lodge in her mind with displaced time-stamps, making her unable to parse memory from promise. It enables her fragment-collection method (other people's sorrows root easily in loosened chronology) and charges the shutter-click ambiguity at closure. The trait is more than label, but its cost is conceptual rather than forcing a visible on-page trade-off in a specific action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Regret operates as both past action (the photographs she never took, the ambitions she let erode) and present driver: "I regret the photographs I never took more than the ones I lost" becomes part of her collection and fuels the negotiation. It shapes her scavenging (looking for vocabulary to speak to the ghost) and the closure choice (keep collecting as a form of barter). The action is distinct—this isn't generic loss but specifically unfulfilled documentation—and can't be easily swapped. It's causal but not the sole pivot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Fragment-collection is signaled early ("She collected fragments of overheard stories"), mechanics are clarified (whispered exchanges, half-sentences from camps she never entered), and the method matters: fragments displace her chronology and become the currency for ghost negotiation. It shapes her present tactics (moving along the lagoon's edge, listening) and the closure stance ("keep collecting until the ghost agreed to speak"). The barter system (one frame of possibility per fragment) makes the method indispensable. Two beats show active collection; the ending cements it as ongoing strategy.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The kinetic lagoon and halted carousel frame the piece (opening and recurring imagery) and supply the camera wheel. The setting's "fractured stillness" and "directionless eddies" mirror Maren's state and charge the atmosphere. The lagoon is where the ghost appears most often and where Maren scavenges, making it integral to her method. It constrains her spatially (she moves along its edge) and metaphorically (purposeless motion). The setting shapes mood and supplies resources but doesn't force a tactical choice in a high-pressure moment; it's essential backdrop rather than dynamic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The timeframe ("after the carousel halts") anchors the present and establishes the shift from purposeful rotation to recursive stillness. It's signaled immediately and recurs ("since the carousel halted," "The carousel would not turn again"). The halt creates the fractured stillness in which the ghost appears and Maren's chronological confusion intensifies. It doesn't tighten decisions with a live clock but does mark a before/after that charges the ending's acceptance: the carousel won't turn, but she'll keep collecting. Present as causal frame; less as escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The motivation to negotiate with her ghost is dramatized through her fragment-collection, the camera wheel discovery, and the internal dialogue ("I did not mean to let you dissolve. […] what would you have done differently?"). Friction between wants (speak to the ghost, retrieve ambition) and costs (remaining a scavenger, deferring confrontation) is palpable. The ghost as peripheral presence and the barter system (fragments for frames of possibility) make the negotiation concrete. The closure stance (keep collecting until the ghost speaks) locks in the motivation with visible cost, though the negotiation itself remains open.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Fractured stillness is coherent throughout: the lagoon's directionless eddies, the carousel's frozen ribs, Maren's tangled tenses and recursive thoughts. Tone modulates subtly—slightly sharper when she recognizes the camera wheel, quieter in the barter reflection—without breaking the overarching mood. The final image ("The lagoon churned its purposeless circles… Maren moved along its edge") charges stillness with resolve, making the tone inseparable from closure. Diction and rhythm (sentence fragments, parenthetical asides, looped phrasing) embody the fractured quality without obscuring clarity.</comment>
