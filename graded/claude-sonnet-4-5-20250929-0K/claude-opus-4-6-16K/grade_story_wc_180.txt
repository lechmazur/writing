<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion shown through her work-focused lens ("wrapped it around the quartz eye, creating a soft cradle between her fingers"). The discovery of her grandmother's diagrams provides motivation that feels earned rather than convenient, and her decision to teach Elsa carries visible cost (accepting the fight ahead). Minor slip: Elsa's "endearingly feisty" reads slightly externalized rather than fully dramatized through her actions, though her climbing and insistence do show agency. The relationship pressure between mother and daughter meaningfully shapes the ending choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Maren commits to persist, teach, and fight using the discovered pre-patent methods, foreclosing easier paths (descent, negotiation). The causal lens holds clearly—breach triggers flight to cathedral, daughter's visit prompts bag examination, diagrams provide legal/craft foundation for the teaching decision. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first 15% (orchard-cathedral, Maren's platform, her craft, the Syndicate conflict). One meaningful tightening occurs when the diagrams shift Maren's stance from pure stubbornness to grounded persistence with transmissible knowledge. Cost is legible: she accepts ongoing conflict and the work of teaching rather than resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral setting is vivid and purposeful throughout: roots through marble, branches across vaulted ceiling, platform lashed between oaks establish both beauty and precarity that mirror Maren's situation. The micro-setting of the work platform shapes action (Elsa must climb the rope, the light quality affects Maren's work). The bag's contents function as object-as-setting, constraining her methods and enabling the resolution. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (dusty light through rose windows, honest light). The cathedral's ruined state provides both literal refuge and thematic resonance for knowledge that outlasts institutions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving craft autonomy and transmitting knowledge) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the bag contents shift Maren from defensive retreat to active resistance with legal grounding. The tightening forecloses the path of pure stubbornness-without-foundation and the path of abandoning the craft. Elsa's arrival and challenge provide relationship pressure that tests Maren's stance. The resolution is earned by Maren's agency (opening the bag, recognizing the diagrams' significance, choosing to teach) with visible cost (accepting ongoing conflict). No antagonist appears on-page, but the Syndicate pressure remains coherent through Elsa's letter and Maren's responses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: generational knowledge transmission, institutional vs. familial ownership of craft, persistence under adverse conditions. The "deciduous vow" concept is earned through the specific image rather than stated directly, and the final teaching moment provides a resonant answer to the question of how wisdom survives legal and institutional assault. The orchard-in-cathedral image carries consistent metaphoric weight (knowledge growing through/despite ruins) without becoming allegorical. Subtext operates in Elsa's practical help (offering the ribbon before asking to be taught) and Maren's gradual opening of the bag she'd carried unopened. No moralizing or thematic echo in the ending; the teaching act itself reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance through Maren's perceptual signature (craft-focused, filtering environment through her work). Dialogue feels natural and advances plot: Elsa's challenge forces Maren's response, her ribbon offer demonstrates practical wisdom. Voice is distinct with controlled diction that matches Maren's educated, artisan perspective without register drift. The prose modulates appropriately with emotional beats—clipped exchanges during tension, expansive when examining the diagrams. No head-hopping; Elsa's interiority is accessed only through externals. Minor slip: "endearingly feisty" slightly breaks POV modesty (whose endorsement?).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean with high information density and purposeful rhythm. Opening line establishes voice and stakes immediately. Sentence variety supports momentum without template cadence. Figurative language (roots threading marble, cherry trees with ambitions) is fresh and constrained to setup. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. The ribbon sequence shows strategic telling that compresses transit. Spatial choreography tracks clearly (platform, rope, bag contents). Modest filter-verb use ("she'd forgotten," "murmured") fits the reflective moments without stacking. The final image ("honest light") recharges the opening's dusty-light motif without overstatement. Zero scaffold artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral fusion is a specific, memorable synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight and shapes all major story elements. The quartz-eye mending craft is distinctive and well-integrated with the generational transmission theme. Trope transformation: the "lost knowledge in old papers" setup is elevated by the specific craft detail and the mother-daughter teaching dynamic that provides emotional grounding. The breach-of-contract frame gives institutional teeth to what could have been generic mentor-student material. Minor limitation: the "workshop in ruins/cathedral refuge" and "wise grandmother's forgotten papers" elements draw from familiar templates, though execution personalizes them. No close echoes of famous scenes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren shapes all major turns: choosing the cathedral refuge, opening the bag after Elsa's prompt, recognizing the diagrams' significance, deciding to teach. Her craft identity constrains her methods and frames her resistance. Present throughout, drives causality, and charges the closure choice. Irreplaceable—the quartz-eye specificity grounds both conflict and resolution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ribbon appears in two distinct functional beats: Elsa offers it, Maren uses it to stabilize the eye and discovers forgotten technique. Returns with reweighted meaning in the teaching decision (the ribbon that helped her see becomes bridge to teaching). Charges the closure by demonstrating practical intergenerational exchange before the explicit teaching begins. Could score higher with explicit mention in final paragraph, but causal work is strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present in final paragraph as the core metaphor for knowledge that "sheds leaves in winter...but always returns green." Shapes Maren's final understanding and the teaching decision. However, introduced very late (final third) and functions more as thematic articulation than stake-shaper or choice-constraint. Lyric resonance is strong but it does not pressure middle beats. Fits the accidental-wisdom tone but remains more theme-echo than causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elsa demonstrates the trait through climbing despite prohibition, challenging her mother's plan, offering practical help. "Feisty" enables her rope-climb agency and the confrontation that triggers the bag examination. However, "endearingly" reads as external endorsement rather than cost-bearing trait, and the attribute could be replaced with "persistent" or "determined" without structural change. Present in two beats but swappable reduces irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Persistence is the dominant action from opening (refused to come down) through closure (teaching choice). The discovered diagrams provide tools for persisting with foundation rather than pure stubbornness, transforming the action's meaning. Maren's entire arc is persist-refuse-persist-with-wisdom. Shapes all major beats and is indispensable to closure. Charged by the contrast between passive endurance and active transmission.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bag signaled early (opening paragraph: "nothing but the old leather bag"), used minimally until the middle turn when Elsa's ribbon prompts Maren to open it. Contents (diagrams, tools, compound) provide both legal proof and teaching material that enable the resolution. The method matters mechanically—unencumbered pre-patent knowledge solves the institutional problem. Could score higher if the bag's significance were hinted earlier, but the "carried for years without knowing" beat makes the discovery feel earned rather than convenient.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cathedral-orchard setting is introduced immediately, frames all action, and provides both literal refuge and thematic resonance. The platform position shapes Elsa's rope-climb action. The environment supplies apples, light quality for work, and the specific ruined-church/living-orchard image that charges the final teaching moment. Constraints are implicit (isolation, precarity) rather than forcing a discrete tactical choice, but the setting's metaphoric and practical roles are indispensable. Appears in closure image and shapes tone throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Breach triggers the entire plot (six weeks ago, seizure of workshop) and establishes the Syndicate conflict. Timeframe creates urgency (ongoing legal pressure, daughter's visit with new letter). However, after the opening exposition, time functions as backdrop rather than live ticking clock. No mid-scene deadline tightens tactics. The "after" positioning is structural but the duration between breach and present action does not constrain Maren's choices on the page. Present in two beats (setup, Elsa's letter) but not at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Generational-wisdom motivation is dramatized through Maren's reflections on grandmother and mother, the bag's contents, and the final teaching choice. Friction appears when Maren initially resists opening the bag she's carried. The desire becomes action when she spreads diagrams and commits to teach Elsa. Charges the closure directly. Could score higher if the motivation faced sharper on-page obstacle (e.g., Elsa resisting or competing pressure), but the internal realization → teaching sequence shows clear want-to-action with visible cost (accepting the longer fight).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accidental-wisdom tone is coherent throughout: Maren discovers the solution in the bag she forgot to examine, Elsa's offhand ribbon use triggers technique memory, grandmother's foresight was unintentional preservation. Tone modulates appropriately from wry stubbornness to surprise to resolve. The final "so Maren did" line maintains the understated register. Charges the ending by making the discovery feel organic rather than contrived. Does not fully control the high-pressure teaching-decision beat (tone there shifts toward earnest resolve), preventing top-band score.</comment>
