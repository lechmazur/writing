<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Miriam's interiority is concrete and character-specific, with her frugality and devotion to the void establishing clear motivations. Her internal contradiction—proving the universe's indifference while organizing her life around devotion—creates genuine tension. The final choice to whisper "I will keep watching" earns its weight through prior causality, though the epiphany about encrypted devotion arrives somewhat easily without deeper resistance. Embodied emotion is present but could be sharper in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation cleanly (Miriam, Esagila palace, dusk) and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens throughout. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Miriam's covenant to keep watching forecloses the path of demanding answers from the void, with the cost legible in her acceptance of sufficiency. The tightening occurs through the discovery sequence, where the tile's warmth and the uncloaking pattern deepen her understanding and crystallize her stance. One minor slip: the ancient astronomers' encrypted devotion is told rather than fully dramatized, slightly weakening the causal chain to her final realization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The reimagined palace is vividly anchored with bronze light, cool stone floors, and schematic wall patterns that constrain Miriam's investigation. The tile as micro-setting object charges the closure—its warmth in her palm and the glowing numerals transform from inert clay to active participant. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through an astronomer's professional lens. The courtyard's recurring appearance bookends the piece effectively, and the spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why the tile hums under starlight—is signaled early and drives Miriam's actions. Pressure accumulates through the discovery sequence: overlaying star charts, placing the tile against schematics, tracing the spiral to the absent center. The tightening is meaningful but gentle; Miriam faces intellectual mystery rather than sharp opposition. The final covenant carries felt cost (accepting sufficiency without reciprocity), though the escalation could have forced a harder trade-off to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The theme of encrypted devotion emerges organically from concrete actions—Miriam's tile placement, the wall patterns, the spiral pointing to absence. The piece resists stating its thesis directly; instead, the final image of whispering to an indifferent void answers the central question through embodied action. The irony that humans encode prayers into empirical observation without the universe's acknowledgment creates genuine complexity. The concept of covenant as human need rather than divine transaction offers a resonant, non-literal thematic answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice carries a distinct intellectual texture with controlled diction ("schematic representations," "empirically demonstrable," "uncloak themselves") that fits Miriam's professional identity. Psychic distance remains stable throughout, with no head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately—more compressed during action, more reflective during discovery. One minor issue: occasional filter verbs ("she realized," "she suspected") slightly dull immediacy in key beats, though they remain voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or discovery. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. However, two paraphrase loops appear: the "empirically demonstrable" irony is restated across two adjacent sentences in paragraph three, and the "encrypted devotion" concept is explained twice in quick succession. Some template cadence in the transcription sequence ("She worked for hours, the tile warm in her palm, the numerals on its face glowing...") slightly flattens momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient Babylonian astronomy, magic squares, and encrypted prayer offers a fresh angle on the scientist-mystic tension. The specific detail of the magic square summing to fifteen (Ishtar's number) and its use as cipher key demonstrates thoughtful research. The transformation test holds—this story requires Miriam's particular frugality and the tile's specific properties. The concept of devotion hidden in star maps to survive regime changes shows genuine ingenuity, though the core arc of scientist finding meaning in the void has precedent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's frugality is established early and shapes her presence in the palace (sleeping in observatories, stretching grant money). However, her choices during the discovery sequence are driven more by curiosity than by frugal constraints. The trait appears in setup and colors her character but doesn't create key tactical pressure or turns in the core beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tile appears in at least four distinct beats: discovery mention, placement against schematics, warmth during transcription, and return to satchel. Its specific properties (cuneiform numerals, cipher function, warmth/glow under starlight) drive the uncloaking action and charge the closure. The evolving physical state (faint hum → warmth → glow) tracks causally and the final reprise carries reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Encrypted devotion shapes Miriam's understanding and stakes throughout. The concept is dramatized through the tile-cipher mechanics, the wall pattern overlay, and the spiral pointing to absence. It directly enables her final covenant choice and reconfigures her relationship to the void. The phrase appears explicitly but is earned through concrete discovery rather than merely thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The empirical irony (proving indifference while practicing devotion) is established early and constrains Miriam's worldview. It creates visible tension in her response to the tile's mystery—she "would not start now" believing in magic. The trait enables her recognition of ancient astronomers facing the same paradox. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than forcing a hard on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Uncloaking is the central action that reveals the hidden constellation and drives the major turn. The tile placement triggers stars "brightening in her perception," Miriam traces the spiral, and transcribes the cipher. This action is irreplaceable—the entire discovery sequence and thematic revelation depend on it. The mechanics are specific enough that swapping for a generic "decode" would require substantial restructuring.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Schematic representations are signaled early (wall patterns, Babylonian cosmos dome), used as the substrate for overlaying star charts, and provide the surface against which the tile functions. The method shapes Miriam's investigative tactics and appears in multiple beats. While integral, the schematics function more as setting infrastructure than as a constraint that creates pressure or alters choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The palace setting is established in the opening and provides the walls, courtyard, and ziggurat windows essential to the discovery. "Between regimes, belonging to no one" creates permission for Miriam's unsupervised investigation. The cool stone floor and bronze light contribute to atmosphere. However, the setting enables rather than pressures—no palace feature creates tactical difficulty or alters Miriam's approach with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "between regimes" timeframe is signaled early and provides thematic resonance (devotion surviving transitions). It explains the palace's accessibility and connects to the ancient astronomers' encrypted survival strategy. However, the timeframe doesn't create urgency or constrain Miriam's investigation—she works for hours without external pressure. Present thematically but not tactically active.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sealing a covenant with the unknown is Miriam's core motivation, established through her nightly devotion and crystallized in her final whispered promise. The desire is dramatized through her trembling hands, hours of transcription, and the recognition that ancient astronomers made the same offer. The friction between wanting acknowledgment and accepting sufficiency creates genuine tension and drives the closure choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dusky harmony is established in the opening ("light through the reconstructed ziggurat windows turned the color of old bronze") and modulates as real stars appear to align with ancient schematics "in a harmony that felt composed." The tone remains consistent through discovery beats—contemplative, precise, tinged with wonder but not sentiment. The final courtyard image ("thick and indifferent and beautiful") charges the closure by balancing awe with acceptance.</comment>
