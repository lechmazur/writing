<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's acoustic sensitivity is well-embodied through concrete perception ("sub-harmonic moan of tide," "micro-fractures in greenhouse glass"), and her arc from seeking completion to embracing the unfinished is earned through on-page playing and realization. Internal contradiction appears when she stops imposing structure and follows dissonance, showing simultaneous impulses in scene. The grandmother/mother backstory anchors her present choice cleanly. Minor slip: the final epiphany ("understood at last what the women before her had known") edges toward tell, though it's immediately dramatized through her changed playing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (who/where/when by paragraph two). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as Maren's playing unbinds from structure, the greenhouse acoustics answer, and the final image of "a rest between notes" reweights the opening hush with visible cost—she accepts permanent incompletion and returns tomorrow to repeat the cycle. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): refusal to finish the piece forecloses the completion path she spent years pursuing, with the cost legible in her commitment to return and play it differently forever. One tightening: from imposed structure to following dissonance, which changes her relationship to the tradition and the hush.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse is rendered with precise, purposeful detail (rusted trawler ribs, barnacled frame, salt-fogged panes, apple trees drinking silted floor) that charges every beat. The estuary setting constrains her choice of venue and supplies the wrecks' acoustic response (hull humming low D, cracked pane buzzing). The mendicant's bowl anchors her ritual, and the final image of copper light through ash closes the circle. Sensory selection reflects her acoustic priority throughout. The greenhouse as micro-setting directly shapes the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding meaning in the post-fire hush) is signaled early and tightens when she stops trying to resolve the melody. The piece deepens through her unbinding choice: following dissonance instead of resolution narrows her original goal (completion) and opens a new stance (invitation through incompletion). The wrecks answering her playing is a micro turn that validates her new approach. Agency is renunciation with visible cost—she commits to infinite repetition and foregoes the closure her grandmother's tradition withheld. Accumulative pressure coheres under the Textural lens; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (beauty and meaning in the unfinished, incompletion as invitation) emerges organically from Maren's playing, the family tradition, and the post-fire hush without thesis statement. The mendicant's bowl (emptiness as offering), the recurring unfinished melody, and the final image of "a rest between notes" all carry non-literal weight. The ending reweights the opening's "chronic hush" from unbearable absence to charged potential without moralizing. Subtext operates in the grandmother's saying ("a finished story was a dead story") and the gesture of bow-across-bowl. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection through lived particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Maren's acoustic perception ("frequencies others missed," "sub-harmonic moan"). Diction is controlled and lyric ("gray snow," "bones of sleeping giants," "acoustic fabric") without register drift. Perceptual signature is distinct: she hears what others don't, and her way of noticing (sound-first, then visual/spatial) remains consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during playing, wider for setting description). No dialogue present. Minor density: some figurative language clusters ("like gray snow," "like the bones of sleeping giants," "like water through water") in early paragraphs, but voice-motivated and the pattern supports the lyric texture without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; information density is high (most lines do two jobs). Clarity and momentum are strong; no loops or scaffold. Opening and closing images anchor well. Minor overwriting in early figurative clusters: "ash drifted...like gray snow," "rusted ribs...like the bones of sleeping giants," "sound moved...like water through water" in quick succession creates slight density without muddle, but the metaphors are coherent and the cadence recovers. Filter verbs ("could hear," "could see") appear but are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. No grammar slips, tense is stable, spatial choreography tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic acoustic void, family storytelling tradition, and music-as-incompletion is specific and non-obvious. The sunken greenhouse venue and acoustic interplay with wrecks avoid generic post-disaster settings. Emotional truth (grief, the desire to complete, acceptance of endlessness) is earned through concrete playing rather than platitude. The piece transforms the "artist finds meaning after disaster" template through the specificity of acoustic loss, the mendicant's bowl ritual, and the multi-generational unfinished song. Risk: committing to a quiet, repetitive ending (she'll return tomorrow, play it differently, leave it unfinished again) without false climax.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (echo-harbor violinist) drives every beat: she carries the violin, plays the unfinished piece, makes the unbinding choice to stop trying to resolve, and commits to return tomorrow. Her acoustic perception enables the key turn (hearing the wrecks' response). Early signal, multiple beats, causal pressure, closure linkage all present with visible cost (foregoing completion).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mendicant's bowl appears twice: she sets her case beside it, and at the end places the bow across it as "an offering of sound placed into a vessel meant for receiving." Setup and payoff gates met; the reprise reweights the opening mention and charges the closure image. Middle development absent (not handled during the playing), so capped at ~6.3 under the lyric-resonance allowance. The bowl's symbolism (emptiness as offering) ties to theme, but it doesn't constrain a choice mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Chronic hush" is the dominant stake: it settled after the fire, made her acoustic sensitivity unbearable, and her playing is an attempt to answer it. The hush shapes every tactic (she plays into it, adjusts her approach, finally hears it answer). Early signal (paragraph three), multiple beats, causal pressure throughout. Closure linkage strong: "The hush remained, but it was no longer empty. It was a rest between notes." Visible cost: she accepts living within the hush rather than restoring the forest's sound.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Acoustically perceptive" is signaled early ("heard the frequencies others missed") and enables on-page action: she tunes to the forest's key (past), hears the wrecks' acoustic response (present turn), and perceives the faint humming at the end. The trait constrains her experience (the hush is unbearable to her specifically) and shapes the middle choice (following harmonics the wrecks offer). Cost: heightened sensitivity means heightened suffering, though the tradeoff is implicit rather than dramatized as a visible price paid.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Unbind" is the story's pivot: "She let the melody unbind itself from the structure she had imposed on it. She stopped trying to resolve." This action creates the major turn—from seeking completion to embracing incompletion—and redefines her relationship to the tradition, the hush, and her own playing. Early setup (the unfinished piece), middle enactment (the unbinding), closure linkage (commitment to repeat tomorrow). Swapping "unbind" for "release" or "free" would lose the specific textile/constraint metaphor that ties to the grandmother's tradition. Irreplaceable and causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The family tradition of storytelling "around bonfires on the shore" is signaled mid-story as the source of the unfinished melody and the philosophy ("a finished story was a dead story"). It shapes her understanding and primes the unbinding choice. Setup and payoff gates met; the tradition's mechanics (passing songs by ear, each generation adding but never closing) matter to her final stance. Middle development present (she recalls it during her realization). Causal pressure moderate: the tradition explains her initial goal and legitimizes her new approach, but doesn't constrain a visible on-page action with cost until the ending commitment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The "sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks" is indispensable. She wades through it, the wrecks provide acoustic response (hull hums low D, cracked pane buzzes), and the half-submerged apples and silted floor create the tactile environment. Early signal, multiple beats, causal pressure (the setting enables the acoustic answer that validates her unbinding), closure linkage (the wrecks stand "like a congregation" in the final image). Specificity high: removing the greenhouse's exact acoustic properties or the wrecks' resonance would break the story's central turn. Visible cost tied to setting: she must return to this flooded, ash-drifted ruin to sustain the practice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"After the rainforest burns" is the inciting condition: the fire caused the chronic hush, destroyed the acoustic fabric, and made Maren's sensitivity unbearable. "Three months ago" anchors the time, and the ash still drifting signals ongoing consequence. The timeframe tightens her need (she's endured three months of unbearable hush before finding this answer). Closure linkage: the burned forest's absence is what she accepts living within at the end. The fire's aftermath constrains every tactic and shapes the final image's weight. Not a live countdown clock, but a causal timeframe with persistent cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To find beauty in the unfinished" is Maren's arc: she begins seeking completion ("spent years reaching for the final phrase"), the middle dramatizes her shift (unbinding the melody, following dissonance), and the ending crystallizes her new stance ("The unfinished was not a failure. It was an invitation"). Early setup, middle enactment, closure linkage all strong. Friction present: her desire to complete conflicts with the family tradition and the hush's reality, creating visible cost when she chooses endlessness over resolution. The motivation is enacted through playing and choice, not merely told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Magnificent simplicity" operates as coherent tone: the prose is lyric but controlled, the imagery specific ("rusted ribs," "mendicant's bowl," "low D"), and the ending image ("a rest between notes, a breath between words") distills complexity into a simple, charged truth. Tone modulates with pressure (lyric description → playing urgency → quiet acceptance) and charges the final image without overstatement. The faint humming "the most magnificent thing she had ever known in its simplicity" makes the tone explicit, which slightly undercuts the effect but the line earns it through prior restraint. Coherent through turns.</comment>
