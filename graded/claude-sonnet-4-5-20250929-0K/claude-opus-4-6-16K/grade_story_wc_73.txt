<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("grim optimist," the chipped die as signature of unfinished possibility). Her micro-choices—rolling the dice, completing the proof—emerge from established motives with embodied tension. The reflection on the boy and the door moment is purposeful, anchoring her pursuit of "texture" rather than outcome, and it primes the closure choice without flattening present pressure. Minor issue: the final renunciation ("did not look back") feels slightly performed rather than contradictory, but the prior causality earns the stance shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Conceptual Repricing at closure. The staircase motif accumulates through landings, equations, and the perpetual-motion lemmas; the chipped die's blank face ruptures the system with legible conceptual cost (division by nothing, architecture shuddering). Orientation is swift (climber, staircase, memory/forever established in opening lines). The closure—staircase compressing into a single step, "texture she had been chasing," pocketed dice—reconfigures the premise with felt cost (boundless confinement broken, the side she chose). Lens holds; cost is visible. One meaningful deepening (the incomplete proof, the zero) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The staircase functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: infinite helix with irregular landings, carved equations as social trace, pale sourceless light. The chipped die is handled across beats (stolen, carried, rolled, "still warm") and its damaged corner enables the zero-face rupture that charges closure. Spatial choreography (ascending, kneeling, dice on stone) remains clear. The setting pressures Maren's proof-writing and final act; the "stone that was already forgetting" image closes with purpose. No occupational or locale depth is needed here; the abstract architecture suffices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: escape bounded infinity by proving perpetual motion can be ruptured. Signaled early (ten-thousandth step lemmas, hundred-thousandth additions). One meaningful tightening: the incomplete equation and the dice roll that produces zero, a discontinuity the system cannot parse. The protagonist's agency (completing the proof, introducing the impossible number) drives the turn; the staircase folds as a direct consequence. Visible cost: she steps into "neither bounded nor free," forfeiting the climb's endless rhythm for stillness. No secondary reversal is needed; the single deepening narrows options and reweights the premise under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the chipped die as randomness and unfinished decision, equations as proofs of confinement, the door-swinging texture as irreversibility. The closure image—"side she'd chosen rather than the side she'd defaulted to"—answers the central question (can she author her path?) without stating a moral. The mathematical proof as thematic vehicle (perpetual motion = boundless confinement) is organic, not imposed. The final line ("A grim optimist never does") reprises the mother's phrase with earned weight. No abstract philosophizing or thematic echo in the final paragraph; resonance is built from the dice, the proof, and the compressed staircase.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance. Perceptual signature is selective and character-specific: "grim architecture of hopelessness" as a construct she names yet overrides, mathematics as precision language, "texture of the moment" as her recurring obsession. Diction matches the POV (formal but embodied: "balancedly daring hope," "palimpsest"). No head-hopping. Rhythmic control under pressure: short declarative beats at the dice roll ("Zero."), longer syntactic elaboration in reflection. One minor slip: "balancedly daring" feels slightly strained in register, but voice remains coherent. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short sentence at "Zero," longer nested clauses in the perpetual-motion reflection). Information density is high: most lines advance character, image, or concept. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor issues: "that was her particular affliction" and "that was the missed opportunity" are near-identical stems separated by one paragraph (−0.2); "the texture she had been chasing" appears twice in short succession (closure + two lines prior), a mild echo (−0.2). The metaphoric vehicles (helix, closed loop, palimpsest) cohere. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; no artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—infinite staircase + mathematical proof + chipped die producing zero—is specific and non-obvious. The "grim optimist" frame and the pursuit of "texture" rather than outcome transform the escape-the-labyrinth template through lived philosophical detail. The dice's blank face (zero in a 1–6 set) as the discontinuity that ruptures perpetual motion is elegant and earned in hindsight. Risk-taking (mathematical formalism, abstract setting, quiet closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The story commits fully to its premise and follows the conceptual implications (division by nothing collapses the architecture). Bonus for bold structural and thematic integration: +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren as "grim optimist" is signaled early (mother's phrase, first paragraph), constrains middle choices (continuing to climb and carve proofs despite naming hopelessness), and shapes closure (choosing the side rather than defaulting, not looking back). The trait enables the final proof-completion and dice roll with visible cost. Present across setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Attribute is character-specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dice appear in setup (stolen from probability lecture, chipped corner described), middle beat (turned in palm, "randomness was the universe's signature"), and closure beat (rolled, zero face, "still warm in her hand" after compression). The chipped die's unique property—wobbling on damaged corner to show a blank face—is the discontinuity that enables the rupture. Handled on the page across three distinct beats; evolving use with charged reprise. Causal pressure and closure linkage are undeniable; cost is tied to the element (introducing the impossible number).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Perpetual motion is signaled early (ten-thousandth step, nine landings of lemmas), shapes middle tactics (arguing energy return through staircase geometry, "self-sustaining closed loop"), and defines the problem the incomplete proof addresses. The concept constrains the protagonist's method (must prove it can be ruptured) and provides the stakes (boundless confinement). Closure directly enacts the rupture (perpetual motion collapses into a single step). Present across setup, development, and payoff with strong causal pressure. Irreplaceable; the story logic turns on this exact concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Balancedly daring hope" appears once in the middle beat when Maren considers the incomplete proof. The phrase is voice-consistent and encapsulates her simultaneous awareness of cost and willingness to act, but it does not constrain a second on-page action beyond that single moment. Setup is implicit in the "grim optimist" frame; closure echoes the daring choice. Two gates (implicit setup, middle label, closure participation via the proof-completion choice), but no distinct second beat where the attribute visibly alters tactics. Mid-band: functional, some causal linkage, but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Rupture" is named in the incomplete equation (middle), enacted by the dice roll producing zero (the discontinuity), and realized in closure (architecture shudders, steps fold, staircase compresses). The action is the story's conceptual and physical pivot; removing it would eliminate the mechanism of escape. Signaled early via the perpetual-motion lemmas (arguing rupture is possible), drives the middle turn (incomplete proof), and defines closure (system collapses). Irreplaceable; causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost are all tied to this exact action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mathematical proofs are signaled early (equations carved on landings, nine landings filled with lemmas by hundred-thousandth step), constrain Maren's method throughout (formal logic as "the only language precise enough"), and provide the closure mechanism (completing the proof in eleven lines causes the fold). The method shapes her attempts and differentiates her approach; she writes proofs rather than merely climbing. Present across setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure is strong. Minor issue: the actual proof content is elided ("eleven lines, each one building"), so mechanics remain somewhat abstract. Still, the method is essential and shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is present from the opening line, supplies the perpetual-motion constraint (energy lost per step returned by geometry), provides the landings where equations accumulate, and is the object that compresses at closure. It pressures every choice (to climb, to write proofs, to roll the dice) and defines the dominant stake (escape bounded infinity). Setting is indispensable; the story's logic and closure image ("compressed into a single step," "stone forgetting it had ever been a staircase") depend on this exact structure. Irreplaceable; present across all three gates with maximal causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—"to capture the texture of a missed opportunity"—is seeded early (probability lecture, boy, door swinging shut, "exact weight of a door...possibility collapsed into a single irreversible direction"), drives middle reflection (the texture as her pursuit, not the boy), and is fulfilled at closure ("she felt the texture she had been chasing...the side she'd chosen rather than the side she'd defaulted to"). The desire is dramatized through her proof-writing and the dice roll; the final image reprises the door metaphor with earned weight. Cost is visible (forfeiting endless ascent for stillness). Present across setup, development, and payoff; causal and closure linkage strong. Motivation is character-specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Boundless confinement" is established early ("free to climb forever and imprisoned by exactly that freedom," "closed loop disguised as a line") and modulates with pressure: matter-of-fact through the lemmas, tense at the incomplete proof, resolved at closure ("neither bounded nor free, but finally, mercifully, still"). The tone charges the final image (the paradox broken, the staircase forgetting itself). Coherent through turns; the phrase itself appears mid-story and the concept frames both the problem and the resolution. Strong thematic and tonal integration; the ending's stillness is felt as a release from the oxymoron.</comment>
