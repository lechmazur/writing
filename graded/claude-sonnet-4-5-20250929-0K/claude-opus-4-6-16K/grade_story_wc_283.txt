<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and distinctive—her patient cataloging, her belief that "prophecies are seeds," and her Guild-vs.-possibility tension. The final choice to share the unscrambled prophecy as "invitation" rather than "commandment" is earned by her three-year obsession and the button-taught patience. Minor weakness: her emotional progression feels slightly smoothed; the moment of completing the prophecy could carry more bodily contradiction or doubt. No head-hopping, clean knowledge boundaries, and the renunciation of rigid futures feels character-driven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: cataloging thousands of buttons over three years deepens into a single decisive completion and echo-test that shatters the prophecy's "rigid future" into streaming possibilities. Orientation anchors (warehouse, dawn, hourglass turner role) arrive promptly. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the echo's chord and Maren's decision to share as invitation reconfigure the Guild's deterministic stance with visible cost—she knows they will resist, and she accepts the conflict. One meaningful tightening (final button placement) and cost (Guild resistance, the patient work itself) are legible. Causality within the cataloging frame is consistent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber warehouse beneath cliffs functions as more than backdrop: amber light reveals button phonemes "at a specific angle," the canyon echo jar captures reverberating wisdom, and the seventeen oak tables hold the cataloging grid. Spatial choreography (iron stairs, north wall table, eastern wing) is clean and the amber-tinted dust motes spinning in galaxies charges the closure image. The canyon's limestone and mineral drip provide sensory anchors filtered through Maren's patient attention. Minor gap: the physical act of "uncorking the jar" and the echo's acoustic behavior could be more sensorially specific under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform the prophecy from rigid command into branching possibilities—is signaled early and drives the three-year cataloging effort. The final button placement and echo-test create one meaningful tightening that reweights the entire enterprise: the echo sings instead of echoing, and the prophecy shatters. The cost is legible: Maren will face Guild resistance and the prophecy's deterministic shell is irrevocably broken. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: years of patient work culminate in a single charged moment. No coincidence resolves the work; Maren's agency (cataloging, capturing the echo, choosing to share) drives the closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—prophecy as seed rather than command, determinism versus possibility—emerges organically from Maren's cataloging labor and the button/canyon particulars. The echo's deepening variations ("listen" → "glisten," "loosen," "lessen") concretize shared wisdom without abstract philosophizing. The final image of "softened echo" carried into "a world that was, for the first time in centuries, genuinely open" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor slip: "Things come apart... and in the coming apart, they offer their truest gift" tilts slightly toward thematic summary, though it's filtered through Maren's voice and the button metaphor anchors it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Maren's perceptual signature: "the weight of everything it remembered," "patience of someone who understood that small things held enormous truths." Diction is controlled, elevated but not academic, voice-consistent under pressure. The narrative certainty matches what Maren knows (her cataloging, her Guild role, her discovery). No head-hopping. Minor friction: the phrase "unearthed silence, the kind that exists not because nothing is being said but because everything has finally been heard" is meta-commentary that slightly pulls out of Maren's immediate experience, though it functions as thematic close and the voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high (buttons encode syllables; canyon echo deepens over time), and the opening sentence anchors voice and stakes elegantly. The final image (jar, softened echo, world "genuinely open") recharges earlier motifs. Overwriting appears in clusters: "the particular silence that follows revelation—unearthed silence, the kind that exists not because nothing is being said but because everything has finally been heard" stacks metaphor and explication in the closure beat, reducing immediacy (−0.6 for density + coherence friction in a peak beat). "Quietly inspired" is label-only without embodied detail. Minor paraphrase loop: "shared wisdom" and "canyon's memory" near-synonyms. Otherwise clean grammar, no scaffolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—prophecy phonemes hidden in lost buttons, revealed by amber light, tested by a canyon echo that continues thinking—is specific and non-obvious. The hourglass-turner profession and Guild context ground the metaphysical conceit in a lived-in world. The transformation of "prophecy as command" into "prophecy as seed" offers a fresh angle on fate-versus-free-will material. Minor limitation: the core premise (reconstructing a shattered oracle text) echoes familiar "lost knowledge" templates, though the button-cataloging method and the echo-jar mechanics provide fresh texture. Risk-taking in the amber-light phoneme mechanic and the canyon-memory device elevates within band (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as hourglass turner is signaled early (formal duty now secondary), returns in her understanding of "time's residue," and her patient turning of hourglasses parallels the cataloging work. The profession shapes her belief that "prophecies are seeds" and her decision to share the prophecy as invitation rather than command is a key turn driven by her Guild identity and opposition to its deterministic stance. Setup ✓, middle development (time's residue insight) ✓, closure (sharing as invitation vs. Guild command) ✓. Causal pressure: her Guild role creates the conflict and frames the final choice. Cost: she knows the Guild will resist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The canyon echo jar appears early (north wall table, captured with "listen"), is used in the middle to test reconstructions (harmony vs. silence), and delivers the climactic moment when it sings instead of echoing, confirming the prophecy's completion and shattering its rigid shell. Setup ✓, middle development (testing tool) ✓, closure (singing chord, "softened echo" carried into the open world) ✓. The jar's unique property—continuing to think and layer variations—matters throughout. Specificity high, causal pressure clear, closure linkage strong. The object is indispensable; removing it would collapse the verification mechanism and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Shared wisdom" is embedded in the canyon echo's deepening variations ("glisten," "loosen," "lessen" as "shared wisdom from stone walls that absorbed ten thousand years of voices") and the final chord that fills the warehouse. It shapes the verification method and the prophecy's transformation from command to seed. Setup (canyon echo as carrier) ✓, middle (testing tool) ✓, closure (the wisdom-laden chord enables the shattering) ✓. The concept influences tactics (how Maren tests) and charges the ending, though it operates somewhat abstractly. Swappable with "collective memory" or "accumulated knowledge" without major edits (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" appears only in the closure beat ("She stood quietly inspired, her hands still resting on the table") as a label without prior embodiment or constraint. It does not shape middle choices or enable/constrain actions earlier. Setup absent (−0.6), middle development absent (−0.8). It charges the final image slightly but remains ornamental—describable rather than action-forcing. The trait could be inferred from her patient cataloging, but the phrase itself is late and static. Closure participation is weak (label-only, no visible cost tied to being "quietly inspired" vs. triumphant or anxious).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Unscramble" is the core action: Maren discovers the pattern (buttons encode syllables), catalogs buttons for three years, places the final button, and reads the completed text. Setup (discovery and cataloging introduced early) ✓, middle (ongoing sorting and pattern work) ✓, closure (final button placement and reading aloud trigger the echo's chord and the shattering) ✓. The action is irreplaceable; "decode," "restore," or "reconstruct" would shift meaning. Causal pressure: unscrambling drives all beats. Cost: three years of obsessive labor and impending Guild conflict. Major turns trace directly to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"By cataloging lost buttons" is the method: buttons sorted into ceramic trays by material, era, garment; each carries a phoneme visible under amber light. The mechanics are explained early and matter throughout (sorting, testing sequences, placing the final button on the grid). Setup ✓, middle (cataloging as ongoing work, the grid as spatial tool) ✓, closure (final button placement completes the text) ✓. The method is specific and shapes all attempts. Minor swappability: "by sorting lost buttons" would function similarly (−0.3). Causal pressure and cost (three years, seventeen tables, thousands of buttons) are clear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber warehouse beneath cliffs is introduced immediately and its properties constrain tactics: amber light reveals button phonemes "at a specific angle," the space houses seventeen oak tables and the echo jar, and the cliffs/canyon supply the echo Maren captures. Setup ✓, middle (amber light as tool, warehouse as workspace) ✓, closure (warehouse as container for the singing chord, dust motes spinning in galaxies) ✓. The setting pressures choices (must use amber light, must work in this space) and charges the final image. Removing the warehouse would require major rewrite of method and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" appears only in the closure section ("Tonight, as the truth unravels, Maren placed the final button"). It does not tighten earlier decisions or track a live clock through the middle. Setup absent (no signal of impending unraveling earlier), middle development absent (three years pass in summary, no mounting urgency), closure (the phrase marks the moment but does not impose time pressure on the final choice). Late introduction (−0.7), ornamental phrasing that could be cut without altering the beat. The timeframe is more metaphorical label than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—"to spin a prophecy into raw possibility, to crack open its deterministic shell and release the branching futures trapped inside"—is articulated early and drives all action. She does not want restoration; she wants transformation. This desire shapes her three-year cataloging, her echo-testing method, and her final decision to share as invitation rather than commandment. Setup ✓, middle (the distinction between Guild command and Maren's seed metaphor) ✓, closure (choosing to share, accepting Guild resistance) ✓. The motivation creates friction (Guild will resist) and visible cost (conflict, isolation). Irreplaceable and causally central.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Unearthed silence" is present in the opening ("the amber warehouse held its breath... from the weight of everything it remembered"), returns in the closure ("the particular silence that follows revelation—unearthed silence, the kind that exists not because nothing is being said but because everything has finally been heard"), and modulates through the piece (faint drip, Maren's breath-level voice, the echo's chord filling the space). Setup ✓, closure (the phrase charges the final image and reweights the opening breath-holding) ✓. Middle presence is implicit in the quiet cataloging but not explicitly marked (−0.2). The tone is coherent, supports the accumulative design, and the reprise reweights meaning.</comment>
