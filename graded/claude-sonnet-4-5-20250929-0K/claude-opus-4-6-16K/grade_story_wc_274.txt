<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior is concrete and controlled—"that involuntary instant when the body moves before the mind grants permission" embodies contradiction in action. Her conflict between oath and exposure is rendered through micro-choices (mapping networks "the way a prisoner finds cracks") rather than summary. The final renunciation has cost (isolation remains, complicity acknowledged), and her breathing easier signals earned stasis. Minor deduction: the phrase "bravely conflicted" appears twice as a label without full dramatization of competing impulses in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture: discovery → mapping dormant networks (established months prior) → decision → transmission → filing. The closure is Earned Stasis with visible cost: she remains isolated, the original stays frozen, but complicity is broken and she breathes easier. Orientation anchors (location, role, days alone) arrive within the first two sentences. One meaningful tightening (the letter's content narrows her choice to expose or preserve) drives the turn. Cost is legible: "bravely conflicted still, but breathing easier than she had in three years."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The library's physicality—eleven meters of snow, eight-meter shelves, frost creeping on the reading table, the groan of compression—constrains Maren's isolation and makes the dormant uplinks her only lever. The nitrogen-cooled vaults and cathedral corridors charge the atmosphere of enforced silence. The final image of snow pressing down and the library groaning under weight mirrors her choice's permanence. Micro-setting (the steel reading table, the fluorescent hum) roots each beat without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose mass-murder complicity vs. preserve the archival pact) is signaled early and sharpens through the letter's content. One meaningful tightening: her hands move "before the mind grants permission," driven by three years of mapping escape routes. The price is visible—she remains isolated, the original preserved, but complicity ends. Agency is renunciation with cost (she cannot retrieve the ghost signal). No antagonist required; the pact and her conscience supply pressure. Escalation is internal but purposeful, narrowing options to transmission.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—complicity and the silence around mass atrocity—emerges through the letter's tender penmanship contrasted with fourteen thousand dead, and Maren's role as "priestess of oblivion." The closure answers the thematic question (provoke the unspoken conversation) through concrete action (transmission) without stating a moral. The recurring images of cold, breath dissolving, and the library's groan charge the final stasis. Subtext operates in "civilisation wanted preserved yet never read" and the contradiction that powerful people remain human while engineering floods. No thematic echo or false balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization; perceptual signature (attention to frost, echoes, silence as weather) remains character-specific. Diction elevates purposefully ("priestess of oblivion," "ghost was already climbing") without breaking Maren's educated register. Psychic distance tightens at the transmission beat, then pulls back for the closing image. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak moments. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at the decision point, longer cadence in the reflective frame. Voice is singular and controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance setting, character, or stakes simultaneously. Sentence structure varies—long accumulative descriptions in setup, shorter declarative beats at transmission. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deduction: "bravely conflicted" recurs as a phrase without fresh inflection, and "contraband truth" feels slightly elevated for the moment. Figurative language (library as "lung of something sleeping," signal "riding frequencies") is consistent and legible. Propulsion is steady; the read-aloud test passes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise (archivist in Antarctic vault leaking a suppressed truth via dormant networks) synthesizes familiar elements with specific detail—nitrogen-cooled stacks, the red-circle-bisected-line classification, the dormant satellite relay. The letter's tender penmanship contrasting mass murder offers a fresh moral angle. The ending avoids tidy resolution: the ghost escapes, the original remains, and Maren's isolation persists. Risk-taking is present (no external antagonist, no confrontation scene) but the frame itself (lone archivist, conscience crisis, transmission) follows recognizable template beats. Transformation is partial: execution is strong, but the core arc is moderately familiar.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren drives all key turns: she discovers the letter, maps the dormant networks (months prior, setup), decides to transmit, executes, and files the original. Her profession's constraints (monitored channels, archival oath) and skills (mapping frequencies) shape every choice. Appears in setup, middle choice (transmission), and ending (filing, breathing easier). Causal pressure is undeniable; the closure unit depends on her decision with visible cost. Specificity: only a cryogenic archivist has both access and technical means.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The letter appears in three beats: discovery and reading (setup), transmission (climax), and re-filing (closure). Its content (tender correspondence about engineered flood) sharpens the moral stakes. The contrast between its brittle envelope and devastating content charges Maren's choice. It is causally irreplaceable—no other document would carry the same weight of complicity and affection. The "ghost" climbing through the atmosphere reprises its meaning at closure. Minor gap: the letter's physical handling could be slightly more tactile in peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Contraband truths" is signaled early (the vaults hold "truths deemed too volatile") and shapes Maren's stakes: her role curates what civilization wants "preserved yet never read." The letter's status as contraband (classification tier she's never seen) drives her decision to leak it. The concept recurs in the closure: "a truth that had been frozen long enough." It reweights the premise but does not constrain tactics as concretely as the object or method. The thematic echo is strong; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Bravely conflicted" appears twice as a label: once mid-story ("She was bravely conflicted, and she knew it") and in the closing line. The trait constrains her decision—she hesitates, recognizes the pact's clarity, yet transmits—but the cost is more often shown through action (mapping networks as a prisoner finds cracks) than through this specific phrase. The label feels somewhat external rather than fully embodied in contradictory impulses during peak beats. Present in setup and closure, minor development in middle.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Scandalize" is the stated motive ("to scandalize the silence itself") and drives the transmission. The act is irreplaceable: no other verb captures her intent to force complicity visible. It shapes her choice at the climax and recurs in the closure (provoking "the conversation that fourteen thousand dead had earned"). The action is dramatized through the transmission sequence, not merely declared. Minor gap: the verb itself appears in reflection rather than as a beat label, so its causal force is slightly indirect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dormant networks are seeded early ("she had mapped something the Initiative's architects had overlooked") and their discovery process is detailed ("the way a prisoner finds cracks"). The method's mechanics matter: three dead stations, Christchurch server, routing sequence memorized months ago. It enables the climax (transmission) and is irreplaceable—no other means bypasses monitored channels. The specificity (frequencies, relay codes, satellite uplinks) charges the technical plausibility. Present in setup (mapping), middle (decision to use), and climax (execution).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The library's eleven meters of snow, eight-meter frosted shelves, cathedral corridors, and the groan of compression create claustrophobic isolation that forces Maren's sole lever (dormant uplinks). The setting is causally active: nitrogen-cooled vaults justify document preservation, the monitored channel explains why she mapped alternatives. The final image—snow pressing, library groaning—charges the closure with geological permanence. Micro-setting (steel table, fluorescent hum) anchors each beat. The environment is indispensable to both isolation and the technical solution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Within the blink that follows surprise" frames the transmission beat: "not slowly, not after deliberation, but within the blink...her hands were already at the terminal." The timeframe compresses decision into involuntary action, charging the moment. However, it appears only at climax; the broader story unfolds over untracked duration (forty-three days of silence, three years of mapping). The phrase is specific and purposeful but does not tighten earlier tactics or recur at closure. Present in one key beat; causal role is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's desire "to provoke an unspoken conversation" is articulated mid-story and drives the transmission. The friction between this motive and her archival oath ("archivists curated; they did not disseminate") creates the core conflict. The motive is dramatized through her choice and its cost (isolation persists, complicity broken). It recurs in the closure: the conversation "that fourteen thousand dead had earned but never received." Minor deduction: the motivation is more often told in reflection than shown through contradictory micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Dizzying quiet" is embodied throughout: silence "pooled in the ears and became its own weather," echoes travel shelf after shelf, the fluorescent hum sits "just below perception." Tone modulates with pressure—longer, suspended clauses in reflection; sharper, shorter beats at transmission. The final image (library groaning, silence closing "like water over a stone") charges the ending with tonal permanence. Coherent across turns and consistent with the atmosphere of enforced stillness. The tone is indispensable to the piece's pressure and closure effect.</comment>
