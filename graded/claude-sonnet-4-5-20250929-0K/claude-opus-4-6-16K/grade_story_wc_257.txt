<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's grief-to-craft trajectory is embodied through specific actions—tracing the stencil, setting glass, making the brooch—and her contradictory impulses (working again "not yet" jewelry, then creating mourning jewelry for herself) emerge clearly. The internal arc from stopped hands to clasping her own piece shows genuine cost and transformation. Minor slip: the caretaker Sable and the origami-giver remain abstract presences rather than pressure points, slightly diffusing the relational crucible, but the solitary design holds and the final self-gifting choice carries visible weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (observatory, perpetual dusk, Elara's trade). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: coordinates → observations → craft attempts build density until the final brooch integrates star-and-sunlight with mourning, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where she claims her own grief-work and descends. Cost is visible in the self-directed mourning piece and the departure. One friction: the origami figures' origin remains unexplained, creating mild motivational blur, but the pattern is taught early and the closure image reweights withering/bloom with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory's perpetual dusk, brass dials, dome slit, and supply-room copper constrain and enable Elara's craft choices across multiple beats. The dark observatory glass becomes a micro-setting object that charges the final image by catching mingled light and throwing constellations. Spatial choreography (ridge, deck, eyepiece, bench) remains clear. The setting is not postcard; it pressures her solitary work and the mingled star-and-sunlight directly shapes the brooch's luminous effect at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reclaiming the capacity to work (and mourn) after devastating loss. The piece deepens through accumulative pressure—each coordinate reveals transition (dying/becoming), each craft attempt narrows the gap between observation and self-directed making—until the final brooch integrates her own grief. The tightening is meaningful: she moves from "not jewelry—not yet" to "the first piece…for herself." Cost is legible in the self-application and descent. One deduction: the stakes remain largely internal without an external test or secondary pressure to triangulate urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief as both withering and bloom, genuine artifice as vessel for absence—emerges organically from the nebula observations, the stencil's skeletal-hand-with-bloom design, and the final brooch that "did not erase the withering" but "opened, petal by petal." The "genuine artifice meant to illuminate what could no longer be seen" line integrates concept and emotion without moralizing. The final image (constellation thrown across wrist/wall, descent into "whatever hour") reweights the opening's stopped hands with resonant, non-literal closure. No thematic echo or sermon; the particulars carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices through a jeweler's lens (locks of hair, gold wire, garnet/jet, copper sheeting, sliver of glass). Diction remains controlled ("curtain of gas lit from within," "shadow-Loss…light-bloom") and voice-consistent under pressure. Brief reflection on "genuine artifice" and "paradox" is anchored to the telescope image and tilts present stance. One slip: "She did not know whom she was making it for. That felt like progress" edges toward therapeutic self-assessment, though it stays within plausible interiority. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (mourning-jewelry detail, nebula imagery, craft steps). Figurative language ("photons were real; the image was a ghost," "trailing new stars like sparks from a forge") is selective and voice-integrated. Two frictions: "grief into garnet and jet" and "coal she could not spit out" are vivid but teeter near stock metaphor; the phrase "genuine artifice" recurs three times, creating mild conceptual loop that slightly dulls its final landing. Line-level clarity and propulsion remain strong; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mourning-jewelry-maker premise is familiar, but the perpet­ual-dusk observatory, coordinates-in-origami method, and "genuine artifice" paradox (real gold holding absence) synthesize into a specific, non-obvious frame. The final brooch that throws constellations while honoring skeletal withering feels earned and fresh. Risk-taking in the elliptical origami-giver and the accumulative structure elevates without obscuring closure. One limit: the transformation from grief-paralysis to self-directed mourning follows a recognizable arc; the emotional truth is strong, but the plot shape is conventional within the literary-grief subgenre.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices—tracing the stencil, cutting copper, setting glass, folding her own origami figure, making and clasping the brooch—drive all major beats. Her decision to leave coordinates for "whoever came next" and to wear her own mourning piece are the story's twin closure moves. The character is indispensable; no beat functions without her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The vellum stencil appears early (first night), seeds the bloom/skeletal-hand image, and is traced onto copper in the middle. It returns implicitly in the final brooch's template. Two-beat involvement (discovery, copper tracing) and thematic reprise, but the stencil itself does not constrain a choice or reappear physically at closure. Purposeful but not causally irreplaceable; the bloom could have originated elsewhere with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Curtains of intention" is named once (nebula observation) and echoes thematically in the final brooch's interplay of shadow/light. It shapes Elara's perception of dying/becoming and primes the craft metaphor, but it does not constrain an on-page choice. Lyric seed → final resonance without middle development. Purposeful reprise, but mid-band: the concept enriches theme more than it narrows tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" is articulated in the nebula paragraph ("light that reached her was genuinely artificial…photons were real; the image was a ghost") and explicitly tied to mourning jewelry ("real gold holding an absence, genuine artifice"). It recurs in the final brooch description, charging the ending image. The trait enables the thematic synthesis but does not constrain a specific action with visible cost. Strong thematic integration; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is the story's spine: she aims the telescope to illuminate nebulae, each one in transition; the final brooch illuminates via thrown constellations. The action structures multiple beats (first nebula, repeated coordinates, glass-setting to catch light) and defines the closure image ("glass caught…and threw a tiny constellation"). Removing illumination would break the craft logic and thematic payoff. High integration with visible causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The origami-with-coordinates method appears early (crane, lily, fox), drives the middle beats (feeding numbers into brass dials, observing nebulae), and Elara folds her own heart-origami as a key closure move, leaving it for the next visitor. The method shapes her learning curve and her final act of generosity. Three-beat involvement, causal pressure, closure participation. Origin remains mysterious but the mechanics matter and recur with consequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The timeless observatory (perpetual dusk, no clocks, unlocked door, brass dials, supply room copper, dome slit) enables solitary grieving work, provides the dark glass for the brooch, and the mingled star-and-sunlight that charges the final image. The setting constrains her to accumulated observation and craft, shapes multiple beats, and is indispensable to the closure effect. Micro-setting (glass, bench, ridge descent) all alter tactics and charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After hitting rock bottom" frames the timeframe (post-loss, shop dark, hands stopped) and anchors motive throughout. The element does not create a live clock or escalating deadline, but it primes all choices and the return-to-world descent at closure. Early setup, thematic carry-through, closure linkage. Mid-high band: it shapes context and stakes but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To teach withering to bloom again" is discovered on the stencil, recurs in Elara's craft attempts (shadow-Loss/light-bloom), and the final brooch enacts it ("did not erase the withering…but between those fingers, something opened"). The motive drives her middle work and is dramatized in the closure choice to wear the piece herself. Friction between grief and generativity is visible. Strong causal and closure integration; the desire is tested and fulfilled on the page with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Subdued ardor—quiet intensity without overt passion—is sustained throughout: controlled grief, purposeful observation, solitary craft, and the final image of clasping and descending is restrained yet charged. Tone modulates subtly (from stopped hands to "progress" to the luminous brooch) without spiking into melodrama. The final line ("descended…into whatever hour waited") maintains the restrained fervor. Coherent through all turns and charges the closure image cleanly.</comment>
