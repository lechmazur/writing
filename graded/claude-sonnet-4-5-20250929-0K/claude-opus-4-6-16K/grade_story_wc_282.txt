<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and her sensory-mapping craft is embodied through the filament sensors, but she remains observational throughout—no contradictory impulses appear and no meaningful choice alters her stance. The interiority leans toward diagnostic calm ("factually mystical") rather than contradictory pressure. The ending gratitude pulse from the fossil feels externally granted rather than earned by her internal struggle. Her work continues unchanged, so no path is foreclosed with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph; the piece follows a single continuous scene in accumulative/textural mode. The closure offers a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise: the cave "acknowledging" and Maren smiling in recognition), and the final image reweights the premise—world as sentient partner—with felt conceptual cost (her solitary vigilance). The lens holds, but the closure lacks a decisive foregrounding of what Maren surrenders or what tactical path is now foreclosed; the gratitude and smile feel affirming rather than costly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is vividly rendered with thermal gradients, bioluminescent algae, and thermal columns that organize Maren's movements and constrain her mapping choices. The seventh chamber's warmth frequency directly charges the climactic encounter with the fossil. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional priorities (thermal signatures translated to emotional resonance), and the environment shapes both her method and the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—documenting what the planet whispers when no one listens—is signaled early and pursued coherently, but no meaningful tightening or trade-off appears. Maren encounters warmth, approaches, maps, and continues; no reversal narrows her options or forces a renunciation. The fossil's "gratitude" pulse arrives as external validation rather than earned escalation, and no visible price alters her tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—planetary sentience, human absence, and transitional memory—emerges organically from the cave's thermal architecture and the fossil's layered emotional residue. The concept of "factually mystical" and the transitional object frame are woven through particulars without overt thesis. The ending image (Maren as translator, the unknown "has so much left to say") offers resonance but edges toward summary assertion rather than letting the image alone reweight the question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and confident, with controlled diction ("factually mystical," "thermal residue") that reflects Maren's professional lens without slipping into jargon excess. POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately—technical in mapping beats, lyric in the cathedral chamber—but some filter verbs ("feeling," "seeing") dull immediacy in peak moments. Perceptual signature is strong and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high; nearly every line advances atmosphere or concept. Minor scaffold appears in paired constructions ("Loss. Memory." / "strange, beautiful documents") and the explain-everything closing clause ("The unknown had so much left to say") that summarizes rather than letting the image resonate. No loops or register drift touch the closure, and figurative language (thermal "blood through a heart") remains coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory-tech craft, planetary emotion-mapping, and human hibernation cycles feels specific and non-obvious. The transitional object lens applied at planetary scale transforms a familiar concept into fresh territory. Risk-taking in the quiet, accumulative structure and the embodied mysticism elevate the piece, though the core lonely-custodian-during-absence frame echoes familiar post-human solitude tropes. Emotional truth and particular detail (elm leaf fossil, filament sensors) prevent generic drift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her mapping choices organize all beats, but she makes no decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She approaches, records, and continues; observation without costly agency. The character drives the lens but not the escalation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The elm leaf fossil appears at the climax, floats in the thermal column, and is mapped in detail; its ancient emotional residue is the story's conceptual anchor. It receives focused handling in the cathedral chamber and charges the final image, but it arrives late (past midpoint) and does not constrain earlier choices. Two-gate integration (development, payoff) with strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Transitional objects are named explicitly and explained as the conceptual frame for the fossil's planetary-scale function. The concept shapes Maren's interpretation and the story's thematic architecture, but it does not constrain her on-page choices or tactics. It operates more as a thematic lens than a causal pressure; the fossil's meaning is discovered, not chosen under duress.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is coined early in Maren's field notes and colors her professional stance, but it does not enable or constrain a specific action with visible cost. The term labels her method rather than creating a tradeoff; it enriches voice but remains ornamental to the escalation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating action is central to the climactic encounter: the fossil suspended in the thermal column is the pivot that reveals its transitional function. Maren approaches because it floats, and the impossibility (stone held with "intention") drives her mapping and the closure image. The action could not be swapped without losing the story's conceptual hinge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is signaled in the opening paragraph (filament sensors translating thermal signatures to emotional resonance) and executed across all six prior chambers and the climactic seventh. The method structures her entire arc and supplies the data that reveals the fossil's layered residue. It shapes her approach, middle work, and the final mapping beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The coastal cave network pressures every choice: thermal gradients guide Maren's path, the seventh chamber's unique warmth frequency triggers the climax, and the bioluminescent cathedral supplies the charged atmosphere for the floating fossil. The setting's emotional architecture (warmth flowing "like blood through a heart") is indispensable to both stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hibernation timeframe is established early (three-month winter, seven billion humans asleep) and motivates Maren's solitary work as "one of the few who stayed awake." The absence of humanity creates the conditions for planetary expression and her custodial role. It does not tighten a clock or force a tactical pivot, but it frames the entire premise and charges the ending's translator image.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" is declared early and pursued consistently through mapping, but it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Maren's desire faces no friction on the page; she achieves her goal without renunciation or visible sacrifice. The motivation organizes the arc but does not generate pressure.</comment>
