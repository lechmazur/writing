<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elody's interiority is concrete and specific—her lukewarm magic embodies her gentle persistence, and her belief that "brittle devotion" demands "constant, conscious renewal" drives every on-page action. The trait "earnestly and without irony" is rendered through her counting drops and recalibrating the bell's angle, not asserted. Internal contradiction surfaces when she knows the attempt is "absurd" yet proceeds anyway, earning the final shift. Minor deduction: the line "her naivete the only engine strong enough" edges toward direct statement rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered detail (viaduct engineering, dripping rates, Return Frequency) until the 211th drop seals the crack—a Resonant Reconfiguration (the bell mends itself; something silver turns below) with conceptual cost legible in Elody's unchanged devotion and the phrase "already recalibrating." Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two. Causality is smooth: her understanding of tempo and brittle devotion motivates the ritual, and the closure image reweights prior material (the ocean "began to breathe") without requiring a decisive confrontation. No motif checklist: the bell and dripping rates earn their reprise by constraining her method and charging the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct channels water "drop by drop" at a metronomic tempo, directly constraining Elody's method (she adjusts the bell's angle "by fractions of degrees" to match the Return Frequency). Setting details—compressed mineral glass, drip-point condensation, empty harbor below—are filtered through her professional focus and prime the closure image (the silver turn in the water). Micro-setting (the bell beneath the drip-point) functions as the stage for the climactic act. One subtraction: the viaduct's backstory (engineers, Breathing Ledger) is dense but slightly exceeds immediate scene needs at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: restart the cosmic circuit to save the ocean. Pressure accumulates through Elody's counting and recalibrating under the Accumulative lens; the "two hundred and eleventh drop" is a meaningful tightening that forecloses the prior state (the crack seals, something silver appears). Agency is present: she chooses the angle, whispers fire into the crack, and maintains her devotion despite knowing it looks "absurd." Cost is felt in her ongoing labor ("already recalibrating") and the phrase "brittle and unbroken." No antagonist required; the imbalance itself supplies opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—brittle devotion as fragile commitment requiring "constant, conscious renewal"—emerges through Elody's metronomic counting and micro-adjustments, not statement. The final image (ocean breathing, Elody recalibrating) offers a non-literal answer: balance is maintained through humble, persistent labor. Subtext operates in "her naivete the only engine strong enough" and "plausibility bent around her like light around a dying star." The Return Frequency and Breathing Ledger avoid becoming allegorical stand-ins because they are concretely enacted (drip tempo, bronze hum). One hairline slip: "the only engine strong enough" risks overt commentary, though the surrounding specifics support it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooms in on her palms against bronze, pulls back to "she did not see" the silver turn). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elody notices tempo, resonance, and drip-point angles—details filtered through her mage training. Diction fits her character ("lukewarm," "tea-temperature warmth," "brittle devotion") without register drift. The phrase "plausibility bent around her like light around a dying star" is elevated but voice-motivated, charging the tone. No head-hopping; the withheld detail (she does not see the silver fish) imposes cost on the reader and serves closure by implying success without declarative summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world logic, or atmosphere ("each drop was a syllable in an ancient conversation"). Minor deductions: the phrase "she believed this was not merely ecological collapse but cosmic imbalance" is slightly expository for the POV moment, and "brittle devotion—that was what the shopkeeper had muttered" feels like a callback planted for later harvest rather than organic beat work. The loop "two hundred and ninth out of two hundred and twelve" / "two hundred and eleventh drop" is purposeful pattern, not scaffold. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats; clarity and propulsion hold through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Premise—lukewarm mage restarts cosmic engine with dripping-rate ritual—is specific and non-obvious. The synthesis of failure-as-gift, ancient engineering wisdom, and tempo-as-conversation feels fresh in hindsight. Elody's earnest naivete transforms the underdog trope by making fragility (brittle devotion) the necessary condition rather than an obstacle. One subtraction: the concept "plausibility bent around her like light around a dying star" and "the impossible sat so close to the reasonable" risk meta-commentary, though they serve tone. Risk-taking (quiet closure, protagonist unaware of success) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; +0.3 within band for purposeful withholding at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elody (lukewarm mage) is present throughout, framed in paragraph one, drives the middle ritual (adjusting bell angle, whispering fire into crack), and appears in the closure beat ("already recalibrating"). Her modest gifts and earnest belief motivate every on-page action. Two beats: purchasing the bell (backstory) and conducting the drip-ritual (present). Causal pressure: her understanding of tempo and brittle devotion constrains her method. Closure linkage strong: final sentence names her devotion and frames the viaduct's ongoing function. Cost visible: she remains unaware of success, "already counting the next drop." Early signal, multi-beat involvement, irreplaceability, and closure charge push toward high integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The broken ship's bell appears in beat one (junk-shop purchase, paragraph four), is handled on-page in beat two (Elody places palms against it, pushes magic, adjusts angle beneath drip-point), and participates in closure (211th drop seals the crack "with a sound like a gasp"). The crack is both physical flaw and thematic echo of "brittle devotion." Its resonance governs the ritual's success. Early signal, two distinct beats, causal constraint (angle calibration), closure participation, and irreplaceability (the Hymn of Kept Promises name and salt-greened bronze are specific) combine for strong integration. Slight subtraction: the bell's mending feels slightly convenient; earned by tempo logic but borders on symbolic flourish.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Brittle devotion is named in paragraph four, defined as "a commitment so fragile that maintaining it demanded constant, conscious renewal," and explicitly linked to Elody's method (dripping rates, recalibration). It shapes stakes: the Breathing Ledger "required" this quality. The final beat reprises it: "her devotion brittle and unbroken." However, the concept operates more as thematic frame than on-page constraint; Elody's choices would read similarly if the label were absent. Middle development is thematic rather than tactical. Closure linkage present but light; cost is implicit (ongoing labor) rather than a visible trade-off tied to fragility itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Earnestly and without irony" is shown in paragraph two and embodied throughout: Elody weeps with gratitude at graduation, buys the bell because of its name, and proceeds with the ritual despite knowing it looks "absurd." The trait enables her persistence (she does not hedge or second-guess) and imposes cost (she remains unaware of success, cannot see the silver fish). Two beats: the Academy memory and the present ritual. Causal pressure: her naivete allows her to attempt the "impossible." Closure linkage strong: "her naivete the only engine strong enough to haul the world back toward balance." Early signal, irreplaceability, and visible cost yield solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Rebuild" (paragraph six: "Elody intended to rebuild that conversation") frames her goal and is enacted on-page through the drip-ritual: adjusting bell angle, counting drops, matching tone to Return Frequency. The action drives the middle beat (paragraphs 7–11) and delivers closure (crack seals, ocean breathes). Causal pressure: the rebuild depends on understanding tempo. Closure participation direct. Early signal. Two subtractions: the verb "rebuild" is stated once and then shown rather than recurring, and the mechanics (dripping rates) do most of the specificity work. Swappability moderate; "restore" or "restart" would function similarly. Still, the action is indispensable to plot and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dripping rates are introduced in paragraph five ("calibrated…to dripping rates—the precise rhythm at which water fell"), explained as governing "tempo" and "every exchange the world made with itself," and enacted in paragraphs 8–10: Elody counts drops ("one drop every four seconds"), adjusts bell angle "by fractions of degrees," and listens for tone shift toward Return Frequency. The method shapes her tactic and enables closure (211th drop seals crack). Early signal, middle constraint, closure participation. Irreplaceability high: no other mechanism fits the viaduct's ancient engineering. Cost implicit: painstaking calibration. Slightly abstract (the reader never learns what "Return Frequency" sounds like in Hz or felt terms), keeping score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct at dawn anchors paragraph one and recurs in the final beat ("The viaduct gleamed sapphire in the new light"). The setting supplies the drip-point (paragraph 8: "she held the bell beneath the viaduct's nearest drip-point") that enables the ritual, constraining Elody's method. The viaduct's engineering (compressed mineral glass, dripping-rate calibration) is causally active: its tempo governs success. Time of day (dawn, "sky bleed pink," "new light") charges atmosphere and frames renewal. Early signal, middle constraint, closure reprise. Micro-setting (drip-point) is the tactical stage. Cost connection: the viaduct's ancient design is the only path. Irreplaceability and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Timeframe is signaled in the opening line ("The morning the last fish was caught") and recurs in paragraph three (yesterday's mackerel, Eventide trawler). It establishes urgency (ecological collapse) and primes Elody's motivation. However, it does not tighten on-page decisions: the ritual unfolds at natural tempo with no clock pressure. The 211th drop is a counted threshold, not a race against time. Setup and thematic weight present; middle tactical constraint absent. Closure linkage weak: the phrase "for the first time in years" reprises duration but does not depend on "after the last fish" specifically. Functional but replaceable with "after the ocean went silent" or similar. Mid-band for setup + thematic support without escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation ("to right a cosmic imbalance") is stated in paragraph four and dramatized through Elody's ritual: she believes the Breathing Ledger is fractured and acts to restart the return flow. The goal drives every middle beat (adjusting bell, counting drops) and delivers closure (ocean breathes again). Early signal, causal involvement, closure participation. Cost visible: ongoing recalibration, unawareness of success. One subtraction: the motivation is told ("Elody believed this was not merely ecological collapse but cosmic imbalance") rather than discovered through failed prior attempts or conflicted choice. Friction between want and obstacle is light; Elody proceeds without hedging or doubt. Still, the motivation is indispensable and shapes the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tone (plausible impossibility) is established in paragraph one ("most people had stopped listening to water"; Elody's lukewarm magic) and explicitly named in paragraph nine: "plausibility bent around her like light around a dying star, that the impossible sat so close to the reasonable here that neither could be distinguished from the other." The tone modulates with pressure: matter-of-fact detail (dripping rates, tea-temperature warmth) collides with cosmic stakes (Breathing Ledger, last fish). Closure charged: "The two hundred and eleventh drop struck the bell and the crack sealed itself shut with a sound like a gasp"—the moment fuses mundane persistence and miraculous result. Coherent through turns; rhythmic control heightens without obscuring clarity. Minor meta-commentary risk in paragraph nine, but the effect serves.</comment>
