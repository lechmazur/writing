<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is embodied through concrete action (stopping speech three years ago, mailing anonymous scores) and the camera ritual carries interior contradiction effectively. The three-year silence project demonstrates renunciation with visible cost. Dalir remains somewhat flat—his quiet charisma is told more than shown, and his patient waiting feels like a function rather than a lived choice with its own friction. The final decision "I will come back" arrives with thematic charge but minimal on-page struggle in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates meaning through the camera ritual, sign language, and harbor setting, then reweights at closure when Maren agrees to return "as the silence between the notes." Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—options crystallize and the cost (surrendering anonymity, re-entering the world that applauded her) is felt. However, the turn hinges more on Dalir's patient arrival than Maren's active agency in the present scene, which slightly weakens causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The harbor functions as micro-setting, appearing in the opening, middle camera-click on Dalir, and final bell image. The filmless camera is handled twice with purpose and charges the closure through the metaphor of capturing without possessing. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (moonlight, water lapping, warmth off throat). Spatial choreography is clear. The setting doesn't strongly constrain a choice but does supply the resonant final image of the bell and silver water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Maren will return from self-exile to witness her work performed. The tightening occurs when Dalir reveals the harbor piece is being performed, forcing her to choose between continued silence and re-engagement. One meaningful pressure point is present. The cost (surrendering the purity of her project, re-entering a world of sound and recognition) is legible but largely implicit. Escalation is gentle—more an invitation than a crisis—appropriate to the accumulative lens but limiting high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—translating silence into a language that hearing audiences can feel—emerges organically from Maren's project, her mother's deafness, and the visual notation scores. The camera-without-film motif recurs with evolving meaning and charges the closure without stating a moral. "I come back as the silence between the notes" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in gesture and the camera ritual. The final bell ringing once and falling silent is a strong thematic image that reweights prior material. No overt moralizing; the piece trusts particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren. Perceptual signature is present (she maps silence, notices warmth off Dalir's throat). Sign language is rendered cleanly without over-explanation. Psychic distance is consistent. One brief slip: "forgetting himself" when Dalir speaks aloud feels like authorial commentary rather than Maren's perception. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated. The prose reflects Maren's attentiveness without filter-verb stacks. Distance control is strong overall with that single minor lapse mid-scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high. "Joyful sorrow" appears twice in identical phrasing, a minor loop. "She had wanted silence then. Now silence was the only country she inhabited" is elegant but borders on decorative. The opening and closing images are strong. Figurative language ("silence was the only country," "moon tracing a road") is vivid but occasionally leans toward purple without undercutting clarity. Grammar and sequence are clean. No major scaffold or template cadence. Propulsion is steady but the reflective middle slightly slows momentum before Dalir's arrival.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—composer who stops speaking to translate silence into music for hearing audiences—offers a specific, non-obvious angle on disability and art. The camera-without-film detail and visual notation scores are fresh particulars. The emotional truth of grief for surrendered sound and joy for new language feels earned. The harbor setting and Dalir's whisper aesthetic are apt but somewhat familiar. The piece commits fully to its premise. Risk-taking is present in the structure (reflective, quiet ending) and the sign-language frame, though the romantic reunion arc is conventional. Transformation of tropes is solid rather than radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Dalir (whispering advisor) appears only in the second half. His revelation that the harbor piece will be performed creates the story's key turn and forces Maren's choice. However, he functions more as messenger than active character—his own goals and friction are absent. He is present in setup (conservatory past), development (delivers news), and payoff (witnesses her decision), but his choices don't create turns; Maren's response does. "Quietly charismatic" is told, not shown in action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vintage camera with no film is handled in three beats: opening ritual framing the harbor, mid-scene click on Dalir, and the closing metaphor of capturing/releasing. It returns with reweighted meaning at closure ("everything felt"). The camera embodies Maren's philosophy and her mother's teaching, directly shaping the thematic resolution. Early signal is strong. However, the camera doesn't constrain a tactical choice or create visible cost—it functions more as motif than pressure point. Two-of-three gates plus lyric reprise support mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sign language (core concept) shapes stakes and tactics on the page: Maren communicates only in sign, her scores use sign-language cues, and the performed piece includes "a silent signer." It is present in setup (mother's teaching), development (Maren's question to Dalir), and payoff (her project's culmination). The concept drives her three-year project and the scores she mails. It changes options—her refusal of speech defines her exile. Cost is visible: she has severed connection with the hearing world. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" (attribute for Dalir) is mentioned twice but never demonstrated through action. The trait doesn't constrain or enable an on-page choice with cost. He "could hold a room by leaning against a wall" is told backstory; in-scene he delivers information and waits. The whispering detail is more active (he whispers so she leans close) but that's method, not charisma. Label-only use without visible tradeoffs. Functional but replaceable; swappable with "patient" or "attentive" without changing the scene.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Disrupt" (action) appears in Dalir's line: she sends scores "meant to disrupt every assumption about what a concert can be." It frames her project's intent and is present in setup (the mailed scores) and payoff (the harbor piece's visual notation). However, the disruption itself occurs offstage—we don't witness the act of disrupting in scene. The verb colors her motivation but doesn't create a key turn in the present action. Lyric reprise without mid-scene use; functional but not indispensable. Two gates (setup, payoff concept) support mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" (method) is signaled early ("she had learned to map every contour of its terrain") and returns at closure ("I come back as the silence between the notes"). It frames her three-year project: living inside silence to translate it. The method shapes her tactic (stopping speech) and the scores she writes. However, the mechanics of mapping are largely told rather than shown—we don't see her practicing the gesture in scene beyond the camera ritual, which is adjacent. Present in setup, implied in development, echoed at payoff. One gate clearly met, lyric reprise supports mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is present throughout: opening anchor, Dalir's arrival, mid-scene backdrop, and closing bell image. It supplies the "harbor piece" Maren composed there. The moonlight charges the visual atmosphere and the harbor holds the final image ("held them both in its silver indifference"). However, the setting doesn't constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—it functions as resonant backdrop. Micro-setting (body/camera) does more causal work. All three gates present but causal pressure is low. Strong lyric integration supports low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"When no one remembers you" (timeframe) is signaled in the opening ("No one in this city remembered her name") and frames her self-exile. However, it doesn't tighten decisions in the present scene—Dalir remembers her, so the condition is already violated. The timeframe establishes backstory but doesn't create urgency or constrain her choice to return. Setup is present, development and payoff are weak. The story could function identically if she were merely reclusive rather than forgotten. Swappable; functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate silence into music" is dramatized through Maren's three-year speech refusal, the anonymous scores with visual notation, and the harbor piece for string quartet and silent signer. It is present in setup (her project), development (the mailed scores), and payoff (the performed piece). Friction between want (purity of the project) and cost (isolation, anonymity) is visible. Her final choice—returning "as the silence between the notes"—directly engages the motivation with a reconfigured stance. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. The desire shapes multiple beats and the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Joyful sorrow" (tone) is named twice and embodied in the camera ritual ("the old joyful sorrow bloom behind her ribs," "joyful sorrow crest like a wave—grief for the sound she had surrendered, joy for the new language"). The tone is coherent through turns: loss and creation intertwined. It modulates slightly—reflective at opening, charged at closure when the bell rings and falls silent. The final image ("in that silence, she heard everything her mother had ever told her") carries the tone's dual weight. Strong thematic integration and closure charge. Explicit naming slightly reduces subtlety but the embodiment is present.</comment>
