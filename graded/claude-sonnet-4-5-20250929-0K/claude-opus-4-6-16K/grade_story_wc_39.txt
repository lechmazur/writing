<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Milo's motivation is clear and rooted in a concrete past loss (grandmother's unrecorded voice), driving his collection work with embodied specificity. The micro-choices around dawn—opening jars, recording the music box—reveal character under pressure. Internal contradiction remains muted; his epiphany about "gleaned redemption" feels more delivered than dramatized through struggle. The decision to carry the jar to town is consistent but predictable, missing a final complication that would charge the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Milo gathers sounds, then assembles them into a composite jar, then resolves to share it. Orientation anchors quickly (vagrant poet, loft beneath dunes, dawn). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he steps toward town with the jar, crystallizing his role as translator. Cost is implied—social exposure, rejection risk—but the final image ("would have to be enough. It was.") relies on assertion more than dramatized consequence, keeping it shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The feral loft, dunes, and dawn whistle are vivid and purposeful; the music box's corroded green and the gallon pickle jar ground the action. The setting constrains choices (waiting for dawn's whistle, the hatch opening) and charges the final image (sand, path to town). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Milo's vagrant-poet lens. The environment does not supply a complicating obstacle in the closure beat, but it sufficiently shapes the ritual and journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—become the translator between generations—is signaled early and drives the jar collection and dawn recording. One meaningful deepening occurs: finding the music box transforms his work from archival to compositional, adding the "heart note." The town visit decision tightens stakes (exposure, rejection), but the escalation is gentle; no on-page reversal tests his commitment. Cost is implied (social risk, vulnerability) rather than vividly paid in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: "gleaned redemption" is enacted through the jar collection, not stated until it feels inevitable. The music box and composite jar assemble echoes across time, making the translator role concrete. The final image—vagrant with lantern-like jar—resonates without moralizing. "Would have to be enough. It was." risks pat closure, but the preceding sensory work and the "lodged...as absence, as hunger" insight elevate it. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the prompt concept integrates well.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct poetic register ("sandy lung," "salt crystals form on rope left in tidal pools"). Vocabulary is elevated but consistent with a penny poet's interior. No dialogue to test. Filter verbs ("he wanted," "he thought") are used sparingly and voice-motivated. The phrase "positively wistful, sweet in a way that made his chest ache" leans decorative but serves emotional texture. Perceptual signature is clear: metaphor-heavy, attentive to sound and texture, vagrant-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. "The dunes shifted above him like the breathing of some ancient, sandy lung" is vivid but risks purple; "gleaned redemption" and "lonesome splendor" feel slightly algorithmic in their pairing. One paraphrase loop: "This was gleaned redemption" followed by the expanded definition feels like scaffolding. Otherwise, density is high, clarity strong, and no major artifacts obscure causality. The final "It was" risks abruptness but reads intentional.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vagrant poet capturing sounds in jars via scavenged tech is specific and fresh; the music box as "heart note" adds a resonant twist. The "translator between generations" frame transforms the collector trope through lived detail (grandmother's silence, feral loft, dawn whistle ritual). The schoolyard destination and "lodged...as absence, as hunger" line offer earned insight. Risk is present (unconventional method, lyric closure) without obscuring clarity. Proximity to "holding onto what vanishes" narratives is high, but execution individualizes it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vagrant penny poet is signaled early, drives the jar collection, and makes the key dawn-recording and town-visit decisions. His vagrancy and verse history shape his loft choice and scavenging method. The character's choices create the final turn (assembling the composite jar, deciding to share it), though the turn is gentle. Removal would break the story's logic. Two beats (recording, deciding to carry to town) plus closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten music box appears early (second paragraph as backstory cue, detailed in fourth), is physically handled and wound at dawn, and becomes the "heart note" around which the composite jar is organized. Its corroded state and twelve-note melody carry specificity. It drives the dawn recording beat and the decision to create a composite. Present in the final image ("a song that someone's hands had loved"). Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage; swappability is low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gleaned redemption" is named explicitly and governs the accumulative method (gathering discarded sounds, assembling meaning from fragments). It shapes the jar collection and the decision to carry the composite to children. The concept is enacted on the page (scavenging, recording, composing) and charges the final image. However, the phrase itself arrives late (penultimate paragraph) and risks thematic summary. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Positively wistful" modifies the music box's sound once in the middle ("positively wistful, sweet in a way that made his chest ache with longing"). It colors the emotional tone but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. The trait is descriptive, not causal. No reprise at closure; no visible tradeoff tied to wistfulness. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Sweeten" appears once as a verb ("He wanted to sweeten the jar collection with it") and governs the decision to place the music box at the center of the composite. The action is purposeful and drives the dawn recording beat. However, it is interior intention rather than dramatized turn; the actual recording and jar-opening sequence is the enacted beat. Swappable with "anchor" or "center" without major edits. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Capturing sounds in glass jars is introduced early (jar collection, labeled examples), detailed with scavenged-tech mechanics (microphone, speaker in lid, battery power), and drives the dawn recording and composite-jar assembly. The method is specific and irreplaceable; the story's logic collapses without it. It shapes the translator motivation and the final image (jar carried to town). Three beats, high causal pressure, closure participation. Specificity and cost are strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The feral loft beneath the dunes is established early, provides spatial grounding (eastern wall, hatch, cats), and supplies the dawn whistle constraint (wind over dunes). It pressures Milo's timing and isolation. The loft's half-buried concrete and cat presence color the vagrant specificity. However, the setting does not supply a complicating obstacle at closure; the path to town is uncontested. Two beats (jar storage, dawn recording), moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"At dawn's earliest whistle" is named in the opening line and governs the timing of the recording beat. The dawn whistle is detailed (wind changing direction through dune grass, single sustained tone) and Milo waits for it. It tightens one decision but does not recur or escalate; the walk to town is untimed. Functional constraint in one beat, lyric reprise in final image ("morning"), but no live clock after the recording.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to become the translator between generations" is articulated mid-story and rooted in concrete loss (grandmother's unrecorded voice). It drives the jar collection, the composite recording, and the decision to carry the jar to schoolchildren. The desire is dramatized through action (recording, assembling, packing) and friction is present (rejection history, vagrant status). Cost is implied (social exposure) rather than vividly paid. Three beats, strong causal pressure, closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears in the final paragraph and is enacted throughout: the isolated loft, vagrant status, dawn ritual, and the beauty of dunes and dawn light. Tone is coherent across turns (melancholy archival work, wistful music box discovery, hopeful but uncertain town decision) and modulates with pressure (ache, trembling hands, stepping out). The phrase itself risks late label-speak, but the tone charges the final image (lantern metaphor, "would have to be enough").</comment>
