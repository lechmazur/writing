<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is rendered through concrete images (coin pressed into palm, holding sleeping body) and her profession authentically shapes perception. The backstory of her father's arson is handled economically and tilts present action—she becomes a firefighter to transform rather than erase the past. However, the final act lacks a difficult choice under pressure; she performs a rehearsed ritual without internal contradiction or a foreclosed path with visible cost. The closure reads as fulfillment of prior intention rather than alteration earned by scene pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraphs (who, where, when). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Maren journeys to the lagoon, unpacks symbolic objects, performs grafts, and reflects on her father. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she accepts the stillness and defers judgment to spring—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page. No on-page reversal tightens options; she arrives intending to graft and does so without complication. The final image reweights prior material gently but the "cost" (waiting, uncertainty) lacks the sharpness required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is vividly anchored with black glass cliffs, volcanic rock ledges, and a thin channel pulsing with tide. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's firefighter attention (gracefully alert posture, textured bark, cambium pressing). The grafting tools and black sand constrain her actions and charge the final image. The lagoon itself functions as micro-setting, framing her ritual and reflecting sky, coin, and memory without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciling her father's legacy through this grafting ritual—is signaled early and coheres throughout. However, escalation is absent: Maren performs each step (pouring sand, binding grafts, holding coin over water) without friction, complication, or a choice that narrows options. The piece deepens thematically through accumulation of image and memory, but under any lens the protagonist lacks agency that forecloses a path with on-page cost. The closure is acceptance of waiting rather than a decisive turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: fire/water, arson/firefighting, scars/song, graft as theology. The final image (coin warm, black sand settling, peace filling carved spaces) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the silence of her father's gift and the unspoken belief that wounded things can join and heal. The line "scars could sing" risks platitude but is anchored in her profession and the physical act of grafting, lifting it above abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable single third-person limited; Maren's perceptual signature (firefighter's tuned alertness, precise attention to cambium and bark) is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and lyric without slipping into generic elevated register. The phrase "silence had always been its own language, and she had become fluent long ago" is voice-consistent and economical. No head-hopping; psychic distance is intentional and modulates with memory beats. Reflection anchors in present stimuli (coin, sand, lagoon surface) and the prose rhythm breathes naturally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high: most lines serve character, setting, and theme simultaneously. The phrase "the way firefighters learn to be—not tense, but tuned" is precise and economical. Minor deduction for one instance of elevated abstraction in the final third: "the bridge between movements" and "theology" risk reaching past the concrete without immediate payoff. No clarity issues; propulsion is steady if gentle, matching the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The arsonist's-daughter-becomes-firefighter premise is familiar but executed with specificity: black sand from Punaluu, smoke tree cuttings from Chetco Bar fire, Icelandic coin. The grafting metaphor is coherent and non-obvious, grounding theme in horticultural action rather than sentiment. The piece transforms trope through lived detail and avoids generic everywhere setting. However, the ritual structure (journey, unpack, perform, reflect, depart) follows a well-worn template, and the closure—deferring judgment to spring—chooses safety over bold risk. The emotional arc is authentic but predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's identity as arsonist's daughter and firefighter frames the entire piece and motivates the pilgrimage and grafting ritual. Her profession shapes perception (gracefully alert, tuned senses) and her father's legacy drives the thematic question. However, she makes no key choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path on the page; she enacts a pre-decided ritual without complication. Present in setup, development (via reflection), and closure, but her role is executor rather than decider.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Black sand from Punaluu is unpacked early, poured in a deliberate line along the rock ledge, and returns in the final image ("settling into crevices like a message"). It is handled in at least two distinct beats and charges the closure through visual and symbolic weight. The sand's volcanic origin ties to the lagoon's obsidian cliffs, creating textural coherence. However, it does not constrain a choice or shift tactics; its function is atmospheric and symbolic rather than causal. Solid lyric reprise but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" is described early ("lived in her the way water lives in a watershed") and illustrated through backstory (carrying people from fires, holding hands). It shapes her worldview and the grafting metaphor (pressing wounded things together). However, it does not create an on-page conflict or constrain a choice in this scene; no moment where compassion costs her something or forces a trade-off. The concept is thematically present but not dramatized under pressure. Label-heavy and swappable with "resilience" or "grace" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" is illustrated in the opening beat: "not tense, but tuned, every sense open like a door left ajar." It colors her posture and attention throughout (kneeling, unwrapping, binding grafts carefully). The trait is embodied rather than label-only. However, it does not constrain or enable a decisive action with cost; it describes her baseline competence without generating friction. Present in setup and development but no visible tradeoff or tactical shift tied to this specific quality. Functional but replaceable with "calm focus" or "practiced attention."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Grafting is the story's central action: Maren makes the grafts carefully, joining cuttings to rootstock, binding cambium to cambium, and willing the tissue to accept the wounded thing. The act structures the middle section and embodies the theme ("graft the wounded thing onto the living thing and wait"). It drives at least two beats (preparation, execution) and shapes the closure (she will return in spring to check). The grafting cannot be swapped without losing the horticultural specificity and theological metaphor. However, it unfolds without complication or a moment where the graft itself alters her options or imposes cost. Essential to concept and image but not to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The Icelandic coin drilled and strung on red thread appears early (her father's unexplained gift), is handled mid-scene (wound around her wrist, held over the lagoon), and returns in the final image ("coin warm at her wrist"). It is present in setup, development, and closure. The coin carries symbolic weight (silence as language, her father's unspoken inheritance) and is tied to a specific cultural origin. However, its mechanics do not matter; she simply wears it. It could be any heirloom without altering structure. Lyric reprise is purposeful but the object is ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is established early with vivid detail (black glass cliffs, thin channel, volcanic rock ledge) and supplies the literal ground for the grafting ritual. The lagoon's stillness and reflective surface charge the final image ("held everything—her reflection, the sky, the memory of fire—and asked for nothing"). It is present in setup, all middle beats, and closure. The setting frames and amplifies theme but does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Strong atmospheric and symbolic work; however, Maren could perform this ritual at any remote water's edge without fundamental loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"During the migration of clouds" appears as a temporal marker in the title and is described lyrically mid-scene ("Great slow herds of them, pearl and ash-gray, drifting south"). The timeframe recurs in the final third ("clouds continued overhead, unhurried"). It establishes season (late autumn) and tone (patience, drift). However, it does not tighten decisions; there is no clock or deadline. The clouds function as atmospheric motif rather than pressure device. Present but vague; easily replaceable with "at dusk" or "in autumn stillness." Ornamental reprise without escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To prove that scars can sing" is dramatized through Maren's history (becoming a firefighter to transform her father's arson) and the grafting metaphor (pressing wounded branches together). The line "The scars could sing. She believed this the way she believed in gravity" anchors motivation in embodied conviction. The desire shapes the ritual and the final acceptance ("the stillness was enough"). However, there is no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost or fear; she enacts the belief without resistance. Present in setup and closure with thematic coherence but no dramatized conflict that tests commitment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" is embodied in rhythm and image: slow clouds, still lagoon, Maren sitting back on her heels, breath and salt air filling carved spaces. Tone is coherent from opening (gracefully alert) through closure (stillness was enough) and modulates subtly with memory beats (father's hands, sirens, smoke) without breaking the meditative frame. The final image charges this tone with gentle weight. However, the single static mood—contemplative calm—never shifts under pressure; no escalation or complication disturbs the drift. Purposeful and consistent but mid-high band due to lack of tonal tension or earned modulation.</comment>
