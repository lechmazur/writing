<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is rich and embodied—"shrewdly innocent" shows in her unguarded eyes and tactical empathy. Her motivation to translate Ratu's cast into "a new story" is concrete and driven by parallel trauma architecture. The anesthetic's encroachment provides physical constraint, and her micro-choice to write despite sedation feels earned. Minor issue: the shared wound insight edges toward therapeutic clarity, but it stays grounded in concrete sensory recall (bunker ceiling, coral ridges as braille).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lena commits to writing the story and climbing to the ward tomorrow, foreclosing retreat with visible cost—she writes "under" anesthesia, holding consciousness through will. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: coral/cast/translation motifs deepen through the piece and the final image (coral as "porous heart") reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. Orientation is prompt (atrium, twilight, post-surgery) and the causal thread—coral → cast photos → decryption → new story—holds without breaks. Cost is felt: she trades rest for the boy's need.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is vivid and functionally micro-setting: the louvers, orchids, and fog anchor her choice to avoid the bunker-like recovery ward. The coral fragment becomes tactile setting—its ridges like braille, pressed to lips—and charges the closure image. Fiji locale is signaled through Pijin/Roviana fragments and "Suva rehabilitation hospital." Minor gap: the atrium's spatial choreography (table, chair, IV line logistics) could be sharper, but the body and object constraints are clear enough.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: translate Ratu's cast to give him "a new story for his arm." Pressure tightens through the anesthetic's physical countdown and the emotional weight of the decrypted phrases ("MI WANTEM NIUFALA STORI"). The escalation is textural—density of shared trauma, mounting urgency—and driven by Lena's agency: she chooses to write despite sedation, foreclosing the path of passive rest. Cost is visible: she holds consciousness at a price, and the act redefines her role from passive patient to active translator again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—grafting new meaning onto irreparable wounds—emerges organically from the coral's fossil-like permanence, Ratu's cast-as-canvas, and Lena's translational vocation. The final image (coral as "porous heart" shaped by what passes through) answers the thematic question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the smudged Pijin notes and Lena's throat-tightening recognition. No overt thesis; the lotus-hearted ache modulates naturally with pressure. Very slight demerit: "proof that even the hardest things can be shaped" skirts direct statement, but it reads as image-driven reflection rather than sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight psychic distance; Lena's perceptual signature is distinct (translator's lens, shrewdly innocent observation). Diction stays within her register: "fog inside her skull," "architecture of his fear," "braille for a language not yet invented." No head-hopping. The prose modulates with anesthetic encroachment—softening edges, "lotus-hearted ache"—without losing clarity. Minor slip: "operating rooms do" in the opener is a slight omniscient tell, but the rest stays character-bound. No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is mostly controlled ("fossilized thought," "braille for a language not yet invented"). Information density is high; sentences often do double duty (coral as object and thematic vehicle). Minor overwriting in the opener: "suspended between one state of being and another" is abstractly elegant but slows entry. A few filter verbs ("she recognized," "she possessed") where immediacy would help, and "lotus-hearted in its ache" risks purple but stays voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sequence clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—translator decrypting a child's cast under anesthesia to rewrite trauma—is specific and non-obvious. The coral as recurring motif with shifting charge (gift → braille → porous heart) feels earned. Risk: the piece leans heavily on reflection and lyricism, which could flatten momentum, but the textural escalation and concrete object-work prevent mere abstraction. Slight proximity echo to "translator as bridge-builder" templates; the Pacific conflict-zone setting and Pijin fragments add freshness, but the emotional through-line (shared wounds, new stories) is familiar territory executed with care rather than transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's profession shapes every beat: her shrewdly innocent gaze, her decryption skillset applied to the cast, her conviction that translation can graft new meaning. Her choice to write despite anesthesia is the story's hinge. Present in setup (conflict-zone history), middle (decryption work), and closure (writing the new story). Causal pressure and irreplaceability are high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The coral appears in setup (Ratu's gift with scratched plea), is handled and examined mid-scene ("pressed to her lips," ridges like braille), and charges the closure image ("small, porous heart" shaped by passage). Three distinct beats; specificity (brain coral, Pacific origin, ridged texture) matters. It constrains Lena's symbolic thinking and enables the thematic payoff. Cost connection: it embodies the irreparable-yet-transformable stake.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Shared anxieties—numbness then unbearable sensation, body as foreign country—shape Lena's recognition of Ratu's phrases and drive her commitment to write. The concept is dramatized through parallel bunker memory and cast decryption. It alters her stance from passive patient to active re-narrator. Present across beats but not as tight a causal engine as character or object; it functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is labeled early and shown in her unguarded eyes that disarm warlord and widow. It enables her empathy for Ratu and her ability to hold contradictory views (trauma architecture). But it does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost; it colors perception without creating a tactical tradeoff. Mentioned in setup, informs middle tone, but does not pivot a beat. Functional but mid-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Unknot" frames the central action: she decrypts the smudged Pijin notes ("unknot them, one phrase at a time"). The verb is specific and recurs; it drives the middle sequence and enables the closure decision to write a new story. Removing "unknot" would require substantial rewrite; it defines her method and mirrors her translator vocation. Present in all three gates; causal role in two beats (decryption, story-writing).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method—decrypting smudged notes on the cast—is signaled early (coral inscription "PLIS RIDIM ARM BLONG MI"), enacted mid-scene (phone photos, phrase-by-phrase translation), and shapes the ending (she writes a new story for the cast). The mechanics matter: Pijin/Roviana fragments, sweat-smudged ink, her translator skillset. The method is irreplaceable and drives two beats. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The atrium constrains Lena's choice (refuge from bunker-like recovery ward) and provides sensory texture (mist, orchids, louvers). It is present in setup and frames the entire scene. However, it does not alter tactics after the opening or reappear with reweighted charge at closure; the final image pivots on coral and written story, not place. Functional but not indispensable; a hospital garden could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The anesthetic timeframe tightens pressure throughout: "warm tide climbing," "mist thickened," "lotus-hearted ache," "pen slowed but did not stop." It constrains Lena's agency (she must finish before sedation overcomes her) and charges the closure beat (she writes against the clock). Present in all three gates; it shapes middle choices and ending cost. Strong causal role, though the exact elapsed time remains vague.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The motivation—graft new meaning onto old wounds—is dramatized concretely: Ratu's plea for "a new story for my arm," Lena's throat-tightening recognition, her decision to write despite sedation. It drives the core conflict (translate trauma into transformation) and shapes the closure act. Friction between want (rest) and need (answer the boy's plea) is visible. Cost is paid on the page: she holds consciousness at a price. Present in all gates; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" is a tonal phrase that appears late but names the affective texture sustained throughout: tenderness under pressure, beauty laced with cost. The tone modulates with anesthetic encroachment (softening, deepening) and charges the closure image (porous heart, gentle pull). It is consistent across turns and coherent with the mist/coral/translation imagery. Not mechanical or static, but the phrase itself arrives past midpoint, limiting its structural role.</comment>
