<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper is defined primarily through abstract traits ("grips reality loosely," "discipline to witness change without judgment") that remain largely declarative rather than tested under pressure. Her core contradiction—between witnessing without judgment and the emotional pull of the swan/river quest—is seeded but never dramatized as a choice with visible cost. The final decision to "write nothing" reads as thematic statement rather than earned renunciation that forecloses a path. Interiority relies heavily on elevated philosophical register ("regenerative silence," "loss completed its circuit") that fits the narrator but lacks embodied contradiction in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates observations across untold seasons toward the obsidian refuge discovery, then closes with the choice to write nothing—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the keeper relinquishes her chronicle role with felt cost. Orientation is delayed: "who" arrives quickly but "when" and concrete spatial anchors drift until the catacombs are named (~10% in); the vague timeframe and underground setting are eventually clarified, so I waive the Orientation Test penalty. Closure cost is visible in the lamp guttering and the act of folding the swan back, foreclosing further passage. One meaningful deepening: the transition from recording silence to becoming it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The overgrown library, catacombs, and obsidian refuge supply a coherent micro-setting that constrains the keeper's movement (burrowing, limited lamp light) and charges the final image (black water, reflective glass). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: roots through spines, moss on manuscripts, translucent origami paper, the slow black river. The obsidian structure's "silence gathering itself" directly shapes the keeper's realization and choice to stop writing. Spatial choreography is clear across the descent, and the recurring lamp anchors continuity from reading chamber to river.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether the keeper will find/understand what the swan is leading her toward. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening—the final fold reveals the river and obsidian refuge—but pressure remains atmospheric rather than escalating through choices that narrow options. The keeper's actions (burrowing, unfolding the swan, sitting in silence) lack visible trade-offs or conflicting pulls; she moves toward the river without obstacles or internal friction. The closure forecloses further passage by folding the swan, yet the cost feels thematic rather than tactical. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but agency is passive observation rather than decision under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—loss completing its circuit to become potential—emerges organically from the keeper's descent and the regenerative silence motif, culminating in her choice to let silence keep its own record. The final image (guttering lamp, faint reflection, folding the swan) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. Subtext operates through the swan's cryptic folds and the obsidian refuge as a transition space. Minor slip: "which was enough, which was everything, which was exactly the kind of knowledge" in the final line edges toward overt articulation of theme, though it remains within the keeper's voice and doesn't fully moralize.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV narration maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the keeper notices texture over dates, silence varieties, fossils of intention. Diction is elevated and philosophical ("composted by time," "regenerative silence," "loss completed its circuit") but remains consistent and character-apt for an underground chronicler. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Minor issue: in peak beats (the obsidian chamber discovery, final reflection), the prose leans heavily on abstract philosophy ("boundaries dissolved into a single hum," "crumbling was itself a kind of regeneration") rather than grounding epiphany in concrete sensory shifts, risking a small distance slip under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and many lines do double duty (e.g., "She gripped reality loosely, the way one holds a bird" anchors both trait and voice). Information density is generally high. However, the piece exhibits mild figurative density in descriptive passages ("mineral tears," "fossils of intention," "bird that might die of fright") without always advancing pressure, and the final paragraph contains paraphrase loops: "which was enough, which was everything, which was exactly the kind of knowledge" restates satisfaction three times. The "crumbling peace" motif in the last beat is declared rather than shown through image. No severe artifacts, but cumulative drag lowers momentum slightly in non-closure moves.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of underground chronicler, origami-as-navigation-tool, and regenerative silence offers a fresh angle on archival-quest material, avoiding pure allegory by grounding the keeper's method in concrete acts (burrowing, unfolding, cataloging). The obsidian refuge and the choice to write nothing provide non-obvious closure. The piece resists easy moral resolution and commits fully to its premise. Minor limitation: the keeper's passive observation and the abstract philosophical register trend toward a meditative essay rather than a narrative with high-stakes choices, reducing the sense of risk and urgency that would elevate originality further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Character present throughout. The chronicle keeper's choices—descending deeper, unfolding the swan, sitting in the obsidian refuge, writing nothing—are on the page but largely observational. The final choice to fold the swan and return without writing is the closest to a decision with cost, yet it feels thematic rather than a turn that redefines tactics or options. The keeper does not face conflicting pulls or a visible trade-off that would demonstrate higher causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Object present in setup (obsidian refuge introduced at the river discovery, ~60% in), development (the keeper sits inside, experiences the different silence, understands the circuit), and payoff (the refuge's silence shapes her choice to write nothing and fold the swan). Two beats: entry and realization, plus the resolution beat where she leaves. The late introduction (~60%) and primarily atmospheric function lower the score; the refuge enables insight but does not constrain action with hard trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Concept present early ("regenerative silence") and threaded throughout: the keeper catalogues silence's varieties, the obsidian refuge holds "regenerative silence in its purest form," and the final crumbling peace is itself regeneration. The concept shapes the keeper's understanding and motivates her final choice to let silence keep its own record. However, it functions more as theme than as a force that narrows options or creates tactical pressure. The concept reweights meaning at closure (lyric reprise) but does not drive distinct beats with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Attribute present early ("She gripped reality loosely") and restated in the obsidian chamber ("she let reality loosen further"). It colors the keeper's perceptual style (facts "softened," dates less important than texture) but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait remains largely descriptive rather than forcing a trade-off or mistake. No beat where gripping reality loosely costs her an opportunity or creates friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Action present in setup (keeper burrows through collapsed corridors each morning) and development (she burrows back after the river visit). Burrowing defines her method, distinguishes her from a passive archivist, and is embodied on the page ("moved earth with bare hands, packing it behind her"). It appears in two distinct beats and contributes to the tactile, committed texture of the piece. However, the action does not create a key turn or trade-off; she burrows without obstacles or competing priorities, so it remains essential to character but not to plot pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Method present early (swan found decades/centuries ago, described in detail with "cryptic folds within folds") and used functionally: unfolding a layer reveals a new corridor, the deepest fold leads to the river. The swan appears in three beats: introduction on the desk, the revelation of the river passage, and the final folding-back. It enables the keeper's navigation and is reweighted at closure (folding = promise of future passage). The mechanics matter and are specific. Late first functional use (~40% for the river reveal) and primarily enabling rather than constraining lower the score slightly below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting present from the opening (overgrown library in catacombs) and sustained throughout. It constrains the keeper's movement (she must burrow, carries a lamp, works in darkness) and supplies the resources that shape her understanding (buried texts, roots through spines, the underground river). The catacombs frame the entire quest and the obsidian refuge within them is the closure site. The setting is indispensable to the story's logic and appears in all three gates: setup, development (she moves through it), and payoff (the river and refuge are within the catacombs). The library's decay mirrors the theme of regenerative loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Timeframe present early ("across the drift of untold seasons," "decades ago, or centuries") and restated ("seven thousand volumes," "untold seasons"). It establishes the keeper's long tenure and the scope of her work, contributing to atmosphere and scale. However, the vague, stretching quality of time does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the keeper operates without urgency or deadline. The timeframe is ornamental rather than causal—easily swappable with any long duration. No beat where time pressure alters her tactics or choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation present early ("to witness change without judgment") and restated throughout ("she had recorded none of it with grief," "that was the discipline"). It defines the keeper's stance and is tested at closure when she chooses to write nothing, letting silence keep its own record. The motivation shapes the final choice, creating a lyric reprise (early principle → final enactment). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflict; no scene where the keeper is tempted to judge or grieve and must resist. The closure beat reweights the principle but does not show friction between competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone present throughout: the library shelves buckle, ink fades, walls weep; the obsidian chamber holds "the silence of something gathering itself"; the final beat explicitly names "the peace in that chamber was already crumbling, as all peace must, but its crumbling was itself a kind of regeneration." Tone is coherent and modulates subtly from decay to gathering to crumbling-as-regeneration, charging the final image. The explicit articulation of "crumbling peace" in the final paragraph trends toward declaration rather than embodied image, preventing a higher score. The tone is purposeful and fits the concept but lacks the restraint that would let the image carry the effect alone.</comment>
