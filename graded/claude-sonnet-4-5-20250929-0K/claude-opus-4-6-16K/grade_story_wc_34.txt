<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is specific and embodied—"driftingly alert, half-dreaming" shapes her perception and seven years of silence creates genuine constraint. The decision to sing after deciphering Elin's need is motivated by shared isolation and earns the breakthrough. Internal conflict between isolation-by-choice and the hunger for connection drives the arc. Minor slip: Elin's backstory is told rather than discovered through dramatized beats, softening the causal pressure of her presence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (mutual recognition through art) with visible cost—both women must break their silence through encoded beauty rather than plain speech. The courtyard-as-gallery image at the end reweights the opening isolation with undeniable emotional pressure. Storm-to-storm structure teaches the pattern early; the anomaly reports in the final paragraph confirm the reconfiguration has spread beyond the tower. One meaningful deepening (discovery to reply) is sufficient at this length and the cost is legible in the shift from "unheard ballads" to "singing through the infrastructure."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The misty courtyard constrains action—graffiti appears only when lightning thins the electromagnetic veil, the flower press is a tool that unlocks meaning, and the stone walls become a charged canvas. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "mist curled through the colonnade each morning like something curious and alive" reflects POV filter without tour-guide excess. The courtyard's spatial logic (western wall, eastern wall, supply room) tracks cleanly. The setting charges the final image: a gallery of mutual need made visible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: articulating unspoken need. One meaningful tightening: discovering Elin's encoded plea forces Maren to choose between maintained isolation and reciprocal vulnerability. The cost is visible—singing after seven years forecloses the safety of silence. Agency is active: Maren deciphers, aligns the bolt plate, paints reply murals, and finally sings. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, consistent with the inferred lens. No antagonist required; the pressure arises from the protagonist's internal contradiction between connection-hunger and protective silence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: isolation, encoded longing, beauty as the language of the unsayable. The flower-press bolt plate and painted murals are not symbolic checklists but the story's structural through-line—each recurrence reweights meaning. The ending offers a non-literal answer: two women find audience in each other through art, not declaration, and the anomaly reports confirm the transformation without stating a moral. "The wonder of it was small and handmade, like a tinkerer's music box: improbable, delicate, and turning still" charges the closure with quiet resonance. No overt thesis or thematic echo; complexity lives in the shared need to articulate indirectly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "driftingly alert," "tinkering devotion," "quiet wonder." Diction remains character-particular—technical care blends with lyric compression ("held-breath moment between the flash and the thunder's answer"). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Compression is purposeful and taught early: "She spent the night deciphering it" economically bridges discovery to outcome. Final sentence's rhythm and syntax ("improbable, delicate, and turning still") modulate to match closure's tonal shift without register drift. Minor density note: a few filter verbs ("she recognized," "she saw") in mid-passage, but they do not flatten peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Sentence rhythm varies naturally and paragraph structure supports escalation. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. One small friction: "ancient stone that had been bare that morning" uses passive where active syntax would tighten. "The mist swirled into shapes that might have been a woman listening" risks mild abstraction but earns its place as closure image. Figurative language ("mist curled...like something curious and alive") is selective and controlled. Zero template cadence or synonym churn. Clarity holds throughout; propulsion is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ghost-in-code premise is fresh within the "isolated operator" frame; graffiti as electromagnetic-thinned signal is a non-obvious synthesis. The flower press as cipher key and encoded murals as reply-chain show ingenuity in execution. Emotional truth (mutual need for articulation) anchors the speculative conceit. One friction: the anomaly reports at the end feel like a mechanical closure-proof rather than an inevitable consequence. The transformation test passes—plot and arc depend on these exact particulars. Risk is present (encoded communication as primary action) and heightens stakes without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and makes the key choice to sing at closure, breaking seven years of silence. Early setup: "seldom-heard balladeer by choice and by circumstance." Development: she deciphers, aligns the press, and paints reply murals. Closure participation: the decision to sing is the story's final beat and reweights all prior material. Causal pressure is clear—her isolation and need to articulate drive every turn. Cost is visible: forfeiting safety of silence. Irreplaceable within the logic; another role would break the "balladeer" motif. Two integration signals: beat involvement (deciphering, painting, singing) and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate appears in beat two (discovery in supply room) and beat three (aligned against mural to decode). Early signal: introduced as "a relic from some previous keeper" with engraved pattern. Development: its mechanics matter—aligning grooves with painted stems unlocks Elin's full message. Closure linkage: the decoded message drives Maren's final choice to sing. Causal pressure: without the press, the mural remains opaque and no reply cycle begins. Cost connection: understanding the cipher imposes the obligation to answer. High irreplaceability; the engraved pattern is unique to this object and this story's logic. Three integration signals present: setup, development, closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ghost-in-code concept shapes stakes from inciting incident to closure. Early signal: "ghost in the code" discovered during storm in first third. Development: Elin's presence as signal-pattern constrains Maren's tactics—communication must occur when the electromagnetic veil thins. Closure participation: the anomaly reports confirm the concept's reach and validate mutual transformation. Causal pressure: the concept redefines isolation and enables the encoded-art mechanic. Specificity: Elin "dissolved" into the signal equipment, existing "as pattern, as frequency." Cost: acknowledgment of the ghost compels response and breaks Maren's self-imposed silence. Three gates and high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" is signaled early: "She moved through it in her usual state—driftingly alert, half-dreaming but catching every shift in wind pressure." Development: the trait enables her to notice the anomalous signal during the storm—a character who was not attuned to subtle shifts would miss the inciting incident. Closure linkage: weaker; the trait colors her perception throughout but does not visibly constrain the final choice to sing. Cost is implicit—sustained vigilance over seven years of isolation. One beat with causal involvement; lyric presence but not central to the ending. Two gates (setup, development); third gate (closure) is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Encoding is the story's central action. Early signal: Maren deciphers encoded graffiti in first third. Development: she encodes her own reply murals—"song lyrics hidden in the geometry of painted constellations"—in beats three and four. Closure participation: the anomaly reports describe "fragments of melody woven into the data stream," confirming encoding as the means of transformation. Causal pressure: every major turn (discovery, understanding, reply, singing) involves encoding or decoding. Cost: encoding requires breaking silence and risking vulnerability. High irreplaceability—swapping "encode" for another verb breaks the ghost-in-code logic and the cipher-press mechanic. All three gates with strong closure linkage and cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Messages encoded in graffiti art are signaled early: the mural of flowers with "dots and dashes" threading meaning into stems. Development: the method constrains tactics—Maren must align the bolt plate to decode, then paint her own murals to reply. Closure participation: "The courtyard became a gallery of mutual need made visible" crystallizes the method as the story's emotional core. Causal pressure: the method is the only means of communication between ghost and operator. Specificity: flowers as language, pigments from lichen, geometry of constellations. Cost: the method requires artistry and patience, rejecting direct speech. All three gates; high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The misty courtyard is present throughout and shapes action. Early signal: introduced in opening ("courtyard floated above a permanent sea of clouds"). Development: the western and eastern walls become the canvas for encoded murals; the supply room houses the flower press. Closure participation: "in a courtyard where lightning and thunder traded secrets" anchors the final image. Causal pressure: the setting's elevation and electromagnetic environment enable the ghost's communication—graffiti appears only during storms. Micro-setting (stone walls, mist) constrains choices. Cost: isolation of the floating outpost is the condition of both problem and solution. Three gates with moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Between lightning and thunder" is signaled early: "in that held-breath moment between the flash and the thunder's answer." Development: the timeframe constrains when Elin can reach through to paint. Closure linkage: the phrase returns in the final paragraph—"where lightning and thunder traded secrets"—reweighting the opening. Causal pressure: moderate; the timeframe is a condition of the ghost's communication but does not tighten a decision in real time. Cost is implicit—Maren must wait for storms, and urgency is muted by the accumulative structure. Two gates (setup, closure reprise); middle development is weak. Lyric resonance elevates but causal role is secondary.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The motivation to articulate unspoken needs drives the entire arc. Early signal: Maren "composed every day" but "had not sung for anyone in seven years." Development: Elin's encoded message reveals she "had needed someone to hear her and had not known how to ask." Closure participation: Maren's decision to sing is the direct fulfillment of this motivation, forging mutual recognition. Causal pressure: shared need creates the bond and compels reply. Cost: articulation requires breaking protective silence with visible vulnerability. Internal friction: "Ballads about connection written by someone who connected to no one." High irreplaceability; the motivation is the thematic and causal spine. Three gates with strong cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tinkersong wonder is coherent from opening ("tinkering devotion, with quiet wonder at the fact that any of it worked at all") through closure ("The wonder of it was small and handmade, like a tinkerer's music box"). Tone modulates under pressure—curiosity deepens to recognition—without breaking voice. Development: the tone supports discovery beats (deciphering, aligning the press) and charges the reply cycle. Closure participation: the final sentence crystallizes the tone as wonder at improbable connection. Minor slip: "tinkersong" as compound is not explicitly taught, so the reader infers rather than recognizes the coined term. Two strong positives (setup, closure) with consistent modulation; high coherence but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>
