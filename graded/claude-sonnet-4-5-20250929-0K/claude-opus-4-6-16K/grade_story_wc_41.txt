<comment>Morrow's interiority is richly embodied—his "precognitively forgetful" gift, the stiff hands, the chalk-marking compulsion all anchor concrete choices under pressure. The relationship with his daughter is sketched through absence ("stopped calling") and supplies emotional weight without demanding on-page interaction. The final act of holding the frequency "inside his chest and did not let go" earns a moment of endurance with visible cost (he knows he will forget), though the choice to close his eyes and accept ephemerality could press harder against a live alternative to fully satisfy the 8+ gate.</comment>

<comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when clearly in the opening beat, teaches a pattern of fog-shapes and chalk circles, then deepens through the driftwood markers converging toward the frequency hunt. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Morrow hears the frequency, marks the circle, and holds the sound "inside his chest" knowing he will forget—a crystallization of endurance with felt cost ("another echo to cling to"). The fog exhales, the circle remains: cost is visible in the transience he accepts. One meaningful tightening (the convergence of six markers at the doorway shape) narrows focus and the final image reweights the opening motif of clinging to echoes with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<comment>The fog sculpture garden constrains the entire narrative: its ephemeral forms shape Morrow's search and the doorway motif delivers the frequency. The chalk marks on stone, the driftwood arrows, the bluff paths, and the gray breathing ocean all function as micro-setting elements that guide choices and charge the final image. Sensory selection (sub-audible hum, salt-bleached limbs, marine fog) is filtered through Morrow's long familiarity and urgency. The garden's ephemerality directly pressures his need to capture and mark, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: capturing the acoustic signature of aging before it dissolves, signaled early and sustained throughout. The arranging of driftwood markers deepens pressure by creating a directed search pattern that converges at the fog doorway. The final choice—drawing the chalk circle and holding the frequency despite knowing he will forget—narrows options (clinging to an echo he cannot keep) with visible emotional cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the six markers converge and the doorway appears, raising the stakes in the moment. The cost is felt and legible on the page, though the decision to accept transience rather than fight it trends toward endurance more than a high-stakes trade-off, keeping the score just under 8.0.</comment>

<comment>Theme (the sound of time metabolizing a life, the act of clinging to echoes) emerges from concrete particulars: the unwatched videotapes, the chalk circles, the driftwood arrows, the fog doorway. The frequency "the sound of something that had once been loud learning to be quiet" offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The final image—fog exhaling, circle remaining—resonates as both loss and preservation, reweighting the premise that prophecy passes through him like radio signals. No thematic echo or label-speak intrudes; the closing beats trust image and implication.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice is distinct: "precognitively forgetful," "clinging to echoes—that was what his life had become," and the perceptual signature (noticing fog shapes as future faces, hearing the hush of unwatched tapes) are character-particular. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming into the frequency hunt at the end). Diction stays within Morrow's plausible lexicon; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear. One brief phrase—"longing as a form of navigation"—hovers near abstraction but remains voice-motivated and doesn't disrupt the textured specificity elsewhere, keeping the score solidly in the 8-range without reaching 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Information density is high: nearly every line advances character, search, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally (short declaratives at key beats, longer descriptive passes during setup). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; metaphors (fog as sculptor, frequency as "thermal trace," driftwood as language) are coherent and specific. A few figurative constructions cluster in the middle third ("the timeframe of his search existed amid the hush of old videotapes left unwatched"), which reads slightly elevated but remains legible and voice-motivated. No artifacts touch the closure beat; propulsion is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—precognitive forgetting × ephemeral fog art × acoustic signature of aging—is specific and non-obvious, with each element interdependent. The premise transforms the "prophet" trope by making foresight useless and devastating, and the fog garden as setting without sculptor inverts expectation. The driftwood-as-arrow-language and the frequency hunt feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking (elliptical temporality, lyric accumulation, no dialogue) heightens stakes and thematic resonance without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its melancholy stance and follows its implications to the final image, earning strong originality marks and a +0.3 within-band adjustment for coherent risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Morrow ("junkyard prophet") appears immediately, drives the search across beats (chalk-marking, driftwood arranging, frequency locating), and makes the final choice to hold the sound despite knowing he will forget. His agency (endurance, attention) forecloses the path of refusal and charges the closure. Present in setup, middle, and payoff; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Cost is tied to his trait (forgetting) and visible on the page. Specificity is high; no near-substitute would preserve the precognitive-forgetful layer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Chalk introduced early ("carrying a piece of plain chalk in his coat pocket"), used to mark fog sculptures across beats ("drawing circles on the stone ground"), and returns at closure ("pressed the chalk to the stone beneath the fog doorway and drew his circle"). The act of marking echoes becomes the story's spine. Present in setup, middle, and ending; causal involvement (preserving ephemeral forms) shapes tactics. The chalk's evolving symbolic weight (from record-keeping tool to gesture of acceptance) reweights the final image. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>"Clinging to echoes" is explicitly named mid-story and operationalized throughout: chalk circles as proof, unwatched videotapes as louder silence, driftwood markers as directional language, holding the frequency he knows he will forget. The concept shapes stakes (capturing the ephemeral) and tactics (marking, arranging, listening) on the page, altering every choice Morrow makes. Present early, developed across beats, and anchored in the closure image ("the circle remained"). Causal pressure, cost connection, and closure linkage all strong; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Precognitively forgetful" is introduced in the second paragraph, dramatized through past examples (cannery collapse, trawler, boatyard fire), and constrains the final choice: Morrow holds the frequency knowing "he would forget this too." The trait enables the story's central irony (prophecy as loss) and imposes visible cost (no useful warning, devastating memory). Present in setup, shapes middle reflections, and charges the ending. Causal pressure and cost connection are clear, but the trait operates more as frame than repeated action-driver in individual beats, keeping it mid-6s rather than higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"Locate a particular sound" is introduced early ("trying to locate a particular sound"), drives the driftwood-marker arranging (directional navigation toward the frequency), and culminates in the fog-doorway beat where he hears and holds the hum. Present in setup, enables middle tactics, and delivers the closure moment. Causal linkage strong; the action is irreplaceable (searching for the acoustic signature is the story's engine). Cost tied to the act of locating something he cannot keep. High integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Driftwood markers introduced mid-story ("arranging driftwood as directional markers along the bluff paths"), explained as "an arrow system legible only to someone who understood longing as a form of navigation," and pay off when "six driftwood markers converged" at the fog doorway where the frequency appears. The method shapes the search pattern and enables the climactic location. Present in setup (~30% mark, slightly late), causal in middle, and closure-adjacent (convergence triggers the doorway). One functional beat plus payoff; specificity high but late introduction and single-beat involvement cap the score in the upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The fog sculpture garden frames every beat: its ephemeral forms drive the chalk-marking compulsion, the bluff paths provide the terrain for driftwood markers, and the garden's center hosts the fog doorway where the frequency is heard. Setting constrains choices (transience demands marking, convergence enables locating) and charges the final image ("dissolving garden," "fog exhaled"). Present from the opening line, pressures tactics throughout, and delivers the closure location. High causal involvement, closure linkage, and irreplaceability; no other setting would preserve the ephemeral-art layer.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"Amid the hush of old videotapes left unwatched" appears as a temporal-emotional anchor in the middle section, evoking the specific silence of recorded-but-unplayed moments. The timeframe colors Morrow's search (past losses, present fading) and reappears implicitly in the final acceptance of forgetting. Present in the middle third, thematically resonant, but does not tighten a live clock or alter on-page tactics in real time. Functions as mood and metaphor more than a pressure mechanism, placing it in mid-5s: lyric reprise with cost but no beat-level constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Morrow's desire "to capture the sound of growing older" is introduced early, dramatized through chalk-marking and driftwood arranging, and tested at closure when he hears the frequency but knows he will forget it. The motivation is conflicted (wanting to hold what cannot be held) and drives every choice. Present in setup, enables middle tactics, and shapes the ending's cost (holding the sound "and did not let go" despite futility). Causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection all strong. Friction between want (capture) and reality (ephemerality) is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>Tonal longing suffuses every image: the fog garden without sculptor, the videotapes left unwatched, the chalk circles as proof of what has dissolved, the "sound of a wave that has already broken continuing to move toward shore." Tone modulates subtly (reflective in backstory beats, acute in the frequency hunt, elegiac at closure) and charges the final image ("fog exhaled / the circle remained"). Coherent through turns, rhythmically controlled under pressure, and integral to the story's emotional architecture. No single static mood; longing intensifies and crystallizes at the end, satisfying the high-band test.</comment>
