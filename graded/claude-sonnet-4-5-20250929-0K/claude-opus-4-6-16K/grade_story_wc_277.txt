<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marguerite's interior logic is grounded in her observational nature and the contradiction methodology she applies to her father's legacy. The decision to send the envelope to Dao carries visible cost—three years of private ritual becomes public intervention. Minor weakness: the shift from private observatory work to active intervention could show more internal friction or hesitation in the moment of choice, though the backstory establishes the pattern of avoidance she's breaking.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis breaking into action): Marguerite moves from private tallying to public intervention with the mailed envelope, and the final image reweights silence versus disclosure. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—the three-year pattern of charting regrets culminates in one decisive shift with felt cost (ending her observatory of conscience). Orientation anchors quickly (observatory, post-call, Marguerite alone). One meaningful deepening: the phone call forces a choice that her logbook ritual had deferred.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory at eleven thousand feet with clouds below and the echoing dome creates vivid atmospheric pressure. The brass holder, rosewood nib, and logbook are handled tactilely across beats. The valley lights of Lansdell County charge the telescope moment. Spatial coherography remains clear throughout. Does not quite reach 8+ because while the altitude and dome echo contribute to tone, they don't materially constrain the core choice to mail the envelope—she could have made that decision in any isolated workspace.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether to intervene and break silence) is signaled early via Dao's call and Marguerite's habitual deflection. One meaningful tightening: recognizing Dao's voice carries "the tremor of someone who suspects a hidden truth" crystallizes the cost of continued silence and compels the envelope. The proof-by-contradiction sequence demonstrates agency through method. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: ending three years of private ritual and exposing her father's suppressed stories. Does not reach 8+ because the opposition is largely internal/historical rather than live dramatic pressure in the present window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: the orbits-of-regret metaphor, the rosewood nib used to chart and then expose suppression, the contrast between stars' "blind reliable gravity" and human conscience. The final image—truth descending toward a mailbox—offers a resonant answer to whether silence or disclosure serves justice, without overt moralizing. The proof-by-contradiction method embodies the theme of rigorous truth-seeking. Subtext operates in the nib's false origin story and Marguerite's "grim smile" at dismantling her father's architecture. Avoids the thematic-echo trap; no character articulates the premise in prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Marguerite with consistent psychic distance and perceptual filters (the "devotedly observant" lens, her mathematician's idiom). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("orbits of regret," "planetary wreckage," "pooled rich and certain"). Some elevation in register during reflection ("architecture of omission," "perihelion") fits the character but occasionally drifts toward essayistic phrasing that slows momentum. The line "Solemn work, this tallying of planetary wreckage, yet she permitted herself a grim smile" demonstrates voice modulation under pressure. No dialogue present to assess naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with most lines doing double work (e.g., the nib's false origin story establishes both prop and character insight). Some ornate constructions in the middle third: "the particular silence of altitude, the hush that exists where atmosphere thins toward honesty" is evocative but slightly overwritten for a peak choice moment. Minor paraphrase loop: "orbits of regret" concept is restated in adjacent lines ("paths traced," "looped outward," "swung away") without added pressure. No grammar slips; clarity remains high. The final image ("descending toward a mailbox") is concrete and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomer-as-investigator and proof-by-contradiction applied to journalistic suppression offers a fresh angle on legacy-and-atonement material. The rosewood nib transforming from her father's talisman to instrument of exposure is a strong particular. Risk: the three-year observatory ritual and the specific Lansdell case ground the premise in lived detail rather than generic grief. Weakness: the journalist-calls-at-night frame and the choice to finally intervene follows a recognizable redemption template; the emotional arc (recluse breaking silence) is familiar even if the details are specific. Does not reach 8+ because the core move—send evidence to reporter—is a fairly direct solution once the choice is made.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marguerite's choice to copy and mail the logbook entries is the story's central turn and grows from her established traits (observation, contradiction method, private ritual). She appears throughout, drives the ending, and her heiress background frames the stakes. Does not reach 7+ because the "newsprint heiress" label functions more as context than active constraint—her wealth or social position does not materially narrow or enable tactics on the page; the choice would read similarly if she were simply "Arthur Bellamy's daughter, an astronomer."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rosewood nib appears in three beats: introduced with its false origin story (setup), used to chart contradictions mid-story (development), and employed to copy the critical entries for Dao (payoff/closure). Its transformation from her father's talisman to instrument of exposure charges the final action. Specificity matters: the nib's history and Marguerite's choice to use it (not any pen) tie directly to theme. Reaches 7+ for beat involvement and closure linkage but not higher because the nib does not constrain choice—any writing tool would suffice for the mechanical act of copying.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "orbits of regret" concept is introduced early, frames Marguerite's three-year project, and the comet/perihelion metaphor recurs through the story. It shapes her methodology (charting suppressed stories as trajectories) and the final image of truth descending recalls orbital motion. However, the concept functions more as thematic architecture than causal pressure—it does not materially narrow her options or alter tactics in the present window. The decision to mail the envelope could proceed without the orbital framing. Lyric reprise is strong but the concept remains one layer abstracted from on-page choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" is established through concrete action: pulling the original plate at fourteen, noticing which drawer her father locked, recognizing Dao's voice quality. The trait enables the contradiction proof and the three-year logbook project. It appears in multiple beats and drives the investigative method. Does not reach 7+ because while observation powers her work, the trait does not constrain or cost her in a visible tradeoff—being observant is purely advantageous here. No moment where hyper-attention harms or forces a difficult choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Intervene" is the story's central action and structural pivot: three years of non-intervention establish the pattern, Dao's call tests it, and mailing the envelope enacts the break. The action redefines Marguerite's stance (private ritual becomes public exposure) and forecloses her prior path. Signaled early via her habitual "I will call back" deflection and paid off in the copying and sealing beats. Reaches high 7s for essentiality but not 8+ because the intervention itself (mail documents) is a fairly conventional investigative move; the dramatic weight rests on her internal shift rather than a unique or high-cost external action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The proof-by-contradiction method is introduced and demonstrated on the page: "Assume Arthur Bellamy published everything...Contradiction achieved." It structures the middle investigative beat and establishes her rigorous approach. However, it does not shape the climactic choice—mailing the envelope to Dao proceeds from emotional recognition ("the tremor of someone who suspects a hidden truth") rather than from the logical proof. The method appears in one substantial beat (development gate) but is absent from the ending, limiting its causal reach. Present and functional but not indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The observatory is anchored early (eleven thousand feet, dome, clouds below, catwalk) and returns in the ending (dome echoes, telescope turned to valley, outgoing shelf by the catwalk door). The altitude and isolation reinforce Marguerite's three-year withdrawal. The echoing quality supports tone. However, the setting does not constrain her choice—she could mail evidence from any location with postal access. The telescope moment looking at Lansdell County is atmospheric but does not alter tactics. Strong setup and closure presence lift the score into mid-6s; lack of causal pressure on the decision caps it below 7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the journalist calls" is the story's present anchor and inciting event. The 9:47 p.m. timestamp and the present-tense unfolding (call, reflection, logbook work, copying, sealing) create a coherent single-scene window. However, time does not materially tighten decisions—there is no deadline or urgency driving Marguerite's choice to act tonight versus tomorrow. The frame is clear and functional but passive; the clock does not narrow options or escalate pressure. Lyric design allows for leisurely reflection without consequence, which fits the Accumulative lens but limits temporal integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To discover hidden truths" is dramatized through Marguerite's three-year charting project and the proof-by-contradiction beat. The motivation drives both her past observatory work and her recognition of the same drive in Dao's voice, which compels intervention. Friction appears in the line "To ignore that voice would be to complete another orbit, to let regret swing out into the dark and return heavier"—the cost of continued discovery-in-isolation versus public exposure. The desire is enacted in multiple beats and shapes the ending. Reaches 7+ for causal involvement and cost linkage but not higher because the motivation does not face a competing want (e.g., safety, reputation) in a dramatized conflict on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Solemn playfulness is present throughout: "grim smile," "strange, playful satisfaction in watching a dead man's careful architecture of omission dismantle itself," the formal astronomical metaphors applied to moral tallying. Tone modulates appropriately—solemnity dominates the Dao call and the intervention decision; playfulness surfaces in the proof method and the nib's ironic deployment. The final image balances both: serious mailing of evidence, but framed with the wry "truth, at last, was descending toward a mailbox." Tone is coherent and charges the ending. Does not exceed 7.0 because the playfulness remains largely narratorial commentary rather than embodied in Marguerite's on-page actions or dialogue (none present); it describes her mood more than enacting it through choice.</comment>
