<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sera's motivation is consistently rooted in grief transformed into ritual, with her "senselessly perceptive" trait embodied through concrete observation (roses curling before the rumble). The young militia man's arc from bluster to weeping works as embodied emotion, and his shift feels earned by the dome's quiet. Minor deduction: the militia man's interiority ("the boy beneath the soldier") leans slightly toward summary rather than fully dramatized contradiction, and Sera's pacifism "by marrow" risks being told rather than tested by a meaningful on-page cost at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (Sera, Dome Seven, post-tower-fall). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the dome's quiet and ritual against the desert's violence, culminating in the final image ("building something else, root by root"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Sera's ritual persists with visible cost (time, labor, renunciation of her father's world), and the ending crystallizes her stance. Deduction: the cost is implied and atmospheric rather than sharply legible in a single beat; the militia man's knife moment offers a micro turn but does not decisively narrow Sera's options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass dome functions as both setting and constraint, shaping the enclosure's pressure and the final lantern image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "basin of amber light," "roses glow like living coals," the "engraved quiet" felt on skin. The dome's intactness against the collapsed tower charges the spatial contrast. The grafting knife and rosehip tea ground Sera's work in tactile action. Minor note: the salt flats remain somewhat generic backdrop; more could be done with proximity or scarcity to pressure a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to weave continuity through chaos"—is signaled early and sustained through Sera's ritual and her care for survivors. The militia man's arrival and his choice to sheathe the knife provide one meaningful tightening that narrows his immediate violent option. Under the Accumulative lens, the dome's quiet accumulates pressure against the external violence, and the final image reweights the tower's loss with Sera's persistent building. Deduction: Sera herself faces no on-page reversal or trade-off; her stance is consistent throughout, and the cost (time, solitude, renunciation) is atmospheric rather than a sharp forfeiture in a peak beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between the tower (centralized, fallen) and the dome (decentralized, persistent), layered through the roses, the scrap burial, and the militia man's weeping. "Engraved quiet" and "grafting" function as motifs that constrain choice (the knife is sheathed, the man sits and weeps). The ending—"building something else, root by root, word by word, that would not fall"—offers a resonant answer to the premise without stating a moral. Minor slip: "the world retained a grammar" in the middle risks abstraction; it skirts the edge of thematic echo but stays rooted enough in Sera's action to avoid a full penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and distinct: elevated, lyrical diction ("senselessly perceptive," "tranquil blaze," "scored into the glass and soil") fits the contemplative tone and Sera's gardener-philosopher stance. Psychic distance is stable in limited third. The militia man's brief dialogue ("Nothing here needs cutting") and Sera's responses carry subtext and goal pursuit. Minor deduction: the phrase "choosing stillness in a landscape built for violence" edges toward meta-commentary, and "weeping was its own kind of grafting" risks over-articulation of the thematic parallel; both stay voice-motivated but push the boundary of show-versus-tell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm and length, supporting the contemplative pace. Information density is high: the scrap burial, the militia man's arc, and the dome's sensory charge all advance character and atmosphere. No loops or scaffolding clutter the page. Minor deductions: "a silence that was not empty but carved, shaped by intention, scored into..." stacks three near-synonyms in one phrase, risking decorative overwriting; "the boy beneath the soldier" and "grief behind his bluster" lean toward summary rather than image. Figurative language is purposeful but densely clustered in the final third ("lantern," "thread," "grammar"), which slightly dulls propulsion at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—pacifist daughter of a bounty hunter tending roses in a dome after societal collapse—offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic resilience, centering care rather than scavenging or combat. The ritual of "inculcating plants with values" is specific and transforms the genre's typical survival focus. The militia man's knife moment subverts the expected confrontation. Deductions: the collapsed-tower-as-chaos and dome-as-order dichotomy, while executed with specificity, echoes familiar fragility-versus-permanence templates; the ending's "building something else... that would not fall" risks a tidy thematic statement rather than a more ambiguous image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sera (bounty hunter's pacifist daughter) drives the frame and her stance shapes every on-page choice: she buries the scrap, speaks to roses, feeds survivors, and responds to the militia man without violence. Her pacifism "by marrow" is signaled early, tested in the knife moment, and present in the final image of persistent building. The contrast with her father (bounty hunter) charges the scrap burial and the inheritance of the farm. She shapes two beats (scrap burial, militia man) and the closure hinges on her continuity project. Deduction: her choices do not narrow her own options or force a visible trade-off on the page; she enacts her stance without internal friction or cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The airship ballast sandbag scrap appears in two beats: Sera withdraws it from her pocket and buries it at the rose bush, offering it as a lesson in "persistence" and "carry weight for someone else." It is present early (first third), tied to backstory (her father's death), and its burial enacts Sera's ritual method. It charges the father-daughter relationship and the farm's inheritance context. Deduction: after burial, it does not return or reweight the closure; it does not constrain a later choice or alter tactics. Its role is thematic accent rather than escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" is signaled early ("the dome hummed with an engraved quiet") and charges multiple beats: the militia man feels it on his skin, it contrasts the violence outside, and the final image ("scored into the glass and soil and air by... a woman choosing stillness") reweights the premise. It shapes the militia man's choice to sheathe the knife and sit, altering his immediate tactic. The concept is indispensable to the story's pressure and closure. Minor note: the concept risks abstraction ("a silence that was not empty but carved") but is anchored by the dome's physical enclosure and Sera's ritual action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is mentioned in the opening ("She was senselessly perceptive that way, attuned to shifts no instrument could measure") and demonstrated when the roses curl before the rumble and when Sera reads the militia man's "tremor in his hand, the grief behind his bluster, the boy beneath the soldier." It enables her response to the militia man (offering the knife, then inviting him to sheathe it). Deduction: the trait does not constrain her or impose a visible cost; it functions as characterization and slight tactical advantage but does not narrow her options or force a trade-off. It is present early and in two beats but remains label-plus-demonstration rather than pressure-generating.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Sheathe" is the pivotal action in the militia man's arc: he finds the grafting knife, returns with a changed face, and Sera tells him "You can sheathe it." He does, then sits and weeps. The action redefines his immediate option (violence → stillness) and ties directly to the dome's quiet and Sera's influence. It is present in the middle beat and implicit in the closure logic (the dome as a place where weapons are not needed). Deduction: the action is tied to the militia man's arc, not Sera's; it does not alter her stakes or tactics, and swapping "sheathe" for "set down" or "put away" would only slightly reduce the martial-to-peaceful charge. The specificity of sheathing carries symbolic weight but is not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Inculcating plants with values" is introduced early ("This is persistence... This is what it means to carry weight for someone else") and frames Sera's ritual method: she buries the scrap, speaks principles into the soil, and believes the roses absorb meaning. The method shapes her daily work, her response to the militia man, and the closure image ("whispering. Persistence. Compassion. Patience. Surrender"). It is present across multiple beats and indispensable to her motivation and the story's conceptual logic. Deduction: the method is demonstrated through the scrap burial and final whispering, but we do not see it constrain a choice or impose a cost; it remains thematic practice rather than a tactical pressure that alters outcomes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The desert rose farm in the glass-domed enclosure is established immediately and shapes every beat: it is intact when the tower fell, it holds the amber light and roses, it shelters survivors, and it becomes the lantern visible for miles in the final image. The dome's enclosure contrasts the open desert and tower rubble, pressuring Sera's choice to stay and continue her work. The space enables the militia man's shift (he feels the quiet) and charges the closure (building something that will not fall). The setting is mechanically and symbolically indispensable; removing the dome or roses would collapse the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the tower falls" anchors the story ("The tower fell on a Tuesday") and establishes the chaos (survivors arriving, shattered communication, ended rationing). The "days after" frame allows Sera's ritual to continue and survivors to arrive, creating the immediate pressure (militia man seeking weapons). The timeframe is present early and shapes the middle beat (survivors need shelter, the militia man's tension). Deduction: the passage of time does not tighten decisions on the page; there is no live clock or deadline that alters Sera's tactics or forces a choice. The frame is causal context rather than escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sera's motivation "to weave continuity through chaos" is named explicitly ("her motivation was precise") and demonstrated through every action: burying the scrap, feeding survivors, speaking to roses, offering the knife, and the final image of building "root by root, word by word." The desire drives her stance across all beats and charges the closure. It is tested by the militia man's arrival and the tower's collapse, creating friction between her ritual and the immediate survival needs around her. Deduction: the motivation is enacted rather than conflicted; Sera does not face a moment where weaving continuity costs her another goal or forces a painful trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is embodied in the opening image ("basin of amber light, a tranquil blaze that made the roses glow like living coals") and recurs in the final paragraph ("the sun blazed low, turning the dome into a lantern"). The tone fuses stillness and intensity throughout: Sera's quiet work against the desert's violence, the "engraved quiet" that marks visitors, the militia man's weeping. The tone modulates slightly (the militia man's bluster, then his softening) and charges the closure. Minor deduction: the tone is consistent but does not shift decisively under peak pressure; it remains a steady atmospheric register rather than a modulating force that escalates with the story's beats.</comment>
