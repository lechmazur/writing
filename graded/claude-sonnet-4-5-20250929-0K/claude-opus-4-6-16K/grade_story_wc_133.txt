<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's insomnia and compulsion to paint are embodied throughout—her "haggard awe" and inability to reconcile the ruined world drive concrete choices (crossing at dawn, seeking cadmium yellow, collaborating). The brooch inheritance and her mother's stubbornness create a credible value hierarchy. The gaunt painter remains functional but less developed; his role is to provide counterpoint rather than independent arc. Minor slip: the collaboration's emotional stakes could press harder against Sable's established solitude, but the renunciation of solo painting is legible and the cost (sharing, trusting) is present.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates harrowed detail (water wars, ruined harbors, rationing) and tightens through the pigment exchange and collaborative painting, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration—Sable promises to return, committing to shared creation over solitary threshing. The closure carries felt cost: she relinquishes her lone-artist stance and accepts interdependence. Orientation is swift (who, where, when by paragraph two). The rain-trail mechanics and tidal causeway create a persistent constraint that shapes the crossing and departure, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tidal island, causeway timing, and rain trails are vivid and functional: the tide's return forces the painters to finish and leave, the chapel ruins provide tactile atmosphere ("mineral pigment and old stone and…brine"), and Sable's body (paint-stained fingers, the brooch warm against her throat) serves as micro-setting. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (she reads rain trails as drainage stories). The amber brooch's "warm geological glow" on the mural directly informs the collaborative palette, linking object to environment in a way that charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Sable's need to "thresh meaning from experience" through painting. The story tightens when the solo approach proves incomplete ("neither perspective is complete"), escalates through the pigment exchange (irreplaceable materials risked), and deepens in the collaborative mural that merges ground-level anguish with aerial clarity. The rain-trail reversal imposes a time limit, and her promise to return forecloses the solitary path with visible cost. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length; the cost is legible in the unfinished mural and the covenant of shared pigments.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—reconciliation of irreconcilable realities, the insufficiency of solo perspective, and stubborn meaning-making—emerges from concrete particulars (the convergence mural, pre-war pigments, the brooch her mother refused to trade). Subtext operates in gesture: the amber glow cast on his mural, the wordless exchange over the altar, the packed pigments "like a covenant." The final image (two insomniacs carrying color through a world that tried to wash itself clean) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or prompt-language intrusion; the "haggard awe" recurs as earned texture, not assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, clean and consistent. Voice is distinct: "like a tooth from a rotting jaw," "the awe of someone who hadn't slept in eleven days," "wryly earnest in the way of someone who had thought too long about precise language." Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries subtext (the pigment negotiation, "Not for trade"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tightening during the collaboration). Minor slip: "wryly earnest" reads slightly over-articulated for internal narration, nudging toward evaluative filter, but remains within voice bounds and doesn't break distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well, information density is high, and no loops or scaffold clutter the page. Figurative language ("tooth from a rotting jaw," "the sea reclaimed it," "the land's slow exhalation") is vivid and coherent. Sentence openings vary; paragraph structure supports momentum. One template-cadence note: "She carried… She painted… she couldn't sleep… she couldn't sleep…" in paragraph three leans on parallel "she [verb]" stems but serves emphasis and doesn't obscure causality. No filter-verb stacks, no synonym churn, no proximity to famous lines. The final image is propulsive and clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The post-water-wars setting, insomniac painter, and tidal-island collaboration offer a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The "unearthed convergence" concept (aquifer collapse + military advance + storm surge) is particular and transforms the familiar post-apocalyptic frame through the lens of art-making as survival and reconciliation. The amber brooch, rain trails, and pre-war pigments feel inevitable in hindsight rather than ornamental. Risk: the quiet, accumulative structure and the commitment to texture over set-piece action heightens stakes without gimmickry. The transformation test holds: plot and arc would fail with generic replacements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable (insomniac painter) is present throughout, drives the crossing, the pigment exchange, and the promise to return. Her insomnia and painting compulsion frame the opening, middle collaboration, and closure. She makes key decisions (unpinning the brooch to show the color, agreeing to paint together, committing to the next tide). Setup, development, and closure participation all present. Causal pressure: narrows her solitary path and enables the collaborative turn. Closure linkage: her promise and the shared pigments are the hinge of the ending. Cost: she forecloses solo meaning-making. Deductions: late-story choice (promise) is the only distinct agency beat; earlier beats are observation and exchange rather than decision under competing pressure. Band: ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Amber brooch appears early (paragraph three), is handled mid-story (unpinned to cast light on the mural), and recurs at closure ("pulsed warm against her throat, holding its ancient light"). Three beats: inheritance/backstory, active use (showing the color), closure reprise. Causal work: the brooch's color ("warm geological glow") informs the collaborative palette and Sable's refusal to trade it signals her value hierarchy. Closure linkage: present in final image, reweighted as shared rather than hoarded light. Deductions: the ending mention is brief and the brooch does not constrain the promise itself; the active middle use is the strongest beat. Band: ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Unearthed convergence" is named and explained early (paragraph seven), frames the mural's subject, and drives the collaboration's purpose: merging Sable's ground-level view with the painter's aerial clarity to capture "three forces that had nothing to do with each other until suddenly they had everything to do with each other." Setup, development (the mural work), and closure (unfinished mural as covenant) all present. Causal pressure: shapes the collaborative task and stakes. Closure linkage: the mural's incompleteness charges the promise to return. Cost: visible in the unfinished state and the distributed pigments. Deductions: the concept is more thematic frame than on-page constraint altering tactics beat-to-beat. Band: ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Wryly earnest" appears once (paragraph seven) as a descriptor of the gaunt painter's manner when he corrects Sable's phrasing. It colors his dialogue and establishes his character's texture but does not constrain or enable a distinct on-page action with visible cost. Setup present (early signal), no clear development beat where the trait alters a choice, weak closure linkage (the trait does not shape the promise or final image). Functional but largely ornamental. Band: ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The exchange (pigments over the altar) occurs mid-story, drives the collaboration, and is reprised at closure ("the new pigments distributed between them like a covenant"). Setup, development (the exchange enables the joint mural work), and closure participation all present. Causal pressure: the exchange of irreplaceable materials (cadmium yellow, ultramarine) narrows both characters' solitary paths and commits them to shared creation. Closure linkage: the distributed pigments underpin the promise to return. Cost: visible in the risk of irreplaceable stock and the covenant formed. Irreplaceability: high; the specific pigments matter. Band: ~8.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Following rain trails" is introduced early (paragraph two: "by following rain trails scored into the mudstone she could time her crossing to the minute") and frames Sable's expertise. It enables the crossing (setup), is implicit in the successful timing (development), and recurs at closure ("I'll follow the rain trails back" as promise). Setup, development, closure participation all present. Causal work: the method constrains the crossing window and shapes the tidal pressure. Closure linkage: the promise to return invokes the method explicitly. Deductions: the mechanics are explained but not dramatized under pressure in a distinct beat; the method is more enabling condition than contested tactic. Band: ~7.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren's Rock (tidal island) is introduced early, houses the chapel and mural, and the tidal cycle creates the story's time pressure. Setup, development (the causeway's drowning forces the painters to pack and leave), and closure (they cross together as the tide returns) all present. Causal pressure: the tide's reversal tightens the collaboration window and drives the departure. Closure linkage: the crossing together is the final act. Cost: the unfinished mural and the promise to return are tied to the island's accessibility. Micro-setting: the chapel altar, the mural wall, and the tidal mechanics all alter tactics. Band: ~8.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the water wars" is established early and frames the ruined world (flooded harbors, rationing, salt-poisoned fields) that drives Sable's insomnia and painting compulsion. Setup present. Development: the backstory informs the mural's subject (Port Eleuth, the convergence) and the scarcity of pigments. Closure linkage: weak; the timeframe does not constrain the final promise or reweight the ending image directly. The wars supply context and motivation but do not tighten decisions beat-to-beat. Causal work: informs stakes but does not narrow options in the closure beat. Band: ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To thresh meaning from experience" is stated early (paragraph four) and drives Sable's insomnia, her crossing, and her willingness to collaborate. Setup, development (the collaborative mural is an attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable), and closure (the promise to return commits her to shared threshing) all present. Causal pressure: the motivation narrows her to painting as survival and opens the collaborative path when solo work proves insufficient. Closure linkage: the promise and unfinished mural are direct expressions of the threshing drive. Cost: visible in the forfeiture of solo completeness. Deductions: the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices; internal friction between solitude and collaboration could press harder on the page. Band: ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Haggard awe" is introduced in the opening line, recurs in describing the mural's quality ("breathed with haggard awe"), and charges the closure ("stubbornly bearing it forward"). Setup, development (tone shapes the sensory texture and reflection throughout), and closure participation all present. Coherence: the tone modulates from exhausted wonder to collaborative determination without breaking. Closure linkage: the final image ("two insomniacs carrying color") is suffused with haggard-awe texture. The tone is specific, consistent, and irreplaceable; removing it would flatten the voice and ending. Band: ~8.2.</comment>
