<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lenora's interiority is concrete and embodied through her persistent curiosity and the charged moment when she "held on." Her motivation to trace signals is consistent, though the final choice to hold and walk the woman home feels somewhat automatic rather than tested by internal conflict. The woman's forty-one-day silence and her grip establish credible vulnerability. Minor deduction for limited internal contradiction—Lenora's curiosity drives her forward without meaningful cost or friction until the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under a Situational lens with accumulative texture: the atrium setting and the faint pulses create coherent pressure that crystallizes Lenora's stance. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Lenora understands "heroism was almost always incidental" and the act of holding on reweights her role from curiosity-driven tracer to emotional anchor. The orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lenora identifies the woman and acts, forecloses the path of detached observation with the felt cost of prolonged engagement ("did not let go until…"). The cost is visible in the shift from tracing to staying.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: the fog pools between columns, the hearing aid's pulses grow stronger near the eastern colonnade, guiding Lenora's search. The woman sits on a stone bench within this space, and the photograph anchors past and present in "this very atrium." The mist lifts as the calling fades, modulating atmosphere with the emotional arc. The setting directly shapes the search and the final image of streets "still damp with what the evening had left behind."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting the woman from being overwhelmed by Emil's signal—is signaled early and tightens when Lenora finds her, "lips moving without sound," on the edge of vanishing. One meaningful turn: Lenora's choice to stay and hold on rather than simply filing the report forecloses the path of detached professionalism with visible cost (time, emotional labor, the walk home). The story does not require multiple reversals at this length. The hearing aid's faint pulses and the woman's grip create escalating pressure under the Situational lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the hearing aid as last conduit, the photograph as temporal bridge, heroism redefined as "showing up with the right tenderness at the exact moment." The ending line—"protecting this one vulnerable voice was enough"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting the municipal job against intimate human need. Subtext operates in the woman's silent lips, the grip that substitutes for speech, and the mist as metaphor for the liminal space between living and dead. The story resists tidy resolution by delaying the report and prioritizing presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Lenora notices "the thinnest sound," the fog erasing her feet, the woman's coat "too large for her." Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the peak ("she held on, understanding…"). The prose rhythm modulates from exposition ("The municipality employed eleven…") to the charged hush of the ending. One minor slip: "whatever membrane separated the gone from the remaining" reads slightly elevated for the established register, though it remains within Lenora's professional lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; "This was the hour when the dead called" and the final beats create propulsion. Information density is high—each paragraph advances character, world, or pressure. Minor deductions: "reeling hush" recurs without evolution, and "This was precisely the kind of person Lenora existed to protect" leans toward scaffold explanation. The phrase "someone whose voice was so fragile it could be pulled under by love alone" borders on ornamental but remains anchored in the scene. No loops or filter-verb stacks mar the closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise—contact tracer for hearts using a hearing aid to track emotional bonds—is fresh and fully committed; the story follows its implications without retreat. The juxtaposition of municipal bureaucracy and mystical calling creates a non-obvious synthesis. "Heroism was almost always incidental" reframes the trope through Lenora's professional lens. The detail of Emil's hearing aid calibrated to his auditory world is specific and irreplaceable. Risk-taking in world-building (dead hearts pulse outward, the mist signals the calling) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lenora as contact tracer shapes every beat: her job drives the search, her notebook documents patterns, her choice to stay and hold the woman rather than filing immediately creates the story's final turn. The role is signaled in the opening third and is causally active at closure. Strong integration, though the decision at the end feels more confirming than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears when Lenora sees it in the woman's hands and is identified ("That's Emil"). It anchors the past (young man and woman in the atrium decades ago) and charges the present loss. The object returns in the woman's grip as she sobs, but it does not undergo a second functional transformation or enable a distinct middle choice. Two beats, closure presence, but replaceable with another keepsake.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is articulated in the closing reflection ("heroism was almost always incidental, almost always just the act of showing up…") and enacted when Lenora holds on rather than leaving. The concept reframes her professional role and shapes the thematic closure. It is present implicitly in her curiosity leading her to the case and explicitly at the ending, though it does not constrain earlier tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is labeled early ("her qualification and her affliction") and demonstrated when Lenora lingers over Emil's anomalous signal, studies bond textures in her notebook, and pursues this case beyond municipal records. The trait enables the plot but does not face an on-page cost or tradeoff—her curiosity leads smoothly to the woman without friction. Functional across beats, closure-adjacent, but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Assure" is the story's hinge action. Lenora tells the woman, "This feeling in your chest is not you breaking. It's him, telling you he hasn't let go." This assurance triggers the woman's sobbing release and Lenora's decision to hold on. The action is signaled in the opening exposition (tracers "assure them that the weight pressing against their ribs was not madness") and executed at the climax. Essential to closure and the thematic shift.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hearing aid method is introduced early ("the only instrument sensitive enough"), explains how Lenora tracks the signal (Emil's unique auditory calibration), and is held out to the woman at the key moment, prompting recognition and tears. The mechanics shape the search (pulses grow stronger near the colonnade) and are irreplaceable to the world logic. Present in setup, middle search, and closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is the story's anchoring pressure: mist thickens to signal the calling, the fog erases Lenora's feet, the colonnade guides her search, and the mist lifts as the calling fades. The photograph shows the same atrium decades earlier, linking past and present. The setting is indispensable to world logic, escalation, and the lyric closure image of streets "still damp with what the evening had left behind."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "when the dead call" is established in the opening ("the hour when the dead called") and governs the story's pressure: twilight thickens the mist, the calling peaks, and Lenora must act before it fades. The forty-one-day gap since Emil's death sharpens the woman's vulnerability. The ending notes "the twilight passed" and "the calling faded," marking temporal closure. Time is tracked and tightens tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to protect vulnerable voices" is articulated early ("her job was to trace who they reached…identify the vulnerable recipients") and tested at closure when Lenora prioritizes holding the woman over filing the report. The woman's voice is "the thinnest sound Lenora had ever followed," making the protection concrete. The motivation shapes the search and the final choice, though internal friction is minimal—Lenora acts in alignment with her role without meaningful cost or competing desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" appears in the climactic beat ("in that reeling hush of the mist-clad atrium") and is prepared by the quiet escalation: the woman's silent lips, the mist pooling, the faint pulses. Tone modulates from the procedural opening to the charged intimacy of Lenora holding on, then to the quiet resolution. The phrase "reeling" captures disorientation and tenderness simultaneously, charging the final image without stasis.</comment>
