<comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular: the taste-as-grief ability is embodied throughout, and her motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" through subsumption is credible. The seven-minutes-too-late backstory anchors her remorse without therapy-speak, and the final choice—letting borrowed grief layer over her own—feels earned by prior causality. Minor slip: the pavilion's mechanics are accepted without internal contradiction or doubt, which flattens the struggle slightly. The ending stance crystallization (carrying rather than curing grief) forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, after rain). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered grief memories, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Maren's remorse is "sanded down" by company and she accepts carrying rather than curing. Cost is legible: her singular sharp memory becomes "one thread in a vast and heavy tapestry," and she deposits her grief into the pavilion's sediment. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the tightening occurs when she kneels and lets the flood come, narrowing her stance from erasure to coexistence.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The desert fortress, weeping walls, salt bowl, and coral pavilion are vivid and purposeful. The pavilion's frozen coral and tidal pools constrain Maren's method and charge the final image (she climbs stairs "on unsteady legs," the fortress waits with "kitchen full of salt"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's professional lens (cumin, roasted lamb, metallic bite). The micro-setting (hands in salt, kneeling at the pool) drives the peak choice. Cap at 8.3 due to minor spatial vagueness: the pavilion's interior choreography (pool proximity, coral structure) is atmospheric but not fully legible.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Maren seeks to "sandpaper rough memories" of her daughter's death. One meaningful tightening occurs when she kneels and lets the pavilion's flood of borrowed grief pour through her, narrowing her option from erasure to shared carrying. The cost is visible: she withdraws with a "shell of shared sorrow" and climbs on "unsteady legs," her remorse now one spiral among many. Agency is clear (she devised the method and chooses to let it come), and the resolution is earned by her prior study and the pavilion's mechanics. Minor issue: the pavilion's centuries of stored remorse feel convenient—no hint of prior failure or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme (grief as a thing to carry, not cure; shared sorrow as bearable) emerges from concrete particulars: the taste-memory gift, the pavilion's tidal pools, the seven-minutes-too-late memory. The final image—Maren climbing into a "desert washed clean by rain" with her "dream...finally closed"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the salt bowl, the weeping walls, and the branching coral metaphor. Minor slip: "carrying was easier when the weight was shared" in the final paragraph edges toward thematic echo, though it's anchored in the prior scene action. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the pavilion descent. Diction is distinctive and purposeful: "tidal pool formations," "sharp and branching," "subsume." Perceptual signature is clear (flavor as memory map, "astronomers read stars"). No dialogue, so that bullet is N/A. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "She had learned to read these flavors the way astronomers read stars, mapping the constellations of human regret" is slightly elevated for the immediate moment, though it coheres with the established voice. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong (short clauses during the flood, longer reflection afterward).</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the motif of salt and the kitchen. Minor loop: "stored remorse" appears twice in quick succession (pavilion description, method explanation) without added detail, and "The cold seized her instantly. Flavors erupted..." / "The cold climbed her arms..." edges toward synonym churn. Stock metaphor: "sharp and branching, cutting her from the inside" for grief reads familiar. No major artifacts touch closure, so non-closure accumulation cap applies (−0.8 for two distinct issues).</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The coral-icebound-pavilion-in-a-desert premise is fresh and the taste-memory gift is specific to Maren's vocation. The method (subsumption via layered grief) offers a non-obvious angle on processing remorse. However, the core emotional arc—accepting rather than erasing grief—is a familiar template, and the "company makes sorrow bearable" resolution trends toward a recognizable therapy-narrative shape. Transformation is present (the pavilion's mechanics, the tidal pool analysis), but the final stance feels anticipated by the setup. No close echoes of famous lines. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits to its premise without retreat but does not destabilize expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Chef who can taste memories: Established early (opening paragraph); shapes middle beats (she reads strangers' grief in salt, cumin, lamb); drives the peak choice (her ability to absorb through touch enables the pavilion method); and charges the final image (she will cook tomorrow, tasting strangers' sorrows). Three-gate pass. Causal pressure is strong: her gift is the reason she seeks the pavilion and the mechanism for subsumption. Cost is visible (she absorbs centuries of grief, climbs on unsteady legs). Specificity is high (irreplaceable). Minor cap: the gift is largely backstory context; on-page decisions are pavilion-focused rather than chef-specific.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Coral icebound pavilion: Established by the second paragraph; used in two distinct beats (discovery three years ago, tonight's descent and kneeling); drives the peak choice (she presses hands to the pool, lets the flood come); and charges the final image (she climbs the stairs, leaving her remorse in the sediment). Three-gate pass. Causal pressure is strong: the pavilion's mechanics enable the subsumption method. Cost is visible (withdrawal on unsteady legs, spiral in sediment). Specificity is high (coral + ice + desert is irreplaceable). Reaches high band via closure linkage, beat involvement, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Stored remorse: Established early (pavilion as "reliquary for stored remorse"); drives middle beat (months of study, reading sediment spirals); drives the peak choice (she kneels and lets centuries of remorse pour through her); and charges the final image (her remorse is now "one spiral" among others, "finally closed"). Three-gate pass. Causal pressure is strong: the concept shapes her method and the pavilion's function. Cost is visible (her singular grief becomes one thread in a tapestry). Specificity is high (the pavilion exists to store and share remorse). Reaches high band via closure linkage, causal pressure, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Emotionally contagious through touch: Established early ("emotionally contagious through touch...whatever she held, she absorbed"); enables the middle beat (absorbing strangers' grief from salt); drives the peak choice (she presses hands to the pool, absorbing the pavilion's flood); and charges the final image (she will cook and taste strangers' sorrows). Three-gate pass. Causal pressure is strong: the trait is the mechanism for subsumption. Cost is visible (she risks being "subsumed entirely"). Specificity is high (irreplaceable). Reaches high band via closure linkage, causal pressure, and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Subsume: Signaled early (she seeks to "sandpaper rough memories," later "subsume her entirely"); drives the peak beat (she lets the flood come, "would not resist...would let it pour through her"); and shapes the final image (her grief is subsumed into shared sorrow, she climbs with the dream "finally closed"). Three-gate pass. Causal pressure is moderate: the action is the method's climax, but the mechanics (letting the flood come vs. resisting) are not deeply contested. Cost is visible (unsteady legs, grief transformed). Specificity is moderate (the verb "subsume" is precise but the action could be described as merge/absorb with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Analyzing tidal pool formations: Established in the second half ("spent months analyzing tidal pool formations, reading the spiral patterns of sediment and ice"); signals the method but does not appear in a distinct middle beat (the analysis is backstory context, not on-page action); shapes the ending (she deposits her remorse as "a new spiral in the sediment"). Two-gate pass (development via backstory, payoff at ending). Causal pressure is light: the analysis enables her to understand the pavilion but does not constrain her peak choice. Cost is indirect (the method she devised). Swappability is moderate (could be "reading the ice patterns" or "studying the pools").</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Desert fortress after rain: Established in the opening line; provides the inciting condition (rain compacts sand, reveals the staircase); frames the middle (she stands in the courtyard with salt); and charges the final image (she emerges into "a desert washed clean by rain, the fortress waiting with its weeping walls and its kitchen full of salt"). Three-gate pass. Causal pressure is moderate: rain is necessary for access but does not constrain her choice once she descends. Cost is indirect (the setting's isolation and the fortress as her chosen kitchen). Specificity is moderate (rain + desert + fortress is evocative but the fortress interior is underdeveloped).</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>At the close of an unspoken dream: Signaled obliquely in the opening half ("at the close of an unspoken dream she'd carried for years"); shapes the middle (her goal is to fulfill this dream via subsumption); and charges the final image ("The dream she had never spoken aloud settled quietly into the sand behind her, finally closed"). Three-gate pass. Temporal pressure is light: "tonight" and "three years ago" anchor time, but no ticking clock tightens decisions. Cost is visible (the dream is closed, she climbs with finality). Specificity is moderate (the "unspoken dream" is thematic glue but could be "her long-held hope" with minor edits). Lyric resonance (early seed → final reprise) lifts the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>To sandpaper rough memories: Established early ("she might finally sandpaper rough memories into something smooth enough to swallow"); drives the middle (months of study to devise the method); drives the peak choice (she kneels and lets the flood layer over her sharp-edged memory); and charges the final image (her grief is "sanded down...made bearable by company"). Three-gate pass. Causal pressure is strong: the desire shapes her tactics and the pavilion's use. Cost is visible (she risks subsumption, withdraws on unsteady legs). Specificity is high ("sandpaper" is a distinct, tactile metaphor). Reaches high band via closure linkage, causal pressure, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Sturdy brittle: Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure. "Sturdy" appears in the peak beat ("Something sturdy formed around the brittle core of her grief, a shell of shared sorrow that would not shatter"). "Brittle" is implicit in the "sharp and branching" coral metaphor and the "seven minutes" remorse. The tone charges the final image (weeping walls, clean desert, kitchen full of salt). Three-gate pass (setup via metaphor, peak articulation, ending reprise). Causal pressure is light: tone supports rather than constrains. Cost is indirect (the tone embodies the transformation). Specificity is high (the sturdy/brittle pairing is precise and irreplaceable).</comment>
