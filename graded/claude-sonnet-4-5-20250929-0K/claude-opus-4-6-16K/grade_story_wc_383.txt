<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular—"quarantined" memory, the archivist's lens on copies versus originals—and her micro-choices (pressing the shell harder, choosing to believe the warmth is real) embody contradictory impulses without therapy-speak. The final stance is earned: she moves from recovery to reconstruction, building "from wreckage" with visible cost (accepting incomplete fragments). Minor deduction: the phrase "tragically radiant" recurs as a label without altering her on-page choices in key beats, and the fever backstory, while anchored, occupies significant reflection without mid-scene friction that changes tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren accepts that the fragments "were not Clara" but chooses to build from them, foreclosing hope of true recovery with on-page cost (the notebook's "incomplete, distorted" contents). The Accumulative lens holds: density increases through the night vigil, and the final cadence shift ("walked forward into a morning she had made her own") reweights isolation into agency. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs (the realization that "to translate isolation into independence" means building from absence), sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet garden grounds the scene early with vivid, selective detail (flowers "so deeply purple it seemed to absorb the failing light"), and the seashell half functions as micro-setting, constraining her vigil and charging the closure image when it "settled against her hip like a small, familiar weight." The timeframe (twilight to dawn) subtly guides her endurance. Minor cap: the garden itself does not constrain a mid-scene choice or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconstructing Clara through resonance—is signaled early and tightens once: Maren's realization that "to translate isolation into independence was not to stop needing what was lost but to become the kind of person who could build from absence" narrows her options from recovery to acceptance, foreclosing the path of waiting for true return. The vigil itself (pressing the shell, catching fragments) embodies protagonist agency, and the cost is legible in the "incomplete, distorted" notebook entries. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the archivist's understanding that "copies were never originals" but "to archive something was to declare it worth preserving" charges her choice to build from fragments. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—wreckage as architecture, absence as foundation—without stating a moral. The seashell's "imperfect acoustics" and the notebook's distortions embody the theme's cost. Minor: one phrase ("translate isolation into independence") edges toward abstract thesis, but it's immediately grounded in the choice to "build from absence."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren filters the garden through an archivist's lexicon ("cataloging," "transcribed letter lost the pressure of the pen") and the prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity (short fragments at the peak: "Not erased. Quarantined."). No head-hopping. Minor deduction: the phrase "ghostly resolve" in the final third echoes the prompt's tone element in a way that feels slightly imposed rather than earned by prior diction, though it remains voice-plausible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high ("charmed skeptic," "neural scarring...walled off an entire sector") and most lines advance character or atmosphere. The opening simile ("the way the dying hold theirs") and the closing image ("velvet flowers were opening now to catch the dawn") charge the frame. Minor artifacts: "tragically radiant" recurs identically without variation, and the phrase "ghostly resolve" appears twice in the final third as a slight template cadence. One paraphrase loop: "wreckage could be architecture" is restated as "wreckage as architecture" without added pressure, triggering −0.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of memory-as-archive and the nautilus shell's logarithmic chambers offers a fresh, specific angle. The final turn—accepting incomplete copies as "a beginning" rather than failure—feels earned in hindsight. Minor deduction: the core premise (medical memory loss prompting reconstruction through sensory cues) echoes widely used recovery/acceptance templates; the story elevates it through the archivist lens and the shell's specificity, but the arc (acceptance after loss) follows a familiar emotional path without a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren is established as a "charmed skeptic" in exposition, and her final choice to believe the warmth "was real" and to "build from wreckage" enacts skepticism tempered by devotion. The trait shapes two key turns: choosing the experimental protocol (middle) and choosing to accept fragments as "hers" (closure). It appears early and charges the ending. Cap for prompt element: the label "charmed skeptic" is told rather than demonstrated through a specific on-page friction where charm and skepticism collide in a single beat, and the trait does not visibly constrain a tactical choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The seashell half is handled in three distinct beats: initial description, pressing it to her ear during the vigil, and tucking it back "where it settled against her hip like a small, familiar weight" at closure. It enables her resonance attempt (middle causal pressure) and charges the final image with accumulated meaning. Early signal, middle use, closure reprise all present. Minor: the shell's mechanics (spiral chambers shaping sound) are described but do not narrow her tactics or force a visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Quarantined memory" shapes the dominant stake (she cannot access Clara's memories) and drives the vigil tactic (using resonance to coax echoes through the barrier). It appears early, constrains her options throughout (she must reconstruct rather than recover), and the closure image (accepting "incomplete, distorted" fragments) directly addresses the concept's cost. The concept is indispensable to the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Tragically radiant" is a label applied twice (opening and closing) without demonstrating how the trait constrains or enables a specific on-page action. It describes her appearance/state but does not alter her choices, narrow her options, or impose a visible cost. The radiance (fever glow) is backstory context; the tragedy (memory loss) drives stakes, but the combined phrase itself is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Archive" is signaled early ("spent her career as a literary archivist") and drives her conceptual reframing at closure: "she would archive Clara...building a new collection from whatever echoes leaked through." The action shapes her final choice (to build from fragments rather than wait for recovery) and is inseparable from the ending's meaning. The notebook filled with fragments is the on-page artifact of this action. Minor: the archiving itself is more conceptual stance than physical action; she listens and writes, but the verb "archive" does not narrow mid-scene tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Through resonance structures" is explained by Dr. Vasquez (middle exposition) and enacted in the vigil: Maren uses the shell's spiral chambers to "coax the quarantined memories to echo through the damaged barrier." The method is signaled, attempted on the page, and yields the notebook fragments. It shapes one key beat (the vigil) and enables the closure realization. Cap: the mechanics are told rather than tested through a failed-then-adjusted attempt, and the method does not impose a visible tactical trade-off or friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "velvet garden at twilight" is anchored early, provides vivid sensory detail (flowers "so deeply purple"), and recurs at closure ("velvet flowers were opening now to catch the dawn"). The setting frames the vigil and the lyric reprise reweights the opening image (holding breath → opening to dawn). It charges the final image but does not constrain a mid-scene choice or alter tactics. Lyric-resonance allowance applies: early seed, purposeful final reprise, reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"When the last star fades into morning light" is signaled late (final third: "When the last star faded into morning light, Maren was still there") but the timeframe (twilight to dawn) is tracked throughout and tightens the vigil's endurance cost. The passage of hours shapes the notebook's accumulation and the closure image (dawn as new beginning). Causal pressure: the all-night vigil is necessary to fill the notebook and earn the final stance. Minor late-arrival penalty applied.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To translate isolation into independence" is dramatized in Maren's choices: she moves from hoping to recover Clara to choosing to build from fragments, with friction between wanting true recovery and accepting reconstruction visible on the page. The phrase itself appears at closure as the earned realization, and the cost (foreclosing hope of true return) is legible in the "incomplete, distorted" notebook. The motivation drives all three gates and is indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" is coherent through the piece: quiet determination amid absence (the garden "held its breath," Maren's "deliberate" choices) modulates with the vigil's accumulation and charges the final image ("walked forward into a morning she had made her own"). The tone supports pressure without static repetition. Minor: the phrase "ghostly resolve" appears explicitly twice in the final third, slightly forcing the prompt element into the diction rather than letting it emerge fully from rhythm and image.</comment>
