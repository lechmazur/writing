<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal progression from maze designer to temporal navigator is grounded in concrete action (prying the fragment, grafting roots, training growth) and each choice narrows her options with visible cost. The moment she watches the photograph disintegrate while feeling "quaking reverie" embodies contradictory impulses—grief and wonder acting simultaneously—earning the final stance. Minor slip: the retrocognitive trap is labeled more than it constrains on-page micro-choices in the middle section, relying somewhat on summary ("she could not stop seeing") rather than dramatized micro-refusals.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (temporal fragments accumulating around the halo shard) and delivers closure through Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights time's texture as "fibrous and branching" with felt cost (the photographs dissolving, her present thinning). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Elara, bridges, fragment); one meaningful deepening occurs when she applies hyperbolic geometry to redesign the garden, altering her navigation of the past. The cost is legible: "the present grew thin around her like an overexposed photograph." No causality breaks; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The living bridge garden constrains Elara's movement and charges the closure: she trains new root-growth along hyperbolic spirals, and the bridges' texture becomes the story's conceptual anchor ("fibrous and branching, like root-wood"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("her bare feet reading the texture of bark and time"), and the gorge below recurs as a spatial constant. The fragment held "up to the sun" in the final image uses micro-setting (body + object) to charge the ending. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering time's texture to navigate retrocognitive overload. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara realizes hyperbolic geometry can map temporal curvature, enabling her to "choose her direction" rather than drown in random pasts—this narrows her tactical options and is earned by her prior expertise. The cost is visible: photographs fade to white dust, her present disintegrates. Agency is renunciation and endurance with a visible price. The escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens but lacks a second on-page reversal that would push into higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story's thematic question—what is the texture of time?—emerges from concrete particulars (root-wood, hyperbolic curves, disintegrating photographs) and avoids stated morals. The final image ("fibrous and branching, like root-wood, like the bridges") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights all prior material: time's geometry is organic, patient, and always reaching. The photograph's destruction as "time completing its own curve" is earned wisdom without platitude. No thematic echo; the ending trusts image over thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV, third-limited with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "her bare feet reading the texture of bark and time," "colors that belonged to other moments." Diction remains within Elara's designer/mystic lexicon throughout; no head-hopping or register drift. Under peak stress (final paragraph), compression is purposeful and the internal texture stays consistent. One minor slip: "quaking reverie" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward elevated phrasing, but the effect supports the closure beat and does not break voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or concept. Rhythm varies naturally, and the opening/closing lines anchor stakes and recharge motifs. Two minor artifacts: "thick as a man's torso in places, thin as fingers where new growth still reached" is functional but edges toward stock comparison; "which was also somewhere she had always been, which was also now" repeats "which was also" in a template cadence without taught pattern payoff. Neither obscures closure, so Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.6 total within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognition, hyperbolic geometry, and living architecture is specific and non-obvious; removing any element would break the story's logic. The hedge-maze backstory transforms from ornament to causal engine when Elara applies her design expertise to time itself. Risk-taking (temporal geometry as navigational tool) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Slight proximity concern: the fading-photographs motif echoes genre conventions (time erasing evidence), but the hyperbolic-geometry angle provides fresh inflection and the ending follows its implications without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hedge maze designer: Setup (paragraph 2), Development (realizes hyperbolic geometry can map time, redesigns the garden), Payoff (final navigation through her living maze). The occupation drives two beats and is causally irreplaceable—her expertise enables the solution. Cost: visible in the redesign labor and the dissolution of her present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Halo fragment: Setup (paragraph 3, pried from root-wood), Development (pressed between palms to navigate visions, paragraph 6), Payoff (held up to the sun in the final image, refracting "colors that belonged to other moments"). Three distinct beats; causal pressure throughout; unique properties (temporal refraction) are irreplaceable. High specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fading photographs: Setup (paragraph 4, "the photographs began to fade"), Development (kept in a box, "month by month they were fading"), Payoff (last one disintegrates at maze center, paragraph 7, triggering "quaking reverie"). Two beats; the disintegration charges the closure by literalizing time's consumption. Moderate causal pressure; swappable with another physical decay marker but the visual logic (overexposure metaphor) is tight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Retrocognitively trapped: Setup (paragraph 4, "snagged on the past"), Development (label-only; the constraint is asserted but not dramatized in a middle choice that costs her an option), Payoff (implied in final navigation). The trait enables the premise but lacks a visible on-page tradeoff in the middle section. Cost is conceptual (her present thinning) rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Disintegrate: Setup (photographs fading, paragraph 4), Development (watching the last photo "disintegrate over the course of an afternoon," paragraph 7), Payoff (the photograph's destruction is reframed as "time completing its own curve"). Two beats; the action redefines Elara's understanding and is causally tied to her acceptance. Not easily swappable; the specific verb charges the closure metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry: Setup (paragraph 5, "worked with hyperbolic geometry"), Development (paragraph 6, realizes time behaves hyperbolically and trains roots along hyperbolic spirals), Payoff (final navigation through the maze). Two beats; the method enables the tactical shift and is signaled early. Moderate specificity—geometry jargon does the work but the mechanics remain abstract; a reader unfamiliar with hyperbolic curves might not grasp how it differs from "complex curves."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Living bridge garden: Setup (paragraph 1, sensory anchor), Development (Elara redesigns it, paragraph 6, "training new root-growth along hyperbolic spirals"), Payoff (stands "at the center of her living maze, barefoot on ancient roots" in final image). Three beats; the setting supplies both resource (roots to reshape) and constraint (the abyss below, the centuries-old growth). Causal pressure high; micro-setting (barefoot contact) charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To discover the texture of time: Setup (paragraph 5, "She needed to understand... to discover the texture of time itself"), Development (paragraph 5, "It was the mazes that gave her the answer"), Payoff (paragraph 8, "She understood now that time had a texture after all"). Three beats; the motivation is dramatized through her redesign labor and the final realization. Friction between want (understanding) and cost (dissolving present) is legible. Slightly told in paragraph 5 but earned by closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Quaking reverie: Setup (implied in the dreamlike diction of paragraph 1, "roots weaving into lattice and sinew"), Development (explicit in paragraph 7, "She felt a quaking reverie as it went"), Payoff (final paragraph's heightened syntax, "which was also somewhere she had always been, which was also now"). Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure; the phrase "quaking reverie" is named once but the trembling-awe register charges the ending. Moderate rather than indispensable—another mood descriptor could serve, but this one fits the mystical-geometry frame.</comment>
