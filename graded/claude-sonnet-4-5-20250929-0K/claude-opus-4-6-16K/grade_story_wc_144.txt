<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's blindness is embodied through her hands and thermal reading rather than declared, and her devotion to repair creates a consistent professional identity. Her calm under Soren's urgency and her willingness to remain "here to patch what needs patching" show a character-particular stance. However, the story offers little internal conflict or contradiction—she moves through the repair with serene competence, and no genuine struggle threatens her method or self-concept. The final gesture ("the way one greets an old friend") is warm but lacks visible cost or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when early (Elara, repair shop, ship departure imminent) and follows a clear causal chain: damaged drone → diagnostic touch → thermal water test → repair → release. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara returns to her bench as the ship finds direction, reaffirming her role with quiet continuity. Cost is implied—she remains stationary while the world moves—but the final image does not sharply reweight prior material or demonstrate a felt trade-off on the page. The lens reads Causal with a lyric overlay; escalation is minimal (one tightening via the anchor-lifting deadline) and the ending recedes into atmosphere rather than crystallizing a decisive shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot, condensation trough, and anchor-chain winch are vividly rendered and fully integrated into Elara's method—her thermal reading via water refraction is a micro-setting constraint that shapes the climactic diagnostic beat. Sensory detail (mist settling "on every iron beam," the "hum" of the drone's wings) reflects Elara's non-visual priorities. The harbor and depot evolve causally as the Aurelia prepares to leave, and spatial choreography (workbench, trough, bay doors, platform edge) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repair the lead-frequency drone before the ship departs—is signaled early and tracked via the anchor chain's progress. One meaningful tightening occurs when the horn sounds and dockworkers begin preparation, compressing Elara's window. However, the repair itself proceeds without setback or visible trade-off; Elara's skill is serene and uncontested, and Soren's question ("what happens if the signal drifts?") arrives after resolution, offering no on-page complication. Agency is present (Elara's diagnostic and repair choices) but the escalation lacks a moment where options narrow or a price is paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—precision, devotion to mending, and the artisan's acceptance of imperfection—emerges organically from Elara's method and her closing promise to "patch what needs patching." The water-refraction test and the ship "finding its direction" create a resonant image of indirect guidance. Subtext operates in her calm response to Soren's anxiety and her blind gaze toward the harbor. The ending offers a quiet reconfiguration of the premise (blindness as instrument, not deficit) without overt moralizing, though the thematic answer feels more atmospheric than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and confident; Elara's perceptual signature (texture, weight, sound, thermal gradients) is distinct and voice-particular. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and carries subtext (Soren's anxiety versus Elara's magnetic calm). The prose modulates cleanly between technical precision ("carbon lattice," "neural relay") and lyric atmosphere ("breath across cold glass"). No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping; psychic distance remains consistent. The final paragraph's rhythmic cadence ("The mist kept falling. The depot breathed.") charges the closure image without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (the water-trough diagnostic explains itself through action in ~80 words). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; figurative language ("mist like breath across cold glass," "hum... like a tuned string") is vivid and coherent. Minor scaffold: "She was a heartfelt artisan, the kind who grieved over every stripped gear" tells rather than shows, and "the way one greets an old friend" is a stock closure gesture. Propulsion is steady but gentle; no artifact obscures causality or closure, so deductions remain small.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of blindness, thermal light-reading via water refraction, and hummingbird-drone repair is specific and non-obvious; the premise transforms "blind artisan" tropes through embodied technical method. The mist-coated rail depot and maiden-voyage timeframe add texture without feeling ornamental. However, the emotional arc (serene competence → serene return to work) and the lack of genuine complication keep the story in familiar "steadfast artisan" territory. The water-refraction method is fresh, but the stakes and resolution avoid bold risk—Elara's mastery is never credibly threatened.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive all major beats: she diagnoses the fracture by touch and rotor vibration, mixes and applies resin, tests via thermal water-reading, and releases the drone. Her decision to stay ("I will always be here to patch what needs patching") reconfigures her role at closure. The character is present in setup, development (repair sequence), and payoff (release and return to the bench), with causal pressure across three distinct beats and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The drone appears in four beats: arrival, diagnostic touch, thermal test, and release. Its "lead frequency" property is irreplaceable (the swarm depends on it), its damaged wing constrains Elara's method, and its successful flight enables the Aurelia's departure. The drone is handled on the page, its state changes causally (broken → patched → operational), and it participates directly in the closure action (Soren releases it; it "shot forward... carrying its frequency"). High specificity and causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The repair shop frames all action and stakes: it is Elara's workspace, the site of the diagnostic trough, and the location she vows to remain in at closure. The shop's tools and methods (patching resin, micro-LEDs, water feature) shape her tactics throughout. The concept is present in setup (converted maintenance bay), development (every repair beat), and payoff (her return to the bench). The shop is the fixed locus that contrasts with the departing ship, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Blindness constrains Elara's method in every diagnostic and repair beat: she relies on touch (texture of fractures, weight of tools), sound (rotor asymmetry), and thermal gradients (heat from refracted light). The trait is present in setup ("had not seen light in eleven years"), development (all sensory substitutions), and payoff (her blind gaze toward the harbor). However, blindness never threatens failure—her alternative senses are so refined that no visible cost or trade-off materializes. The attribute enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Patch" is the central action: Elara applies resin to the carbon-lattice fractures, tests the repair via water refraction, and reassembles the drone. The action drives the middle sequence and enables the ship's departure. It is present in setup (title of her role: "patching the wing membrane"), development (the resin application and thermal test), and payoff (her promise to "patch what needs patching"). The verb is thematically charged and irreplaceable; without patching, the drone cannot fly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The water-refraction method is introduced early (Soren has "seen her tilt the piece at precise angles"), demonstrated on-page during the climactic diagnostic ("She held the patched wing over the trough... reading the thermal language of scattered light"), and essential to the repair's success. The method is specific to Elara's blindness, shapes her tactics, and cannot be swapped for a generic inspection. Present in setup (backstory anchor), development (thermal test), and payoff (the "Clean" verdict enables release). High irreplaceability and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot supplies the condensation that feeds Elara's diagnostic trough, anchors spatial choreography (workbench, bay doors, platforms, harbor view), and provides the auditory cues (anchor chain, horn, winch) that track the deadline. The setting is present throughout, shapes Elara's method (mist → water → refraction test), and returns in the closure image ("The mist kept falling. The depot breathed."). The depot is a micro-setting that alters tactics and charges the final mood.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The anchor-lifting timeframe is signaled early ("before the ship leaves"), tracked via the horn and winch sounds, and tightens Elara's window in the middle beats ("the winch had begun to groan"). Soren's run and the drone's release occur "as the Aurelia prepared to taste open water for the first time." The timeframe is present in setup, development (auditory deadline cues), and payoff (ship departure confirmed). However, the clock is more atmospheric than urgent—Elara's repair proceeds without visible time pressure altering her method or forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation—decode swarm feedback into ship navigation—is explained by Soren and drives his urgency, but it remains external to Elara's internal desire. Elara's own motivation (to repair well, to remain steadfast) is constant and untroubled; no internal friction between wants and costs materializes. The motivation is present in setup (Soren's explanation), development (his anxiety), and payoff (the swarm's function confirmed), but it is told and observed rather than dramatized through Elara's conflicted choices. Functional but not deeply inhabited.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Magnetic calm is embodied in Elara's measured movements ("deliberate strokes"), her reassuring responses ("her calm settling over the space like the mist itself"), and the story's syntactic rhythm (long, breathing sentences). The tone modulates subtly—Soren's urgency creates counterpoint, and the final paragraph's cadence ("The mist kept falling. The depot breathed.") deepens the calm into acceptance. Tone is present throughout, coherent across turns, and charges the closure image. High integration and thematic alignment.</comment>
