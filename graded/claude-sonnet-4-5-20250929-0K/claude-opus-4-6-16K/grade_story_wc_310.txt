<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is consistently embodied through her coin-casting ritual and her "quietly enthusiastic" approach despite cosmic collapse. Her interiority is specific ("wavelength align with purpose") and her micro-choices—gathering coins slowly, deciding to tell the crew—reveal hierarchy under pressure. The "stellar doubt" moment crystallizes internal contradiction, and her final stance (choosing to cast lots "even if next is yesterday") forecloses passivity with visible cost. Minor: the crew remains abstract, limiting relational pressure, but single-POV interiority is strong and the final choice is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when within opening paragraphs (amber observatory, Maren, post-contraction universe). Pressure accumulates through static bursts arriving faster, the coin pattern revealing an un-sealed corridor, and Maren's decision to act despite futility. Closure is Charged Poise: "someone had to choose what comes next. Even if next was yesterday. Even if the coins fell the same way twice. Especially then." This crystallizes her stance and reconfigures the premise with felt cost (endurance in meaninglessness). One tightening (static acceleration) is sufficient for this length and lens; cost is legible in the final image's defiant repetition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck is purposefully distinct (pooled light from stellar death), and the coins function as micro-setting—each carries "electromagnetic signature of its origin world," constraining her divination method. Spatial choreography is clear (deck, crescent spread, coins at her feet). The copper disk landing on edge and titanium sliver rolling to crescent's edge charge the coin-scatter beat. The amber light returns in the final image, anchoring closure. Economy is strong; no occupational clutter. Qualifies for 7+ band: environment (coins) constrains choice and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to act (cast lots, tell the crew) when causality runs backward and purpose may be illusory. The static bursts arriving faster create one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens, and Maren's coin reading reveals an un-noticed problem (un-sealed corridor), forcing her decision. Her final choice—"she would tell the crew… she would cast the lots again… she would listen to the static"—is agency as endurance with visible cost (refusal of purposelessness). One deepening is sufficient at this length; the trade-off between stellar doubt and action is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: backwards prophecy, impossible coins, the tension between randomness and purpose. "Wavelength align with purpose" is not stated as thesis but enacted through her ritual and final stance. The coins' interference patterns and the static bursts form a coherent symbolic system that constrains her method. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: choosing "what comes next" even in a universe running toward extinction reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext operates in "especially then" and the amber light pooling at her feet. Minor: "stellar doubt" verges on label-speak but is embodied through her gathering coins "slowly" with "impossible weight."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with tight focalization. Perceptual signature is consistent: light "pooled," coins "unbonded into elementary particles," static as "symphony played in reverse." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during coin-reading, slightly wider for exposition on backwards prophecy). Diction remains within Maren's technical-contemplative register ("wavelength align," "interference patterns"). No head-hopping. The compression in "After the universe contracted, light had nowhere left to go. It pooled" demonstrates rhythmic control. Minor: a few filter verbs ("felt closest") are voice-consistent but slightly dull immediacy in one beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or pressure. Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Rhythm varies: short declaratives ("It pooled") contrast with longer contemplative beats. Figurative language is controlled and coherent ("honeyed glow," "stellar death compressed"). Minor loop: "cast lots" / "cast them" / "cast the lots again" recurs across three beats without evolving pressure, trending toward template cadence (−0.3). "Quietly enthusiastic" and "stellar doubt" appear twice each but serve different functions. Scaffold is minimal. No pronoun drift or simultaneity errors. Line-level clarity is strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The backwards-prophecy premise offers a fresh angle on post-apocalypse divination, and the specific detail (coins that "should have dissolved," light pooling after contraction) avoids generic everywhere settings. The synthesis of randomness and determinism through coin interference patterns feels specific. The final stance—choosing despite futility—transforms the trope through Maren's technical method and her renunciation of "stellar doubt." Risk: the lyric/accumulative structure and the commitment to a quiet ending heighten stakes without gimmickry. Minor: the observatory-crew setup and "cast lots decision maker" role echo familiar sci-fi governance motifs; transformation is present but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren, the cast lots decision maker, is present throughout. Her decisions—shaking coins, reading scatter, choosing to tell the crew—create the central turn. The role is introduced in paragraph three, developed through the coin-reading beat (middle), and drives the ending choice. Causal pressure: her method constrains tactics (must use coins, must interpret static). Closure linkage: "she would cast the lots again" directly invokes the role in the final image. Irreplaceability: high; the role is unique to the premise. Cost: visible in her endurance despite doubt. All three gates met; strong beat involvement and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The collection of foreign coins is introduced in paragraph two, handled in the coin-scatter beat (middle), and returns with reweighted meaning in the final paragraph ("gathered the coins slowly… impossible weight"). Early signal (+0.8), three distinct beats (+1.4), causal pressure (their electromagnetic signatures create interference patterns that constrain her divination method, +1.2), closure linkage (gathering them slowly with "stellar doubt" charges the ending stance, +1.4), specificity (each coin's origin world and signature matter, +0.6), cost connection (their impossibility embodies the story's central tension, +0.5). Total elevators ~5.9; cap check passed. Irreplaceable: removing the coins would break the divination logic and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy is introduced in paragraph four, shapes the static-burst method (middle), and frames the ending's temporal paradox ("what comes next. Even if next is yesterday"). Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (determines how she interprets static and why choice feels futile, +1.0), closure linkage (the final paradox depends on it, +1.2), specificity (not generic foresight, +0.4). No visible cost tied uniquely to the concept itself (stellar doubt is broader). Total elevators ~4.0. Strong integration but not indispensable; a different oracular constraint could work with edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Quietly enthusiastic" is stated in paragraph five: "She was quietly enthusiastic about this work, though she would never have said so aloud." It colors one micro-choice (her private thrill in decoding bursts) but does not constrain a high-stakes action or appear at closure. Label-only trend: the trait is told, not shown through distinct speech or gesture (−0.6). Late middle introduction (−0.3). No closure participation (−0.8 cap at 2.8 would apply, but lyric reprise consideration raises floor). Swappable: "solemnly dedicated" or "grimly committed" would work with minimal edits (−0.6). Functional but replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Distill" appears in paragraph four: "Maren's task was to distill meaning from these signals, to parse the noise into something the crew could act upon." The action is her core function, introduced early (+0.6), drives the coin-reading beat (middle, +0.4), and is implicit in the ending decision to "listen to the static" (+0.9). Causal pressure: her ability to distill meaning determines whether the crew survives (+1.0). Specificity: moderate; "interpret" or "decode" would be near-synonyms (−0.5). No unique cost tied solely to distillation itself. Two gates met (setup, middle); closure participation is implicit rather than explicit. Mid-7s band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Understanding static bursts" is introduced in paragraph four as her method, used in the coin-reading beat when "the static had changed" (middle), and drives the ending resolve to "listen to the static." Early signal (+0.7), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (the method shapes her interpretation and the crew's survival tactics, +1.1), closure linkage (listening to static is her final commitment, +1.0). Specificity: moderate; the mechanics (interference patterns, backwards signals) are sketched but not detailed (−0.3). Swappable: "interpreting transmissions" would work with minor edits (−0.5). All three gates met; solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "ambered observatory deck" is introduced in the opening line, used as the location for the coin-casting beat (middle), and returns in the final image ("amber light pooled around her feet"). Early signal (+0.8), two beats (+0.9), setting pressures choice indirectly (the deck is where she must act, +0.5), closure linkage (the amber light charges the ending stance, +1.1), specificity (pooled light from stellar death is unique, +0.5). No direct constraint on tactics; the observatory is backdrop more than obstacle (causal pressure modest). Total elevators ~3.8. Lyric reprise elevates to low-6s despite modest middle development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the universe contracts" is stated in the opening and frames causality (backwards prophecy, impossible coins). Early signal (+0.7), implicit in every beat (+0.9), causal pressure (determines why choice feels futile and why static arrives backward, +1.0). Closure linkage: the paradox "even if next is yesterday" depends on it (+1.0). No live clock or ticking deadline that alters tactics within the scene (−0.4). Time is cosmological backdrop rather than immediate constraint. Swappable: another apocalyptic frame (heat death, time loop) would work with moderate edits (−0.6). Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To wavelength align with purpose" is introduced in paragraph five as Maren's motivation, tested in the stellar-doubt beat (middle), and enacted in the ending choice to act despite futility. Early signal (+0.7), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (the desire to align drives her persistence and ritual, +1.2), closure linkage (choosing "what comes next" is the alignment in practice, +1.3), cost connection (the friction between alignment and stellar doubt is visible, +0.5). Specificity: the wavelength metaphor is unique (+0.4). All three gates met; strong integration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Stellar doubt" is introduced in paragraph seven ("Stellar doubt pressed against her ribs"), modulates the coin-gathering beat with "impossible weight," and charges the final image ("Even if the coins fell the same way twice. Especially then"). Early signal (~60% mark, −0.2), two beats (+0.9), tone coherence (doubt pervades the narration without flattening into static mood, +1.0), closure linkage (the defiance "especially then" gains power from the doubt, +1.5), specificity (stellar as cosmic scale is apt, +0.4). Mild label-speak (the phrase itself is slightly on-the-nose, −0.3), but the doubt is embodied through her slow gathering and the weight of the coins. Strong tonal charge at closure.</comment>
