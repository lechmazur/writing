<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is deeply embodied—grief "folding" manifests both literally and metaphorically through origami cranes, and her fear of the twentieth lantern shows contradictory impulses (wanting/avoiding her daughter's final dream) acting simultaneously. The final choice to draw rather than fold is earned by the lantern's revelation, foreclosing the origami path with visible cost. Minor deduction: the weeping moment leans slightly toward summary of emotional state rather than letting the embodied action (hanging the lantern, drawing) fully carry the release.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren shifts from preservation/folding to creation/drawing, reconfiguring her relationship to grief with visible cost (abandoning the origami system). The piece establishes an Accumulative lens early (dream-lantern ritual, cranes as grief containers) and delivers a decisive tightening when the twentieth lantern reveals Lira had dreamed the same transformation. Orientation anchors (floating island, tea garden, pavilion, basilica proximity) arrive within the first two paragraphs. One small slip: "the shadow detaches" recurs as a temporal marker but its mechanics (what it means for choice or risk) remain slightly atmospheric rather than constraint-driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden is vividly particular (jasmine, cloud-veined flagstones, bergamot air) and the shadowless hour creates a charged ritual window. The twentieth lantern—a tangible object Maren handles—constrains her final choice and charges the closure image. Slight dock: while the basilica is visually rich and emotionally resonant, its role remains largely symbolic; the tea garden itself does not pressure a mid-story decision, functioning more as backdrop than active constraint until the final act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether to play Lira's final dream) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through Maren's nightly ritual and explicit fear. The twentieth lantern's reveal—Lira dreamed the same transformation Maren enacts—deepens the grief work and forces the tightening choice: continue folding or unfold into creation. Agency is clear (Maren strikes the crystal, weeps, then draws), and the cost is visible (she abandons the containment system she built). One meaningful turn is sufficient at this length and the escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (grief as transformation, the choice between preservation and creation) emerges organically from the lantern-and-crane work without thesis statement. The final image—drawing the basilica-crane with "grief and grace folded into a single wing"—answers the thematic question non-literally and reweights all prior folding. Lira's dream ("descending while ascending") functions as earned subtext, showing mother and daughter converging on the same insight. The cranes and lanterns constrain choice and charge closure rather than serving as token motifs. Very slight dock: "luminous torment" in the weeping line brushes close to abstract statement, though the surrounding action anchors it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Maren's perceptual signature (grief as light, emotions folded, shadow detaching as ritual marker). Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring causality. Minor penalty: "luminous torment pouring through her like light through a polished gem" in the weeping passage elevates register slightly above the surrounding texture, and the phrase "gave Maren permission to unfold" borders on authorial summary rather than staying fully within Maren's discovery. Filter verbs ("watched," "understood") appear but remain voice-appropriate and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (each paragraph advances grief work, lantern mechanics, or emotional stakes). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Small deductions: "blinding, relentless, impossible to hold in bare hands" stacks three parallel modifiers in the opening without tightening; "she was afraid it would be dark. She was afraid it would be bright" uses deliberate repetition but the third clause ("afraid that once she heard its frequency") extends the parallelism into slight redundancy. The closing image ("like a lantern holds its light") is apt but leans slightly stock as a simile anchor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dream-recording lanterns and grief-as-origami offer a fresh synthesis, and the "descending while ascending" paradox transforms familiar metaphor into earned embodiment. The reveal that Lira dreamed her mother's coping method feels inevitable in hindsight. Slight dock: floating islands and glass basilicas evoke genre familiarity (Studio Ghibli, etc.), and while the piece personalizes them through Maren's grief, the setting itself does not surprise. The emotional truth and thematic complexity elevate above surface novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout, her choice to strike the twentieth lantern creates the key turn (Lira's dream revelation), and her final decision to draw rather than fold drives closure. "Crafty" is demonstrated through dream-recording mechanics (grinding memory into luminescence, gem polishing). The character's agency shapes all major beats and the ending would collapse without her.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glass basilica appears in three beats: Lira's memory (setup), the dream vision (development—it folds into a crane), and the closing image (shadow and light). Its transformation in the dream charges Maren's final act, but the object itself is not handled or used by Maren; it remains observed and symbolic. The reprise reweights meaning but lacks physical interaction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dream recording is established early (gem polishing, memory grinding, frequency capture), shapes the dominant stake (whether to play the final dream), and drives the climactic revelation (Lira's descending/ascending vision). The mechanics constrain Maren's ritual and the twentieth lantern's playback alters her tactics. Present in setup, development, and closure with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Descends while ascending" appears first as the dream content (Lira falling yet rising, landing on the spire) and charges the closure image (grief and grace "folded into a single wing"). The paradox enables Maren's final transformation and reweights the entire folding metaphor. Not a physical constraint on action but conceptually indispensable to the thematic turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Transform" operates at multiple scales: Maren transforms grief into cranes (literal folding), the basilica transforms into a crane in Lira's dream, and Maren's final choice transforms her practice from folding to drawing. The dream-vision of transformation redefines Maren's options and is causally active in the ending. Removing this action would eliminate the closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Gem polishing is introduced early (raw crystals from the garden's roots, cut and polished into lenses) and explains how dreams are captured. The method shapes the lantern mechanics but does not constrain a mid-story choice or tactic. It participates in setup and context but remains descriptive rather than tactically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden provides the workshop location, supplies the crystals (from levitation core roots), and establishes the shadowless ritual hour. The setting frames the entire action and the shadow-detachment creates a temporal marker for Maren's nightly practice. It does not pressure a mid-scene tactical choice but supports closure atmosphere (cranes turning in thermal drafts). Present across all three gates but more contextual than causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"After the shadow detaches" is the liminal hour when Maren plays the lanterns, creating a ritual window and heightening vulnerability ("shadowless, raw, exposed"). The timeframe is present at setup (nightly ritual), signals the climax (tonight, the shadow detached), and charges the final image (shadow returning, held gently). It shapes the emotional stakes and timing of the key choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren's drive to fold grief into origami cranes is established early (hundreds hang from the beams), dramatized through her nightly ritual, and conflicted (folding as containment vs. the need to unfold). The twentieth lantern forces friction between preservation and release. The final choice to stop folding and draw instead forecloses the crane-path with visible cost, making the motivation indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" is embodied in the opening metaphor (grief as blinding light), sustained through the dream-lantern imagery (memory ground into luminescence), and arrives on-page during the weeping passage. Tone modulates from ritual control (nightly playback) to rupture (weeping) to quiet creation (drawing). The phrase itself risks abstraction but the surrounding images anchor it, and tone coheres across the arc.</comment>
