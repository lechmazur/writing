<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's claustrophobia is embodied through counted steps and breath thinning, driving micro-choices under pressure. Interior contradiction surfaces in "quiet defiance against her own nerves" and "stubborn tenderness toward the vast world," creating layered motivation. The final choice to climb out with the key is earned by the pattern of choosing forward motion despite fear. Minor slip: "prudently adventurous" reads as convenient label rather than contradiction tested on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: descent triggers spatial mutiny, compass point vibrates as tuning fork, organ sound stills the architecture, Maren follows resonance to the key. Closure delivers Decisive Change—key retrieved, walls still pressing—with visible cost (counted steps, sustained claustrophobia). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. One meaningful tightening when tunnels compress and she must adapt tactics. Cost is legible in "she counted every step. She did not stop."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Nexus's shifting walls, narrow passages, and vertical shaft create spatial constraint that drives Maren's choices. Compass point and organ pipes function as micro-setting elements that enable the solution. Starlight through the collapsed nave charges both opening and ending images. Sensory detail—"walls sliding inward with geological patience," vibration in steel—filters through Maren's professional and fearful attention. The body (breath, pulse, chest seizing) serves as immediate constraint throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve the key to the deepest archive) is signaled in paragraph two and sustained. One meaningful tightening: spatial mutiny forces Maren to discover the organ's function, narrowing her options to following harmonic resonance. Agency is enacted through her decision to press the compass point and move quickly while walls are stilled. The final climb—"She did not stop"—forecloses retreat with visible cost (sustained physical and psychological pressure). Coincidence (wind activating organ) complicates but Maren's use of the compass and movement complete the causal chain.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of defiance-through-endurance emerges from Maren's claustrophobia confronted scene-by-scene, not stated. "Stubborn tenderness toward the vast world" and "refusing to let fear choose her boundaries" accumulate weight through counted steps and the choice to descend. The organ/architecture pairing—sound disciplining space—offers non-literal resonance without moralizing. Final image (key warm, walls pressing, counting steps, organ's "gratitude") reweights confinement as both obstacle and condition of discovery. Minor excess: "wistful rebellion" label in closing paragraph edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tight third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature: fear quantified ("forty-seven steps"), spatial metaphors ("moth pinned under glass"), professional vocabulary ("tuning fork," "dowsing rod"). Diction remains character-apt; elevated phrasing ("geological patience," "prudently adventurous") fits a cartographer's interior register. Narrative certainty matches POV knowledge throughout. No head-hopping. Compression at peak beats ("She moved quickly") supports urgency without obscuring clarity. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long, layered sentences in reflection, clipped action in crisis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density high; most sentences advance both atmosphere and causality. Syntax varies purposefully: long accumulative builds in description, short declaratives at turns ("She understood"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor figurative density in opening paragraph ("architects whose names had dissolved into legend," "shadows pooled") does not obscure sense. "Spatial mutiny" and "hymn played by weather and decay" are fresh, coherent metaphors. Slight scaffold: "That was its own kind of wistful rebellion" in the penultimate paragraph reads as thematic summary rather than image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The organ-as-counterpoint to shifting architecture offers a non-obvious synthesis rooted in world logic. Claustrophobic cartographer embodies lived contradiction rather than token quirk. Transformation test passes: plot depends on this specific pairing of spatial mutiny and sonic stabilization. Proximity check clean; no close echoes of famous lines. Risk: structural interweaving of fear, architecture, and music heightens stakes without gimmickry. Slight derivative pull: "forgotten places" and "subterranean crossing" echo genre templates, though execution is specific enough to offset.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices drive all key turns: decision to descend, to press compass point to wall, to move quickly during stilled moment, to retrieve key and climb out. Present in setup (profession/motivation), middle (discovering tuning-fork function), and closure (final climb with key). Claustrophobia constrains every beat with visible cost. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Compass point introduced early, used in two distinct beats (vibration test at shifting tunnel, following resonance through junctions), and present implicitly at closure as the means that led her to the key. Reweighted from map fragment to tuning fork. Specific properties (steel, salvaged from designer's set) matter. Strong integration, though not explicitly held/charged in final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Spatial mutiny" named and dramatized in paragraph five, shapes all middle tactics (Maren must wait for organ sound, follow resonance), and the stilled-then-pressing walls frame the final climb. Concept alters options on every page. High causal pressure, irreplaceability, and closure linkage. The architects' intentional design of mutiny-plus-organ drives the entire problem-solution arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Prudently adventurous" appears as mentor's phrase in opening and manifests in counted steps and measured courage, but the constraint is not tested with visible cost on the page—Maren never risks recklessness. Present in setup and reflected in closure behavior (not stopping), but lacks a distinct beat where prudence and daring conflict. Functional but not irreplaceable; similar traits would serve.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Transfix" is the named effect when organ sound stops the shifting walls, the pivotal turn that enables Maren's success. Setup (organ pipes described), development (wind activates them, architecture freezes), closure participation (walls remain stilled during retrieval and press again on exit). Unique mechanic; swapping the verb or method would require major rewrites. High causal necessity and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Organ reverberation signaled in paragraph two (pipes still standing), mechanics explained and enacted in paragraph six (sound pins corridors), shapes all subsequent movement, and echoes in final paragraph with "gratitude." Early setup, middle development (the solution), closure participation (final chord, ending mood). Method is irreplaceable; removing organ breaks the spatial-mutiny problem.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Shadowed Nexus is the location throughout; starlight through collapsed nave anchors opening and closing images. The setting's core property (self-rearranging architecture) creates all conflict and the vertical shaft in the final chamber supplies the key's pedestal. Present in setup, development (mutiny), and closure (exit under starlight). Micro-setting (narrow passages, junction walls) alters tactics at every beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fallow period introduced in opening paragraph, explained as when "the earth slept deepest" and wind through organ is "enough" to still the Nexus. Timeframe enables the solution—outside this season the organ might not sound. Setup and development clear; closure participation implicit (Maren exits during same window). Constraints are conceptual (seasonal quietness) rather than a live ticking clock, reducing urgency slightly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Desire to retrieve the key stated in paragraph two, drives every choice (descent, using compass, following resonance, final retrieval). Motivation is dramatized through action rather than told. Mild friction: wants align neatly with steps; fear complicates but does not create conflicting goals. Present across all three gates with clear causal pressure, though not tested by competing desires on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Wistful rebellion" named in closing paragraph but enacted throughout: claustrophobic defiance, "stubborn tenderness," gratitude in the organ's sound. Tone modulates with pressure—reflective in descent, urgent when walls shift, poignant at closure. Coherent across beats. Minor label-reliance: the phrase appears as summary rather than emerging solely from imagery, and "wistful" is less dramatized than "rebellion."</comment>
