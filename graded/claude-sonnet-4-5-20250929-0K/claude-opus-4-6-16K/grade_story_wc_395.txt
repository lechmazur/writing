<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's character is established through her professional acuity ("brightly attentive," noticing millisecond delays) and her investigative drive. Her decision to expose the hidden partition shows agency under pressure, though the internal conflict between institutional loyalty and moral obligation remains largely told rather than dramatically embodied in contradictory impulses. The final choice to press send is earned by prior investigation but lacks visible on-page hesitation or cost that would elevate it to high-band territory. Harke's pupils dilating is a concrete tell, but Lena's emotional progression from suspicion to certainty to action feels smooth rather than messy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal/Accumulative Hybrid—investigation beats follow because/therefore logic while the 7-22 pattern accumulates texture. Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change: Lena presses send, altering her stance from keeper to whistleblower. The orientation anchors (Lena, archive, Chicago) arrive promptly. The reversal (Harke's lie → deeper digging) narrows options and the final act carries conceptual cost (her role as Memory Keeper now weaponized against the corporation). However, the cost remains somewhat abstract—we don't see immediate职业 jeopardy or relational rupture on the page, only the charged atmosphere of "forty-three ghosts had drawn breath," which is evocative but oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The server archive is vividly particular: "hummed in frequencies that reminded Lena... of songs she could almost remember," "liminal partition," "buffer zone." The setting constrains Lena's access and enables her discovery through metadata and hidden partitions. The recurring 7-22 signature functions as micro-setting, charging the investigation. However, the corporate retreat "Site 722" and the physical archive space remain underdeveloped—we never see her navigate the server complex physically or encounter spatial obstacles. The environment guides choice through data architecture rather than embodied action, which fits the concept but slightly limits tangible constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: expose the suppressed disappearances. The 7-22 pattern discovery escalates to the hidden partition, then to Harke's lie, then to the unsent messages and Site 722 revelation. One meaningful tightening occurs when Harke dismisses her findings, forcing her to dig covertly. The final decision (sending the evidence) is protagonist-driven and forecloses her role as neutral keeper. Cost is signaled (she's now a whistleblower against her employer) but remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—no immediate threat materializes on the page, only the charged expectancy of the archive's "silence... changed."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: data as memory, corporate suppression as digital burial, the archive as a gravesite with a heartbeat. The 7-22 motif functions as a language of the dead, not a code but "a count." The final image—"forty-three ghosts had drawn breath"—reweights the premise without overt moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary: "The data remembered what the corporation wanted to forget" articulates the story's thesis in direct language rather than letting the action speak. The tension between preservation and exposure creates genuine complexity, though the resolution tilts clearly toward moral clarity without ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with tight focalization through Lena's professional lens. Perceptual signature is distinct: "she knew corrupted data by its smell," "that brightly attentive instinct." Diction remains character-appropriate (metadata, timestamps, buffer zone) without jarring register shifts. The prose modulates under pressure: calm investigation → suspicion → covert action. Minor filter-verb presence ("She understood now") is voice-motivated and doesn't dull immediacy. No head-hopping. The metaphor "furniture in an abandoned house" and "echo of forgotten songs" are slightly elevated but consistent with Lena's philosophical bent about where deleted files go.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence-level craft is strong with purposeful rhythm variation and vivid texture ("frequencies that reminded Lena of songs she could almost remember"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances discovery. However, minor scaffold appears: "Not metaphorically missing. Missing persons. Cold cases, every one" restates for emphasis without adding pressure, and "She brought her findings to Desmond Harke" followed by "He studied her report" cycles through predictable steps. The pattern-number repetition (7-22-7-22-7-22) borders on over-emphasis in the opening. No major loops or template cadence, but the prose occasionally luxuriates in metaphor during investigation beats where leaner momentum would serve better.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes digital archaeology, corporate conspiracy, and cold cases in a plausible near-future frame. The 7-22 motif as both signature and count is a fresh inflection. The "Memory Keeper" role and the liminal partition concept show specificity. However, the core arc (lone investigator discovers corporate cover-up, whistleblows) follows a familiar template. The Artemis-7 lunar wreckage adds SFF texture but remains underdeveloped—what was in the patch that warranted forty-three disappearances? The story executes its premise competently but doesn't transform the whistleblower framework into something unexpected. The philosophical question "where deleted files go" provides thematic depth but the investigative mechanics are conventional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena as Memory Keeper is established early, drives all investigation beats (discovering the pattern, confronting Harke, copying data), and her final choice (pressing send) converts her archival role into activism. The職業 specificity (metadata cataloging, decommissioning accounts) constrains her access and enables discovery. Her professional philosophy ("where deleted files go") directly motivates the entire arc. Present in setup, middle investigation, and closure decision with visible cost (she weaponizes her keeper role against the institution).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The Artemis-7 patch appears mid-story as evidence within the hidden profiles' photos. It connects to Site 722 and explains why the forty-three vanished, establishing motive for the cover-up. However, it's only mentioned in one expository beat—"a singed triangular emblem"—without being handled, examined physically, or reweighted at closure. No tactile engagement or evolving meaning across beats. Functions as plot token rather than charged object. Swappable with any recovered evidence (document, sample, recording) without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The missing-persons cold case concept anchors the entire investigation and defines the stakes. Lena's discovery that all forty-three disappeared people had deleted profiles drives every beat from pattern recognition through final exposure. The concept shapes tactics (cross-referencing public records, hidden partition forensics) and pressures the climax (whistleblowing to journalists and oversight). The unsent messages and Site 722 link deepen the mystery. Present in setup (orphaned accounts), developed through investigation, and fulfilled at closure when she sends evidence to make "the world remember." Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" is established early with concrete examples: noticing three-millisecond delays, feeling "the texture of data the way a jeweler feels the weight of a stone." The trait enables her pattern discovery (7-22 sequence) and detection of Harke's lie (pupils dilating). However, it never constrains a choice or imposes visible cost—her hyper-awareness only helps, never hinders. No moment where obsessive attention causes her to miss something larger or alienate a colleague. Functions as enabling superpower rather than double-edged trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Harke's lie ("There's nothing there, Lena. You're pattern-matching noise.") is the story's pivot: it confirms conspiracy, converts Lena from institutional investigator to covert whistleblower, and escalates the stakes. The lie drives the second half—she digs deeper, finds the unsent messages and Site 722. Without this turn, she might have stopped or escalated through official channels. His physiological tell (dilated pupils at "Diana Okafor") makes the lie legible and motivates her tactical shift. Essential beat that redefines options and locks in the closure path.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Recurring 7-22 numbers shape the entire investigation: file timestamps, server temps, calorie count, email count. The pattern drives Lena's initial suspicion, leads to the hidden partition discovery, and reappears in deletion dates and Site 722 naming. It functions as the archive's "language," a signature trail left by the cover-up. The motif is established in paragraph two, recurs across investigative beats, and is conceptually repriced in the ending: "not a code... a count." Shapes attempts and charges the final image. Near-indispensable; removing it would collapse the investigation's causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The social network archive is present throughout, houses the conflict (hidden partition, metadata, unsent messages), and its humming refrain bookends the story. The setting enables discovery through its liminal spaces and buffer zones. The archive's "sensed absence" of forty-three people becomes tangible through data forensics. At closure, the archive's hum changes—"charged now, expectant"—reflecting the story's outcome. The digital architecture (server complex, partitions, metadata) constrains Lena's access and tactics. Not merely backdrop; the archive functions as both crime scene and witness, essential to plot mechanics and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears as metaphorical description of the archive's hum and platform mergers, not as a literal timeframe constraint. The story spans "that quarter" (Lena's decommissioning task) but time pressure never tightens decisions—no deadline, no escalating urgency from temporal limits. The investigation unfolds at Lena's pace. The "echo" motif recurs poetically but doesn't shape tactics or force trade-offs. Functions as atmospheric texture rather than structural time constraint. Swappable with any vague duration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The desire "to find where deleted files go" is established early as Lena's philosophical driver and career motivation. It directly powers her investigation into the hidden partition (files that "hadn't actually been deleted") and the forty-three preserved profiles. The motivation is dramatized through her forensic choices and refusal to accept Harke's dismissal. However, internal conflict is minimal—no moment where the cost of knowing tempts her to stop. The desire remains consistently noble without friction between professional curiosity and personal safety. Present across beats and fulfilled at closure but lacks opposing wants that would create authentic tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Sensed absence" is coherent throughout: the archive's hum of missing platforms, orphaned accounts as "furniture in an abandoned house," the liminal partition where deleted profiles linger, the "silence inside it" that changes at the end. Tone modulates from contemplative (opening hum) to unsettled (pattern discovery) to tense (Harke's lie) to charged (final breath of forty-three ghosts). The atmospheric consistency supports the investigative arc without becoming static. The ending image—ghosts drawing breath—crystallizes the tone with undeniable pressure. The sensed-absence motif charges the closure and reweights the archive from passive repository to active witness.</comment>
