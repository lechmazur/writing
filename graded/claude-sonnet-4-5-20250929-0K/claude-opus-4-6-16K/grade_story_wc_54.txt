<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's interior voice is specific and embodied—"functionally creative in a way her professors would have envied"—with contradictory impulses subtly present (professional duty versus personal need to matter). Her micro-choices (photographing the sextant, pocketing it, mapping flows) reveal hierarchy of values. The final proposal move is earned by prior causality, and the "maze of intentions" interiority adds depth. Minor slip: the carnival engineers and board members remain off-page abstractions, limiting relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Sable has plotted her coordinate and now waits, the feasibility study opening a corridor with visible opportunity cost (not a yes, acknowledging the maze ahead). The piece holds a Causal lens—carnival modifications seed her idea, she maps and calculates, proposal follows. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening: the discovery of redirected flows crystallizes her approach, narrowing options from passive survey to active resurrection proposal. Cost is felt in "waiting" and the open corridor, though slightly more oblique than a paid price on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is vivid and pressure-bearing: tile echoes, dormant grid, exposed junctions, old navigation lounge. Sensory detail (boots echoing, dusty counter, brass weight) is selective and filtered through Sable's engineering lens. The hydraulic and electrical systems constrain and enable her proposal, so setting shapes choice. The sextant and terminal infrastructure charge the final image. Minor gap: the carnival's physical footprint (rigs, displays) is sketched but not anchored spatially across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving resurrection cheaper than demolition—is signaled early and coheres. One meaningful tightening: the sextant inscription reframes her project from technical to intentional, narrowing her approach to "plotting coordinates" and crystallizing her proposal strategy. Agency is present in mapping, calculating, and drafting; the feasibility approval is a micro-turn that raises future cost (she must now deliver). The cost is opportunity and patience rather than immediate loss, fitting the Charged Poise closure but slightly muted for a higher band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—intention as the first coordinate, hope as functionally creative engineering—emerges from particulars (redirected flows, sextant, proposal math) without moralizing. The final image ("old water finding new channels") reweights prior material with a quiet, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the maze metaphor threading choice and purpose. The sextant inscription constrains her framing without becoming a thesis statement. No overt philosophizing; the proposal's "sober language" carries "quiet amazement" earned by scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable and apt; Sable's perceptual signature (engineering particulars, "functionally creative," "listening to echoes") is consistent and character-specific. Diction fits her intern role without register drift. The phrase "equations forming in her mind were not standard civil engineering" anchors reflection in present observation. Rhythm modulates from measured opening to the propulsive final-paragraph flow. Minor slip: "stoic intensity that her supervisors mistook for mere diligence" tells a nuance the prose could have shown through a supervisor's glance or comment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Clarity and propulsion are strong; sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., carnival setup also frames abandonment, sextant discovery also reframes intention). Opening and closing lines anchor and resonate. Rhythm varies purposefully across beats. Minor penalties: "She was twenty-two, a civil engineering intern assigned to the Meridian Infrastructure Reclamation Office" feels scaffold-heavy with appositive stacking. The phrase "equations for hope, formulas that could prove" is a near-paraphrase loop. One instance of filter-stack: "She understood mazes" immediately follows interior maze-mapping without added pressure. Deductions total approximately −0.5 for minor loops and one scaffold beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination—abandoned spaceport, carnival's accidental improvements, civil engineer intern, sextant relic—feels specific and non-obvious. The "functionally creative" framing transforms a standard reclamation plot into a meditation on intention and resurrection. Emotional truth (need to matter, proving structures carry memory) anchors the concept. Weak spot: the carnival-leaves-terminal-empty setup is recognizable; transformation comes primarily from the sextant and redirected-flows angle rather than a fully fresh premise. No close echoes of famous scenes, and the synthesis feels earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sable drives the two key turns: discovering the redirected flows (which crystallizes her vision) and drafting the proposal (which opens the feasibility corridor). Her curiosity is dramatized through mapping, calculation, and the sextant moment. Setup clear, two beats involved, closure linked via the proposal submission. The "curious" trait is more implicit than explicitly cost-bearing, but her engineering observation enables all forward movement. Mid-band solid; not indispensable in that another specialist could occupy the role with edits, but tightly woven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sextant appears in two distinct beats: discovery in the navigation lounge (reframing her intention) and presence on her desk during proposal drafting. Its inscription "Intention is the first coordinate" directly seeds her tactical shift from technical survey to intentional resurrection plan and charges the final image. Setup past the first third (−0.3), but causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Swappable with another relic artifact bearing a similar motto (−0.3). Totals approximately 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The maze metaphor appears early ("Intention, after all, was a maze") and recurs in the middle ("Her entire internship had been a maze of intentions") and at closure ("an open corridor in the maze"). It shapes stakes by framing the feasibility study as one corridor among many and reweights the ending image. However, the maze functions primarily as thematic resonance rather than a tactical constraint that narrows her on-page choices—she maps flows and drafts a proposal without navigating literal decision branches. Present across three beats, but more lyric than causal. Approximately 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is signaled early (carnival's jury-rigged systems) and again applied to Sable's own approach ("equations for hope" that repurpose infrastructure). It enables her core tactic: seeing resurrection potential in accidental improvements. One on-page cost: choosing this unorthodox frame risks board rejection (she must "dress it in sober language bureaucrats trusted"). The trait is more pervasive in narration than tested under pressure; visible tradeoff is slight. Setup strong, one beat with mild cost, closure participation via the proposal's creative logic. Approximately 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is the story's central action: Sable's goal ("structures carried memory worth preserving"), her proposal's aim ("resurrect the terminal through redirected flows"), and the final image ("flowing toward a future"). Two major turns trace to it: recognizing the flows' potential and drafting the resurrection plan. The feasibility approval is a micro-turn within that frame. Setup clear, two beats, closure tightly linked. Small swappability risk—"reclaim" or "revive" could substitute with minor edits—but "resurrect" carries stronger thematic charge (death/life, memory/future). Approximately 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" is introduced early (carnival rerouted water) and becomes Sable's core method: she maps every redirected flow, calculates reclamation rates, and titles her proposal "resurrect the terminal through redirected flows." The mechanics matter—hydraulic lines repurposed for hydroponics, rainwater channeled—and shape her feasibility study's structure. Setup strong, two beats (discovery and proposal), closure participation clear. Slightly abstract as a method (she doesn't redirect a flow on the page, only maps prior redirections), so causal pressure is one step removed. Approximately 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The terminal is the story's sole setting, present from the opening sentence through closure. It supplies the puzzle (exposed junctions, dormant grid, skylights for solar), pressures Sable's choices (vast scale, abandonment status, board scrutiny), and houses the sextant discovery. Her proposal's feasibility hinges on terminal-specific constraints (load-bearing walls, concourse gardens, hydraulic lines). Setup immediate, three beats (survey, discovery, proposal), closure image ("old water finding new channels") is terminal-specific. The space is active, not postcard. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The carnival's Thursday departure frames the story's start, and "over the following weeks" marks proposal duration. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions—Sable's survey and drafting could occur at any post-carnival moment with identical pressure. The carnival's absence matters thematically (leftover improvements) but not as a temporal constraint. Setup clear, but no middle or closure tightening via deadline or clock. Functional scene anchor, not a causal driver. Approximately 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sable's desire to "puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated early and dramatized through her mapping obsession and proposal drafting. Friction appears in "quiet desire to matter" versus professional duty and in waiting for the colony to find its own intention. One on-page cost: her "stoic intensity" isolates her (supervisors misread it as diligence). The motivation drives two beats (mapping, proposal) and charges the final wait. However, the phrasing "equations for hope" is slightly abstract; more embodied want-versus-fear tension would lift it. Approximately 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is coherent from the opening (boots echoing, "genuinely impressed") through the sextant moment ("feeling its weight, its improbable presence") to the measured proposal presentation ("without smiling, letting the math carry its own quiet amazement") and final image ("listening to echoes, trusting"). Tone modulates under pressure—calm observation during survey, compressed intensity during proposal work, patient poise at closure—without breaking register. The diction ("functionally creative," "quiet amazement," "something ahead was worth reaching") sustains the blend. Tone charges the final image's restrained hope. Strong execution.</comment>
