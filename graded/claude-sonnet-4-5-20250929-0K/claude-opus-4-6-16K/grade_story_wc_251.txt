<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is highly controlled—her motivation is clear and her method of "cradling" unspoken words feels embodied. Internal contradiction is present (fear this wouldn't matter vs. continuing the work), but the piece tilts heavily toward summary of eleven years rather than live micro-choices under pressure. The grotto scene shows others reacting, not Maren's own stakes-driven decision that forecloses a path with visible cost, weakening agency at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece uses an Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring motifs (library, notebooks, mist, chess pieces) gather density and the final notebook entry reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear promptly. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maren moves from routine displays to the grotto installation, then writes her own fear. The cost is legible on the page ("I was afraid this wouldn't matter"), though the ending image leans toward asserted resonance rather than a decisive physical or relational price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt library, magnetic grotto, and recurring objects (notebooks, chess pieces, compasses) are vividly rendered with purposeful detail. The grotto's magnetic pull holds notebooks open, a micro-setting constraint that charges the climactic scene. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (mist, starlight, stone) and details are filtered through Maren's professional chess-coach lens. The library and grotto both constrain choice and anchor the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear: whether Maren's quiet displays matter. The grotto installation represents escalation, moving from storefronts to an immersive event, and the town's response tightens pressure. However, the piece summarizes years of work and others' reactions rather than dramatizing a live reversal driven by Maren's agency. The final notebook entry feels more like thematic punctuation than a decision that forecloses options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: silence as truth, unspoken words reclaimed, winning vs. being right. The chess-queen display and the grotto's constellation notebooks avoid overt moralizing. The final line "It mattered" risks thematic echo but is cushioned by prior particulars and the image of the blank notebook. Subtext operates effectively in the widow's grief, the father's apology, the politician's doubt—all dramatized through display phrases rather than declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric, precise, with controlled distance (third limited) and a perceptual signature tied to Maren's chess-coach patience and listening gift. Diction choices ("deep bruising," "forests of second thoughts," "patient as a pawn one square from promotion") are character-particular and voice-motivated. No head-hopping. The piece teaches its pattern of poetic compression early and sustains it through closure. Brief elevated register ("hush where past meets prophecy") fits the lyric mode without breaking the established lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; sentences often do multiple jobs. A handful of figurative phrases approach overwriting ("color of deep bruising," "amplified quiet," "prophecy") but remain legible and the pattern is taught. Minor scaffold appears in the reflective summary of eleven years and the town's founding week, slightly dulling momentum before the grotto scene. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity and propulsion hold through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—a listener of unspoken words creating window displays—is fresh and the magnetic grotto under starlight offers a non-obvious venue for climax. Chess-coach profession and the "cradling" metaphor are specific. However, the "quiet rebel changes hearts through art" frame is familiar; transformation relies on poetic execution rather than structural surprise. The grotto installation and final self-inscription feel earned but not radically unexpected. Risk-taking is moderate: lyric compression without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as chess coach appears in the opening and the queen-chess-piece display mid-story, shaping her patience and metaphor vocabulary. Her method (listening, transcribing, displaying) drives all beats. However, the coach role itself does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics at closure; the gift of hearing unspoken words and the display method do the causal work. Present in setup and development, but swappable with another patient, observant profession.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto appears in setup (hinted as a known landmark) and becomes the climactic venue. Its magnetic properties hold notebooks open on stone ledges, a specific constraint that shapes the installation's mechanics. Starlight illuminates the words, charging the final image. The grotto enables the most ambitious act and is present in the closure scene. Not quite indispensable—another evocative venue could serve—but deeply integrated and irreplaceable without significant rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Humble rebellion" is named on the page and enacted through Maren's method: no marches, just glass and light. It frames the dominant stake and shapes every display beat. The council's failed prosecution and the grotto's quiet gathering dramatize the concept's pressure. However, it functions more as thematic lens than a constraint that narrows tactical options; Maren never faces a choice between loud confrontation and quiet art. Present in setup, development, and thematically at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Hearing unspoken words is introduced in paragraph three and enables every display. The trait is used in multiple beats (library listening, transcription, grotto arrangement) and its cost is implicit: absorbing others' pain for years without voicing her own fear until the end. The final notebook entry shows the price of the gift. However, we never see a moment where the ability constrains Maren or forces a trade-off on the page; it primarily functions as enabling superpower.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Cradle" appears as a metaphor in paragraph four ("the way one holds a wounded bird") and recurs subtly in Maren's handling of fragments and her final posture with the notebook ("cradling her last empty notebook against her chest"). The action shapes her method and voice but does not drive a major turn; it describes her care rather than creating a choice point. Present in setup and ending reprise, but largely atmospheric rather than causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Organizing synchronized window displays is introduced early, detailed with specific examples (pharmacy, bookshop, hardware store), and drives the narrative through multiple beats. The method matters: overnight installation, weekly changes, sympathetic shopkeepers. The grotto expands the method to immersive installation. Removing the display method would collapse the story's logic. However, the mechanics are told more than dramatized; we never see Maren negotiating with a shopkeeper or installing a display under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cobalt library appears in the opening and closing, frames Maren's work, and its reading room is where she harvests unspoken words. The library's own front window hosts the queen display that stops the council. The mist and blue color charge the atmosphere and the final image ("patient as a pawn"). However, the library does not constrain a key choice; most action occurs in town storefronts and the grotto. Strong atmospheric and thematic presence, moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"The hush where past meets prophecy" and "that strange autumn week when the anniversary of the town's founding overlapped with the election" are named but never dramatized. No ticking clock, no choice shaped by the timeframe's pressure. The phrase enriches tone but remains ornamental; the grotto installation could occur at any moment. Present as thematic color, absent as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—to plant forests of second thoughts—is stated explicitly and enacted through all display beats. It drives her method and the grotto installation. The final notebook reveals the fear beneath ("I was afraid this wouldn't matter"), showing friction between intention and doubt. However, the motivation is more told than tested; we never see Maren tempted to abandon the work or forced to choose between second thoughts and certainty. Present in setup, method, and closure theme.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is named and sustained throughout: the library's louder silence, the unspoken words, the reading silence in the grotto, the "new silence…of recognition." Tone modulates appropriately from the library's patient waiting to the grotto's charged hush to the final understated claim "It mattered." The tone charges the final image and is indispensable to the piece's effect. Coherent, purposeful, and fully integrated.</comment>
