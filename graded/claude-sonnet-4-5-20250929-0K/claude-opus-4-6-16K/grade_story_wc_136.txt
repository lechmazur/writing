<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sable's interiority is concrete and character-specific—her decades-long mapping compulsion and the mother-shaped void drive her choices without therapy-speak. The final decision to walk without documenting is earned by the accumulated weight of "every map she had drawn to avoid standing still long enough to grieve," foreclosing her evasion pattern with visible cost. Internal contradiction operates simultaneously: she seeks truth while building elaborate defenses against it. Minor slip: the embodied emotion could be sharper in the climax beat; "trembling certainty" is asserted more than shown through contradictory micro-actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Sable chooses presence over documentation, foreclosing her eleven-year cartographic defense with on-page cost ("She did not bring her maps"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—arrows, cracks, terminal, punch, and maternal silhouette accrete until the final walk reweights all prior mapping as avoidance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by the second paragraph without delay. One meaningful deepening occurs when the punch bite reveals "a key, disguised as a wound," narrowing her options to confrontation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The starlit vault constrains the final choice—mist parts only after the punch is used, making environment causally active. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "old leather and static electricity" grounds the railcar, "fractures in the glass roof" create the light columns that make the punch visible. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (platform → Track Nine → railcar interior → illuminated track). The body-as-setting (her fingertip tracing cracks, palm feeling the hum of cord) charges micro-moments without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—confronting maternal abandonment and her own evasion architecture—is signaled early and tightens in the railcar when Sable realizes "the fortress was built from her own architecture as much as anyone's." The punch-squeeze is protagonist-driven agency that opens the corridor, a meaningful pressure point with immediate consequence. Cost is visible: she leaves her maps, abandoning the professional identity that has armored her for eleven years. Theemo-logic of "dare herself into territory that could not be charted afterward" credibly raises the price of the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: unspoken truths literalized as architecture, cartography as grief-avoidance, the punch's "key disguised as a wound." The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer—walking the mother's arrow without documentation enacts presence over analysis—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the silent terminal, the mother's notebook of unsent letters, the decade of route-mapping that converges here. Minor wobble: "holding everything and explaining nothing" in the final line borders on theme-statement where image alone would suffice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and controlled: "the hour that divides bad habits and new starts," "homesick for places they had never visited," "grief annotated instead of felt." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close in the railcar, pulling back for the vault's witness at closure. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she reads cracks as arrows, sees the punch's teeth as a map symbol. Two slips lower the score: "fastidious devotion" and "analytically artistic" in the opener edge toward label-speak, and "trembling certainty" recurs as a phrase rather than enacted through contradictory gestures in the squeeze-moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines multi-task (the punch "validated passage not between cities, but between what was spoken and what was swallowed"). Rhythm varies and propulsion holds through the accumulative structure. Three localized artifacts prevent higher scores: "the fortress of unspoken truths" repeats across paragraphs without evolved meaning (paraphrase loop), "every map/mystery/route" stacks in parallel without added pressure (template cadence in paragraph four), and "trembling certainty" appears in both the title-concept and closure without dramatized contradiction. No clarity harm at closure, so caps don't apply, but the loops dull momentum mid-piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography-as-grief-evasion, phantom municipal devices, and literal unspoken-truth architecture feels specific and non-obvious. The cracks-as-arrows motif and the punch that bites invisible passage transform familiar "map to closure" tropes through concrete world-logic and embodied stakes. Transformation test: remove Sable's profession and maternal loss, and the emotional arc collapses—the freshness is wed to character. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and the refusal to explain the mother's fate heighten stakes. Proximity check clean; no close echoes of famous closure images detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable the meticulous route mapper is present in setup (opening paragraph), shapes middle choices (following arrows, documenting cracks), and drives closure (decides to walk without maps). Her cartographic compulsion creates the central contradiction: mapping to avoid feeling. The final renunciation of documentation is causally impossible without her established trait. Cost is visible—she abandons the professional armor that defined eleven years.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The phantom train ticket punch appears mid-story (railcar seat), is handled and examined (she studies its teeth, recognizes the map symbol), and used at closure (squeezes to open the corridor). Two beats: discovery and use. The punch's mechanics (bites invisible passage, teeth form a map symbol) are specific and irreplaceable. Slight swappability: another phantom device could serve similar function with modest edits. Cost linkage moderate—using it dares her forward but the price is mostly Sable's choice to follow, not the punch itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Unraveling mysteries is mentioned in setup (eleven years of mapping mysteries) and frames the dominant stake (finding the fortress). It shapes her tactics—following arrows, documenting each crack—across the middle. At closure the "mystery" thread is less active; the final walk is about presence versus evasion rather than solving. The concept enables but doesn't drive the turn; the punch and maternal confrontation do the causal work at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Analytically artistic" is labeled in the opening paragraph and illustrated with one image (contour lines + strange elegance). It does not constrain an on-page choice or enable a tactic under pressure. The trait could be removed and the plot would function unchanged; her meticulous observation and cartographic skill do the actual causal work. Label-only without visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Dare" is setup in the rulebook mention (stationmaster's journal) and central at closure: "to use the punch was to dare herself into territory that could not be charted afterward." The squeeze-action is the pivot that opens the corridor and Sable's path forward. The word and concept are irreplaceable—alternative framing (risk, choose, attempt) would not carry the same charge of self-challenge tied to her evasion history. Cost is explicit and felt.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cracks forming arrows are signaled early (three months of following), shape all middle tactics (she traces each arrow, documents them, follows across the city), and converge at closure (the final arrow her mother cracked). The method is mechanically specific and irreplaceable—without the directional cracks, her eleven-year search has no navigation system. Causal pressure across at least four beats. Cost: following them consumed years and led her to confront what she avoided.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The starlit vault in mist is present in setup (second paragraph anchor), houses the railcar discovery, and the mist parts at closure to reveal the corridor. Setting enables the climax: fractures in glass roof provide light to study the punch, mist's parting is the visible consequence of the squeeze. Two beats of direct involvement. Moderate irreplaceability—another liminal transit space could substitute with edits, though the vault's cathedral-like enclosure and vapor reinforce the theme of silent accumulation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "upon the hour that divides bad habits and new starts" is signaled in the opening (midnight) and the terminal clock chimes midnight's final stroke before the punch is used. The hour adds thematic weight but does not tighten tactics—Sable's actions would proceed identically at any hour. It reweights the closure image (transition from evasion to presence) but functions more as resonance than constraint. Lyric reprise from first third to ending, limited causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to find the fortress is established in setup, dramatized through eleven years of route-mapping, and friction appears when she realizes the fortress "was built from her own architecture"—her search was self-evasion. The discovery forces a choice with cost: confront or continue mapping. The motivation drives the middle (following arrows) and is reweighted at closure (she walks the final arrow without documentation). Two beats and closure linkage with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Trembling certainty is named at the punch-squeeze moment and coheres with the piece's accumulative pressure—certainty in the arrows' truth, trembling at the personal cost. Tone modulates appropriately: analytical in the mapping passages, charged in the railcar, quiet-resolute at the walk. The phrase is asserted rather than fully enacted through contradictory gesture; showing both tremor and resolve in simultaneous action would lift this higher. It charges the final image but could be sharper in embodied contradiction.</comment>
