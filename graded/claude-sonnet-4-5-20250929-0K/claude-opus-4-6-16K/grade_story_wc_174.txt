<comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and specific—the calligrapher's precision, the "half-lit epiphany," the stillness recognized as performance. The reversal from performer to facilitator is earned through concrete on-page reflection tied to the story stick and Petra's accusation. His admission "You were right" and acknowledgment of fear show embodied stakes with visible cost. Minor slip: the serenity-as-performance insight arrives slightly late and could have constrained an earlier micro-choice to reach higher bands.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Causal-Accumulative Hybrid, dominantly Causal at closure. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (Marcus, dome, post-argument). The closure is a Decisive Change—Marcus commits to reversing his method, Petra accepts, and the cost (his terror, the relinquishment of control) is legible on the page in "That terrifies you" / "Yes." One meaningful tightening occurs when the story stick's seventh notch (reversal) prompts his epiphany, which then drives the service-door confrontation. The lens holds; the final image (broken dome still listening) resonates without requiring more. No causality breaks.</comment>

<comment>The radar dome's cracked meridian and single blade of starlight anchor mood and constrain the scene spatially; the service door becomes the threshold for Marcus's choice. The story stick is handled twice with distinct texture (tracing the seventh notch, setting it down), and its grooves guide narrative structure on the page. The desert air and creosote scent mark the shift to confrontation. The dome's final image—"broken receiver still listening"—charges closure by reweighting the story's central question about ethical reception. Strong spatial choreography and purposeful detail throughout.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: whether Marcus's puppet shows exploit or honor their subjects. The escalation is causal: Petra's accusation → Marcus traces the reversal notch → he formulates a new method → he exits to propose it, admitting fear. The cost is visible: relinquishing control and the "equanimity" he performed, which the text frames as "no real skin in the game." One meaningful tightening suffices at this length. The terror he names forecloses the safer path of aesthetic distance. Minor: the antagonist (Petra) applies pressure off-page in the argument itself; on-page she tests his sincerity, which slightly dilutes immediacy of the confrontation but does not break escalation.</comment>

<comment>Theme—ethical art-making, whose story to tell—emerges through concrete particulars: the story stick's notches, the puppet faces in calligraphic script, the reversal beat as both narrative structure and moral pivot. The dome's "broken receiver still listening" image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: receptivity without the old design, transformation through rupture. No thesis statement; the "half-lit epiphany" is earned by prior pressure and embodied in Marcus's terror. The final exchange ("That's where the real story starts") lands as a character insight, not a moral, and the image reweights all prior material. Subtext operates in the starlight's shift and Petra's long look.</comment>

<comment>POV is stable third limited on Marcus; psychic distance tightens under pressure (the epiphany paragraph) and opens for the final image without head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "uncommonly serene," "meteor-hush glow," "shop rags," "corrosive lies families tell." Dialogue is spare, functional, and carries subtext—Petra's "That terrifies you" tests sincerity, Marcus's "Yes" is a vow, not exposition. The prose rhythm modulates: longer, syntactically complex sentences during reflection, clipped exchanges at closure. Perceptual signature: Marcus notices script, notches, light angles, the mechanics of performance. No filter-verb stacks or convergence.</comment>

<comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (e.g., the puppet-show paragraph compresses fifteen years and method in ~150 words without drag). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled: "blade of starlight," "meteor-hush glow," "candle seen through fog" all cohere and avoid mixed vehicles. Minor density slip: "the hush left behind by a heated argument" in the opening and "the argument's echo still lived" in the second paragraph restate the same acoustic fact without added pressure, triggering a small paraphrase-loop penalty (−0.2). The closure image is sharp and propulsive. Grammar and pronoun reference are clean throughout.</comment>

<comment>The urbane-calligrapher-turned-ethical-puppeteer premise is a specific synthesis, and the story stick as compass for reversal is a fresh inflection. The dome setting and the "half-lit epiphany" motif avoid generic frames. However, the core arc—artist confronts exploitation, proposes collaborative model—follows a recognizable ethical-art template without a deeply non-obvious moral calculus or transformation that would elevate it further. The Navajo veteran's gift and the reversal-notch mechanic add texture, but the resolution (handing over the stage) is the predictable next step rather than an inevitable surprise. Strong specificity in detail and voice keep it in the upper 7s; more risk or complication in the final stance would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Marcus appears by name in the opening line and his choices drive all major turns: tracing the story stick (beat 1), formulating the reversal (beat 2), walking to the service door (beat 3), proposing the new method and admitting fear (beat 4). His calligrapher training shapes his perception (script, precision, guidelines) and his past meaningless work motivates the puppet shows. The closure turn—reversing his role—would not exist without his urbane-artist identity and the tension between beautiful control and ethical stakes. Setup, development, closure participation all present; causal pressure high; irreplaceability clear. Cost: relinquishing performed equanimity. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, specificity all strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The story stick is introduced in paragraph 5 (Navajo veteran's gift), handled on-page when Marcus traces the seventh notch (beat 1), and set down on the concrete before he exits (beat 2). Its notches structure his narrative compass and the reversal-notch specifically triggers the epiphany that drives closure. The object enables the tactic (using story structure to understand his ethical failure) and is irreplaceable—no generic prop could substitute. Setup by mid-story, two distinct beats, causal pressure, closure linkage (the epiphany it prompts leads directly to the service-door scene). Minor: it does not appear in the final image itself, capping it slightly below the highest band.</comment>

<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The "half-lit epiphany" is named explicitly and staged on-page: "He felt the epiphany arrive not as a thunderclap but as a half-lit thing, a candle seen through fog." It shapes Marcus's realization (reversal of lens) and drives the choice to exit and propose the new method. The concept is seeded early via Petra's accusation (his shows mine trauma without full honesty) and paid off in his acknowledgment that his serenity was performance. It constrains his options—he cannot continue as before—and is thematically charged. Setup, development, closure participation present. Minor: the concept is more thematic accent than a physical constraint that alters tactics beat by beat, placing it mid-upper band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Uncommonly serene" appears in the opening line and is later reframed as performance: "his serene composure...was not strength. It was the stillness of a man who had been performing equanimity...with no real skin in the game." This recognition drives the closure choice to admit fear and relinquish control. The trait enables the reflective epiphany (his calm allows the long meditation) and the cost is its unmasking. Setup early, closure participation via the realization that dismantles it. However, the attribute does not visibly constrain a middle action or force a tactical trade-off on-page—it is more realization than lever—capping it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>"Reverse" is seeded via the story stick's seventh notch ("the one he always associated with reversal"), becomes the epiphany's core mechanic ("What if ethical storytelling meant reversing the lens entirely?"), and is voiced in the closure beat: "I want to reverse the whole thing. I want to hand the stage over." The action redefines the story's central conflict and forecloses the prior method. Setup, development (epiphany), and closure participation all present; causal pressure is high. The reversal is irreplaceable—no synonym captures the structural and moral pivot. Minor: the action is cognitive rather than physical, slightly limiting visceral presence, but it drives all closure choices.</comment>

<comment>The puppet shows are described in paragraph 4 with concrete mechanics: "crude, stitched from shop rags," faces in calligraphic script, stories about addiction and betrayal told in seedy bars. They are the method under scrutiny—Petra calls them exploitative—and the epiphany proposes their reversal. The shows shape the dominant stake and enable Marcus's ethical crisis. However, no show is dramatized on-page; the method is summarized in backstory. Setup and thematic development present; closure participation via the proposed reversal. Causal pressure moderate. The lack of an on-page performance caps the score; if one show had been staged, it would reach higher bands.</comment>

<comment>The radar dome anchors every beat: cracked meridian admitting starlight (opening and closing images), concrete floor where Marcus sits, service door as threshold for confrontation, acoustics holding the argument's echo. The dome's破裂 (brokenness) mirrors Marcus's ethical rupture and the final image—"broken receiver still listening"—reweights the closure by making the theme of receptivity spatial and inevitable. The setting pressures the choice by isolating Marcus in a space built for old signals, forcing reflection. Setup, development (the blade of starlight shifts as earth turns), closure charge all strong. Physical constraint is moderate (the space isolates but does not block action), placing it in upper 7s.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The timeframe—"the hush left behind by a heated argument"—is signaled in the title and opening paragraph. The argument's echo "took minutes to fully die," anchoring the reflective window. The starlight's shift marks earth's rotation, giving a naturalistic clock to the meditation. The hush enables the epiphany (silence as condition for thought) and ends when Marcus exits to Petra. However, no ticking urgency tightens decisions—Marcus could sit longer or shorter without altering the outcome. Setup and development present; closure participation moderate (the hush ends but does not drive the choice). The timeframe frames mood more than tactics, capping it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Marcus's motivation—"to explore ethical storytelling"—is dramatized through his past (meaningless calligraphy, penance puppet shows), Petra's accusation, and his epiphany about reversing the lens. The desire is conflicted: he wants to matter but has been "mining other people's trauma," and the cost of the new method ("That terrifies you" / "Yes") forecloses the safer aesthetic distance. The motivation drives every beat and shapes closure. Setup (the puppet shows as ethical experiment), development (the reversal-notch insight), and closure participation (the proposal and admission of fear) all present. Friction between want (ethical work) and cost (loss of control) is high. Irreplaceable; causal pressure strong.</comment>

<comment>"Meteor hush" is named in the text ("pale, meteor-hush glow") and sustained through auditory and visual imagery: the dome's acoustics, the dying echo, the single blade of starlight, the cool desert air. Tone modulates subtly—contemplative during reflection, tense in the epiphany, quiet but charged in the final exchange—without breaking the hush frame. The final image (dome listening for signals) reinforces the tone and charges closure. However, "meteor hush" as a phrase appears only once on-page, and the tone is more atmospheric backdrop than a constraint that alters tactics beat by beat. Setup, development, closure charge present; causal pressure moderate. Strong coherence and closure linkage lift it to mid-7s.</comment>
