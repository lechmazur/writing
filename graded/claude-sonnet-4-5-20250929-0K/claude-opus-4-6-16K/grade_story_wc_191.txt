<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Senna's motivation is clear and her "wisely adventurous" trait shapes multiple micro-choices (three escape routes, peeling paint, not hesitating at the stairs). Internal contradiction appears in the simultaneous caution and boldness, embodied in her methodical yet decisive actions. The final choice to sit on the throne feels earned by her decades of cataloging and the escalating pressure of the ticking clock. Minor issue: her interiority occasionally relies on declarative summary ("She had not come to visit") rather than embodied sensation at peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with accumulative elements in the world-building; the because/therefore chain (coordinates→orchard→paint layers→ruby flake→stairs→throne) holds cleanly. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: she sits, claims the throne, and awakens the network, foreclosing her role as observer. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the waterfall's dawn deadline forces the descent, and the final image reweights her journey from cataloger to sovereign with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The kaleidoscopic waterfall constrains entry/exit timing and creates concrete danger (burning skin at dawn), directly shaping her window of action. The chrome-bark trees, geothermal springs, and the ruby flake's resonance integrate tactile, auditory, and visual specificity that charges the orchard and descent. Spatial choreography remains clear across the orchard floor, down the stairs, and into the throne chamber. The prismatic light filtering through the flake is both sensory anchor and causal trigger, fulfilling the micro-setting gate for 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reach the throne before dawn) is signaled early and tightens through the paint-peeling sequence and stair descent. One meaningful escalation: the ground opening forces immediate commitment with no return path once the waterfall seals. Agency is clear in the choice to peel, to descend, and finally to sit—each forecloses a path. Cost is visible: she cannot leave, and her role transforms irreversibly. The sunrise clock creates genuine pressure, though the descent itself encounters no complication beyond physical exertion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme of dormant power awaiting intentional claim emerges through the orchard's "beautiful, disconnected, slowly forgetting" nodes, the unclaimed throne, and Senna's transformation from observer to sovereign. The final image—"She would give them something worth hearing"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting her cataloging as prologue to activation. Subtext operates in the layered paint (failed pilgrims) and her refusal to merely visit. Minor slip: "what power meant" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thesis statement rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited to Senna; perceptual signature shows her lore-keeper lens (holographic archive, degraded data-glass, living network). Diction is consistent and controlled, blending technical specificity with lyric compression ("signal static," "curtains of color"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the paint-peeling beat and expanding for the throne room. No dialogue present. Register occasionally elevates ("ionosphere," "bioelectric charge") but reads voice-motivated for a scholar character, not drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance world, character, or pressure. Sentence rhythm varies and propels, accelerating during the descent. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor density slip: "She had until sunrise. Six hours remained. Maybe less." restates the same constraint across three sentences without added pressure. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. One metaphor approaches stock: "collapsed in its own brilliance" trends toward cliché but remains legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The post-post-apocalyptic frame (ruins of the gleaming civilization, not the ancient one) and the chrome-bark data-tree orchard offer fresh specificity. The stairway-of-ascension motif is familiar but transformed through the paint-archaeology method and the ruby-flake key, which are non-obvious. Emotional arc and world logic cohere; the piece commits fully to its premise. Risk: the lyric-SF register and compressed time structure succeed without obscuring clarity. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Senna's choices drive all major turns: consulting the archive, entering the orchard, peeling the paint, holding the flake to light, descending, and sitting on the throne. Each decision narrows options and shapes the causal chain. Present in setup (opening paragraph), development (paint-peeling choice), and payoff (final choice to sit). High irreplaceability and causal pressure across at least four distinct beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ruby flake appears in the paint-peeling beat, is held to prismatic light (causing the ground to open), carried in her fist during descent, and its broadcast tone activates circuitry. Beats: discovery, activation, descent accompaniment. Present in setup (peeling), development (opening mechanism), and payoff (circuitry awakening during climb). Strong causal pressure and specificity; its crystallized-data-glass nature and resonant frequency are irreplaceable properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The unclaimed throne frames the entire quest and is the physical/symbolic goal. It appears in setup (oral traditions, archives), development (implicit throughout the descent as destination), and payoff (she sits, awakening the network). Shapes the dominant stake and the final image. Causal role is strong but somewhat abstract until the ending; the throne itself does not constrain tactics until the final beat, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous" is signaled in the opening beat (three escape routes yet always steps through) and enacted in the paint-peeling and descent choices. It constrains her method—she plans, then commits—visible in her midnight entry and methodical paint removal. Present in setup and development; cost is implicit in her calculated risk-taking. The trait could be rephrased without breaking the story, limiting irreplaceability, but it does shape her tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Sally forth" appears once at the descent moment, marking her commitment to enter the stairs. It drives the major turn from orchard to stairway and is the hinge between preparation and ascension. Present in development and implicit in payoff (the sally's consequence). Causal weight is solid; however, the action itself could be described with near-synonyms ("descended," "entered") with minor edits, limiting top-band eligibility despite its clear beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The peel-of-paint-layers method is signaled early (she begins to peel), drives the middle sequence (arrows, mural, warning, schematic, ruby flake discovery), and its payoff (the revealed map and flake) opens the stairs. Present across setup, development, and payoff. The mechanics matter: each layer reveals older information, and the deepest layer yields the key. High specificity and causal pressure across multiple beats; removing this exact method would collapse the discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hidden orchard behind the kaleidoscopic waterfall provides the entry mechanism, the data-tree network, the paint archive, and the stairway entrance beneath the central trunk. The waterfall's timed danger (dawn sealing) constrains her window and forces urgency. Present in setup (coordinates, approach), development (orchard exploration, paint work), and payoff (sealing behind her as she ascends). The setting supplies resources (trees, flake) and pressure (clock, one-way passage); multiple beats depend on its specific features.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "until sunrise" timeframe is established early (six hours, maybe less) and referenced at the throne chamber (dawn minutes away), creating urgency. It constrains her exploration window and forces the descent choice. Present in setup and payoff. However, the clock is not tracked during the middle beats—no intermediate time checks during peeling or climbing—so it functions more as boundary condition than live tactical pressure, limiting higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to find the stairway of ascension drives every choice: crossing continents, entering the orchard, peeling paint, descending, and sitting on the throne. It is dramatized through her methodical archive study, her physical actions under pressure, and the final commitment. Present in setup (opening exposition), development (all tactical choices aim toward this goal), and payoff (she reaches and claims the throne). High causal pressure and irreplaceability; the quest structure depends entirely on this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia coheres through the "ruins of the old world" frame, chrome-bark trees as monuments "slowly forgetting," degraded holograms, and Senna's reverent recording. The tone modulates appropriately: lyric during the orchard exploration, urgent during the descent, charged at the throne. It is present in setup (cataloging, degraded archive), development (reverent movement, monument description), and payoff (ancient network awakening). The tone charges the final image by reweighting the past as now-activated rather than merely elegiac.</comment>
