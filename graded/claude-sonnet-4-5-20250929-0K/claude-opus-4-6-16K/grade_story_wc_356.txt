<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's internal journey from obsessive data collection to allowing organic growth is well-earned through sensory specificity and embodied interiority. The shift from journalizing to doodling reflects genuine character contradiction—her family custom wars with her ambition. The corpse flower insight lands with cost: she relinquishes her need for control. Minor weakness: the final moment ("did not reach for a pen") feels slightly telegraphed rather than discovered, and Ohn's wisdom arrives as exposition rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren renounces her monitoring habit with visible cost—she closes the journal, plants the seed without measurement protocols, embodying the undercurrent wisdom. The seed's planting and the final line crystallize her shift. Orientation anchors cleanly (treetop village, dusk, workshop). One meaningful deepening: understanding the flower blooms *through* rot, not despite it, which reweights her approach and forecloses the path of obsessive control.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The canopy village is rendered with purposeful sensory detail—violet air, swaying bridges, moss and resin scents—that grounds Maren's work and isolation. Her acute sense of smell functions as micro-setting, constraining her marketplace experience and enabling her herbalist expertise. The hanging pot and clay vessel anchor key beats. The village itself remains somewhat postcard-like; it pressures through isolation but doesn't materially constrain the central choice about the seed's cultivation approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake clearly signaled: Maren's sleeplessness and need to quantify serenity. One meaningful tightening: the corpse flower's stench-as-invitation insight forces her to abandon measurement protocols with visible cost (she will not journalize hourly). Agency is present in her decision to plant without monitoring. Pressure accumulates through scent, Ohn's riddle, and her own exhaustion. Weakness: the elder's seed-gift and pronouncement feel somewhat given rather than earned through Maren's own investigation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wisdom as ceasing resistance, growth through decay rather than despite it. The corpse flower's rot-as-summons becomes a non-literal answer to Maren's sleeplessness and control obsession. Subtext operates through doodling versus journaling, scent versus vision, her mother's note "Breathe more." The final image—not reaching for a pen—reweights all prior data collection without stating a moral. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the closure beat. The grandmother's "think with your fingers" line risks platitude but is grounded in family practice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with distinct perceptual signature: Maren filters everything through scent, notices "particular sweetness of bark beetles." Diction stays consistent—"olfactorily sensitive," "carrion sweetness"—without register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to the final pulled-back "wildflower hush." No dialogue to evaluate. Minor slip: "the turning of the tide's thought" is a lyric intrusion that breaks the herbalist's concrete sensory idiom momentarily, though it mirrors the timeframe prompt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure and high information density. Strong images: "warm, decaying hand," "think with your fingers." No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity remains high throughout. Weakness: "ambition moved like wind through the canopy—restless, directionless" stacks metaphor without full coherence (wind has direction). "Olfactorily sensitive to a degree" is slightly clinical. The phrase "journalizing obsessively" uses a low-frequency verb that feels forced. Overall propulsion is strong with strategic telling that compresses backstory efficiently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of ambitious herbalist, acute scent, and corpse flower as metaphor for acceptance feels purposeful rather than template. The doodling-versus-journaling opposition is a fresh angle on control versus intuition. Treetop village and scent-symphony create memorable specificity. Weakness: the wise-elder-gives-seed setup is conventional, and the blooms-through-rot insight, while well-executed, is a familiar nature metaphor. The story transforms the material through sensory specificity and the family custom detail, but the core arc (driven professional learns to let go) remains within established templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's ambition is present from the opening and shapes her obsessive journalizing. Her key decision—to plant the seed without monitoring—directly opposes her stated drive and closes the story. She appears in every beat and her choices create the closure turn. The trait is more obstacle than engine until the final act, keeping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed appears in four beats: elder's gift, the unsealed pot/scent revelation, Maren's insight about blooming through rot, and the planting without protocols. Its unique property (rot-as-summons) drives the thematic realization and alters Maren's tactics. The seed's meaning evolves from riddle to answer. Removing it would collapse the story's logic and image system.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The undercurrent of wisdom is quoted by Ohn and demonstrated when Maren stops resisting the seed's natural process. It shapes her final choice to cease monitoring. However, it remains more thematic echo than on-page constraint—it doesn't narrow options in a middle beat, only reframes them at closure. The concept charges the ending but doesn't constrain tactics mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maren's acute sense of smell enables her herbalist expertise, makes marketplaces unbearable, and allows her to read the corpse flower seed's "carrion sweetness" and "green, embryonic" undercurrent. This sensory gate is the mechanism of her insight. It appears in three beats with functional cost (marketplace avoidance) and closure participation (breathing in the seed's scent leads to understanding). Specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Journalizing appears in early exposition (filling notebooks obsessively) and at closure when Maren closes her journal and does not reach for a pen. The action establishes her control obsession and its renunciation marks the turn. However, the middle lacks a beat where journalizing itself constrains a choice—it's backdrop until abandoned. Present in setup and payoff but underdeveloped in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Doodling on wrapping paper interior is introduced midstory with family history, used once to sketch the peaceful figure among roots, and mentioned in closure ("Think with your fingers"). It provides the counter-method to journalizing. Weakness: it doesn't constrain an earlier choice or face resistance; it simply appears as the alternate path. The lyric reprise and thematic charge elevate it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Canopis is anchored early with vivid detail (cypress crowns, woven walkways, violet air). The treetop isolation and hanging gardens establish Maren's context and ambition. The setting provides resources (hanging pot, black soil) and frames her expertise. However, the village itself doesn't materially pressure her choice about the seed—the conflict is internal. Atmospheric but not mechanically essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"The turning of the tide's thought" appears once as a phrase marking the dusk/nocturnal shift when Maren has her insight. It's poetic but vague—no clock pressure, no tightening deadline. Time is more mood than constraint. The phrase itself intrudes slightly on voice. Present as lyric marker but doesn't alter tactics or choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maren's desire to cultivate serenity drives her three years of work, obsessive journalizing, and sleeplessness. It's stated early and tested throughout. The friction between her need for control (data as architecture of mastery) and the cost (months without sleep) generates genuine tension. Her final choice to let the seed grow untended directly addresses this motivation with visible cost. The want-versus-method conflict is clear and sustained.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone is established as contemplative and sensory-rich from the opening ("violet air," "something older than language") and maintained through lyric phrasing and restrained rhythm. The "wildflower hush" phrase in the final paragraph explicitly names the tone and modulates from her earlier restlessness. Coherent and purposeful, though the final invocation feels slightly named rather than purely embodied. The tone charges the closure image without forcing a dramatic key change.</comment>
