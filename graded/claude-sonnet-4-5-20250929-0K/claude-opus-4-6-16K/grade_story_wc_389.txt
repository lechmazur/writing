<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's isolation and devotion to the transmissions are established, but her interiority remains at a distance—most of her emotional life is summarized ("long enough to forget... short enough to remember") rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The decision to broadcast feels driven more by plot mechanics than by an earned internal conflict; we see the action but not the cost of breaking eleven years of silence. Her characterization is consistent and her final choice aligns with established traits, but the absence of lived-in emotional friction under pressure keeps this from rising higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece opts for an Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments accrue meaning across the prophet's rise until Elara's broadcast reweights the entire pattern. Orientation is swift (observatory, Elara, radio fragments by the second paragraph). The closure—"prophecy wasn't a leash, it was a seed catalog"—delivers Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (she ends alone, but the world "chose"), and the final portico hum charges the image. One structural weakness: the middle section summarizes Davan's rise and the "race" rather than dramatizing a single pressure point, flattening escalation slightly. The lens holds and closure lands, but the summarized middle prevents higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observatory above thunderheads and the cobalt portico create vivid, purposeful micro-setting: the glass hums at instrument frequencies, refracts storm and starlight, and amplifies her broadcast at the climax. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("storm-lit and alone"), and spatial choreography is clean. The portico's return in the final line charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor limitation: the lowlands and Davan's gatherings remain generic placeholders without tactile specificity, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the ancient shadows serve or subvert human agency—is signaled early and drives Elara's choice to broadcast. However, the key escalation (Davan's rise, the realization that "someone down in the muck had a receiver") is summarized across years rather than dramatized in a single pressured beat, diffusing tension. The resolution (her broadcast fractures Davan's monopoly) is thematically resonant but lacks visible on-page cost at the moment of the choice; we're told the outcome ("Some chose him. Some chose her") without witnessing a trade-off or sacrifice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—prophecy as invitation rather than determinism, "a seed catalog" rather than a leash—emerges organically from the radio fragments and the variant allegiance motif. The final image ("stubbornly, beautifully open") offers a resonant answer without moralizing, and the thematic question is woven through action rather than asserted. One slip: "Prophecy wasn't a leash. It was a seed catalog" edges toward direct statement in the penultimate section, replacing scene pressure with meta-commentary at a pivotal moment (−0.3). The metaphor is apt and voice-consistent, preventing a larger penalty, but it pulls the reader out slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "ate cold beans from cans and talked to weather patterns like they owed her money" anchors Elara's perceptual signature with gritty whimsy. POV remains stable (single third-person limited), and diction matches the focalizer's blend of technical precision and lyric compression ("frozen prophecy," "shadow-tongue verses"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—zooming out for the prophet's rise, tightening for Elara's midnight pacing. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the prose rhythm varies under pressure without artificial pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: "lightning learned to sing" and "stars that hadn't yet decided whether to shine or weep" demonstrate rhythmic control and fresh metaphor without overwriting. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor issues: "gritty and whimsical" in the broadcast passage risks label-only description (−0.2), and "stubbornly, beautifully open" in the final paragraph stacks modifiers that slightly blur focus. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; grammar and sequence clarity are clean throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of radio archaeology, variant prophecy, and dueling interpreters transforms familiar "lone visionary vs. charismatic leader" material into a specific, non-obvious premise. The cobalt portico as signal amplifier and the fragmented broadcasts as invitation rather than script feel fresh. Risk-taking (the Accumulative lens, the observatory setting as character) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One limitation: the prophet Davan remains a stock figure—honey-and-gravel voice, constellation banners—without the same specificity lavished on Elara, keeping the piece from the highest originality band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her isolation/vision drive the arc. She makes two key choices: reversing her arrays to broadcast (setup and development) and her final acceptance of the open outcome (closure participation). Her loneliness constrains her tactics (no collaborators, solo decoding) and her vision enables the broadcast. Cost is visible in her continued isolation and the uncertainty of the outcome. Meets all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage, though the choices are more reactive than proactive, keeping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico is introduced early (setup), used functionally in two beats (it hums at frequencies matching her instruments; it amplifies her broadcast signal at the climax), and returns in the final line to charge the closure image ("The cobalt portico hummed its ancient chord"). Its specific properties—refraction, frequency resonance—enable her broadcast and link past to present. Strong closure participation and irreplaceability; could rise higher with more visible cost or mid-scene constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Variant allegiance is named explicitly and shapes the central question: whose side are the shadows on? It drives Elara's realization that the fragments serve no master and her decision to broadcast competing interpretations. Present in setup (third paragraph), developed in the race with Davan, and resolved in the ending ("shadows whispered their approval"). Causal role in one major turn; swappable with "plural prophecy" or similar, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The attribute "lyrically prophetic" is mentioned once in the method description ("lyrically prophetic fragments") but remains label-only. It does not constrain or enable a distinct on-page action with cost; the fragments function as plot mechanism without the lyric quality altering Elara's tactics or creating friction. Missing middle development and closure participation; introduced late (after 40% mark) as descriptor rather than active trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action "unfold" appears in two key moments: "The notebooks began to unfold their meaning at last" (climax setup) and implicitly in the resolution where the fragments' meanings diverge into multiple futures. It drives Elara's shift from hoarding to broadcasting and shapes the thematic payoff (doors vs. walls). Present across beats and ending, with causal pressure; slightly generic (could be "reveal," "open"), limiting irreplaceability to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Radio frequencies are signaled early (paragraph four: "jury-rigged radio arrays... pulling voices from the static"), drive the entire middle (decoding fragments, tracking Davan), and enable the climax (reversing arrays to broadcast). The mechanics matter: her signal "bled through every radio on the continent," creating the divergent outcome. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage; high irreplaceability (the story's logic depends on this exact medium).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is established early (opening line: "where lightning learned to sing, perched... above a permanent sea of thunderheads") and pressures Elara's isolation ("alone among the telescopes"). The setting enables her work (elevation above interference, the cobalt glass artifact) and charges the final image ("storm-lit and alone"). Meets all three gates; could score higher with a visible mid-scene constraint (e.g., storms threatening equipment, forcing a tactical choice).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the rise of a prophet" is signaled ("Three years ago, the broadcasts began naming someone") and structures the narrative arc. However, time is compressed into summary ("His followers numbered in the thousands now") rather than dramatized in beats that tighten decisions. Present in setup and implied at closure, but missing middle development where a ticking clock would escalate pressure. Functional but replaceable; lacks the live urgency required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to shape the dawn using ancient shadows is implicit in Elara's decade of transcription and explicit in her broadcast decision. It's dramatized in her choice to reverse the arrays and "hold the light high," and the cost is visible in her continued isolation and the uncertain outcome. Present in all three gates with causal linkage; slightly abstract phrasing ("shape a new dawn") reduces specificity, keeping it mid-band rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gritty whimsy is established early ("ate cold beans from cans and talked to weather patterns like they owed her money") and maintained through turns: technical detail paired with lyric compression, deadpan humor ("stubbornly, beautifully open") at the resolution. The tone modulates with pressure—tightening during the race, breathing at the ending—and charges the final image. Coherent across beats and integrated into voice; pervasive enough to feel indispensable, though the whimsy occasionally risks self-awareness ("gritty and whimsical" label in broadcast passage).</comment>
