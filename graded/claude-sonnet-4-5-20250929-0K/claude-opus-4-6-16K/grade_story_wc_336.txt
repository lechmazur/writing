<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is richly embodied through her pruning craft and world-weaving practice, with choices grounded in forty-seven years of observation. The seed-planting decision carries visible cost (vulnerability to both worlds dimming) and is earned by her accumulated understanding. Minor slip: the "insatiably creative mind" appears as a label rather than emerging fully through contradictory impulses in scene. Her motivations are clear and her final action forecloses a path with felt stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric description layered with reflection) and accumulates pressure through the graying-earth problem, the seed's bridging function, and Maren's choice to plant at the seam. Closure is Charged Poise: the seed reaches into the other world while Maren returns to her pruning work, crystallizing options with undeniable cost (both worlds' vulnerability). Orientation anchors are present by line 2 (Maren, parapet, waterfall, orchard). The cost is legible in "Color would come... but it would come" and the vulnerability acknowledgment, though the price remains largely prospective rather than paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The verdant parapet beside the waterfall is not postcard description—it constrains Maren's choice (thinnest seam between worlds, endless moisture for the seed) and charges the final image as she climbs back to the orchard through mist. Micro-setting details (moss-claimed stone, basin depth, the fold's shimmer) are filtered through her pruner's attention and directly enable the planting decision. The waterfall's "succor" and the parapet's position "between cliff and open sky" matter causally.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: preserve the world's color against its graying. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren moves from observation to the irreversible seed-planting, with the stated cost that "a bridge open in both directions meant vulnerability." Agency is decision with visible trade-off (one world's richness may dim to save the other). The pressure accumulates through lyric density rather than causal turns, fitting the Accumulative lens. Slightly below 8.0 because the cost, while acknowledged, remains largely prospective; we don't see immediate tactical constraint from the choice itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the particulars of pruning-as-conversation, the graying earth, and the seed as bridge, avoiding direct statement. The final image—Maren returning to prune while "something green and ancient began to grow"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to preservation-of-wonder without moralizing. The recurring motifs (fold/seam, color/essence, patient art of deciding what to keep) charge the ending organically. Minor reservation: "wonder" and "radiance" edge toward abstraction in a few beats, though grounded enough through the color-work mechanics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices the fold, filters setting through a pruner's patience, and perceives in metaphors of cut and growth. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("the season upon the hush of budding hope," "insatiably creative mind"). Distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and wider lyric observation. One minor slip: "insatiably creative mind" momentarily tells rather than shows, though the surrounding texture remains consistent. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with high information density; sentences do multiple jobs ("moss claimed the ancient stone in slow emerald conquest"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but coherent and serves the accumulative design. Minor deduction: the phrase "made it her life's purpose to preserve the color of wonder" edges toward summary abstraction in a beat that otherwise trusts image. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs cleanly. Overall clarity and propulsion are strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of pruning craft, world-folding, and essence-capture offers a fresh angle on fading-world premises. The specific method (cupping blossoms, breathing color into bark) and the seed-as-bridge mechanic are non-obvious and well-integrated. The piece commits fully to its lyric-textural premise. Deduction: the graying-earth and world-between-worlds frame, while executed at a high level, remains recognizably adjacent to fantasy/literary templates; transformation through Maren's pruner lens is strong but not enough to lift into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout, her pruner's lens filters all perception, and her planting decision creates the key turn. She appears in the opening, middle (planting), and final beats. However, her actual pruning work bookends the story without being dramatized in a choice under pressure; the pruning shears rest at her hip and she returns to pruning at the end. The seed-planting is the decisive act, but it is enabled by her accumulated wisdom rather than arising from a pruning choice in scene. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, but the pruner role is more lens than active constraint at the peak moment, and the final pruning is prospective.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The heirloom seed appears early (inner pocket introduction), is handled and planted in the climactic beat, and its growth shapes the final image ("something green and ancient began to grow"). Setup +0.7, two beats (introduction, planting) +0.9, causal pressure (bridges worlds) +1.4, closure linkage (root threading into other world, future color) +1.6, specificity (last of lineage, anchor point) +0.7, cost connection (vulnerability of both worlds) +0.5. The seed is indispensable to story logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is established early (Maren's childhood seeing the seam, stepping through the fold), shapes her color-preservation method in the middle, and the planted seed's root threads through the boundary in the ending. Setup +0.8, three beats (childhood, method explanation, seed's root crossing) +1.4, causal pressure (enables her life's work and the climactic planting) +1.4, closure linkage (the fold breathes, the root crosses) +1.5, specificity (the seam at the parapet is "the thinnest place") +0.7. The concept drives stakes and tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Insatiably creative" is mentioned once as a label ("an insatiably creative mind that refused to accept the slow graying of the earth") but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The essence-capture method and seed-planting demonstrate creativity's results, but the attribute itself is told rather than shown through a specific creative struggle or tradeoff. Setup (mid-story mention) −0.3, one beat (label mention) +0.4, no distinct causal pressure tied to the trait itself, swappable with "determined" or "resourceful" without altering structure. Label-only −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Succor" appears explicitly once: "She chose this place because the waterfall offered succor to everything that grew beside it, endless moisture, endless song." This reasoning directly shapes the planting location and thus the story's pivotal act. Setup (climactic beat) +0.5, one beat (waterfall's nourishment justifies the parapet choice) +0.4, causal pressure (enables seed survival) +1.0, closure linkage (the moisture sustains the growth mentioned at the end) +1.0. The term is specific and tied to cost (seed must have nourishment to bridge worlds), but it appears only once in summary rather than dramatized across beats. Not swappable; "nourishment" wouldn't carry the same connotation of comfort and support.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early in backstory ("she worked by capturing essence... breathe across its petals until the color lifted... press that distilled hue into the bark") and the seed-planting extends that method by anchoring the bridge permanently. Setup +0.6, two beats (explanation, planting as culmination) +0.9, causal pressure (the method is her life's work and the seed makes it sustainable) +1.0, specificity (cupping blossoms, breathing, pressing) +0.6. However, the method is recounted in summary rather than shown in a present-tense beat with stakes, and we don't see her perform the essence-capture on the page. Summary-only −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The verdant parapet beside the waterfall is introduced in the opening paragraph, supplies the thinnest seam for the planting, offers endless moisture (succor), and anchors the final image as Maren climbs back. Setup +0.8, three beats (opening, planting rationale, return climb) +1.4, causal pressure (only this location enables the bridging) +1.6, closure linkage (she climbs from parapet to orchard in final beat) +1.7, specificity (moss-claimed stone, three-hundred-foot drop, crack for the seed) +0.8. The setting is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Upon the hush of budding hope" is established early and frames the entire piece: frost has released but blossoms haven't committed, trees wait, Maren waits. The timeframe creates a thematic urgency (the moment before opening) that justifies the now-or-never planting. Setup +0.8, pervasive (opening, middle reflection, ending trembling buds) +1.4, causal pressure (the hush implies a closing window) +1.2, closure linkage (buds "almost ready" in final beat) +1.2. The timeframe is more atmospheric than a ticking clock with tactical consequences, but it does tighten the decision by framing it as a liminal, charged moment. No explicit countdown that alters moves on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Preserving the color of wonder is stated early ("She had made it her life's purpose"), dramatized through the graying-earth problem and her essence-capture work, and drives the seed-planting with acknowledged cost (both worlds' vulnerability). Setup +0.7, three beats (life's purpose statement, method explanation, planting decision) +1.4, causal pressure (the graying world forces the irreversible bridge) +1.4, closure linkage (color will come, slowly) +1.4, cost connection (vulnerability trade-off) +0.5. The motivation is strongly integrated, though "wonder" edges toward abstraction in one beat and the "life's purpose" phrasing momentarily tells rather than shows.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Radiant hush is established in the opening ("the mist softened every hard edge," "a silence that felt like held breath") and sustained through the piece with modulating intensity: quiet observation, reflective middle, and the charged final image ("The mist held its radiant hush. The buds held their breath."). Setup +0.8, pervasive across all beats +1.4, causal pressure (the tone reflects Maren's patient method and the liminal season) +1.0, closure linkage (final paragraph crystallizes the tone in two brief sentences) +1.8, specificity (not merely quiet, but luminous and expectant) +0.7. The tone is coherent, charges the ending, and fits the Accumulative lens.</comment>
