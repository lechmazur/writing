<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is specific and embodied—"the realization settled into her chest like a stone finding the seabed"—and her choices (dancing doors open, rolling dice, executing deletion) track causally through consistent motivation. The relationship with her absent mother forces key decisions and charges the ending. Minor slip: the inherited cipher system and her role as "lyrical code breaker" feel convenient rather than earned through prior contradiction or cost, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with visible cost: Maren deletes the operatives' files, fulfilling her mother's directive and forfeiting the intelligence archive. The lens reads as Causal with Accumulative accents (the dance metaphor and dice structure). Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers Lise is her mother, narrowing her options and reweighting the stake. Cost is legible in the deletion and the forty-year conversation completed, preventing higher band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory constrains Maren's movements (dance-locks, geothermal power, waterproof case) and charges the final image through the algae lights' exhale and the ocean parting. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "walls furred with salt crystal," "bone dice carved with tiny gallows." Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The laboratory as prison-concept integrates setting with theme, reaching high-8s on constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberating the operatives versus preserving the archive—signals early and tightens when Maren learns Lise is her mother. Agency is clear: she chooses deletion, forecloses the intelligence use, and completes her mother's design. The dice-roll structure and dance-based progression build pressure under a Causal lens. One tightening choice (execute deletion) narrows options with visible cost. Lacks a second reversal or complication that would test commitment further, capping below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—encoding vulnerability as strength, love as lock—emerges from the journal's confessions and the laboratory's architecture without moralizing. The final image (ocean parting, forty-year conversation completed) offers a resonant answer to the mother-daughter question. The hangman's dice and dance metaphor reweight prior material at closure. Minor slip: "calm defiance indistinguishable from grace" edges toward stated theme rather than embodied subtext, preventing 8.5+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual texture: "the ocean does not drown those who understand its language." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated. No dialogue present to evaluate. Brief register drift: "encrypted architectures that held this place together like a hymn holds a congregation" and "algorithmic sequence" slightly exceed the immediate sensory frame without clear character warrant, preventing higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high, but two issues lower the score. "She explains through dance what others explain through equations" is present-tense intrusion in past-tense narration, breaking stance. Figurative density ("stone finding the seabed," "spider spins its web," "hymn holds a congregation") clusters in the opening third without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting. Clarity remains intact and no loops appear, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—lyrical code breaker, dance-based locks, hangman's dice as one-time pad randomizer—feels specific and non-obvious. The mother-as-architect reveal and vulnerability-as-fortress paradox elevate the material. However, the "sunken lab with secret files" and "operatives' identities locked away" frame reads as familiar intelligence-thriller territory. Transformation through the dance metaphor and emotional particulars rescues it from mid-band, but the structural bones remain recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren ("lyrical code breaker") drives every key turn: decoding the journal (entry 3), rolling dice again (entry 6), and executing deletion. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle choice, ending action). Her specific method (singing ciphers loose, dancing doors open) is irreplaceable and constrains tactics throughout. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; visible cost (archive destroyed) ties directly to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hangman's dice appear in three beats: discovery, first roll (three steps/entry 3), second roll (six steps/entry 6). They enable the journal-decoding method and charge the final image ("small carved scaffolds pressing into her skin like punctuation marks"). Specific mechanics (gallows faces, one-time pad randomizer) are irreplaceable and causally active. Closure participation is strong, though the dice do not independently alter tactics beyond guiding which entry to decode.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Calm defiance" shapes the ending action: "Maren's fingers moved across the console with a calm defiance that was indistinguishable from grace." It appears in setup (her ease in the sunken lab) and crystallizes at closure (deletion protocol). The concept constrains her stance—no panic, no hesitation—and charges the final paragraph. However, it does not create a visible tradeoff or narrow options in the middle beats, limiting score to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Explains through dance" is demonstrated in two key beats: she dances the first door open ("slow pivot and three deliberate steps") and the second chamber ("as a spider spins its web"). It appears in setup, middle action, and closure metaphor ("she danced her way back"). The trait constrains access (doors respond to movement patterns, not keys) with visible cost (she must embody the cipher physically). Causal pressure and irreplaceability are high.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Liberate" drives the climax: Maren executes the deletion protocol, dissolving operatives' files and returning them to anonymity. It appears in setup (journal directive), middle realization (laboratory as prison), and closure action. The stakes hinge on this exact action—swapping it would break the mother's design and the story's moral calculus. Visible cost (archive destroyed, government loses intelligence) and causal pressure are undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Coded journal entries" appear in all three gates: Maren finds the journal early, decodes entry 3 (middle beat), and decodes entry 6 (final directive). The mechanics matter: hangman's dice determine which cipher key to apply, and Lise's encoding method is inherited by Maren. The method constrains her approach (must roll dice, sing ciphers loose) and enables the liberation. Irreplaceability and causal linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory pressures every choice: air-breathing requires cipher fluency, doors lock via movement patterns, the central console holds geothermal power, and the architecture is Lise's prison-design. It appears in setup, middle (second chamber), and closure (algae lights pulse, ocean parts). Setting constrains access, supplies resources (console, journal), and charges the final image. Irreplaceability is high; the laboratory is Lise's message made spatial.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"As a spider spins its web" is used once as a simile for Maren's second dance ("with patience, with geometry, with the quiet certainty that the structure would hold"). It does not appear in setup or closure, and it does not constrain time or tighten decisions. The phrase charges one descriptive beat but remains ornamental—time itself is not tracked or pressured. Lyric reprise is absent, capping score below 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Encrypt vulnerability as strength" is dramatized in Lise's journal confessions (fear and love encoded as unbreakable cipher) and Maren's inheritance of that method. It appears in setup (journal discovery), middle realization (entry 3), and closure (Maren completes the design by deleting files). The motivation shapes stakes—Lise's love becomes a lock only Maren can open—with visible cost (forty-year separation, archive destroyed). Minor friction: the motivation is told more than enacted in Maren's own choices, preventing 8.0+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" modulates across the piece: Maren moves "with the familiarity of someone returning to a childhood home she had never visited," the laboratory "recognized her dialect," and the ocean parts "with the mysterious familiarity of something that had always known she would come." Tone is coherent through setup, middle tension, and closure, supporting the inherited-design logic. It charges the final image and shapes Maren's stance (calm, inevitable), reaching the 8.0 threshold.</comment>
