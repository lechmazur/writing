<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's internal contradiction—belief that carrying shadows is courage versus emerging recognition it's "something closer to greed"—acts in scene and drives the closure choice. The decision to release Darvo's shadow is motivated by the mirror's revelation and costs her the "precise fury" she thought was wisdom. Embodied emotion is strong: "shadows pulsed faintly," "weighted breath before reply." Minor slip: the shift from hoarding to releasing could have been tested more concretely in a prior beat to deepen the cost at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The inferred lens is Causal-Hybrid: Maren's use of the crystal fragment reveals how others perceive her, which motivates the release of the oldest shadow—a decision that forecloses her former method and opens a new stance ("ask rather than absorb"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise verging on Decisive Change): she releases one shadow on-page, altering her approach with visible cost (loss of Darvo's memory). The cost is legible in "she could no longer recall the precise fury" and the replacement is uncertain, meeting the felt-cost test. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard and lighthouse are vivid and voice-filtered: "roots threaded through frozen basalt," "apples hung like small red lanterns." The cellar's mirrors and the ice below supply recurring spatial anchors. The setting constrains choice moderately—the mirrors enable the revelation, and the final walk toward the ice grounds the closure image—but does not tighten a middle beat as forcefully as the highest band requires. Sensory detail is selective and supports atmosphere without catalog listing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Maren's method and its cost to those she serves) is signaled early and deepens when the mirrors show fear in others' faces. The tightening—seeing herself as frightening—narrows options and forces the release choice. Agency is decision with visible cost: releasing Darvo's shadow forecloses her former certainty. One meaningful pressure point suffices for this length. The price (loss of memory, gain of uncertainty) is legible on the page and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (the balance between absorbing others' pain and allowing them autonomy) emerges through the mirrors' revelation, the shadows as physical record, and the closure choice. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: releasing the shadow and choosing "to ask rather than absorb" reweights prior material (her belief that "to forget a conflict was to misunderstand the next one") without stating a moral. The apples as "small red lanterns" in the final image quietly recur, charging the transition from enclosure to openness. No thematic echo or didactic statement mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "the shadows she carried were not metaphorical," "weighted breath before reply," "salt and cold iron." Psychic distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear—Maren notices suffering and tactics, filtered through her peacekeeper lens. Diction ("reconstitute," "filaments," "architecture of a dispute") suits her careful, analytical mind. Minor slip: "courageous anomaly" in the narrator's voice edges toward tell rather than letting her choices demonstrate it, though it does not flatten the ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: "souvenirs of every conflict she had absorbed," "the fragment showed nothing on its own, only a milky opacity that warmed when held." No loops or scaffold in closure beats. Minor deduction: the phrase "calmly intuitive about their worth" in the second paragraph is slightly elevated/abstract for peak interiority, and "emotional architecture of a dispute" borders on therapeutic register, though both remain legible and voice-motivated. The final image propels cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of physical shadows as记录 of absorbed conflict, vintage mirrors as diagnostic tool, and the orchard-lighthouse setting is specific and non-obvious. The "vintage store" frame and seer's fragment add texture. The turn—Maren seeing herself as others do—feels earned in hindsight. Minor limitation: the peacekeeper-with-shadow-burden premise echoes familiar emotional-cost tropes; transformation comes through the mirror twist and the choice to release rather than hoard, which lifts it into the solid range without full breakthrough originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening; Maren's choice to release the oldest shadow is the story's pivot. She appears in at least three functional beats: morning walk, cellar mirror-work, release decision. The peacekeeper role constrains her method (absorb conflict) and the shadow-laced attribute pressures the choice at closure. Her decision alters tactics ("ask rather than absorb") with cost (loss of Darvo's memory). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced in the fourth paragraph (cellar scene). Used in two beats: positioned between mirrors to reveal glimpses, then glowing on the shelf as Maren makes her choice. The fragment enables the key revelation (others' fear) and is present at closure, but its specific properties (warmth, milky opacity) do not constrain the release choice itself—the mirrors do the heavy lifting. It seeds the revelation but is not causally indispensable to the final act. Mid-range: functional across two beats with closure presence, but swappable mechanics lower irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is named on-page ("This made her a courageous anomaly among peacekeepers") and her absorption method contrasts with peers' purges. The concept shapes her stake (absorb vs. detach) and the closure realization ("she wondered if it was something closer to greed"). However, the phrase is told rather than dramatized in the peak choice, and the text could convey her outlier status through action alone. One key turn (mirror revelation) ties to the concept; closure linkage is oblique. Mid-band for stake-shaping but limited on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" appears as a label in the second paragraph but does not visibly constrain or enable choices with cost. Maren's intuition about the mirrors' use is backstory; the closure choice (release the shadow) stems from the mirror revelation, not from calm intuition enabling a specific tactic. Present but ornamental; no demonstrable on-page tradeoff. Introduced early but not developed beyond the label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The act of reconstituting the seer's vision via mirrors and fragment is introduced in the fourth paragraph, used in the middle beat (seeing herself as others do), and directly shapes the closure choice. Maren's method depends on this action; the revelation it provides ("fear in the faces") motivates the release. Removing "reconstitute" would break the mechanics of her insight. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability. Setup is delayed slightly (after ~25% of text) but functional across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mirrors introduced in third paragraph; fragment-and-mirror method detailed in fourth. The method is used in two beats: to show conflicts in the settlements, then to reveal Maren's own image as others see her. This second glimpse drives the closure choice. Mechanics matter: the "correct angle" is specified and the fragment's warmth is noted. The method shapes the key turn and is present at closure ("mirrors waited"). Essential to the revelation but slightly less so to the release act itself. Strong integration across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orchard and lighthouse anchor the opening and closing images; the cellar houses the mirrors; the ice below provides recurring auditory pressure ("deep percussive groaning"). The orchard frames the walk toward the ice at closure, reweighting "small red lanterns" as a transition image. However, the setting does not constrain middle choices—the mirror revelation happens in any enclosed space. Early signal, closure participation, and atmospheric pressure are present; causal constraint on tactics is limited. Solid two-gate integration with lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Weighted breath before reply" is named explicitly and frames the closure beat: "She stood in the weighted breath before reply, that stretched silence between question and answer where the real decision lives." The timeframe tightens the decision, compressing it into the pause before she acts. It appears early (as concept in her peacekeeper philosophy) and charges the final choice. Causal pressure and closure linkage are exceptional; the exact phrasing is indispensable to the story's rhythm and stakes. High irreplaceability and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren's goal ("to map empathy onto action") is carved into the lighthouse door frame and demonstrated through her absorption method. The motivation is dramatized in her choice to release the shadow and shift to "ask rather than absorb." Friction between the want (to protect) and cost (others' fear) drives the closure. The principle is tested in two beats: the mirror revelation and the release. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the desire shapes the final action with visible cost (loss of certainty).</comment>
