<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's preemptive nostalgia is embodied through concrete acts—listening, measuring, writing—but her interior life remains slightly abstract. The "mourning the listening even as she listened" pattern is vivid, yet the final conjecture feels more like intellectual exercise than a choice with visible personal cost. Emotion is present but not sufficiently contradictory or pressured to elevate the score.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through monuments, forecourt whispers, and the final conjecture, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Maren continues archiving despite uncertainty, and "for now that was enough" crystallizes her stance with felt cost. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (archivist, observatory, above fog). The tightening is subtle but legible: shorter shadows signal a shift, the hymn confirms it, and the final act of writing reweights her solitary work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory, monuments, and crystal forecourt are vivid and purposeful. The rain-triggered whispers ground a key beat, and the stormlight brackets the action. Spatial choreography is clean (platform, ring, forecourt, desk). The crystal forecourt constrains her method (she must wait for rain) and charges the middle beat, lifting the score toward the 9+ gate, though the final image does not lean on setting as heavily.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving collective memory and making sense of it before the fog swallows everything. The shortening shadows introduce a tightening, and Maren's conjecture is an act of agency—yet it reads more as intellectual synthesis than a forced trade-off. The piece lacks a visible price paid; she writes "until the stormlight dimmed," but no live option is foreclosed. Pressure is coherent but gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: adaptation versus preservation, the cost of being the last witness. The conjecture that the people below are "sculpting a new identity from experience" reweights the earlier grief and hymn without stating a moral. The preemptive nostalgia thread charges the final image ("mourning was not the same as surrender"), and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether her work matters.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and controlled: "the ghost-shapes of words," "the deepening hush," "summer quills." Psychic distance is stable (close third). The perceptual signature (measuring shadows, hearing hymns in crystal) is character-specific. One minor slip: "emotional residue of ten thousand people" drifts slightly toward expository summary, but the voice recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with strong rhythm variation. A few phrases ("the deepening hush," "the ghost-shapes of words") approach stock lyricism, and "solid fog" is repeated without reweighting. Line "She was preemptively nostalgic for this, too, for the act of listening, for the forecourt's rain-born murmuring, for the solitude..." stacks prepositional phrases in a way that slows momentum slightly. No scaffold loops or major artifacts, but figurative density in several beats nudges the score down from 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The summer-quill archivist above solidified fog is a fresh synthesis, and the method (shadow measurement to infer collective memory shifts) is non-obvious. The "preemptively nostalgic" frame and the conjecture about adaptation-as-identity add specificity. The piece commits fully to its premise. Risk-taking is present (lyric accumulation, quiet closure), though the emotional contours (solitary scholar, uncertain purpose) are familiar within speculative literary fiction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren appears in setup, measures shadows (middle), and writes the conjecture (end). Her decision to "conjecture" rather than merely transcribe is a choice, but it does not narrow live options with visible cost—she was always going to write. Two-of-three gates met; causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt appears in setup (described) and is used in a key middle beat (Maren kneels, listens, hears grief/laughter/hymn). It does not return in the final image except as ambient whisper. Two gates; the middle beat is vivid and functional, but the ending does not reweight it. Specificity is high (rain-triggered, translates vibrations), lifting the score within the 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Collective memory is the frame (setup via Archive), shapes her method (middle: listening for emotional currents), and is the subject of her final conjecture (the people below are "sculpting a new identity"). Three gates met. It does not constrain a live choice on the page—Maren observes and infers rather than choosing between competing actions tied to the concept. Causal pressure is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Preemptively nostalgic" is named in the opening line, recurs in the listening beat ("She mourned the listening even as she listened"), and implicitly informs the final stance ("mourning was not the same as surrender"). Setup and payoff present; middle development is thematic rather than choice-constraining. The trait is label-heavy and does not visibly alter a tactical decision with cost, capping the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Conjecture is named early (method, setup), enacted in the middle (she hypothesizes from shadows and hymn), and forms the final action (she writes the conjecture "until the stormlight dimmed"). Three gates. It drives the ending beat and distinguishes this session from prior transcription work, but the conjecture itself does not foreclose a path or face resistance—Maren was always going to write. Causal role is solid; cost connection is weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Examining shadow lengths is described in setup, enacted in the opening scene (she records "shorter than they should have been"), and serves as evidence for the conjecture (payoff). Two-of-three gates clearly met (setup and a middle observation that feeds the ending conjecture). The method does not constrain her later choices—she measures, records, then moves to the next task. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory (stormlit, above clouds) anchors the entire piece (setup), supplies the monuments and forecourt (middle resources), and brackets the ending ("observatory faded to amber"). Three gates. It pressures her isolation and provides the tools (monuments, crystal). The "above the permanent cloud deck" detail underscores her separation from the people below, charging the thematic stakes. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe (after fog becomes solid) is established in setup ("fog…solidified into something between glass and stone"), informs the middle stakes (people "sealed beneath a sky they could no longer see"), and shapes the final conjecture (they are forgetting the sky existed). Three gates. The timeframe is backdrop rather than live clock; it does not tighten decisions within the scene. Integration is thematic and atmospheric, not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation to "sculpt identity from experience" is articulated in the conjecture beat and frames the ending reflection. It is Maren's hypothesis about the people below, not her own stated desire—she infers it rather than enacting it. Setup is indirect (her role as memory-keeper implies care about identity), payoff is clear (the conjecture), but middle development as a live want driving her choices is absent. Lyric reprise logic applies; score within the 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone (deepening hush) is named in setup ("the silence had acquired a different quality, a deepening hush"), recurs in the final line ("set the quill down in the deepening hush"), and modulates through the piece (quiet → grief/laughter → amber dimming). Three gates. The tone charges the final image and reflects pressure (the world "holding its breath before a confession"). Coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
