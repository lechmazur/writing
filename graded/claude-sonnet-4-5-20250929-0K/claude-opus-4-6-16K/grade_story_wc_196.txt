<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior is concrete and character-specific—reading dust as language, understanding institutional abandonment through sediment patterns. The motivation to archive unwitnessed kindness is embodied in her handling of the button and anchored in her own foster-system history. The final choice to create a companion archive feels earned by the button discovery and forecloses a path of passive cataloging with visible cost (expanding her work beyond the grant mandate). Minor: the "broken-hearted archivist" label in the opening leans slightly abstract, but later particulars (emancipation, no photographs, no safety net) ground it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands clearly: Maren's decision to create a companion archive is a Decisive Change that reconfigures her project and forecloses passive compliance with the grant. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—dust patterns teach the method, the button discovery deepens the stake, and the final image (opening the next folder) reweights her entire cataloging mission with undeniable purpose. Orientation is prompt (archivist, basement, Hardin County courthouse, digitization project by paragraph two). One meaningful tightening: finding her own file shifts from abstract mission to personal reckoning to expanded purpose. Cost is legible: she commits to work the county didn't hire her for.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The file room is anchored early (basement, 1987, dust patterns) and constrains choice: thick dust signals neglect, finger-grooves show hesitation, and the E drawer's placement makes the discovery concrete. The button itself functions as micro-setting—its cold-then-warm tactility and broken clasp charge the closure decision. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: fluorescent light, humidity-pressed pages, cathedral-thick dust. The spatial choreography (sorting table, drawer, scanner) tracks cleanly and the basement's institutional neglect mirrors systemic failure, supporting theme without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to find proof that someone tried in these children's lives, sharpened when Maren finds her own file. The button discovery is a meaningful tightening—it transforms her abstract mission into a concrete method (the companion archive) and narrows options by committing her to work beyond the grant. Agency is clear: Maren's decision to log the button differently and begin a new record forecloses passive digitization. The price is visible: expanding her mandate without institutional support. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient and the escalation reads as density increase that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: dust as language, the button as seed, unwitnessed kindnesses buried in bureaucratic language. The companion archive answers the central question (can care be salvaged from institutional record?) through concrete action rather than statement. The final image—"other seeds waited"—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the unsigned note, the broken clasp, and the thirty-five-year wait. "Tactfully hopeful in its purpose" risks abstract phrasing but is anchored by Maren's belief in "very little tenderness" and her choice to magnify rather than merely document. No thematic echo at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren reads dust like snow, understands sediment as language, and notices what caseworkers miss. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close for the button discovery, slightly wider for the final resolve). Diction stays controlled—"cathedral-thick," "tracker reads snow," "seed pressed into dry soil"—specific to her archival expertise without registry drift. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue present. The narrator's certainty matches what Maren can plausibly infer (she guesses Civil War era, cannot verify Diane). Rhythm tightens appropriately under emotional pressure (short clauses when she opens her file).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., dust patterns teach method and reveal institutional neglect). Sentence variety supports rhythm—long contemplative structures in reflection, shorter beats at the button discovery. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent: dust as language, seed as metaphor, files as dry soil. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line charges prior motifs (seeds, folders, dust). Minor: "cold legal word" and "broken-hearted" in the opening slightly tell where showing would suffice, but do not recur or touch closure. Propulsion is consistent; no momentum drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—archivist finds her own file and decides to catalog hidden kindnesses—offers a fresh angle on foster-system narratives by centering bureaucratic artifacts and unwitnessed care rather than trauma alone. Dust-as-language and the button discovery feel specific and grounded. The transformation test: swapping names and places would lose the particularity (Hardin County, 54th Ohio Infantry, emancipation). Risk is present in the quiet, reflective mode and the choice to end on intention rather than dramatic confrontation. Proximity check passes; no close echoes detected. The companion archive as response feels earned and non-obvious, though the foster-care-worker-magnifying-kindness frame is not wholly unfamiliar.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren drives key turns: she chooses to find her own file (inciting beat), interprets the button (middle deepening), and decides to create the companion archive (closure). Her choices alter tactics from passive digitization to active curation. Early signal (paragraph one), two distinct beats (finding file, opening next folder), causal pressure (her conviction shapes the new project), and closure linkage (final decision) are all present. Cost is visible: she commits to unsanctioned work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The button is handled in multiple beats: discovered wrapped in notebook paper, examined for maker's mark and broken clasp, set beside the scanner, and its meaning extended to "other seeds." It shifts from personal relic to conceptual seed that justifies the companion archive. Early signal (midpoint), causal pressure (enables the new project), closure linkage (primes "other seeds"), and specificity (brass, eagle, 54th Ohio, broken clasp) all present. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Unknown histories shape the stakes (hundreds of children whose care was unwitnessed) and constrain tactics (Maren must search between official pages). The concept is present from the opening (dust patterns, untouched files) and reweighted at closure (other seeds waiting). It changes options: instead of digitizing what's documented, she will catalog what's hidden. Causal pressure and closure linkage present; cost is implicit in the expanded mandate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" appears as a descriptor of the companion archive's purpose and is embodied in Maren's choice to magnify kindnesses without sentimentality. It constrains the method (she will not editorialize or moralize) and charges the final tone. Present in two beats (companion archive decision, final resolve), but the trait is more inferred from action than tested under pressure. Cost is oblique. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Unfurling the pages is the hinge action: it reveals the button and note, which drive the closure decision. The action is signaled early (humidity-pressed sheets), dramatized on-page (separating like leaves), and its result (the button) redefines Maren's mission. Swapping it for "opened" or "read" would lose the tactile care and archival specificity. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dust patterns as method are signaled immediately (paragraph one: "dust was its own language") and shape two beats: identifying which files were almost wanted (opening) and reading her own file's cathedral-thick layer (midpoint). The method matters—it teaches her how to find unwitnessed care—and is extended conceptually at closure (other seeds in dust). Causal pressure and closure linkage present, though the method itself does not constrain a difficult choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The file room pressures choices: its 1987 disorganization enables Maren's discovery, the E drawer's placement makes the find concrete, the sorting table and scanner anchor the decision to log the button differently. The basement's institutional neglect mirrors systemic failure and the confined space intensifies the solitary reckoning. Early signal, two beats (finding file, deciding on new archive), causal pressure (environment supplies the materials), and closure linkage (next folder) all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the emancipation" (thirty-five years post-aging-out) is signaled early and shapes Maren's authority and detachment: she has survived long enough to return with professional skill. It tightens the decision by making the wait legible (the button sat thirty-five years) and charges the closure with the weight of deferred connection. Two beats (her own emancipation context, the button's wait), causal pressure (time gap makes the discovery poignant), but the clock does not alter immediate tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to magnify small kindnesses is dramatized through her dust-reading, the button discovery, and the companion archive decision. It is conflicted: she has no proof anyone cared for her until she finds the note, yet she believes others deserve that proof. The motivation drives the closure (she commits to cataloging unwitnessed care) and forecloses passive compliance. Early signal, causal pressure, cost (expanded work), and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tone is reflective, forensic, and quietly elegiac—examining unknown histories through sediment and bureaucratic language. It modulates with pressure: measured and analytical in the opening, more intimate at the button discovery, resolute at closure. The tone charges the final image ("Maren picked up the next folder, read the dust, and opened it") by sustaining quiet conviction without sentimentality. Coherent across turns and purposeful in supporting the accumulative design.</comment>
