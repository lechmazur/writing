<question>1</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sable's interior life is specific and consistent—"tranquilly perceptive in a way that unsettled colleagues" materializes through her indexer's discipline and her choice to apply "the alternative hypothesis" at the moment of discovery. The decision to write the entry knowing "the consortium would not welcome her findings" is earned by her methodological rigor and her recognition that "the library had waited six centuries...for someone to read it honestly." Minor: the reflection on what the consortium wants ("Prove dependency, they said") is efficient but leans toward summary; embodiment of her perceptive silence could be sharpened in one more micro-choice earlier. The final act—beginning the entry—forecloses the path of compliance with visible professional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Sable Voss, logical page indexer), where (Merenthi Library, submerged), and when (during the blackout) within the opening lines. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the blackout restores stillness, the cabinet unseals, the ledger and stamp reweight the dependency theory through layered evidence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Sable writes the entry with "resigned grace," knowing the cost ("Her contract would likely end"), and the final image—"It was indexed"—reconfigures the premise (hidden origin now legible) with conceptual and professional cost undeniable on the page. One meaningful deepening (from testing the hypothesis to committing the entry) tightens options under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The submerged library is vivid and purposeful: bioluminescent kelp, barnacled halls, oilskin seals, mineral deposits on artifacts. The blackout strips mechanical hum and restores "the faint percussion of deep currents," anchoring the "reclaimed stillness" that charges the ending. The stamp and ledger constrain Sable's hypothesis through physical evidence (wear pattern, ink composition, bone origin). Spatial choreography is clean (cabinet, reading rail, notebook). The setting charges the final image: Sable's indexing "the way the city had once settled into the sea." One minor note: the "archaeological team" and "diving station" are mentioned but not used; tighter focus on the immediate space would lift density slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to trace honest origins"—is signaled early and tested through Sable's discovery and methodology. Pressure tightens when the stamp and ledger predate Alendic texts by eighty years, forcing Sable to test alternative hypotheses ("What if the stamp was a forgery..."). The reversal occurs when "each alternative collapsed under scrutiny," narrowing her choice to either suppress or index the truth. The decision to write the entry forecloses compliance with visible professional cost ("Her contract would likely end"). Agency is decision under the accumulative lens; the cost is legible in "dappled resolve" and the recognition that "other indexers...would be brought in."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the blackout as "reclaimed stillness," the stamp's closed eye above an open hand, and Sable's methodological discipline. The final image—"not with violence, but with the resigned grace of something returning to where it belonged"—reweights the premise (suppressed origin) without moralizing. The piece resists easy binaries: Sable's resolve is "dappled," not blazing, and the library's patience is "not absence, but restoration." Subtext operates in silence, the library "remembering its original silence," and in Sable's recognition that truth will cost something. The indexer's method (test the alternative hypothesis) integrates with theme (honest origins). One line—"The honest origin...was no longer lost. It was indexed."—risks mild assertion but is anchored by the prior scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Sable notices "the tick of settling sediment," applies "the discipline she trusted most," and writes "slowly, letting each word settle into the silence." Diction is specific and voice-consistent: "tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve," "the resigned grace of something returning." Interiority is concrete ("She forced herself to readjust") and avoids therapy-speak. Free indirect style is clean. One brief moment—"This was the moment where enthusiasm could corrupt methodology"—leans slightly toward explanatory commentary but remains within the indexer's professional idiom. No head-hopping; rhythm modulates with pressure (short declaratives at the decision beat, longer cadences in reflection).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening establishes texture ("the barnacled halls," "bioluminescent kelp"), and the closure slows to match Sable's deliberate action. Information density is high: most lines advance knowledge or stakes. Minor scaffold: "She paused and forced herself to readjust" followed by "This was the moment where enthusiasm could corrupt methodology" leans toward paraphrase; the second sentence could be cut or integrated. The phrase "the resigned grace of something returning to where it belonged" is lyric and apt but edges toward elevated register in a moment otherwise grounded in indexer's precision. No loops or template cadence; propulsion is steady. One filter-verb stack in the testing paragraph ("could corrupt," "could commit") is acceptable within the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sunken-library premise is familiar, but the indexer POV and the methodological testing (alternative hypothesis applied to historical evidence) offer a fresh angle. The blackout as restoring rather than removing silence is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The stamp's sigil and the ledger's concept-based cataloging are particular to this world. The piece avoids stock metaphors and commits fully to its premise. Risk: the professional/academic conflict over historical provenance is well-worn territory; the transformation comes through Sable's perceptive silence and disciplined resolve rather than external action, which feels earned but does not radically subvert expectations. The ending's quiet inevitability is strong but not startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's role as "logical page indexer" drives the key turn: her ability to "reconstruct a catalog system from waterlogged fragments" enables the discovery, and her indexer's discipline to "apply the alternative hypothesis" tests the evidence. The decision to write the entry—"Item 1, Cabinet 9...Origin: local. Provenance: confirmed."—is the closure action. The trait is signaled early, active in the testing beat, and shapes the ending. The occupation is not ornamental; removing it would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The antique ink stamp appears when the cabinet unseals, is examined for physical evidence ("the wear pattern on the stamp's face," "The bone was local"), and sits on the reading rail during Sable's decision ("the stamp sat on the rail, real and heavy, its closed eye patient"). It returns in the final beats, charging the closure image. The sigil (closed eye above open hand) and the handle's etched date predate Alendic texts, making it irreplaceable evidence. The stamp is handled across three beats and its specific properties drive the reversal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is introduced when "the blackout stripped away the hum of generators" and "What replaced it was older." Sable "recognized this as reclaimed stillness—not absence, but restoration." The concept shapes stakes (the library "remembering its original silence") and charges the final image: Sable writes "slowly, letting each word settle into the silence the way the city had once settled into the sea." It modulates tone and pressure but does not directly constrain a tactical choice; its work is atmospheric and thematic, lifting it to mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is named early ("She was tranquilly perceptive in a way that unsettled colleagues") and materializes in Sable's indexer's eye parsing the ledger and her disciplined testing. The trait enables the discovery but does not create a visible tradeoff or constrain an on-page action with cost. It colors her voice and supports her methodology, but the cost at closure (writing the entry) is tied to her commitment to honesty, not directly to this attribute. Functional but not indispensable; a near-synonym ("methodical observer") could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Readjust" is the pivot: "She paused and forced herself to readjust. This was the moment where enthusiasm could corrupt methodology." The action introduces the alternative-hypothesis testing that validates the stamp and ledger, driving the reversal. The closure—writing the entry—traces back to this readjustment. Removing it would collapse the causal chain; the discovery would feel unearned. The action is signaled, executed, and paid off at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" is signaled ("the discipline she trusted most: the alternative hypothesis") and its mechanics are dramatized on the page: "What if the stamp was a forgery...What if the ledger's dates used a different calendar?" Each test is applied to physical evidence, and "each alternative collapsed under scrutiny." The method shapes the middle beat and validates the closure decision. It is procedural and specific, not swappable. The method is the means by which the honest origin is confirmed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "forgotten library inside a sunken city" frames the entire piece: the barnacled halls, oilskin seals resisting seawater, bioluminescent kelp lighting the work. The blackout removes power, isolating Sable and restoring the library's original silence. The cabinet she pries open contains the evidence. The setting supplies resources (the preserved ledger and stamp) and pressures choices (isolation, no radio contact). The library's six-hundred-year patience charges the ending. It is essential across beats and integral to the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"During the blackout" is signaled in the opening paragraph and frames the entire action: the power failure isolates Sable, strips mechanical noise, and restores the library's stillness. The blackout does not impose a ticking clock or tighten tactics beat-by-beat, but it creates the conditions for the discovery (most of the team ascended; Sable stayed) and the atmosphere of "reclaimed stillness." It shapes the dominant pressure and charges the tone. It is present across the story but does not alter moves within the scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To trace honest origins" is established early ("Sable had come to Merenthi to trace honest origins") and tested against the consortium's demand to "Prove dependency." The discovery of the stamp and ledger dramatizes the conflict: the evidence contradicts the funded theory. Sable's choice to write the entry—knowing "Her contract would likely end"—forecloses compliance and dramatizes the cost. The motivation drives the plot, generates the conflict, and shapes the closure. Friction between institutional pressure and methodological honesty is legible throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" is named near the end ("She felt dappled resolve—not the blazing certainty...but the quieter, shadowed kind") and modulates the tone throughout: Sable's tranquil perception, her disciplined testing, and the final image of writing "slowly, letting each word settle into the silence." The tone is coherent through turns and charges the closure ("the resigned grace of something returning"). It is not static; the blackout's restoration of stillness prepares for the dappled quality of the ending. The tone is integral to the final image's resonance.</comment>
