<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's trajectory from impermanent rebellion to acceptance of impermanence is cleanly motivated and embodied through her drawing impulse. Her social perceptiveness is demonstrated on the page ("could walk into a room and feel the architecture of resentment") and guides her final action. The chalk-drawing gesture at the end earns the shift from "insist on presence" to releasing the need for permanence. Interior voice remains consistent, though the emotional arc could show more internal contradiction—her epiphany arrives smoothly without visible struggle in the final beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren's memories soften, she accepts impermanence, and her drawing becomes an act of moving through damage rather than restoring it. Orientation is established early (grotto, mist, unlearning context by ~100 words). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the mandala discovery deepens the dominant stake (discover meaning in the mess), the tile flake intensifies it, and the drawing act reweights the premise with visible cost (her own memories loosening). The voice-echo "I'm here" returns as a question, micro-turning the premise. One meaningful deepening is achieved; cost is legible in "loosening their grip."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto setting constrains and charges throughout: acoustics guide color placement in the mandala, the tile flake whispers when held to the ear, and the curved walls multiply Maren's voice back to her altered. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("lilac unease that settled on the tongue," "mist curled like slow-dying breath"). Spatial choreography remains clear (center mandala, floor, curved walls). The whispering gallery tile flake functions as micro-setting object, actively shaping her final choice to extend the patterns. The setting charges the final image ("the grotto would continue whispering").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("discover meaning in the mess") is signaled early and tightens through the mandala discovery, tile flake handling, and final drawing choice. One meaningful deepening occurs when she picks up the tile flake and hears the emergent hush, narrowing her impulse from marking/announcing to moving through damage. Her agency is visible in the drawing act, which forecloses the old rebellion path. Cost is felt: her memories soften, the need for permanence releases. The escalation is Accumulative—density increases through layered sensory pressure and the hush deepens—but no second reversal or competing option tests her commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (impermanence, the value of transient meaning) emerges organically from the chalk artist's backstory, the unlearning premise, the smeared mandala, and the final drawing-through-damage. The ending offers a non-literal answer: impermanence itself can mean something even as it dissolves. No overt thesis statement; the final image ("the mess, for one suspended moment, meant something she could almost name") resists tidy resolution. The tile flake and mandala motifs recur with reweighted meaning. Minor slip: "releasing the desperate need to be permanent" edges toward abstract summary rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable, focalized through Maren with a lyric, textured register that fits an artist's perception. Perceptual signature is distinct: "architecture of resentment," "laughter was load-bearing," "emergent hush that built from silence the way a wave builds." The single line of dialogue ("I'm here") is voice-driven and advances the beat by triggering the grotto's echo-return as a question. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer at the tile flake, pulling back for the mist-thickening final paragraph). Elision is minimal and purposeful. Diction remains within an educated, reflective artist's lexicon without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sensory texture is dense and specific ("lilac unease," "slow-dying breath"). Information density is high across most beats. Minor loop detected: "the mess was all that remained" and "meaning in the mess" recur without functional gain, though they serve thematic echo. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively. A few metaphors near the edge of over-density in the opening ("mist curled like slow-dying breath," "paper itself had decided to reject meaning," "memories loosening, names slipping") but they remain legible and don't obscure causality. No scaffold or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of chalk artist + unlearning city + sand mandala + whispering grotto offers a fresh frame; the combination reads purposeful rather than assembled. The emergent-hush concept is original and the emotional arc (accepting impermanence as an artist who marks surfaces) avoids template resolution. Transformation test passes: swapping names/places would lose the whispering-gallery acoustics and chalk's specific impermanence. Minor proximity note: "meanings dissolving, memories loosening" echoes broad speculative-fiction tropes without deepening the city's mechanics, though the personal mandala turn individualizes the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The whimsical chalk artist trait is seeded early (chalk rebellion, sidewalks, coffins), shapes her decision to draw around the mandala in the middle, and drives the closure action (extending patterns with violet chalk). Present in all three gates: setup (paragraph one), development (pocket chalk mentioned, then used), payoff (final drawing act). The choice to draw new lines "through the smeared places" rather than restore is character-specific and causal. Cost: accepting impermanence. Beats: backstory mention, pocket reference, final drawing spans two beats functionally. Swappability: a different artist type (e.g., sculptor) would require different mechanics. Strong integration, but the trait operates more as enabling flavor than hard constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The whispering gallery tile flake appears mid-scene (center of mandala, ~40% mark), is picked up and held to the ear (one beat), then set back into the mandala's center (second beat). Setup present by midpoint; development (hearing the emergent hush) changes her intent; payoff indirect (she replaces it, and the hush deepens). Two distinct touches. Specificity: "curved and iridescent," "from the grotto's original dome," carries the emergent-hush concept sonically. Late first appearance (−0.3) and closure participation is thin (she sets it down before drawing, so it primes but doesn't directly charge the final image; −0.4). Causal pressure is moderate: it shifts her from wanting to interject to accepting the hush.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Emergent hush is present by ~50% ("hush that seemed to grow, an emergent hush that built from silence"), shapes her reaction (she tries to interject, then yields), and returns amplified at closure ("emergent hush deepened"). Setup borderline late (−0.2), but the concept is named and experienced. Development: changes her tactic from marking/announcing to drawing through damage. Payoff: "the quiet that grew louder than forgetting" reweights the premise. Specificity high: "not the absence of noise but the active arrival of quiet" is vivid and irreplaceable. Cost connection: her memories soften in response. Two beats (tile flake moment, final paragraph). Strong thematic charge, moderate causal pressure since the hush operates more as atmosphere than hard constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Socially perceptive is introduced early ("could walk into a room and feel the architecture of resentment"), applied to the city's collective grief ("felt the collective grief humming in the grotto walls like tinnitus"), and guides her mandala reading ("emotional logic" through color and acoustics). Setup strong, development moderate (enables her to interpret the mandala's disrupted center), payoff indirect (her drawing choice reflects that sensitivity). One clear on-page action: tracing the spiral and finding the tile flake via perceptual skill. Cost is implied (sensitivity "sharpened into something close to pain") but not tested. The trait feels enabling rather than constraining; swappable with "intuitive" or "empathic" without major edits (−0.5). Label-only in places ("that sensitivity had sharpened").</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Interject appears explicitly mid-scene: "She wanted to interject, to say something that would break the spell—her old instinct… So she did. 'I'm here.'" Setup (backstory of marking surfaces as rebellion), development (the spoken line triggers the grotto's echo-return as a question, shifting her intent), payoff (she then draws instead of speaking, moving through damage rather than announcing). The action is causally central to the turn from rebellion-by-marking to acceptance-by-drawing. Three beats: impulse, execution, consequence. Specificity: the grotto's acoustic response is unique to this action. Cost: her voice returns "almost unrecognizable," signaling loss of control. Strong integration, though the final drawing could be seen as still an interjection (−0.3 for partial swappability).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sand mandala is discovered at ~30% ("someone had constructed a sand mandala"), its patterns are read ("emotional logic… translating whispers into geometry") to find the tile flake (development beat), and Maren extends its patterns with chalk at closure. Setup clear, development central (the mandala's disrupted center holds the tile flake and guides her perception), payoff strong (she draws new spirals "through the smeared places," completing the mandala's logic). The method shapes her final choice: she does not restore but "acknowledged the damage and moved through it." Three beats, high specificity (concentric rings, geometric petals, blue sand, color clustering where acoustics are strongest). Irreplaceable: removing the mandala would break the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The whispering grotto in mist is established in the opening sentence, supplies the acoustics that guide the mandala's color placement, multiplies Maren's voice back to her as a question (turning point), and frames the closure image ("the grotto would continue whispering to no one and everyone"). Setup immediate, development (acoustics and mist constrain and enable her drawing choice), payoff (setting charges the final line). Sensory specificity high: "mist curled like slow-dying breath," "lilac unease," curved walls, collapsed dome. The grotto's whispering mechanics are irreplaceable—swapping for a silent cave would break causality (tile flake, voice echo, acoustic mandala logic). Cost connection: the mist thickens as her memories soften. Three or more beats across the piece.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The unlearning is contextualized early ("past eleven months, the city's records had begun dissolving… memories loosening"), supplies the dominant stake (discover meaning amid forgetting), and recurs at closure ("in the dissolving city… louder than forgetting"). Setup strong, development moderate (the unlearning creates the collective grief Maren feels and motivates her grotto visit), payoff (her own memories soften, enacting the unlearning on the page). Two beats. The timeframe does not impose a live clock or tighten tactics beat-to-beat; it operates as premise and thematic frame rather than constraint (−0.6). Specificity: "databases corrupted, archives rotting, names slipping from faces" is vivid. Cost visible: her memories loosen. The unlearning enables rather than pressures the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>To discover meaning in the mess is stated explicitly early ("she had come here to discover meaning in the mess"), tested in the mandala-reading beat ("The meaning within the mess"), and answered at closure ("the mess, for one suspended moment, meant something she could almost name"). Setup clear, development (her reading of the disrupted mandala and hearing the tile flake are both attempts to extract meaning), payoff (her drawing choice enacts the discovery). Three beats. Friction: she wants permanence but the world (and the hush) demand she release it; visible in "releasing the desperate need to be permanent." Cost: the meaning remains provisional ("almost name," "one suspended moment"). High causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor label reliance ("to discover meaning") slightly lowers embodiment (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lilac unease is introduced early ("something sweeter, almost floral—a lilac unease that settled on the tongue"), modulates as the hush deepens ("The mist thickened. The emergent hush deepened"), and charges the final image through its persistent atmospheric presence. Setup immediate, development (the uneasy sweetness contrasts the stone and grief, shaping mood), payoff (tone modulates from uneasy to almost serene as Maren yields). Coherent through turns: the tone shifts from active unease to passive acceptance without breaking continuity. Specificity: "lilac" as a color-scent hybrid is original and the "settled on the tongue" anchors it sensorially. The tone does not constrain a choice (−0.4) but supports the emotional arc. Two functional beats (opening sensory anchor, thickening mist at closure).</comment>
