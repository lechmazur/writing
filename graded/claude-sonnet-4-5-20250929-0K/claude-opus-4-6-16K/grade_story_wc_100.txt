<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior is concrete and profession-specific—"she was not an adventurer…an undertaker in a coastal town where the dead outnumbered the living"—and her "inadvertently stubborn" trait drives the inciting choice to investigate. Her final act of placing the lens shards is embodied and motivated by her undertaker's instinct to give rest. The transformation from exhaustion to relief is earned through the story's pressure, though the climactic choice could have shown more visible internal conflict in the moment of assembly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Causal lens inferred and held: package arrival → coordinates → descent → lens restoration → closure of distress signals. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the second paragraph. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (the city exhales, Maren's ache ends) with visible cost—she "revitalized it by letting it die"—and the final image of opaque water makes the foreclosed path legible. One minor gap: the mechanics of how placing the lens "inward" achieves burial rather than broadcasting could be slightly clearer, though the poetic logic holds under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The underwater library is vivid and purposeful: "books had long become something else—pulped into soft coral-like masses" anchors the drowned-but-not-dead premise, and the impossible lighthouse inside the library drives the climactic action. Sensory hierarchy fits Maren's POV (brine smell, wheezing suit, cold hands). The lens housing "waiting" at the top constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent and placement sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ending the distress that has drained Maren for years—is signaled early ("the ache behind her eyes") and tightens when she realizes the city needs burial. The reversal from revitalization-as-rescue to revitalization-as-death is earned and narrows her action to a single choice with clear cost: the coordinates "would lead nowhere now." Agency is decision-driven at closure. No secondary antagonist is required here; the pressure is situational and coherent under the causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the undertaker premise and the paradox articulated on-page: "she revitalized it by letting it die." The lens and coral-books function as non-literal vehicles for memory and unrest, and the final image—opaque ocean, folded oilcloth, ache gone—resonates without stating a moral. "Stillness had finally stopped running" reweights the opening's "silence" and closes the thematic loop with precision. No token philosophizing; the undertaker's skill applied to a city is both particular and universal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "inadvertently stubborn—not in any dramatic way, just in the quiet manner of someone who could not leave a question unanswered" establishes Maren's perceptual signature. Diction remains consistent with her profession and temperament; no register drift. Psychic distance is stable third-limited throughout. One slight slip: "They needed what she gave to others daily" edges toward summary-tell when the surrounding texture is more oblique, but it does not harm momentum and the surrounding beats stay concrete.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings are diverse, and information density is high: "The lighthouse had been sending out pulses of need through the broken lens for decades…Maren had felt them in every grave she'd dug" packs motivation and causality into one move. No loops or scaffold. Minor figurative density in the descent sequence ("cathedral of silence," "thoughts passing through a sleeping mind") stays legible and voice-apt. The phrase "distress signals ceased" is efficient but slightly abrupt for the tonal weight; one more image-beat might have deepened the closure's texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater-library-with-lighthouse premise is fresh and the undertaker-as-protagonist transforms the ghost-city trope through occupational logic. The inward-turning lens and coral-books are specific, non-obvious choices. The paradox of revitalization-as-burial is conceptually sharp. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging. Risk is moderate—vivid imagery and thematic clarity rather than structural experimentation—so it lands in the upper-mid band rather than the exceptional tier.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout, makes the key decision to investigate (inciting), descends (middle), and places the lens (climax). Her weariness and undertaker's instinct drive all three beats and the closure turn. The choice to board the boat and the final assembly both trace to her character. Costs—persistent exhaustion, the journey, the foreclosed coordinates—are visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lens appears in the opening (setup), is carried and examined mid-story (development), and its placement is the climactic action (closure). Each shard's restoration is dramatized with tactile detail ("click she felt more than heard"), and the shift from scattered-outward to focused-inward is causally specific and irreplaceable. Removing the lens collapses the plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Distress signals" frame the inciting package, are explained at the library's center ("pulses of need…reaching anyone sensitive enough"), and their cessation is the closure line. The concept shapes Maren's motivation and the story's central paradox. The signals are not merely thematic but tactical: they have been draining her for years and stopping them is the story's goal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is labeled early and shown when Maren boards the boat despite being "not an adventurer." The trait enables the investigation but does not visibly constrain a later choice or create friction. It's functional and character-specific but not tested under peak pressure; a mid-band score fits the causal but non-conflicted role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Revitalize" is the assigned action and the story's hinge: Maren arrives intending restoration, realizes the city needs death, and the lens placement fulfills both senses—revival through cessation. The paradox is articulated on-page ("she revitalized it by letting it die") and drives the thematic closure. The action is irreplaceable but slightly more implicit than a high-cost dramatic beat; hence upper-7 rather than 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Occupying impossible spaces" describes the lighthouse inside the library ("a tower rising through what should have been floors and ceilings but instead opened into a hollow column"). The impossibility is signaled at discovery and anchors the lens-housing location, enabling the climactic placement. It does not constrain earlier tactics or create friction, so it scores as essential setup and payoff without middle development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underwater city library is introduced early, supplies the lens housing at its center, and its coral-books and architecture embody the memory-and-unrest premise. The setting pressures Maren's realization ("They needed burial") and the final image (opaque water) confirms the setting's transformation. Micro-setting (the wheezing suit, cold water) also constrains her bodily experience. Removal would erase the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Time begins "after the mysterious package arrives" and proceeds linearly through investigation, descent, and lens placement. The frame is clear but does not impose a ticking clock or urgency that alters Maren's tactics. The temporal arc is functional and legible but not pressure-shaping; hence mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To give rest a permanent address" is dramatized when Maren understands "They needed burial. They needed someone to say: you may stop now." The motivation drives the lens placement and the closure image ("the stillness had finally stopped running"). It is specific to her profession, tested on-page, and carries visible cost (the coordinates lead nowhere). The desire is both want and ethical imperative, creating authentic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" coheres across the piece: opening weariness, the ache that "sleep never fully dissolved," the distress signals as restless light, and the closure's "stillness had finally stopped running." Tone modulates from weary resignation to focused action to quiet relief without tonal whiplash. The phrase is slightly abstract but the on-page texture (wheezing suit, silver fish, warm water) grounds it. The final image charges the tone without stating it.</comment>
