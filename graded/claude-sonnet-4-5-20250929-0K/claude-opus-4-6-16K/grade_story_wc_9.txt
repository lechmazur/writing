<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's interior life is richly embodied through concrete action—placing cards, tracing her hand on moss—and her motivation (grief over lost time, the pull to her daughter) drives every choice. The "willingly perplexed" stance is demonstrated through her leaning into confusion rather than stated. Minor slip: the midwife moment and the decision to leave are told in summary rather than dramatized, weakening the inciting cost slightly. The final renunciation (no longer reading others' futures) is earned and forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the glade reading deepens understanding through layered images (moss, saucer, cards, moonlight) that reweight the premise of lost time. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. Closure is Conceptual Repricing: the final insight—"You do not get the time back. You get the glade"—reconfigures the premise with felt cost (years spent, daughter waiting). The cost is legible in the cracked saucer catching moonlight and Sable's descent to her daughter, choosing present over past.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glade's cold moss, silver birch, moonlight columns, and scent of "rain that had never touched soil" create a vivid micro-setting. The cracked saucer—porcelain, faded roses, hairline crack—constrains ritual and charges the final image when it catches moonlight "pointing the way home." Spatial choreography (kneeling, placing cards, tracing hand, descending through clouds) remains clear throughout. The setting directly enables the cartomancy ritual and shapes the final choice to leave.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to find where lost time accumulates, driven by grief over years spent reading others' fortunes. The reading itself is the tightening beat—Sable "leaned into" confusion, and the cards reveal lost time becomes "beauty that chokes you." The cost is visible: she gathers cards, traces her hand (a renunciation of the old pattern), and chooses descent to her daughter, explicitly deciding "she would not spend it reading other people's futures." One meaningful deepening with felt cost, appropriate to length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the cracked saucer, traced hands on birthday tablecloths, onyx-ink cards, the moss glade. "Cloudbound repentance" is named but earned through concrete images—sorrow as altitude, lost time accumulating in cracks and moonlight. The final image (cracked saucer catching moonlight, "pointing the way home") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The insight that wasted time becomes beauty rather than recoverable resource reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and controlled: "a disc of moss and silver birch suspended in the architecture of clouds," "beauty of it was so acute it closed around her throat." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the reading, pulling back for thematic reflection). Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "willingly perplexed" reads slightly over-articulated for peak emotional moments, though it functions as intentional narrator distance. Perceptual signature (cartomancer's way of seeing patterns, layers, cracks) remains stable and distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmic and image-dense: "moonlight fell through breaks in the vapor like columns in a ruined cathedral," "the crack caught the last of the moonlight...a thin, luminous line." Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances atmosphere or stakes. Minor overwriting in the final paragraph: "Below, her daughter was three days old and waiting. The time ahead was not a replacement for the time behind, but it was time, and it was hers" edges toward summary-telling where image alone would suffice. No loops or scaffold; sentence variation supports momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartomancy, traced-hand ritual, cracked heirloom saucer, and altitude-as-grief is specific and non-obvious. "Cloudbound repentance" as a named concept risks prompt echo, but the story earns it through lived detail (the midwife moment, sister holding the infant, moss cold under knees). The transformation of "lost time" from recoverable resource to charged beauty feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric, reflection-heavy design succeeds without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's choices—ascending the mountain, performing the reading, tracing her hand, descending—create all major turns. Present in setup (cartomancer established early), middle (performs reading), and closure (decides not to read others' futures). Two beats of causal pressure (reading reveals lost time's nature, decision to return) and closure linkage (final renunciation). High specificity; the story requires this exact character.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cracked saucer appears in three beats: introduced with its history (mother's, crack from her death year), placed at center of card spread, catches moonlight in final image "pointing the way home." The crack's meaning reweights from wound to guide. Setup, middle ritual use, and closure charge all present. Strong causal role: the crack "was the point," and its luminous line directs her descent. Irreplaceable; no generic object would carry this genealogical and symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Cloudbound repentance" is named by grandmother's term and demonstrated: sorrow over wasted years lifts Sable to the glade where she gains understanding rather than recovery. Setup (grief heavy enough to "weigh upward"), middle (the reading reveals lost time's transformation), closure (she accepts the glade instead of reclaimed time). Shapes stakes and tactics: the concept structures her quest and its resolution. Moderate causal pressure; could be implied without the label, but the label anchors theme effectively.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" appears once explicitly ("left her willingly perplexed") and is dramatized: Sable "did not fight the confusion. She leaned into it the way one leans into fog, trusting that the obscurity itself was the message." This stance enables the reading's success—resisting clarity would abort the insight. Setup and middle use present; closure implication (acceptance over mastery). One beat of causal work with visible tradeoff. Specific and irreplaceable to her cartomancer discipline.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears as the hinge action: "She began to unfasten the leather cord that bound her deck. The cards spilled out." This moment initiates the reading that reveals lost time's nature, leading directly to her final choice. Setup (deck introduced), middle pivot (unfastening releases cards and ritual), closure consequence (decision to stop reading for others). Causal pressure is strong; without this act, no reading and no revelation. Moderate specificity; "open" or "untie" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The traced-hand method is introduced early (birthday tablecloths, "geological strata" of overlapping hands), adapted into her reading layout ("the shape of a traced hand"), and reprised in closure when she traces her hand on moss "leaving no visible mark but knowing the glade would remember." Three beats: setup ritual history, middle card-spread execution, closure physical enactment that seals renunciation. High causal work and specificity; the method structures the entire reading and final gesture. Irreplaceable; no generic cartomancy would carry this genealogical charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The glade is present from the title and opening, supplies resources (moss to kneel on, moonlight for the reading, spatial isolation for reflection), and charges the final image ("clouds parted like curtains," cracked saucer catching moonlight). Setup (accessible "only at midnight, only to those carrying enough grief"), middle (site of the reading), closure (departure through clouds). Strong causal pressure: the glade's beauty and isolation enable the revelation. High specificity; no other setting would yield "cloudbound repentance."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the birth" anchors timeframe: "Three days after her daughter entered the world screaming, Sable left her." The urgency (newborn waiting with sister) tightens the descent decision. Setup (three-day marker), closure (return to "three days old" daughter). Moderate causal work: the fresh wound of motherhood drives the quest, but no live clock pressures the reading itself. Visible cost (leaving infant) shapes final choice. Swappability moderate; "after loss" could work, but birth specifically feeds the lost-time theme.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation ("to find where lost time accumulates") is stated early and drives every beat: Sable climbs to the glade, performs the reading, and learns lost time "accumulates here—in glades above clouds...in the hairline cracks." Setup, middle reading, and closure insight all hinge on this desire. Strong causal pressure with visible friction: she sacrifices time with her newborn to pursue the answer, then accepts "You do not get the time back. You get the glade." The irony (spending time to find lost time) is felt and specific.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Choking beauty" is embodied throughout: "beauty of it was so acute it closed around her throat," "lost time...becomes the beauty that chokes you," final saucer line "beautiful enough to stop the breath." Tone is consistent and modulates with pressure—awe in the glade, perplexity during reading, bittersweet resolve at descent. Charges the final image: the luminous crack is both wound and guide, beauty and cost unified. High specificity and irreplaceability; the tone is the conceptual hinge of "cloudbound repentance."</comment>
