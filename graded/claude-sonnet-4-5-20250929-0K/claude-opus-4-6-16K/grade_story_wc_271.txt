<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Noor's interiority is embodied through concrete anchors—hand on sternum, boots in thyme—and her trauma responses are physicalized rather than labeled. The final choice to pin the photograph carries visible cost (ending private ritual, accepting permanence) and emerges from prior micro-choices. Minor slip: "quietly talented" reads as authorial summary rather than dramatized blindspot or trade-off. The pearl metaphor risks therapy-speak but is earned through repeated morning practice and the pneumatic-drill beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): pinning the photograph and tending the pines reweights her relationship to memory with visible cost—she moves from pocket secrecy to public acknowledgment. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and cadence build to the final image where "things, despite everything, still grew." Orientation anchors who/where/when by graf 1. One meaningful deepening (pneumatic drill → pearl → photograph pinned) tightens the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arboretum setting constrains multiple choices: salvaged lighthouse glass for the greenhouse, thyme between flagstones as her morning anchor, the cliff's edge as practice site. The pneumatic drill (maintenance crew on cliff-side railing) triggers the climactic freeze and shapes the pearl discovery. The final image—copper light sweeping the cliff, Aleppo pines—charges closure by grounding her reconfigured stance in material specificity. Sensory selection reflects urgency: smoke/screaming/chemical smell compress trauma; wind/heartbeat/needles expand present safety.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can she hold wound and world simultaneously—is signaled early and tested in the pneumatic-drill beat. One meaningful tightening: the freeze happens but this time she finds the completing breath, a micro-turn that narrows options (she can no longer deny the pearl's reality). The photograph pinning forecloses private mourning with felt cost: crooked lavender row, hour of shaking hands. Agency is renunciation and endurance under Accumulative lens; no requirement for causal antagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image and action: the arboretum with no keeper, things that grow despite abandonment, the pearl as bodily proof rather than metaphor. The final image—photograph pinned beside tide chart, Aleppo pines in copper light—offers a non-literal answer to "can healing coexist with wound" without stating a moral. "The body keeps its own ledger" and "somatic markers" risk label-speak but are dramatized through freeze/breath/shaking sequence. The white dress "blurred by dancing" recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, anchoring theme in particular loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and apt; free indirect filters Noor's perception through horticultural bias (crooked lavender, salvaged glass, Aleppo pines from seed). Diction remains character-particular: "dumb, unearnable luck," "copper light," "salt wind." The therapeutic terms ("somatic markers," "pearl of stillness") are framed as Dr. Liang's language, not Noor's unmediated thought, preserving voice integrity. Rhythmic control modulates with pressure: short fragments during freeze, longer syntax when tending. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence; information density is high (every sentence advances character, setting, or pressure). Figurative language is controlled: "the courtyard would return in full sensory detail" is concrete, "pearl of stillness" is introduced by Dr. Liang and then earned bodily. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully—staccato during trauma recall, flowing during horticultural acts. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and resolve through image. Minor note: "quietly talented" in graf 4 could be shown through a single failed graft or visitor comment rather than summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—PTSD recovery through horticulture on an abandoned cliff-top arboretum—feels specific and non-obvious. The photograph detail (Rasha mid-laugh, white dress blurred) and the Aleppo pines (species-specific, tied to Sanaa origin) avoid generic trauma templates. Risk: the "pearl of stillness" could veer into self-help idiom, but it's grounded in morning cliff practice and the pneumatic-drill payoff. The piece transforms healing-journey tropes through embodied particulars (earbuds listening to nothing, boots in thyme, salvaged lighthouse glass) and resists tidy resolution—hands still shake, lavender is crooked.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Noor's survivor status drives the dominant stake (hold wound and world) and her choices: leave with duffel and grafting knives, build greenhouse from salvaged glass, practice at cliff edge, pin the photograph. Introduced in graf 2, causal in the pneumatic-drill reversal (courtyard returns, but pearl emerges), and present at closure (photograph pinned, pines watered). Setup + Development + Payoff all present. Specific cost: she moves from pocket secrecy to public acknowledgment, altering her relationship to memory.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The photograph is handled in three distinct beats: graf 2 (kept in chest pocket), the freeze beat (presses against heart "like a brand"), and closure (unfolded, pinned to greenhouse wall). Each touch reweights its function: talisman → wound marker → integrated memorial. Its presence in the final image charges closure by making the reconfiguration visible. Causal: the photograph's migration from pocket to wall embodies the thematic shift from private grief to coexistence. Irreplaceable: the specific detail (Rasha mid-laugh, white dress blurred, courtyard in Sanaa) ties to the missile strike and cannot be swapped.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"A pearl of stillness" is introduced by Dr. Liang in graf 6, sought in morning practice (graf 7), discovered during the pneumatic-drill freeze (graf 8: "a breath that completed itself"), and referenced at closure ("the pearl was real, and she could return to it"). It shapes tactics: her morning cliff practice is a search for this exact sensation. The concept narrows options in the climactic beat—she can now access calm inside panic, altering her stance toward healing. Felt cost: she still shakes for an hour and plants crooked, so the pearl is not cure but coexistence tool.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" is introduced graf 4 ("a gift people noticed only in its results") and demonstrated through roses that survive salt air, Aleppo pines from seed, and the greenhouse built from salvaged lighthouse glass. It enables her solitary life and the arboretum work that frames the story. However, it does not constrain a key choice or create visible trade-off on the page—her talent is context, not crucible. Present in setup and development, but passive at closure. Mid-band: functional but not indispensable to the dominant stake or final turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The freeze action appears in grafs 5–6 (whistle, gull, car door can trigger it), tested in the climactic pneumatic-drill beat (graf 8: "legs locked, vision tunneled"), and its partial bypass (finding the pearl within the freeze) drives the story's closure. Removing "freeze" breaks the plot: no somatic stakes, no pearl discovery, no earned shift from terror to coexistence. Setup + Development + Payoff all present. Specific cost: even after the pearl, hands shake for an hour and lavender is crooked. Causal irreplaceability: the freeze is the wound's bodily signature and the site of her micro-victory.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Somatic markers" is introduced graf 6 via Dr. Liang ("the nervous system encodes threat into muscle and nerve") and operationalized in the freeze beats: body locks, breath stops, courtyard returns "in full sensory detail." The method shapes her morning practice (hand on sternum, feeling heartbeat/wind) and the pneumatic-drill payoff (finding the completing breath). It frames the dominant stake—can the body learn safety—and the resolution proves the method works incrementally, not as cure. Setup + Development + Payoff present. Minor cap: it's articulated by the therapist rather than discovered through Noor's unmediated trial, so slightly less irreplaceable than if she'd invented the practice herself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The arboretum is introduced graf 1 (terraced cliff, cypresses, salt wind, automated beacon, forgotten gardens) and pressures multiple choices: salvaged lighthouse glass for greenhouse, thyme-flagstone morning practice site, cliff-side railing repair triggers the climactic freeze. The setting supplies resources (wild thyme, salvaged glass, salt air that should kill roses but doesn't) and constraints (isolation, exposure to pneumatic drill). Present in setup, development, and closure (final image: copper light sweeps the cliff, Aleppo pines). Micro-setting: the cliff's edge as practice anchor. Removing the arboretum breaks the plot's spatial logic and thematic resonance (growth in abandonment).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper died" establishes temporal frame in graf 1 (county automated beacon, forgot gardens) and contextualizes Noor's three-year tenure (graf 2). It creates the abandonment that allows her solitary work and frames the thematic question (who tends what's forgotten). However, it does not tighten a present decision or create urgency—no live clock pressures her choices. Setup present, mild thematic participation at closure ("no keeper watched anymore but where things… still grew"), but no middle development where the timeframe alters tactics. Mid-band: functional context, not causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To anchor optimism in realism" is dramatized in graf 9: "not a fantasy of healing but evidence, bodily and inarguable, that she could hold both the wound and the world." The desire is tested in the pneumatic-drill beat (can she find calm inside panic?) and resolved at closure (photograph pinned, pines watered, hands still shaking). Friction: her body's freeze response conflicts with her need to function; the pearl is "small, imperfect, luminous," not cure. Setup (morning practice), Development (freeze + pearl discovery), Payoff (closure image balances wound and growth). Specific cost: she accepts crooked lavender and ongoing vulnerability, foreclosing fantasy of full recovery.</comment>
