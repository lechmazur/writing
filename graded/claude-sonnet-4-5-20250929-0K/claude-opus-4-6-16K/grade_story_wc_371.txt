<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's noticing affliction is embodied through concrete observations (post office hours, vanished bakery) and drives her choice to seek Sable. Her interior is specific and character-particular ("stone the river couldn't smooth"). The final decision to learn gardening flows from accumulated pressure and represents a meaningful shift from passive observation to active resistance. Minor slip: the interiority occasionally drifts toward essay-like reflection ("creeping normality, she called it") rather than staying strictly dramatic, but this remains anchored to present stimuli and tilts her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the palace-gate paragraph (~15% in). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren moves from solitary noticing to committed action ("Teach me to garden"), foreclosing passivity with visible cost—she accepts the tenuous, incremental work of resistance. The bread motif seeds early and charges the final sacramental meal. One meaningful deepening occurs when Sable explains the flour conspiracy, reweighting Maren's isolation as both curse and gift. Cost is legible in the phrase "sometimes the sacred doesn't announce itself but simply waits...for someone stubborn enough to notice."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard supplies tactile constraint: jasmine trails guide Maren, the collapsed wall opens sky, mismatched cups and fire anchor the encounter. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (ivy "swallowing," moss "felting"). The bread as micro-object charges the final image when handled as sacrament. The setting enables the clandestine meeting and mirrors the theme of beauty through neglect. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Maren's need to validate her perception and find meaning in what others forget. Pressure accumulates through the bread delivery, Sable's flour revelation, and the final choice to act. One meaningful tightening: the conspiracy explanation narrows Maren's options from solitary witness to participant in resistance. Agency is visible in her request to learn gardening, foreclosing passive isolation. The cost—accepting incremental, uncertain work ("tenuous," "we can't give back")—is legible on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, the final sacramental meal reweights earlier particulars.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory, resistance, the sacred in ordinary acts—emerges from bread, guerrilla gardening, and the courtyard meal without overt statement. The final image (eating stale bread "as though it were holy") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: preservation is an act of witness that can't restore but can make forgetting harder. Subtext operates in Sable's heuristic gentleness and the silence where birdsong was. Minor slip: "tenuous absolution" and "uncloak" risk prompt-echo in the dialogue, though they remain dramatized rather than thesis-stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with Maren's perceptual signature (noticing eleven-minute shifts, blank walls). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("heuristically gentle," "felting the marble"). Dialogue feels natural and advances plot; Sable's indirection ("we can only make forgetting harder") carries subtext. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the ending's reflective close. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping. Minor texture note: a few phrases ("the ghost of sweetness") approach decorative lyricism but remain anchored to Maren's way of seeing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening has dense, accretive sentences that match Maren's cataloging mind, then breathes in the courtyard scene. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "moss felting the marble stairs" gives texture, decay, time). No paraphrase loops detected. Minor figurative density in the second half: "ghost of sweetness," "stone the river couldn't smooth," "beauty uncloak itself through neglect"—each individually clear but clustering near closure risks slight overwriting. Sentence openings vary. Grammar and tense are consistent. Final image ("sometimes the sacred...") lands cleanly despite slight abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The guerrilla-gardening frame offers a fresh angle on memory-resistance narratives. Specific detail (Korvath's sourdough, rosemary paths as directions, new flour as amnesia agent) grounds the premise. The birds-gone detail and blank-wall bakery are vivid particulars. Risk: the conspiracy explanation (dulling flour) feels slightly schematic, a convenient mechanism rather than surprising inevitability. The ending's choice to garden rather than fight is a quieter, more original turn than overt rebellion. Transformation test: swapping names/places would lose the overgrown-palace specificity but the arc's emotional shape might survive, suggesting mid-high originality rather than indispensable singularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren the noticer is setup from line one, shapes the middle beat (bread delivery, recognition of her immunity), and drives closure (choosing to learn gardening). Her noticing creates the key turn when she realizes her diet exempted her. Two gates plus closure participation. Causal pressure is clear. Visible cost: accepting incremental resistance over solitary witnessing.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Bread appears at journey start (carried in satchel), midpoint (placed on table as evidence, handled reverently), and ending (eaten as sacrament, charged with new meaning). Three distinct beats. Causal: proves the bakery existed and seeds the flour conspiracy reveal. Closure linkage strong: the final meal reweights it from evidence to holy act. Irreplaceable: the stale loaf's survival is the premise's linchpin.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tenuous absolution is named in dialogue ("absolution for what's already been lost? That's tenuous") and the concept shapes the stake: can memory be restored or only future forgetting resisted? It reweights Maren's choice at closure, accepting the limits of the work. Setup via theme, payoff in Sable's explanation and Maren's acceptance. Functional presence but not irreplaceable; the story could pivot to "resistance" or "witness" with minor edits. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Heuristically gentle is assigned to Sable early ("approached every truth sideways") and shown on-page: her pouring tea first, breaking bread reverently, delivering the conspiracy gently. The trait enables Maren's trust and shapes the midpoint exchange. Visible tradeoff: Sable's indirection might delay action, but it preserves agency. Two beats (tea-house introduction, flour explanation). Contributes to closure tone.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Uncloak appears in Sable's dialogue ("We can uncloak it") and thematically brackets the ending ("letting it uncloak," "uncloak the memory"). The action—revealing what's hidden—is the resistance method and charges the bread meal. Setup and payoff present, but swappable with "reveal" or "restore" without breaking logic. Lyric resonance lifts it slightly above functional. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is signaled early (planted lavender/rosemary paths, "embedding directions"), used at midpoint (the secret meeting enabled by the trails), and becomes the closure choice ("Teach me to garden"). The method shapes tactics (clandestine, incremental) and the final image (seeds, cracks). Two beats plus closure. Causal: the paths bring Maren to Sable. Irreplaceable mechanics: planting as covert resistance is the story's spine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Secret tea house setup through Maren's arrival (collapsed wall, mismatched cups, fire), pressures the encounter (clandestine location enables conspiracy reveal), and charges closure (the courtyard meal as sacrament). Three gates. The ruined palace mirrors theme (beauty through neglect) and supplies the micro-setting where resistance is born. Removing it would require a new covert meeting point and lose thematic resonance. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Birds flying south three weeks prior frames atmospheric loss (silent sky) and sets the timeframe, but does not tighten decisions on the page. Mentioned once at opening, echoed at courtyard scene ("quiet without birdsong"). No middle development or escalation tied to elapsed time. Lyric resonance present but no causal constraint. Below mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Finding the sacred in the ordinary is named late ("to find the sacred in the ordinary") but dramatized throughout: Maren's noticing, the bread as evidence, the courtyard meal. Setup implicit, middle choice (bringing bread, seeking meaning), payoff explicit in final paragraph. The motivation drives the arc and is tested against the cost of tenuous work. Friction between desire for restoration and acceptance of limits. Two beats plus closure. Felt cost: choosing small, uncertain acts over grand solutions.</comment>
