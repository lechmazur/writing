<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Selin's retrocognitive condition is concretely embodied through touch and perceptual fragmentation ("parts of her remained in every past she visited"), and her discipline—"to cradle empathy in arms of steel"—drives micro-choices across the piece. The flashback to Oren is seamlessly anchored in present stimuli (the tessera) and tilts Selin's present stance: she chooses to speak the name and then moves to the next stone. Internal contradiction is present (gentle/radical, steel/empathy) but acts more as thematic framing than as contradictory impulses wrestling in scene; the character executes her purpose without visible hesitation or competing desire, which keeps the grade below 8.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and pattern-taught repetition (tessera → name → next stone), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Selin's final act of kneeling at the next stone crystallizes her ongoing commitment with undeniable cost (accumulating grief, "one borrowed grief at a time"). The cost is visible in the closing image ("let the past pour in") and the persistent constraint (retrocognitive trap) shapes tactics throughout. One brief ellipsis (the magistrate's offer) is clearly motivated by Oren's memory. Orientation is clean by ~80 words; the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The plaza's vertical-to-horizontal transformation ("flames took everything vertical and left only what was flat and broken") and the shattered sky are filtered through Selin's priorities; the mosaic stepping stones function as micro-setting, constraining her choices (she must touch them, kneel, move sequentially). The final beam of light touching the mosaic charges the closure image. Spatial choreography (fountain center, kneeling, walking to next stone) tracks cleanly. The setting does more than one job—atmosphere, symbolic echo, and tactical constraint—but the constraint is softer than a hard gate (she chooses to touch; the stones do not force her hand), keeping the score just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake is clear early: Selin's mission to rename silenced grief. The accumulative lens guides escalation as a deepening rather than a reversal: each touch-and-name cycle reweights the cost ("empathy given structure—given steel—was revolution"). The final choice to kneel at the next stone forecloses the option to stop, with visible cost signaled in "let the past pour in." No explicit antagonist or reversal is required under this lens; the tightening comes from the recursive commitment. The cost is felt but somewhat oblique (she continues willingly), keeping the grade in the 8.0–8.5 band rather than 8.8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Selin's embodied action: "empathy unhoused is just sentiment, and empathy given structure—given steel—was revolution." The tessera's chipped pattern, the name embedded in geometry, and the warm/cold paradox ("warm as a hearth and cold as the acknowledgment") cohere without didacticism. The final image reweights the central question (can individual acts of naming resist erasure?) through the recursive gesture, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. One near-slip: the phrase "aberrant mercy" is named twice, risking thematic echo, but it is contextualized rather than preached. The ending avoids moralizing and sustains complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Selin; psychic distance is controlled, and the perceptual signature (touch-driven memory, tessellation-reading) is distinct and consistent. Diction stays within register ("retrocognitively trapped" reads as jargon the scholars used, not authorial convenience). Syntax modulates under pressure: the closing beat's longer clauses mirror Selin's deliberate rhythm. One minor slip: "the shattered sky watched, indifferent and beautiful" leans toward omniscient poeticism rather than strict Selin-filter, but it reads as stylistic compression rather than head-hopping. No dialogue is present; the single spoken line ("Dahra") functions as action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary; rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene needs. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Two minor loops: "she had learned to use this" and "that was what made her dangerous, and that was what made her gentle" paraphrase adjacent ideas without advancing pressure; the phrase "retrocognitively trapped" appears twice within fifty words. Figurative language is dense ("fractured dome of ash and light, cracked like porcelain") but voice-motivated and legible. The closing beat is clear and propulsive. The loops and one near-synonym pair ("warm as a hearth and cold as the acknowledgment") trigger a −0.6 deduction in Q7 for paraphrase/scaffold, preventing entry to 8.8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognition, mosaic-as-archive, and "gentle radical" reads fresh and specific; the premise transforms familiar "object-holds-memory" tropes through tactile geometry and recursive commitment. The warm/cold paradox and steel-empathy frame avoid cliché. One proximity concern: "empathy given structure" and "aberrant mercy" carry a faint essay-prompt echo, though the story earns them through concrete action (touching, naming, kneeling). The recursive ending (moving to the next stone) is purposeful but predictable in hindsight; a sharper surprise or cost might elevate further. Risk-taking in voice and metaphor is evident; the piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: Selin is named and characterized by ~150 words. Development: her decision to press the tessera firm and speak the name is causally central. Payoff: the final choice to kneel at the next stone is the closure beat. The "gentle radical" frame is cited but the key turns trace to her retrocognitive discipline and mission, not to radicalism as a contested stance. The character's choices create the story's arc; swapping "gentle radical" for "mourning archivist" would require only minor edits. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, swappability −0.6, label-only descriptor −0.3 = ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: the tessera appears in paragraph two, loosened and turned in Selin's fingers. Development: it delivers Oren's memory, reveals the daughter's name in its chipped glaze, and Selin presses it back into the mosaic. Payoff: the beam of light touches the mosaic, making the tiles glow; the object's return is charged. The tessera's specific properties (chipped glaze, cobalt and gold, loosening) drive the narrative and could not be swapped. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.7, cost +0.5, minor swappability −0.4 (any tessera with pattern could substitute) = ~8.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "aberrant mercy" is named in the final paragraph's retrospective ("her work of aberrant mercy"). Development: the magistrate's renaming offer is described as "aberrant mercy" within Oren's flashback. Payoff: the phrase reappears in the closing beat. The concept shapes Selin's understanding and frames the thematic question (can mercy that erases also heal?), but it does not constrain on-page choices—Selin would touch, read, and name the tessera regardless of this label. The work is guided more by her retrocognitive condition and empathy-discipline than by "aberrant mercy" as a distinct stake. Two beats +0.9, thematic framing +0.4, late first mention (second half) −0.4, label-only use −0.5, ornamental payoff −0.3 = ~7.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: "retrocognitively trapped" is explained by ~200 words. Development: the condition enables the Oren memory and constrains Selin (she must manage "parts of her remained in every past she visited"). Payoff: the closing beat ("let the past pour in") dramatizes the ongoing trap. The trait is irreplaceable; without it, the plot mechanism fails. Visible tradeoff: accumulating fragments and "haze of accumulated memory" limit her present clarity. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.4, irreplaceability +0.8, cost +0.6, jargon label −0.4, summary-only constraint (the "trap" is told more than shown in real-time friction) −0.5 = ~8.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: the need to rename is implicit in Oren's story (he could not speak his daughter's name). Development: Selin reads "Dahra" in the tessellation and speaks it aloud, fulfilling what Oren could not. Payoff: the act triggers the retrocognitive release ("grief settled into its proper place") and she continues the work. The act of renaming is the story's hinge; swapping it for "remembering" or "touching" would require structural rewrite. Early implicit signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.7, cost +0.5 = ~8.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: chipped patterns are mentioned by ~250 words. Development: Selin traces the chips to read "Dahra"; the method is specific and dramatized. Payoff: the final stone's chipped surface cues her to kneel and read again. The mechanics matter and are shown on the page, but the discovery feels slightly convenient (200 years of foot traffic wear the glaze in exactly the right spots). Early setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal use +1.2, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.6, convenience −0.5, summary tilt (the how of reading tessellation is asserted, not demonstrated) −0.3 = ~7.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" is anchored in the opening line. Development: the vertical-to-horizontal transformation and the fountain center position Selin's movements. Payoff: the beam of light through the sky charges the final mosaic image. The setting supplies atmosphere and thematic echo (brokenness, erasure) but does not tightly constrain tactical choices—Selin could perform this work anywhere with mosaics. The sky's fracture is more symbolic than functional. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, thematic support +0.5, closure linkage +1.2, postcard risk (beautiful imagery without hard constraint) −0.7, swappability (any post-fire site would serve) −0.6 = ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "three days ago" anchors time in the opening line. Development: the timeframe signals loss and ruins but does not create urgency; Selin's work is recursive and self-paced. Payoff: no ticking clock at closure. The fire's aftermath sets tone and stakes (the scholars are gone, the city is broken) but does not tighten decisions. The piece gains from the post-catastrophe frame yet would function nearly unchanged if the fire were three months or three years past. Early signal +0.7, one beat (tone) +0.4, thematic shading +0.3, no escalation pressure −0.8, swappability −0.5, vague tracking (no on-page time pressure) −0.4 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: "to cradle empathy in arms of steel—that was her purpose" appears by ~300 words. Development: the phrase is dramatized through Selin's discipline (holding Oren's grief "carefully inside the steel architecture") and her choice to act with "unshakeable resolve." Payoff: the closing beat enacts the motivation (she kneels again, accepting the next grief). The motivation is shown through action and drives the arc, though the phrasing leans slightly abstract. Two beats +0.9, causal dramatization +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, cost friction +0.5, label-register (the phrase reads essayistic) −0.5, late first mention (past 40%) −0.3 = ~8.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: the opening image ("fractured dome of ash and light") sets the paradox. Development: "warm as a hearth and cold as the acknowledgment that some wounds do not heal" and "indifferent and beautiful" sustain the tone through turns. Payoff: the closing beat's recursive gesture (kneeling, letting the past pour in) charges the warm/cold balance—compassion paired with clear-eyed endurance. The tone modulates with pressure and is coherent across beats. One slip: "indifferent and beautiful" slightly externalizes the tone rather than filtering it through Selin. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, coherence +0.8, closure charge +1.4, specificity +0.6, minor voice leak −0.3, static tilt (the tone is consistent but not dynamically escalating) −0.4 = ~8.1.</comment>
