<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's occupation as "subtle puzzle archivist" provides concrete interiority through her patient observation and cataloging methodology. Her choice to linger and arrange photographs demonstrates embodied decision-making under thematic pressure. The Ada Polk backstory arrives efficiently via research ("Later, she would learn...") and serves closure rather than flattening momentum. Minor deduction: the "perceptively calm" attribute functions more as label than constraint, and Maren's internal conflict remains muted—she pursues without meaningful hesitation or cost to herself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the story builds through discovery, arrangement, and conceptual reweighting rather than causal reversal. Orientation anchors cleanly (Maren, lavender field, present moment with flashback photograph). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Conceptual Repricing: the final image of photographs "resting in their dove gray case, their arcs of light curving gently toward whoever would find them next" reweights the archive from passive storage to active transmission, with Ada's scattered-seed legacy as the conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maren realizes "a collective healing is never the work of one hand," shifting her solitary pursuit into a continuum.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lavender field behind factory ruins functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: poison-to-beauty transformation constrains Maren's final understanding and supplies the physical anchor for her arrangement. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("purple silence," "rust streaking...amber tears," "long slants through the factory skeleton"). The dove gray map case, vines, and photographs recur with evolving significance. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the single-location scene. Gate satisfied: environment directly shapes the final image and conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: assembling scattered photographs to reveal a coherent arc/healing pattern. One meaningful tightening occurs when the arranged sequence forms "a single continuous curve...spanning decades," narrowing Maren's quest to a transmuted whole. Agency is decision and attention that completes the pattern. Cost legibility is weaker—Maren experiences revelation but no visible forfeit or trade-off on the page; the workers' planting and Ada's scattering carry the heavier conceptual price. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through pattern recognition and culminates in the archive filing, but protagonist cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of collective healing emerges from lavender-as-toxin-purifier, scattered photographs as seeds, and the archive as continuity rather than terminus. The final image—photographs "curving gently toward whoever would find them next"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: healing persists beyond individual discovery. Subtext operates through images (arcs as "lens flares but felt like something more") and the piece resists tidy moralizing. Minor slip: "a world that somehow, persistently...insisted on mending itself" edges toward thematic statement, though it remains imagistic enough to avoid sermonizing. No token motifs; lavender and photographs recur with escalating charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person maintains stable psychic distance with clean focalization. Diction is specific and voice-consistent ("dove gray," "purple silence," "vocabulary of the living world"). Perceptual signature is selective and archivist-filtered: Maren notices fragments, sequences, and patient assembly. No head-hopping. Minor artifact: "as vines climb, with the patient ambition of things that know time is on their side" slightly elevates register with personification that borders on authorial intrusion, though it remains legible within the lyric mode. Rhythm modulates purposefully between description and reflection without losing coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled with high information density ("factory walls rose...like broken teeth, rust streaking down their faces in long amber tears"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting: "orphaned pieces," "grief went to be alphabetized," and the long final sentence risk metaphor density that slows momentum in a reflective passage. The phrase "transmute pain into a masterpiece" in the penultimate section reads slightly abstract compared to the concrete imagery elsewhere. No clarity breaks; propulsion maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Subtle puzzle archivist" as occupation offers fresh specificity, and the photograph-scattering-as-seed conceit transforms familiar healing tropes through Ada Polk's deliberate dispersion. The lavender-behind-ruins juxtaposition feels earned rather than ornamental. Risk: lyric accumulation over causal turn succeeds without obscuring clarity. Deduction: the arc-of-light motif, while purposeful, trends toward symbolic convenience (lens flares "that felt like something more") and the "masterpiece" framing in Maren's motivation echoes craft-workshop vocabulary. Still, the synthesis of archive-as-transmission and collective-healing-through-fragments reads specific and inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren ("subtle puzzle archivist") is present throughout, drives discovery and arrangement (two beats), and her cataloging choice shapes the closure filing. Early signal, causal pressure moderate, closure linkage strong. Deduction: her decisions feel observational rather than high-stakes; she encounters no friction or cost beyond patience.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dove gray map case appears in beat one (shoulder sling), beat two (opening to lay photographs), and final image (resting photographs). Early signal, three touches, closure participation strong. Deduction: its use is functional but not irreplaceable—any container could serve; "dove gray" specificity adds texture but not constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Collective healing" shapes the dominant stake (assembling scattered evidence of group planting), drives Maren's realization ("never the work of one hand"), and charges the closure image (photographs curving "toward whoever would find them next"). Early signal via premise, causal pressure high, closure linkage undeniable, cost conceptual (Ada's scattered-seed legacy).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" appears once as descriptor ("perceptively calm in the way of someone who has spent years listening to the silence between puzzle pieces"). Setup present, but it functions as label rather than constraint; no on-page moment where calmness enables or costs her a choice. Swappable with "patient" or "steady."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Linger" is named explicitly ("She chose to linger. Not because she was uncertain, but because the field demanded a certain reverence") and enables the photograph arrangement beat. Early signal, one key beat, closure linked (lingering allows completion). Deduction: easily swappable with "pause" or "wait"; the action itself is not irreplaceable, though its reverence framing supports tone.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Black-and-white photographs with arcs appear in beat one (inciting discovery), beat two (arrangement that forms continuous curve), and closure (resting in archive). Method shapes all tactics: Maren traces arcs, arranges by angle, continues tradition with her own camera. Early signal, three beats, causal pressure high, closure participation strong, specificity high (arc pattern, handwriting, Ada's documentation). Cost: Ada's scattering and Maren's years of collection.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lavender field behind factory ruins is present in setup (inciting discovery), frames the central arrangement beat (laying photographs between rows), and charges closure conceptual repricing (poison-to-beauty transformation underpins theme). Early signal, two beats, closure linkage strong, irreplaceability high (the toxin-purification backstory is essential to collective-healing theme). Deduction: Maren's arrangement does not require the field's physical properties—she could arrange anywhere—so constraint is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"As vines climb" appears in two brief lyric refrains ("The vines kept climbing") but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time during Maren's on-page actions. Setup weak (vines mentioned mid-story), no middle development, closure participation ornamental (reprise without reweighting). Time remains static and untracked; no clock pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To transmute pain into a masterpiece" is named explicitly ("This was the masterpiece she had been trying to transmute") and shapes Maren's three-year quest (setup) and final filing decision (closure). Early signal via backstory, causal pressure moderate (drives collection), closure linkage strong (archive filing completes transmutation). Deduction: motivation is told more than dramatized in friction; Maren experiences no competing desire or visible cost to her own pursuit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Earnest whimsy" coheres through diction ("no business existing," "grief went to be alphabetized," "purple silence") and modulates purposefully between lyric wonder and grounded archival detail. Present throughout, supports pressure without undermining stakes, charges final image ("curving gently toward whoever would find them next"). Deduction: tone remains static rather than shifting under pressure; whimsy does not deepen or darken at closure.</comment>
