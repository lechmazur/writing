<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and specific—"tongue pressed to the roof of her mouth, tasting copper and ozone"—and her skepticism feels earned rather than declared. The grandmother's weather-carrying is rendered through vivid particulars (frost on windowsills, barometric shifts) that avoid therapy-speak. The final turn feels inevitable given the compass's spiral and her accumulated sensory catalogue, though the choice itself is more acceptance than agency with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (skeptic seeking mystery) but could deepen if the renunciation felt more like foreclosure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): Maren recognizes herself as weather-carrier and "let[s] the snow she carried finally fall," crystallizing her inherited role with conceptual cost (the skeptic's stance dissolved). The compass's convergence spiral, grandmother's parcel arrival three months prior, and the forest's election all accumulate toward this reweighting. One tightening suffices at this length; the needle pointing at Maren narrows options decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lavender bluff under aurora provides sensory anchoring (chromatic pools, shifting canopy) and the forest's root-network election functions as micro-setting that mirrors and charges the convergence motif. The compass ring (tin, oxidized, no cardinal markings) is handled across multiple beats and its spinning state constrains Maren's recognition. The final image—lavender bending, aurora flaring—directly charges the closure moment when she releases her inherited snow. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: petrichor, hailstone mineral, burnt-sugar chinook arrive in sequence as the needle accelerates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Maren's need to understand why some carry weather, signaled early and sustained. The compass's accelerating spiral is a clear pressure point; the needle's final direction toward Maren tightens options by forcing self-recognition. Agency is crystallization rather than decision, fitting the Accumulative lens, but the cost is conceptual (loss of skeptic identity) rather than a visible trade-off that alters later tactics. The forest election and converging taste signatures provide escalation under the chosen lens, though one additional on-page foreclosure would anchor the price more firmly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—atmosphere as nervous system, inheritance as election—emerges organically from the compass mechanics, grandmother's parcel, and forest ballot without thesis statements. The final image (high-altitude snow, terrestrially cosmic) offers a resonant answer to the central question: weather chooses its carriers through patient, democratic forces. "Luminous doubt that doesn't reject mystery but demands to stand inside it" reweights Maren's skepticism without moralizing. Subtext operates through taste changes and the compass's emergent behavior rather than declaration. The ending avoids summary and instead enacts the concept with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and voice is distinct: "the only democracy older than memory," "a piece of technology dressed in nostalgia." Perceptual signature is concrete (taste as diagnostic sense, aurora pulsing in sympathetic rhythm). Diction matches Maren's atmospheric science background without slipping into academic register at peak moments. Purposeful compression in "terrestrially cosmic, belonging to both the ground and the void" charges the closure. No dialogue present; psychic distance tightens appropriately as the needle points at her. One phrase—"luminous skeptic... luminous doubt"—recycles the modifier without reweighting it, a minor tic under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences layer action, sensory detail, and concept. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the compass spiral sequence. Two minor artifacts: "a diagnostic tool from some future that had already happened" leans toward explanatory summary rather than image, and "the kind of luminous doubt" in the penultimate section echoes the opening's "luminous skeptic" without payoff, creating a template cadence around that adjective. No loops or major scaffold, but the grandmother reflection block (parcel arrival, childhood observations) slightly dilates momentum in the middle third without anchoring a present micro-choice until the needle resumes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory diagnostic (taste), embodied weather phenomena, and democratic election (forests, atmosphere) feels specific and non-obvious. The tin compass as emergent technology rather than heirloom transforms the inherited-magic trope through grounded mechanics. "Atmosphere is a nervous system" and synaptic carriers offer fresh idiom. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and concept-forward structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One proximity note: "luminous skeptic" and the taste-driven investigator echo genre templates (magical realism detective), though the execution particularizes through the grandmother's frost and Dmitri's humidity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren (luminous skeptic) drives the investigation across multiple beats: cataloguing weather-carriers, coming to the bluff when the needle spins, and recognizing her own inheritance. Her final choice—"let the snow she carried finally fall"—emerges from accumulated evidence and alters her stance (skeptic to participant). Present in setup (opening), development (cataloguing tastes), and payoff (closure image). Not swappable; her atmospheric science training and inherited sensitivity are causally linked. Scores in mid-6s for causal involvement across beats and closure linkage, constrained from higher bands by the passive acceptance mode (chosen rather than choosing).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tin compass ring handled in three distinct beats: arrival in parcel (setup), tasting near Dmitri and coffee-shop woman (development), spinning then pointing at Maren (payoff). Its emergent property (points toward weather-carriers, not north) drives the investigation and the final recognition. Specific mechanics (no cardinal markings, tiny needle under glass) matter; a standard compass would break the logic. Present early, constrains Maren's search method, and charges the closure moment when it identifies her. Scores high for irreplaceability and closure linkage; capped below 8.5 because the ring's arrival is recounted rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Emergent compass (the concept, not only the object) shapes stakes: it points toward the intersection of human bodies and atmospheric phenomena, redefining what compasses do. This conceptual shift underpins Maren's catalogue work and her recognition that she herself is a convergence point. The concept is dramatized through the needle's behavior (spinning, then pointing at her) rather than merely thematic. Present in setup (ring's function explained), development (tastes catalogued), and payoff (needle's final direction). Scores solidly for causal pressure and closure participation; constrained from higher bands because the mechanics are more tool than dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" recurs three times: aurora/lavender setting (description), grandmother's weather-carrying (backstory label), and Maren's snow "belonging to both the ground and the void" (closure). The trait labels rather than constrains until the final image, where it charges the snow she releases. Functions more as thematic accent than on-page limiter; no visible trade-off tied to being terrestrially cosmic versus another state. Present in setup and payoff with weak middle development. Lyric reprise from first paragraph to last reweights meaning, reaching low-6s; lacks the causal cost needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Converge" drives the escalation: weather-carriers converging on a single point (the needle's spiral), forest election as convergence/selection, and Maren's final understanding of convergence as election. The action is signaled early (needle spinning), constrains her bluff visit (why she came), and the payoff reveals she is the convergence target. Two distinct beats (spiral behavior, needle pointing at her) plus closure linkage. Specific to the compass's emergent function; swapping for "gather" or "approach" would lose the pattern-and-selection resonance. Scores high for causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sensing through taste changes is signaled early ("tasting copper and ozone," "the taste in her mouth changed") and used across beats: salt/warm rain near Dmitri, metal filings/dry lightning near coffee-shop woman, petrichor/hailstone/chinook at the bluff, and high-altitude snow at closure. The method enables Maren's catalogue work and provides the diagnostic proof she seeks. Mechanics matter: each person's weather signature is tasted distinctly. Present in setup, development (multiple examples), and payoff (snow she tastes is her own). Scores high for causal involvement and specificity; capped below 8.5 because the tastes accumulate evidence but don't force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lavender bluff under aurora provides spatial anchor and sensory texture (chromatic pools, shifting canopy). The forest's root-network election (a micro-setting element) mirrors the convergence motif and the democratic theme. The bluff is the destination Maren chooses when the needle spins, so it shapes one choice. Aurora and lavender return in the closure image ("aurora flared, and the lavender bent"), charging the final moment. Present in setup, weak middle development (setting is mostly backdrop during reflection), strong payoff. Scores in mid-6s for lyric reprise and closure charge; lacks tactical constraint to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"While forests hold elections" frames the narrative window and provides thematic parallel (democracy, selection), but does not tighten Maren's decisions. The election concludes mid-story ("The forest below fell silent, its election concluded"), marking a transition rather than imposing urgency. Time is signaled but not tracked as live pressure; Maren's bluff visit is not racing a clock. Present in setup (opening paragraphs) and mentioned at closure (canopy redistribution), but middle development is absent. Functions more as atmospheric frame than tactical constraint. Scores in mid-5s for thematic coherence without escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—to learn why some carry weather—is stated explicitly ("She had come to the lavender bluff because...") and drives her catalogue work and bluff visit. The motivation is dramatized through her sensory research and the grandmother's example, creating friction between skepticism and inherited truth. The ring's spiral complicates the question by turning it inward. Resolution occurs when she recognizes herself as the answer. Present in setup (grandmother's backstory), development (cataloguing), and payoff (self-recognition). Scores in low-7s for causal linkage and closure participation; constrained by the told framing ("She had come to learn") rather than fully embodied want-versus-cost struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia operates through the compass ("a piece of technology dressed in nostalgia—tin and glass and a needle that remembered what compasses were supposed to do before they were asked to do something stranger") and the grandmother's parcel (future diagnostic sent three months posthumously). Tone is coherent: scientific skepticism meets inherited mystery, old materials doing new work. Modulates with pressure—clinical cataloguing shifts to lyric recognition—and charges the closure image (high-altitude snow, terrestrially cosmic). Present throughout; the tone reweights the final image by making the future-past loop explicit. Scores in low-7s for tonal coherence and closure charge; not indispensable (could substitute another tone family with edits).</comment>
