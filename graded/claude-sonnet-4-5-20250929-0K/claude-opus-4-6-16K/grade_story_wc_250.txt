<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The silent guardian is characterized through embodied stillness and purposeful action (adjusting shutters, wielding the mirror). Her motivation to "teach darkness the value of stars" drives concrete choices with visible cost—the labor of creating patterns, the offered connection to the boy. The boy's grief is shown through "stiff jaw" and "redness at the rims," and his response (sitting, breathing in sync) demonstrates earned change. Minor slip: the guardian's interiority remains largely inaccessible, limiting contradictory impulse visibility, but her renunciation of speech and her patient stance under pressure read as credible endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (cobalt dock, canal, post-rain evening). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through the guardian's ritual, the boy's arrival, and the shared silence that reweights loneliness as company. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the boy's softened shoulders and matched breathing crystallize the stakes with felt cost (his unlit lantern, her sustained vigil). The final image ("darkness overhead learned, slowly, to value its stars") reprices the opening metaphor with undeniable emotional weight, and the canal's indifference adds conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, wet planks, pooled water, and warehouse shutters are rendered with vivid specificity and constrain the guardian's actions—she must cross the footbridge, adjust shutters at angles, position herself for the mirror's reflection. The canal's "stillwater tension" and iron-wet air anchor mood and charge the final image. The dental mirror as micro-setting object recurs across beats and drives the light-coin gesture that connects guardian and boy. No occupation-level detail is forced; every sensory note serves pressure or atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching darkness to value stars, manifested as offering connection to the grieving boy—is signaled early and tightens through the guardian's pattern-weaving and the boy's approach. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy sits and his breathing syncs, narrowing options (he no longer flees, she no longer stands alone). The cost is legible: her sustained vigil, his unlit lantern left aside. Agency is renunciation and endurance; coincidence (the boy's arrival) complicates but does not resolve. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images—shutters as constellation, loneliness as a shutter one can open—without statement or label. The dental mirror's shifting function (private proof, then bridge) and the canal's indifference frame the question: can pattern be woven from neglect, can silence become company? The final image ("darkness overhead learned, slowly, to value its stars") offers a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in prior particulars (the boy's softened shoulders, matched breath). No moralizing; the conceptual cost (slow learning, sustained effort) is undeniable and reweights the opening metaphor with quiet authority.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering all through the guardian's selective attention (weaver studying a loom, canal knowing it is watched). Diction ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "bright syllables in a sentence the night was still learning") is purposeful and voice-consistent. Psychic distance tightens at the boy's arrival without head-hopping. The piece uses no dialogue, which fits the silence motif. Minor slip: a few phrases ("against all logic") edge toward authorial commentary rather than strict focalization, but the perceptual signature (stone-dropped ripples, angled mirror, shutter-slits as punctuation) remains distinct and rhythmically controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully ("The canal did not care. The rain did not return."), and most lines do double duty (setting + mood, action + theme). Information density is high. However, figurative language clusters heavily in several beats without always advancing pressure: "spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "mirror-skin of reflected sky," "bright syllables in a sentence the night was still learning" appear within tight proximity, occasionally slowing momentum. The dental mirror turning "and turned between her fingers" is a paraphrase loop across adjacent mentions. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the density of metaphor in high-concept passages approaches overwriting without quite crossing into opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—silent communion via light-pattern and mirrored reflection—feels fresh and specific, rooted in the guardian's peculiar toolkit (dental mirror, warehouse shutters). The transformation of loneliness into company through adjustable openings avoids therapy-speak and stock epiphany. The boy's unlit lantern and the guardian's nightly vigil are non-obvious synthesis elements that feel inevitable in hindsight. Minor constraint: the "teaching darkness to value stars" frame, while executed with care, edges toward a familiar metaphor (light vs. dark, hope in despair) without fully subverting it. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation, minimal plot) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The silent canal guardian appears early (first paragraph), drives two distinct beats (adjusting shutters, mirroring light toward the boy), and is causally active at closure (holds the mirror steady, lowers it when the boy's breathing matches hers). Her choices—crossing the bridge, creating the constellation, offering the light-coin—narrow options and enable the boy's response. Visible cost: sustained vigil, renunciation of speech. The element is irreplaceable; removing her dismantles the story's logic and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dental mirror is signaled early (first page, "turned and turned between her fingers"), used in two distinct beats (studying the shutter-reflection, sending the light-coin toward the boy), and charged at closure (she lowers it after his breathing syncs). Its angled head and miniature reflections are specific properties that enable her tactics. Visible cost: the precision and patience required to aim the reflection. Removing it would break the light-bridge mechanism and the "private sky" motif. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silent empathy shapes the guardian's tactics (no words, only gesture and pattern) and the boy's response (recognition without speech). It constrains on-page action: she does not wave him closer or speak, only adjusts the mirror. The concept charges the ending when "something passed between them. Not words. Not even a gesture." One meaningful tightening around the shared silence. The cost is implicit (loneliness endured, connection offered without guarantee). However, the concept trends more toward thematic resonance than hard constraint on physical choices, limiting the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" is introduced early and used to describe the guardian's effect ("her stillness radiated outward in concentric rings"). It enables her sustained vigil and patient pattern-work. However, it functions more as atmospheric label than a trait with visible on-page tradeoff. One modest constraint: her calmness allows her to wait without intervening when the boy arrives. Cost is implied (the effort of maintaining stillness) but not dramatized in a specific beat. The attribute is somewhat swappable with "patient" or "steady" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Weave" is signaled early ("the way a weaver studies a loom") and drives the major turn: she crosses the bridge and adjusts shutters to create a constellation, which reframes neglect as canvas. The weaving metaphor charges the closure ("weaving silence into something that felt, against all logic, like company"). Two distinct beats (shutter adjustment, silence with the boy) and causal pressure (the woven pattern enables the light-coin gesture). Cost: labor and precision. Removing "weave" would require recasting the central action, but a near-synonym like "arrange" could substitute with modest edits, limiting the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method—creating patterns with shutters—is signaled early ("she began"), drives the middle beat (crossing the bridge, tilting shutters to specific angles, creating a constellation), and is causally essential to the light-coin gesture and the closure image (the broken constellation on the canal's surface). Its mechanics matter: the shutters must be adjusted precisely to reflect light into the dental mirror. Visible cost: the physical labor and time. Removing this method dismantles the story's central mechanism and thematic charge. High causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain is anchored early and supplies resources (wet planks that reflect and slide light, pooled water, the footbridge she must cross). It pressures choices: she must position herself at the dock's edge to aim the mirror, and the canal's flat surface reflects the shutter-constellation. The setting charges the final image (dock holding both figures, "cobalt and gleaming"). Two distinct beats and causal involvement. Cost: the iron-wet air and the dock's exposure. However, a dry dock or stone quay could substitute with moderate edits, preventing a score above mid-8s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret—that trembling instant when the mouth opens and the truth has not yet decided whether to emerge" is invoked once at the midpoint to describe the moment of recognition between guardian and boy. It does not function as a ticking clock or tracked timeframe that tightens decisions. The phrase adds lyric resonance but is swappable with "a held breath" or "a pause before speaking." No causal pressure or closure linkage. Ornamental use; score in the mid-5s for thematic echo without structural necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation—to teach darkness the value of stars—is dramatized early (she creates the shutter-constellation) and drives two beats (pattern-weaving, offering the light-coin). It faces friction: the boy's grief, the canal's indifference, the inherent impossibility of "teaching" darkness. Visible cost: nightly vigil, sustained effort without guarantee. The motivation charges the closure ("the darkness overhead learned, slowly, to value its stars"). However, it trends more conceptual than urgent want-versus-fear tension. The desire is shown through action but not deeply conflicted on the page, limiting the score to low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is introduced early ("the canal...lay flat and heavy, holding its breath") and modulates across beats: initially atmospheric, then tightening when the boy appears, finally resolving into "two figures held in stillwater tension" at closure. The tone coheres through turns without flatlining and charges the final image (the canal's indifference, the slow learning). It reflects the guardian's spiraling calm and the boy's hesitant arrival. Strong closure linkage and coherent modulation under pressure. Minor constraint: the tone is more ambient than directly causal, preventing a score above mid-8s.</comment>
