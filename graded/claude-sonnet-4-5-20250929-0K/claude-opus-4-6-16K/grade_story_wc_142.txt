<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is coherent and embodied through micro-choices (painting the mural at midnight, keeping the stone chip, coordinating through art). Her dual allegiance creates visible internal conflict that drives choices without therapy-speak. The foundation stone chip appears three times with changing weight, charging the closure beat. Backstory is substantial (~25%) but anchored in present stakes (the privatization vote, her education return) and tilts present choices, staying within BRR allowance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraph. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the counteroffer is ready, Olu's allegiance has shifted, the mural spreads the word, and the final image crystallizes undeniable pressure ("deciding what it wanted to be") with felt cost (sixty days, gentrification encroaching). One meaningful deepening occurs when Olu brings the counteroffer, reweighting Maren's solitary organizing into collective action. Cost is legible in the stone chip's imprint and the persistent threat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Flotilla is vividly realized through selective sensory detail (drumlines, painted streamers, stilts, copper lantern light) filtered through Maren's familiarity. The carnival setting constrains her communication method (no centralized bulletin, monitored radio) and the stone chip functions as micro-setting, handled three times and charging the final mural. Spatial choreography is clear (eastern platform, pontoon, main platform). The setting drives the reorganization tactic and shapes the closure image of the rocking rafts.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent privatization through community reorganization) is signaled early and tightens when Olu arrives with the counteroffer, a reversal driven by Maren's prior organizing. The sixty-to-forty-day exchange narrows the window with agency. Pressure accumulates through the graffiti coordination, the founder/newcomer tension, and Olu's shift, all feeding the Charged Poise ending. Cost is visible in the persistent threat, the stone chip's symbolic weight, and the phrase "because the alternative is drowning."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (collective self-determination vs. imposed order, dual allegiance as strength) emerges through concrete particulars—the graffiti system, the stone chip imprint, Olu's coffee and counteroffer—without thesis statements. The final image ("deciding what it wanted to be") reweights the carnival's anarchic identity as intentional architecture with conceptual cost (the perpetual carnival must organize to survive). Maren's liminality is enacted through choices, not explained. The closing drums extend the opening motif with deepened meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Maren sees "pressure points the way a sailor sensed weather," filters the carnival through planning and affection). Diction stays controlled and voice-motivated throughout. The two brief dialogue exchanges feel natural and goal-driven, advancing plot (Olu's allegiance shift) without exposition. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates appropriately under pressure (the midnight painting beat is compressed; the dawn closure breathes).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Prose is propulsive with high information density and varied syntax. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence runs. The opening hook ("shock absorber") and closing image (drums) frame effectively. Minor slips: "orderly intuitive mind" reads slightly label-like, and "riotous aesthetic" is somewhat generic, but these are brief and do not obscure causality or closure. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("synaptic threads," "elegy and anthem") serves pressure without overwriting. Clear sequence and strong verbs throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The floating-city carnival premise is vivid and the encoded-graffiti coordination method is specific and fresh. Maren's dual allegiance and the gentrification-on-water angle offer a non-obvious synthesis. The stone chip as both anchor-fragment and seal is a concrete, irreplaceable detail. Risk is modest—the structure is linear and the hopeful tone predictable—but the particulars (stilts as natural extension, desalination units as class markers) transform familiar material. Transformation test passes: swap names and the Flotilla's carnival logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren as shock absorber/culture translator shapes all major beats: she reorganizes districts, encodes messages, paints the mural, and her dual allegiance enables Olu's shift. Present in setup (opening paragraph), middle (graffiti coordination), and closure (walking into the carnival, believing in forty days). Drives at least three beats with visible cost (her liminality, the midnight painting, the belief "because the alternative is drowning"). Irreplaceable—remove her mediator role and the community-ownership counteroffer fails.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in three beats: turned between her fingers at dawn (embodied anchor), pressed into wet paint as a seal (tactile middle use), and slipped back into her pocket at closure (reprise with reweighted meaning—anchor becomes active tool). Early signal, purposeful reprise, and the imprint constrains the mural's meaning. Cost connection is present (symbolic weight, "saints' medals"). Swappability moderate—a different token could work, but the "foundation" link to the Flotilla's origin charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dual allegiance shapes every beat: Maren's mainland education vs. Flotilla birth drives her reorganization strategy, her communication method (graffiti within carnival aesthetics), and her ability to shift Olu's stance. Setup early ("dual allegiance made her uniquely suited"), development (she uses carnival to encode messages, bridging camps), and closure (Olu's shift proves the allegiance model works). Drives tactics, narrows options, and the final belief ("we only need forty") depends on cross-camp trust. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive mind" appears once as a label ("sense a community's pressure points the way a sailor sensed weather") and constrains her reorganization tactic implicitly. Early signal, but no on-page moment where the orderliness/intuition creates a visible tradeoff or cost. Mentioned in setup, inferred in the graffiti coordination beats, but not dramatized as a choice constraint at closure. Functional but swappable—"strategic" or "systems-minded" could replace it. No felt cost tied to the attribute itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reorganization is the central action: signaled early ("begun to reorganize the Flotilla's informal districts"), drives the graffiti-encoding method, generates the mural beat, and the counteroffer at closure depends on it ("the cooperative charter had enough signatories"). Present in setup, middle (coordinating through art), and closure (the mural spreads the word, organizing continues). Drives at least three beats and the ending would collapse without it. Cost is visible (midnight painting, persistent threat, belief under pressure). Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Graffiti messages are signaled early ("Maren used the carnival itself... messages encoded in graffiti art"), mechanics detailed in the middle paragraph (indigo spiral, geometric fish, red wave), and the midnight mural beat demonstrates the method under pressure. The method constrains her tactics (no centralized bulletin, monitored radio) and shapes the closure (the mural spreads the counteroffer news, organizing continues). Present across setup, development, and closure. Drives two beats with visible cost. Specific and irreplaceable—swap for flyers or radio and the carnival integration collapses.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Flotilla carnival setting is established vividly in the opening (drumlines, streamers, stilts, perpetual festival) and constrains the communication problem (no centralized system, Consortium monitors radio), forcing the graffiti method. The setting supplies resources (riotous aesthetic hides messages) and the closure image (drums, lanterns, rocking rafts) charges the final stance. Present in setup, middle (carnival as communication medium), and closure. Drives tactics and the ending image. Swappability moderate—another marginal community could work, but "perpetual carnival" specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sixty-day privatization deadline is signaled early, tightens in the middle ("Consortium's privatization bid was sixty days from ratification"), and narrows at closure ("Sixty days." "We only need forty"). Time pressure drives the urgency of the reorganization and counteroffer. Present in setup, development (implicit in the mural's urgency), and closure (the forty-day belief). Drives tactics and the final wager. Cost is visible (the alternative is drowning). Specific countdown elevates stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Navigating gentrification is dramatized through concrete choices: reorganizing districts before the Consortium imposes its grid, encoding messages in carnival aesthetics to resist external order, and the counteroffer as community-ownership alternative. Motivation is embodied early (wealthier barges, espresso machines, noise ordinances), drives the middle beats (graffiti coordination, mural painting), and the closure stakes (forty days to counter privatization). Friction between preserving wildness and achieving stability creates visible cost. The motivation is irreplaceable—remove gentrification and the reorganization loses its stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Hopeful desperation coheres throughout: the perpetual carnival under threat, Maren's fierce belief "because the alternative is drowning," the saxophone "between elegy and anthem," and the closing "drums did not stop" against the sixty-day countdown. Tone modulates under pressure (midnight painting urgency, dawn's golden light) and charges the final image (unsteady and alive, deciding what it wants to be). Setup, development, and closure all carry the blend. The juxtaposition of celebration and existential threat is consistent and irreplaceable.</comment>
