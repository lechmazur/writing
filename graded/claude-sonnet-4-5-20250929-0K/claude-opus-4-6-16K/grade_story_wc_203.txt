<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marco's interiority is concrete and profession-specific—his observation philosophy and ceiling-reading methodology ground his choices. The ghost relationship shows internal logic: twenty-three years of avoidance until this specific trigger forces engagement. The final decision to pocket the locket and search for Marguerite demonstrates a values hierarchy with visible cost (taking on an unpaid burden). Minor slip: the "curse" framing in the opening feels slightly label-like, though the subsequent action dramatizes it well enough.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative elements (observation accumulates until action). Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration—the ghost's release through Marco's intervention, followed by his commitment to find Marguerite, reweights his relationship to his "curse" from passive endurance to active stewardship. Cost is visible: he accepts an open-ended search obligation. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening two paragraphs. One meaningful tightening when the fluorescents die and the ghost looks *at* him shifts the stakes decisively. The because/therefore chain from crack-reading to barrel discovery to ghost release holds cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus setting provides specific atmospheric detail (sequined leotard, elephant engravings, warped floorboards) and the ceiling itself functions as micro-setting that constrains Marco's discovery—he must climb, pry, analyze dust. The fluorescent buzz operates as both environmental pressure and a signal of supernatural shift. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Doesn't quite reach 8+ because while the setting enables discovery, it doesn't force a tactical choice or dilemma at closure; the locket decision happens independently of environmental constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: resolve the unfinished business (both mechanical and supernatural). The fluorescent silence creates a meaningful pressure shift that forces Marco's choice to engage. His decision to open the barrel and place the locket is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost—he commits to an unpaid search, foreclosing the option to remain professionally detached. The escalation is economical: observation → discovery → supernatural acknowledgment → commitment. Doesn't quite reach 8.5+ because the ghost's cooperation makes the final act feel slightly frictionless; no competing values test the choice to help.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of unfinished burdens and chosen witness emerges through concrete action—ceiling observation, hidden objects, waiting dead—without thesis statements. The "weightless burden she could neither carry nor set down" risks telling but earns it through the preceding image work. The final choice to search for Marguerite reweights Marco's "curse" from affliction to vocation without moralizing. The elephant-engraved barrel and children's locket create specific emotional texture. The ending's quiet resonance ("its secrets lighter now by one") reprises the ceiling philosophy with new weight. Reaches high 8s but not 9+ because the thematic answer feels slightly tidy—burden acknowledged, burden lifted—without lingering moral friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Strong perceptual signature: Marco's ceiling-first methodology, dust-pattern analysis, and professional precision create a distinct filtering lens. The prose modulates purposefully from technical observation to supernatural encounter without register clash. POV remains stable third-limited throughout. The ghost's non-verbal communication is handled cleanly without head-hopping. Minor deduction: "everything else he noticed was his curse" and "a philosophy" edge toward abstract labeling in the opening, though subsequent concreteness compensates. Psychic distance shifts (close during discovery, slightly wider during ghost interaction) serve the beats appropriately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high—most sentences advance character, setting, or plot simultaneously. Rhythm varies appropriately (short sentences at the supernatural turn: "The fluorescent buzz died off"). Clean grammar and pronoun reference throughout. The ceiling-reading passage demonstrates controlled technical specificity that characterizes without stalling. Minor template echo: "He [verbed]" construction repeats in the middle section ("He crossed," "He followed," "He turned") but doesn't form a long enough chain to trigger the −0.4 penalty. The "trunk-to-tail" elephant detail and "felt like cloth" texture show strong concrete specificity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ceiling-observation hook provides a fresh professional lens on ghost-seer stories, and the dust-pattern methodology is specific enough to feel researched. The horologist's barrel (profession specificity, elephant detail) elevates beyond generic "hidden object." However, the core ghost-with-unfinished-business premise remains highly familiar, and the resolution—sympathetic observer helps trapped spirit find peace—follows a well-worn arc. The piece executes the template skillfully but doesn't transform it through a non-obvious moral calculus or structural risk. The ending's emotional truth is genuine but the story structure could transpose to other settings with minimal friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marco's dual identity (technician + ghost-seer) is established immediately and drives key choices: his ceiling-first methodology enables the barrel discovery, and his twenty-three-year avoidance policy crystallizes into the decision to engage when the ghost looks directly at him. His final choice to pocket the locket and search for Marguerite demonstrates agency with cost. The character appears in all three gates (setup, development, payoff) and his specific skills create the causal chain. Reaches mid-7s for strong beat involvement and closure linkage; doesn't reach 8+ because the ghost-seeing trait, while present, feels slightly generic once activated—the specific elevator-repair angle does more causal work than the supernatural perception itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mainspring barrel appears in three distinct beats: discovery (behind ceiling tile with elephant engravings), examination (Marco recognizes it as horologist's work, opens it), and resolution (contains locket and note that complete the ghost's waiting). Its specific properties matter: the elephants signal circus connection, the grandfather-clockmaker detail motivates Marco's recognition, the rattling sound builds curiosity. The object directly enables closure—without it, no release, no locket, no Marguerite mission. Introduced at ~30% mark (slightly late but functional), handled on-page with tactile detail (heavy, ornate, unscrewing the cap), and the contents reweight the entire supernatural encounter. High irreplaceability: a generic container wouldn't carry the same craft-specific resonance or thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "cracks in the façade" concept operates on two levels: literal (ceiling fractures that lead to discovery) and metaphorical (hidden burdens, surface versus depth). The ceiling-crack analysis methodology drives the midpoint discovery beat and reflects Marco's philosophy about what buildings and people hide. The concept shapes his approach tactics (where to look, what dust patterns mean) and charges the final line ("the plaster held its silence, its secrets lighter now"). However, the conceptual work remains somewhat illustrative—the cracks enable rather than constrain, and the façade metaphor doesn't create a dilemma or cost. Present in setup and payoff with one development beat; reaches mid-6s for thematic integration but not 7+ because removing "cracks" specifically and replacing with "ceiling stains" or "loose panels" would preserve the discovery logic with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is dramatized through the dust-pattern analysis, the ceiling-reading philosophy, and the grandfather-clockmaker recognition that identifies the barrel. It enables the key discovery and reflects a professional methodology with clear on-page mechanics. The trait carries implicit cost: Marco's hyperfocus on physical details is framed as what he's "good at" in contrast to his ghost-seeing "curse," suggesting observation is both skill and coping mechanism. However, the trait doesn't create friction or a visible tradeoff at closure—it's consistently rewarded without complication. Present in setup (introduced as core trait), development (drives discovery), and payoff (he "recalibrates" to return to work), but the lack of a moment where observation fails or costs him something keeps it below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Engage" is the exact pivot: after twenty-three years of not watching back, Marco makes the active choice to speak to the ghost ("This is yours") and open the barrel between them. That decision drives the entire resolution sequence—ghost acknowledgment, locket placement, release, commitment to find Marguerite. The story builds toward this action through Marco's observation accumulation and the fluorescent-silence pressure shift, then makes the engagement choice redefine his relationship to his ability. The word "engage" appears on the page ("decided to engage") at the turn, charging it with intentionality. Without this specific action, the ghost remains unacknowledged and the barrel stays closed. Irreplaceable and closure-shaping; reaches high 8s for strong causal necessity and beat count (decision, execution, consequence).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dust-accumulation analysis appears in one sustained beat: Marco climbs, examines crack patterns, distinguishes old stable dust from recent disturbance, and follows the disrupted line to the elevator shaft and hidden barrel. The method is signaled with procedural specificity ("Where dust gathered thick and even, the cracks were old") and its mechanics matter—the thin/disturbed dust reveals recent shift and guides his search. However, it's used once and then abandoned; the method doesn't recur or evolve. Present in setup (introduced as his approach) and development (drives discovery), but absent from closure where he "recalibrates" to generic elevator work. Reaches mid-6s for enabling one key turn with procedural clarity; doesn't reach 7+ because the technique is easily replaceable with "noticed a loose tile" or similar search logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office provides specific atmosphere (fluorescent buzz, warped floors, sequined ghost, elephant engravings) and contains the essential prop (ceiling access to hidden barrel) and supernatural presence. The counter functions as a staging ground for the final exchange (barrel placed "between them," locket placed for ghost to touch). However, the setting enables rather than pressures—Marco could perform this discovery and choice in various abandoned venues. The circus detail charges imagery (acrobat children, sequins, elephants) but doesn't constrain his tactics or create a dilemma at closure. Present across all three gates with strong atmospheric detail and some tactical shaping (ceiling architecture, counter as ritual space), but swappable with "abandoned theater" or "old carousel building" keeps it at low 7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The overhead fluorescent buzz frames the opening (continuous hum establishing baseline reality) and its death at ~60% creates the exact pressure shift that forces Marco's engagement: "In the sudden silence, the quality of the room changed." The timeframe isn't a clock but a state-change marker—the buzz stopping signals the supernatural threshold crossing, and its return at closure ("flickered back on, buzzing as though nothing had happened") marks the resolution and return to mundane work. This binary (buzz/silence/buzz) structures the three-act pressure curve and makes the ghost's direct gaze possible only in the silence window. Strong causal and atmospheric work; reaches low 8s for shaping the turn and framing closure. Doesn't reach 8.5+ because the mechanics remain somewhat ambient—why the buzz stops isn't explained, so it reads partly as atmospheric convenience rather than fully earned constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marco's motivation "to discover what ceilings hide" is established as both professional method and personal philosophy in the opening ("his curse... his philosophy"). It drives his ceiling-first search pattern and the dust-analysis beat that finds the barrel. The closing line ("the plaster held its silence, its secrets lighter now by one") directly reprises and reweights the motivation—he's discovered what this ceiling hid and added meaning to his compulsion. However, the motivation doesn't face friction or cost on the page; it's consistently rewarded. No moment where the drive to discover conflicts with safety, time, or professional duty. Present in setup, development, and payoff with thematic charge, but the lack of dramatized internal conflict (desire versus obstacle within the motivation itself) keeps it at mid-7s rather than 8+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "weightless burden" tone emerges through the ghost's condition ("a weightless burden she could neither carry nor set down"), the dust imagery (secrets that accumulate without weight), and Marco's quiet professionalism (methodical, undramatic). The phrase appears explicitly at ~75%, crystallizing the story's emotional register. Tone modulates subtly: clinical observation in the opening, mounting supernatural tension through the silence, quiet resolution without flash ("not dramatically, not with a flash, but the way dust settles"). The final image ("its secrets lighter now by one") extends the weightless/burden paradox with precision. Strong coherence and purposeful modulation; reaches high 7s for charging the closure image. Doesn't quite reach 8.5+ because the explicit phrase "weightless burden" edges toward thematic labeling rather than pure implication, though the surrounding imagery compensates well.</comment>
