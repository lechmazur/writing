<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is characterized through concrete professional detail (atlas editor, seventeen years of pattern recognition) that directly motivates her quest. Her interiority is precise and embodied: "subtly confident in the way of people who know they're right but see no need to announce it." The final walk onto the ice embodies a motivated choice arising from her eleven years of correcting cartographic errors and recognizing the convergence pattern. Minor slip: the phrasebook moment ("folding and unfolding the ear until the crease was soft as cloth") reads slightly precious but doesn't undercut the final agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (atlas editor at outpost, frozen lake, post-falcon return) arrive early. The condensation pattern accumulates across seven mornings, shifting from individual rivers to a singular convergence point that reweights Maren's quest with conceptual cost—her walk onto the ice forecloses further editorial safety. Closure is Charged Poise: the final image ("precise as a river finding its course") crystallizes her acceptance of the pattern's logic with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening (day seven's simultaneous overlay) tightens options under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The outpost's sweating walls and condensation patterns constrain Maren's investigation and charge the closure image. Micro-setting detail (rusted perch, branching moisture, warm glass) is selective and purposeful. The frozen lake functions as both spatial anchor and conceptual mirror: "a page no one had written on...suggesting not emptiness but erasure." The phrasebook and falcon perch are tactile, repeatedly handled objects. Spatial choreography remains clean throughout the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the source pattern) is signaled early and tightens when the condensation resolves to coordinates beneath the lake. The day-seven convergence is a meaningful reversal that narrows options: Maren can no longer remain an observer correcting others' work. Her walk onto the ice is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost—she leaves the outpost's safety to pursue a pattern that may not support human mapping. The "empty return" of the falcon and the warming glass are earned escalations under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (memory/source as shared root; invisible architecture versus editorial correction) emerges through concrete images without thesis statements. The Evenki phrasebook page, folded soft, seeds the ending's non-literal answer: maps fail because they capture lines, not the logic beneath them. The final image—Maren walking "precise as a river finding its course"—resonates as Conceptual Repricing without moralizing. The condensation patterns function as motif with escalating pressure, not token recurrence. Quiet ending succeeds through charged particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and apt. Perceptual signature is character-particular: Maren notices branching patterns, recognizes watersheds by shape, and filters the world through editorial precision. Diction ("subtly confident," "anatomical precision," "recursion") fits her professional lexicon without drift. The phrasebook's dog-eared page and the "warm" moisture anchor reflection in concrete present stimuli. Minor issue: "worrying tranquility" in one line risks slight tell-y exposition, but the surrounding images (uncracking lake, motionless falcon) dramatize the unsettling stillness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening establishes voice with "which was itself a message," and the final line's cadence ("precise as a river finding its course") recharges prior material. Information density is high: "Yenisei, the Ob, the Lena" compress world detail without scaffolding. Zero paraphrase loops or template stems. One minor slip: "She was an atlas editor. Blankness was her enemy" reads slightly expository in isolation, but the surrounding concreteness (eleven years at Calder and Rowe, correcting sins of cartographers) mitigates the tell. Figurative language (ice "preening," outpost "bolted...like a barnacle") is coherent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The convergence of cartographic recursion and Evenki etymology offers a fresh synthesis. The condensation-as-map conceit is specific and non-obvious, tied to hydrosurvey setting and editorial expertise. Risk-taking in the quiet, lyric closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight dock: the "singular convergence from which all watershed logic emanated" premise echoes philosophical everywhereness tropes; transformation arises from Maren's occupational grounding and the phrasebook's lived detail, elevating it above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's editorial precision and confidence shape her recognition of the condensation patterns and her final walk onto the ice. The trait appears early ("dry...precise"), recurs in her sketching and phrasebook engagement, and culminates in the closure image ("subtly confident, precise as a river"). Her professional identity constrains her response: she seeks pattern, not mysticism. Cost is legible—she abandons the editorial safety of correction for embodied participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears early (supply locker), is handled physically ("folding and unfolding the ear until the crease was soft as cloth"), and returns at the closure beat ("opened...one last time"). The Evenki root (memory/source) reweights the final walk's meaning. It shapes two distinct beats: initial discovery and final confirmation. Slight limitation: the middle development is reflective rather than action-driving; Maren does not use the phrasebook to alter tactics, only to frame understanding.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Singular convergence structures the entire quest: Maren's seventeen years reveal "a recursion, a fractal signature" across continents, driving her to the outpost. Day seven's overlay of all rivers into one branching structure is the concept made visible, narrowing her options to acceptance or denial. The concept shapes stakes (editorial precision versus participatory surrender) and the final image (walking as a river). Indispensable: remove it and the closure collapses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" is seeded early ("in the way of people who know they're right but see no need to announce it"), enables her seventeen-year pattern recognition, and charges the final line ("subtly confident, precise as a river finding its course"). The trait constrains her response—no dramatic announcements, only methodical observation and a quiet walk. Cost is visible: confidence allows her to walk onto unmarked ice. The attribute is irreplaceable in shaping her agency.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The condensation patterns "herald" Maren's realization but function more as discovery than reversing action. They appear across multiple beats (third night sketching, seventh morning overlay) and shape the ending's coordinate revelation. However, the herald is passive observation rather than a choice Maren makes; the patterns act on her. Present in closure (warm glass, cleared windows) but not protagonist-driven, limiting causal pressure. Mid-band for essentiality without full agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The condensation method is seeded early (first night noticing, third night sketching), its mechanics matter (moisture traces specific watersheds with "anatomical precision"), and it drives the day-seven turn (simultaneous overlay into coordinates). Maren's fingerprint on warm glass is the tactile climax. The method shapes her investigation across beats and charges the closure. Strong integration; slight dock for the method being environmental gift rather than protagonist technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The outpost (rusted, sweating walls, supply locker) anchors all action and supplies the condensation substrate. The frozen lake pressures Maren's final choice—she cannot access the coordinate without walking onto blankness. The falcon's perch and phrasebook are setting resources that alter tactics. The outpost's "exhaled" windows signal closure shift. Setting constrains investigation (isolation after falcon's empty return) and enables discovery (condensation medium). Essential across setup, middle, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the falcon returns" frames the story and "seventh morning after the falcon returned" marks the decisive shift. The timeframe tightens Maren's isolation (no weather station contact) and paces the accumulation of condensation data. However, the clock is not urgent or live in scene-by-scene pressure; days pass in summary. Present in setup and payoff, shaping the accumulative pattern, but not continuously tracked in tactics. Solid integration without high tension.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation (finding the source pattern) is dramatized early through Maren's seventeen-year editorial recursion and drives her presence at the outpost. It conflicts with safety (isolation, abandoned contacts) and culminates in the walk onto ice—sacrificing editorial distance for participatory knowing. Friction between the desire for cartographic capture and the pattern's invitation to embodied surrender charges every beat. The phrasebook moment and warm glass are desire-driven choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Worrying tranquility is established early ("too complete, too settled, like the silence of a held breath") and sustained through uncracking lake, motionless falcon, and sweating walls. The tone modulates subtly: initial unease, methodical observation, then day-seven's warm glass and cleared windows shift to charged acceptance. The tone charges the final image—walking into blankness is tranquil yet irrevocable. Coherent through turns, the tone reweights the closure by framing Maren's precision as surrender rather than conquest.</comment>
