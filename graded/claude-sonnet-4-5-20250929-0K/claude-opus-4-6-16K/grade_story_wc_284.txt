<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's scarred hands and her decision to trust Kaplan establish embodied motivation with visible cost. Interior states remain concrete and character-particular: the burned forearms, the memory of Dietrich pressing the pillbox into her palm. The final choice to vouchsafe the intelligence to Kaplan is earned by prior causality, though Kaplan remains off-page and abstract, which slightly weakens the relational crucible. Minor therapy-speak seeps in ("unused courage") but does not dominate peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening paragraphs. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren commits to vouchsafing the intelligence to Kaplan, forecloses her solitary survival path, and the final image of walking through the parting mist reweights the premise with felt cost. One meaningful tightening—deciphering the snow-code and choosing Kaplan—advances pressure under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible: she scatters the physical evidence and accepts the risk of re-entering the compromised agency world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bluff, mist, and snowpack are vivid and purposeful: the snow constrains Maren's search (she must count paces, brush away crust) and the thinning spring melt provides the story's central mechanism. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her survival mindset ("mineral and cold, like licking a river stone"). The setting charges the final image: the mist parting as she commits to action. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the climb and plateau search.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: retrieve Dietrich's hidden intelligence and decide whom to trust with it. The discovery of the snow-code is the first tightening; choosing Kaplan over extraction or revenge is the second, and it narrows options with visible cost (she returns to a world that tried to kill her). The escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: decoding the names, scattering the evidence, committing to Kaplan. One persistent constraint—her scarred hands and disavowal—shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of trust and vouchsafing emerges organically from the snow-code mechanism and Maren's choice of Kaplan. "Unused courage" waiting for its season reweights prior material without explicit moralizing. The pillbox and snow become charged motifs that constrain choice (she must decode, then decide) and the final image—walking through the parting mist—offers a resonant answer to the thematic question of whom to trust. Complexity is maintained: Maren's choice is both hope and risk, not a tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Maren's operative mindset: "most of the skin on her forearms," "the agency had disavowed her." Perceptual signature is character-specific (she notices the compass rose "catching light even on days when there was none"). No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Diction stays controlled and voice-motivated; the single register slip ("prudently daring") reads as intentional backstory coloring rather than filter failure. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high: nearly every line advances setting, character state, or the snow-code mystery. One paraphrase loop near the opening ("the agency had disavowed her, two since the fire they'd set to erase her") restates cause without new pressure, triggering a −0.2 deduction. A minor figurative muddle: "the snow remembers what we tell it" borders on precious but remains voice-motivated. No template cadence or scaffold. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The snow-code mechanism transforms the "burned spy" premise into a specific, non-obvious synthesis: intelligence hidden in seasonal melt rather than servers or dead drops. The choice of Kaplan and the vouchsafe frame add fresh moral calculus. However, the "disavowed operative / dead drop / handler's final gift" template is widely used, and while the snow mechanism is inventive, the emotional arc (survival → decision to trust an ally) follows familiar beats. Transformation is partial: swap the snow for another seasonal reveal and the arc holds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren appears throughout, drives every beat, and her final decision to vouchsafe the intelligence to Kaplan alters tactics and forecloses the extraction path. Early signal, beat involvement across the climb and decode, closure linkage, causal pressure, and cost all present. Not a 9+ because Kaplan remains off-page, softening the relational stakes slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pillbox is handled in three distinct beats: pressed into Maren's palm in Tallinn, opened on the bluff to read the coordinates, and closed after she memorizes the names. It enables the snow search and the final decision reweights its meaning (from Dietrich's gift to the vessel she will open for Kaplan). Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection all demonstrated. Specificity: the compass rose motif recurs and the engraving matters.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Fixing what's broken" shapes the dominant stake: Maren retrieves and repairs the network's breach by identifying the traitors and choosing Kaplan to restore integrity. The concept constrains her choice (she cannot simply escape; she must vouchsafe the truth). Appears in setup (disavowal, Dietrich's gift), middle (decoding), and ending (choosing Kaplan). Lyric resonance: the snow "fixing what was broken by preserving the truth" makes the concept explicit and charges the closure image. Cost is legible: re-entering the hostile agency world.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" is labeled once in backstory ("Dietrich had been prudently daring all along") but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. Maren's decision to vouchsafe to Kaplan could be read as prudently daring, but the text does not signal the trait at that beat. Late first appearance (second third), ornamental use, and swappability ("cautiously bold," "carefully audacious") all lower the score. Setup and payoff gates present but middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears early in the pillbox message, recurs in Maren's reflection on the word's meaning, and drives the final decision to bestow the intelligence on Kaplan. The action is irreplaceable: swap "vouchsafe" for "deliver" or "leak" and the thematic resonance and moral calculus collapse. Early signal, beat involvement (Tallinn, bluff reflection, closure), causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all strong. Cost connection: the act forecloses safer paths.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The snow-code mechanism is signaled in setup (Dietrich's cryptic instruction), drives the middle search (Maren counts paces, brushes crust, decodes the grid), and its success enables the closure decision. Mechanics matter: the spring melt's vertical archaeology makes the pattern legible. Early signal, two distinct beats (discovery, decoding), causal pressure, closure linkage, and high irreplaceability. Cost connection: the snow's ephemerality forces urgency. Not a 9+ because the mechanics are explained rather than discovered under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff in mist provides the spatial frame, the snowpack supplies the code substrate, and the mist parting charges the final image. The setting constrains Maren's search (she must navigate by compass, count paces in low visibility) and the seasonal timing matters. Early signal, beat involvement (climb, decode, departure), and closure linkage present. Micro-setting: the snow drift and mist function as tactile resources. Cost connection: the remoteness isolates her choice. Not higher because the bluff itself (vs. any remote plateau) is somewhat swappable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Spring melt timing is signaled early ("the tilt of the earth toward spring"), enables the snow-code reveal (the pattern emerges as the snow thins), and adds thematic resonance (Kaplan's unused courage will have "its season"). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development present in the melt mechanics. Cost connection: the seasonal window implies urgency. Not higher because the timeframe does not tighten decisions beat-to-beat; Maren is not racing a clock on the page. Lyric reprise at closure lifts the score into the 6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Unused courage" is introduced late (final third) in Maren's reflection on Kaplan and drives the closure choice. The motivation is dramatized: she chooses to vouchsafe rather than extract or revenge, accepting risk to restore integrity. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong. Late first appearance (−0.4) and ornamental phrasing ("whose courage waited like these codes in snow") weaken integration. Setup gate missing; middle and payoff present. Cost connection clear: re-entering the hostile world.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Silver hush" and mist-soaked tone pervade the opening, middle search, and closure image (the mist parting). Tone modulates subtly with pressure: the climb is deliberate and quiet, the decoding focused, the final commitment resolves into motion. The tone charges the final image: "She walked through" gains resonance from the established atmospheric stillness. Early signal, coherence across beats, and closure linkage all present. Not higher because the tone remains largely static (one mood sustained) rather than dynamically shifting under escalation.</comment>
