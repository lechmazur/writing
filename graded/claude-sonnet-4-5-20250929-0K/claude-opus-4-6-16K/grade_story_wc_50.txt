<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's interiority is consistently rendered through embodied perception ("her hands trembled," "eyes were wet") and her motivation to "store wonder in the cellar of reason" drives concrete action with the timer mechanism. The contradiction between her rational approach and the emotional response ("her eyes were wet") acts simultaneously in scene rather than alternating. The final choice to pack her tools and leave carries visible cost—she departs with "extraordinary data" but also tears, foreclosing further wonder-gathering in favor of catalogued knowledge. Minor: the "reflective by nature" summary in paragraph two leans toward tell, though it's brief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates sensory data, reflections, and echoes that deepen through pattern and cadence shift rather than causal reversal. Orientation anchors (Sable, marble cavern, kneeling at center with tools) land by line three. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Sable packs her tools and departs, crystallizing the tension between wonder and reason; the final image—"the word 'wonder' was still arriving"—reweights her entire project with conceptual cost (she leaves while the phenomenon she sought to master persists, unchartable). The felt cost is legible: she climbs back "carrying her broken timer and her extraordinary data," having stored wonder but not possessed it, and the cavern "would hold" her tears and the echo "long after." One meaningful deepening occurs when "Wonder" returns transformed into "the state of wondering that has no end," shifting her stakes from mastery to acknowledgment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern constrains Sable's method: she must study "reflection angles at different times of day" because "the angles changed as the sun moved, and the echoes changed with them." The timer mechanism functions as micro-setting, its "uneven lurches" mapping the cavern's temporal pockets. The candle flame and its reflections ("light split across seven surfaces") are handled tactically to predict echo arrival. The final image charges setting detail: the cavern "breathed out" and holds her tears and the word "wonder" indefinitely, making the space's temporal properties undeniable at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Sable intends to "reverse-engineer" the broken timer to "map the cavern's strange temporal pockets" and convert wonder into reason. One meaningful tightening occurs when "Wonder" returns as "the state of wondering that has no end"—a conjugation English lacks—forcing her to confront the limits of her cataloguing project. The escalation is textural (density and cadence shift) rather than causal, fitting the inferred lens. Agency is visible: she chooses her final word carefully, tracks the reflection, and then packs her tools, foreclosing further experiment with on-page cost (tears, departure while the echo persists). The price is felt and conceptual: her data is "extraordinary" but the phenomenon exceeds her framework.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between Sable's intention ("store wonder in the cellar of reason") and the cavern's refusal to be catalogued. The broken timer's imperfection becomes thematic: failure enables understanding, yet the understanding remains incomplete. The final image offers a non-literal answer: she departs with data and tears while "the word 'wonder' was still arriving," suggesting that wonder persists beyond rational capture. No moralizing; the story resists tidy resolution by leaving the echo unfinished. The tears and packed tools embody the cost of choosing documentation over immersion, charging the thematic question without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable throughout; POV modesty is strong ("she could not explain," "she recognized this feeling"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: Sable notices reflection angles, timer clicks, and "the moment before a lock gives way." Diction stays within her idiom—locksmith and methodical—without register drift. Free indirect style is clean: "She feared nothing that could be understood" blends narrator summary with her worldview. Minor friction: "the kind of woman who opened doors for others and then stood in the threshold wondering what the opening meant" in paragraph two tilts slightly toward authorial summary rather than emerging from scene, though it's brief and voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or the echo experiment. Rhythm varies purposefully; the uneven timer clicks ("three, five, nine") mirror syntactic variation in key beats. "Peripherally focused, her attention soft at the edges" and "the bent escapement struggling" show concrete, image-driven prose without filler. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language ("autumn bleeding into something colder," "sound and light were married") is integrated and voice-appropriate without overwriting peak beats. The final line's compression—"the word 'wonder' was still arriving"—lands with clarity and resonance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmithing, temporal acoustics, and a broken timer as measurement tool feels specific and non-obvious. Sable's profession shapes her worldview ("every inexplicable thing was simply a lock she hadn't yet learned to pick") without becoming mere quirk. The cavern's rule—echoes return transformed in tense and meaning—is fresh and consistently applied. The transformation test passes: swapping names or replacing the timer with a generic tool would flatten the stakes, as her locksmith lens and the timer's imperfection are integral to the closure's charge. Risk-taking is moderate but effective: the accumulative structure and conjugation device ("the state of wondering that has no end") heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable appears in setup (paragraph one), drives middle beats (choosing words, adjusting the timer, tracking reflections), and makes the closure choice (packing tools, departing with tears). Her reflective nature shapes her method: "peripherally focused" attention and the decision to leave while the echo persists. Her choices—selecting "Wonder" carefully, logging intervals, recognizing "the moment before a lock gives way"—create key turns in understanding and stake the final renunciation. The trait "reflective by nature" constrains her approach (observation over immersion) and charges the ending cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timer is handled in setup (spread across her leather roll, salvaged three towns back), used actively in middle beats (she adjusts the bent wheel with pliers, counts clicks to measure intervals), and present at closure ("carrying her broken timer"). Its imperfection is causally relevant: the "uneven lurches" map the cavern's temporal pockets, and the specific click counts (seven, fourteen, "three, five, nine") vary with each echo's transformation. The timer's failure enables understanding rather than measurement, charging the thematic tension. Swapping it for a generic clock would weaken specificity but not break the plot; its recurring symbolic weight (broken tool for mapping broken time) elevates integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The harvest of echoes is present in setup (paragraph three: "Words spoken here returned… carrying different weight, different meaning"), drives middle beats (Sable speaks three words and tracks their transformed returns), and charges closure ("the word 'wonder' was still arriving"). It shapes stakes and tactics: Sable's entire project depends on predicting when and how echoes will return, and the concept's mechanics (tense transformation, temporal lag) force her method. The final conjugation—"the state of wondering that has no end"—demonstrates the concept's irreducibility and forecloses her cataloguing goal. The element's causal pressure is strong; removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" appears in setup as a named trait and is demonstrated in the middle beat: "her attention soft at the edges the way it had to be when listening for something that didn't want to be caught directly." It enables her method (watching the candle flame "from the corner of her eye") and constrains direct observation. The trait does not create visible cost or a tradeoff on the page; it functions as consistent characterization rather than a dilemma. Swapping "peripherally focused" for "patient" or "oblique" would not alter the closure, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Reverse-engineer" is signaled in setup (paragraph four: "She intended to reverse-engineer the device—not to fix it, but to understand its failure") and governs her middle-beat actions (adjusting the bent wheel, counting clicks, logging intervals). It frames her goal and method, though the actual reverse-engineering is shown through observation and adjustment rather than a climactic disassembly. The closure turn (packing tools, departing with data) traces to this action: she has reverse-engineered the timer's interaction with the cavern's echoes but cannot reverse-engineer wonder itself. Removing "reverse-engineer" would require reframing her technical approach, but a near-synonym like "analyze" could substitute with moderate edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Studying reflection angles is introduced in setup (paragraph five: "by studying reflection angles at different times of day… she could predict where an echo would land and when it would arrive") and used actively in middle beats ("she watched the candle flame" and "tracked the candlelight splitting across seven surfaces"). The method's mechanics matter: changing sun angles alter echo behavior, and the seven reflections carry sound fragments that "assembled" the final echo. It shapes her attempts and enables the "Wonder" experiment's payoff. The method is specific and irreplaceable; removing it would require a different predictive system, though the closure's emotional charge does not hinge on this exact technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The marble cavern is present in setup (title phrase, first line: "The marble cavern breathed in colors no one had named"), pressures middle choices (the "veined marble walls" create the echo effect, and Sable positions herself and the candle based on cave geometry), and charges closure (the cavern "would hold" her tears and the word "wonder" indefinitely). Its physical properties—polished stone throwing light in ribbons, crystalline structure wedding sound and light—are integral to Sable's method and the story's stakes. The setting supplies the phenomenon she seeks to map and ultimately resists her framework. Removing the cavern would collapse the entire premise; it is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the lull of a wounded season, autumn bleeding into something colder and less certain" appears in setup (paragraph two) as lyrical framing but does not tighten on-page decisions. The phrase signals duration and mood yet remains vague; no clock or seasonal constraint alters Sable's tactics in the cavern. The reflection-angle method depends on "times of day" (morning versus afternoon light), which relates loosely to seasonal slant, but the "wounded season" itself is ornamental. A clearer temporal pressure (e.g., fading daylight forcing a final attempt) would elevate integration; as written, the element is present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is stated in setup (paragraph three) and dramatized throughout: Sable brings notebooks, adjusts the timer, logs data, and ultimately packs her tools while crying. Friction between wonder and reason is embodied at closure: she departs with "extraordinary data" yet her eyes are wet, and the phenomenon persists beyond her capture. The desire is conflicted in choices—she recognizes "the moment before a lock gives way" yet cannot reduce wonder to a lock. The cost is visible: tears, departure, the knowledge that "the word 'wonder' was still arriving" after she leaves. Strong causal and thematic integration; removing this exact phrasing would weaken but not break the story.</comment>
