<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular—her bone-setting intuition guides both her profession and her navigation of the maze. The yearning that opens after finding the tooth is embodied through her professional vocabulary ("the logic of things that wanted to be whole") rather than abstract epiphany. Internal contradiction is present: decades of skepticism clash with emergent belief, and her decision to follow the changeling shows a meaningful shift earned by the tooth's physical proof. The changeling child's "shrewdly innocent" expression and her motivation are somewhat告知 rather than fully dramatized in contradictory action, keeping this just below the 8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with lyric undertones: the tooth discovery motivates maze entry, navigation by bone-setting intuition earns the garden arrival, and the changeling's offer creates the final choice with cost (following deeper means accepting unknown consequences). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. Closure is Charged Poise—Maren's hand closes on the tooth and she follows "where the oldest mistakes grew into light," crystallizing her acceptance of a larger, uncertain world; the path home "became something new" signals irreversible change. Cost is felt in the foreclosure of her old certainty. One meaningful tightening occurs when the maze yields to her touch, narrowing options toward the confrontation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The garden's specificity—foxglove beside luminescent moss, ivy "wired with something that hummed"—creates a layered temporal quality that supports the nostalgic-innovation tone. The hedge maze functions as an active constraint: it "tried to confuse her" and she navigates by bone-setting intuition, making setting integral to her capability and choice. The tooth as micro-object charges both the opening examination and the final image when she closes her hand around it "one last time." Spatial choreography is clean throughout (village → Hargrove estate → maze → garden center), and the final detail—"the hedge maze quietly rearranged itself"—reconfigures the world's rules in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: after the changeling discovery, Maren's forty-year certainty cracks and she must decide whether to pursue this opening. The maze navigation provides one meaningful tightening—her bone-setting skill becomes the key to passage, narrowing her path. The changeling's condition ("you have to forgive what you find") raises the cost explicitly, and Maren's choice to follow forecloses her old epistemology with visible weight. Agency is clear: her decision to enter the maze and then to follow the child deeper are protagonist-driven. The price—accepting a world where "every mistake" might matter differently—is articulated and felt, though the actual consequences remain off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the changeling's tooth (grown, not made) bridges the impossible and tangible, and Maren's bone-setting becomes a metaphor for "holding both sides" of a fractured reality without becoming heavy-handed. The final image—"oldest mistakes grew into light" and the path home "became something new"—offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question of whether belief and forgiveness can transform grief, avoiding moral summary. The nostalgic-innovation pairing is carried through imagery (centuries-old garden layered with "modern machines" hum) rather than asserted. Subtext operates in the changeling's confession ("I leave things behind so people will come looking") and Maren's quiet kneeling, which conveys recognition without exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Maren; perceptual signature is distinct and professional—she reads the stock's structure "the way she would assess a broken arm" and navigates by "the logic of things that wanted to be whole." Psychic distance modulates purposefully: intimate during the tooth examination, pulling back slightly for the maze crossing, then closing in for the final exchange. The changeling's dialogue ("I leave things behind so people will come looking") carries subtext and goal, and her phrasing is distinct from Maren's interior voice. One brief filter cluster in the opening ("She did not trust") is voice-appropriate and does not dull immediacy. Prose rhythm shifts with pressure: short, declarative beats during the examination; longer, more reflective cadences in the garden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information density is high—most sentences advance character, image, or pressure without padding. Sentence variety supports rhythm: the opening complex sentence establishes Maren's duality, then shorter beats drive the examination and discovery. Figurative language is purposeful and embodied in her profession ("cartilage remembering its shape," "grief they swallowed until it calcified"). Two minor slips: "the cool air of a larger room she had always refused to enter" borders on abstractness, and "shrewdly innocent" in the child's first description is slightly tell-heavy. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence. The final line—"the path home became something new"—recharges the journey motif with fresh weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—skeptic bone-setter uses her craft to navigate a fairy maze—synthesizes folklore and craft knowledge in a specific, non-obvious way. The changeling's tooth as both enamel proof and signature is a fresh detail that earns the turn. Emotional specificity (yearning framed as "the version of the world where…mistakes…could be turned into constellations") avoids platitude. The garden's layered eras (foxglove + luminescent moss + machine hum) creates a textured innovation rather than generic fantasy. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on bone-setting as both skill and metaphor. Risk-taking in the nostalgic-innovation tone is coherent but not bold enough to push higher; the changeling encounter, while well-executed, follows familiar fairy-bargain structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's forgiving-skeptic nature is established in the opening sentence and drives two key choices: her willingness to examine the changeling stock despite disbelief, and her decision to follow the child despite uncertainty. Her forgiveness is dramatized when she kneels and speaks gently ("You left your tooth behind") and again when she accepts the condition to "forgive what you find." Her skepticism persists in her navigation method (trusting only what she can feel). The character trait shapes the ending directly—only a forgiving skeptic would close her hand on the impossible tooth and follow. Early signal, two distinct beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tooth appears in three functional beats: discovery during examination (she pulls it free and recognizes it as grown enamel), carried through the maze (motivating her journey), and closed in her palm at the moment of final choice ("one last time" before following). Its physical properties matter—ridged enamel "grown, not made" provides the proof that cleaves her certainty. The tooth is causally active: it prompts the maze entry and is present in the closure image, reweighting from evidence to talisman. Irreplaceable: no generic object could provide the same proof of the changeling's nature. Early signal, beat involvement across three moments, causal pressure, and closure linkage all strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "cleft in certainty" is introduced immediately after the tooth discovery ("Maren felt the first cleft in her certainty she had known in forty years") and shapes her entire arc. It drives the decision to enter the maze—she yearns for "the version of the world where...every mistake...could be turned into constellations." The concept widens when she reaches the garden ("The cleft in her certainty widened, and instead of fear she felt the cool air of a larger room"). It constrains tactics: she must navigate by feel rather than rational mapping. The final line's transformation ("the path home became something new") is the cleft's consequence—irreversible epistemological change. Early signal, shapes middle choice, and charges ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" describes the changeling child's expression when Maren first sees her: "old knowledge wearing the costume of youth, watching to see whether this human would scream or speak." The trait enables the child's test—she speaks with calculated simplicity ("I leave things behind so people will come looking") that forces Maren to interpret motive. It constrains the exchange: the child must maintain the appearance of youth while revealing ancient purpose, creating tension in her offer. The attribute is present in setup and shapes one key interaction but is somewhat label-reliant rather than fully embodied in contradictory action, keeping it mid-band. Cost is implied (Maren must trust despite manipulation) but not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Yearn" is introduced at the tooth discovery: "she began to yearn. Not for belief exactly, but for the version of the world where her grandmother's stories were maps rather than madness." This yearning directly motivates her entry into the maze—she carries "a lantern in one hand and the tooth in the other," both practical and symbolic acts driven by desire. The yearning reframes her profession: setting bones becomes a model for "holding both sides" of fractured reality. It's present in the final choice to follow the child into deeper mystery. Early signal, causal pressure on two beats (maze entry, following the child), and thematic integration. Swappable with "hope" or "curiosity" only with loss of the specific constellation metaphor that defines her desire.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bone-setting is established as Maren's profession and epistemology in the opening: "she trusted the things she could feel beneath her fingers: the clean snap of a fracture finding its true line." The method is used actively in the examination beat—she turns the stock's limbs "the way she would assess a broken arm." Most crucially, bone-setting provides the logic for maze navigation: "she navigated it the way she navigated a shattered wrist: by feel, by the logic of things that wanted to be whole." The method enables success where rational mapping would fail. At the garden's center, the metaphor completes: "something broken between worlds, waiting for hands patient enough to hold both sides." Present across three beats, causally active in the maze, and thematically charged at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The secret garden is introduced via backstory (grandmother's stories, two centuries of sealing), signaled at the maze entry, and revealed at midpoint. The garden's wildness and layered eras—foxglove, luminescent moss, humming ivy—create the nostalgic-innovation atmosphere that supports tone. It supplies the changeling child, making it the resource that enables closure. The garden's properties constrain choice: Maren must accept its impossibility (plants that pulse like breathing, ivy wired with machine-sound) to proceed. The final beat uses the garden's depth ("deeper into the garden where the oldest mistakes grew into light") as the literal and thematic destination. Setup, development as location of confrontation, and closure participation all present. The maze's rearrangement in the final line extends the setting's agency.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the substitute body is found" is established in the opening: "after eleven months" of glamour rot, the changeling is discovered, Maren is called, and she acts "tonight." The eleven-month duration adds weight to the discovery—long deception now exposed. The "tonight" framing creates urgency: Maren moves immediately from examination to maze entry, and the sequence reads as continuous. Time pressure is implicit in the changeling's waiting ("Most never do" come looking) and in the hedge maze's active resistance. The final line's past-tense summary suggests forward motion without specifying duration. Timeframe is present, creates urgency, and shapes the decision to act immediately, but the clock is not tracked granularly in the maze or garden.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn mistakes into constellations" is introduced when Maren yearns for "the version of the world where every mistake her family had made...could be turned into constellations, bright and navigable, pointing toward something that still mattered." This desire drives her maze entry—she seeks transformation of grief into meaning. The motivation faces friction: to pursue it, she must abandon forty years of skepticism and risk discovering something she cannot accept. At the garden's center, the changeling's condition—"you have to forgive what you find"—tests whether Maren will pay the cost of her yearning. The final image ("where the oldest mistakes grew into light") literalizes the constellation metaphor as closure. Early signal, shapes two choices (entry, following), and closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Nostalgic-innovation tone is established through imagery: the garden pairs foxglove (old) with luminescent moss and humming ivy "halfway between a lullaby and a frequency she associated with modern machines." The opening's fairy-light skepticism and grandmother-story framing invoke nostalgia, while the stock's "craftsmanship that no local hand could claim" introduces uncanny precision. Tone is coherent through pressure: Maren's bone-setting (ancient craft) navigates via logic (modern rationality), and her final choice braids acceptance of old stories with new understanding. The maze's quiet rearrangement at the end—both ancient and responsive—cements the fusion. Tone modulates from skeptical examination to yearning exploration to charged acceptance, supporting escalation. The final image's pairing ("oldest mistakes grew into light") crystallizes the nostalgic-innovation fusion without labeling it.</comment>
