<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maret's interiority is concrete and specific—counting silence, reading the flute's warmth, tracking the Lament's crossing—and her micro-choices (arranging markers, choosing to step through) reveal a consistent hierarchy of values. The backstory anchors in present perception (the flute's warmth, the remembered tearing sound) and shifts her stance from stripped keeper to active searcher. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between reverence for the relics and her willingness to pursue the lost one alone, but the contradiction could press harder in a single on-page choice. The final step-through carries visible cost (leaving her world), yet the choice feels pre-determined rather than torn from competing impulses in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of crossings (eleven prior, this the twelfth) and builds density through layered detail (markers, flute mechanics, the other-world's copper taste) that reweights the dominant stake—recovering the Lament and answering its caller. Orientation anchors early (Maret, ridgeline, post-guardianship). Closure is a Charged Poise: she steps through with the Lament visible below, the cost felt in the phrase "and it waited for her return"—the return is now uncertain, the stakes crystallized. The lens holds; the final image reconfigures her quest from passive failure to active pursuit with cost. One meaningful deepening (the ninth crossing taught her the caller's identity; today she answers) tightens options and charges the step-through.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range is established early and constrains choice: its silence is a pressure Maret counts, the scree slope and glacial lake supply the driftwood markers essential to her method, and the ridgeline is the crossing threshold. Sensory detail (copper taste, luminous stone, pale wood against granite) is purposeful and filtered through Maret's trained perception. The micro-setting—body, flute, and markers—drives the step-through and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (scree slope to cairn to ridgeline). The setting's "avalanchingly quiet" atmosphere supports tone and stakes without becoming ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: recover the Lament and confront its caller. Signaled early ("she had come… to harvest insights") and tightened by the revelation that the Lament was called (crossing seven) and today she will answer. Agency is clear—Maret arranges markers, plays the flute, steps through—and the step forecloses her prior world with the cost legible in "waited for her return." One meaningful tightening (from study to confrontation) narrows options under the Accumulative lens. No antagonist appears on the page, but the absent caller and the lost relic generate coherent pressure. The price (uncertain return) is felt, not just declared.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—failure as an open door, learning from loss rather than retreating—emerges from Maret's specific actions (building markers, crossing eleven times, stepping through today) without direct statement. The driftwood markers and the flute function as particulars that shift meaning: markers encode her method and pull her back, the flute opens the boundary. The final image (the range holding "silence like a breath, like a promise, like the space between one world and the next") reweights the opening's "avalanchingly quiet" from oppressive to charged with potential. No overt moralizing; the resolution invites reflection on what it costs to walk through failure's door. The piece resists tidy closure—return is uncertain—embracing complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maret; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—she counts silence, reads atmospheric pressure from clouds and knee aches, filters the other-world through tactile and sensory detail. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "avalanchingly quiet," "a sound like fabric tearing underwater," "the air tasting of copper and rain." Psychic distance tightens naturally at the step-through without filter clutter. No dialogue to judge. The prose reflects Maret's disciplined mind (arranging, encoding, tracking) and her reverence (holding the flute "firmly, with the fingers slightly trembling"). Free indirect style is clean; no register drift or unmotivated lexical shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high—nearly every line advances setting, interiority, or the crossing mechanics. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language ("silence pressing down like packed snow before the break," "the air opened like a page being turned") is coherent and voice-motivated, not overwritten. Minor scaffold in "She had been the youngest… the first to lose" (efficient backstory) but it serves momentum. Grammar and tense are clean; pronoun references unambiguous. The final line's triple simile ("like a breath, like a promise, like the space") is controlled and charges the closure without muddle. Zero loops, high propulsion, no artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—relic keeper crosses between worlds to recover a lost charge—transforms a familiar frame (portal fantasy, redemption quest) through specific lived detail: driftwood markers as navigational encoding, the flute's warmth as sensory memory, the Lament called rather than lost. The choice to step through grows inevitably from eleven prior crossings. Emotional complexity (reverence vs. determination, failure vs. pursuit) avoids safety-hedging. The world logic (crossings respond to intent, markers pull her back) is introduced organically. The synthesis of portal mechanics and failure-as-teacher theme feels coherent, though the "youngest keeper, first to lose a charge" setup leans toward archetype without full transformation into irreplaceable particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maret's choices (arranging markers, uncasing the flute, stepping through) create the key turn at closure. Setup is early (appointed keeper, lost the Lament). Development: she encodes crossings via markers and decides today to answer the caller. Payoff: the step-through is the climactic action. Two distinct beats (marker arrangement, step-through) and causal pressure (her study narrows to confrontation). Swappability is low—her keeper training and crossing experience are specific. Cost connection: the step forecloses return certainty. Mid-high band; strong involvement but the choice feels pre-loaded rather than torn in the moment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: the flute rests "warm even through the hide" in paragraph three. Development: she holds it at the ridgeline, noting its gleam and river-pattern gold leaf. Payoff: she plays it to open the crossing, the note folds inward, and the air opens. Three beats (carrying, examining, playing). Causal pressure is clear—no flute, no crossing. Closure linkage is direct: the playing triggers the step-through. Specificity: "gilded reed," warmth, breath memory. Cost connection: using it charges the crossing with risk. Solid integration; the flute is essential but its mechanics could constrain a middle choice more tightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "weave between worlds" is stated early; crossings are described ("folded inward," "luminous stone"). Development: the other-world's properties (copper taste, luminous stone) shape her method (markers needed). Payoff: she steps through. The concept shapes stakes (recovering the Lament) and tactics (markers, flute) on the page. Two gates (setup, payoff) plus weak middle involvement. Causal pressure: the boundary-thinning determines her method. Specificity: the concept is named and shown. Swappability is low. Mid-band; present across beats but development beat is thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "avalanchingly quiet" opens the story and is tracked ("fourteen days," "each absence of sound pressing down"). Payoff: the final paragraph reprises it ("held its silence like a breath"). Development: implied—the silence creates urgency but does not visibly constrain a middle action with cost. Two gates (setup, payoff). The trait charges tone and frames the quest but does not force a tactical trade-off on the page. Lyric reprise reweights the stake (silence becomes charged potential). Mid-band; purposeful but not mechanically essential to a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: uncasing occurs at the ridgeline in paragraph nine. Payoff: she plays the flute, the air opens, she steps through. The action is the hinge of the closure beat. Causal pressure: uncasing → playing → crossing. Specificity: the gilded reed, the note that "did not echo," the air opening "like a page." Cost connection: the act commits her to the crossing. Irreplaceability: no other action triggers the boundary opening. High band; the uncasing and playing are indispensable to the closure, though the uncasing itself is brief.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: driftwood markers introduced in paragraph two; she arranges the third cairn. Development: "directional markers… for herself, when she would need to find her way back." Payoff: she places "the last driftwood marker—pointing home" before stepping through. Two beats (arranging, final placement) and causal role (enables return navigation). Specificity: "pale wood against dark granite," directional encoding. Cost connection: without markers, return is impossible. Swappability is low. Mid-band; present and functional but the mechanics (how markers pull her back from "beyond the veil") are asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: Thunder-echo range anchored in the opening line. Development: scree slope, glacial lake (supplies driftwood), ridgeline (crossing threshold). Payoff: the range "held its silence… and waited for her return." The setting supplies resources (driftwood), pressures choice (silence, ridge as threshold), and charges the final image. Three beats (lake, slope/cairn, ridgeline). Causal pressure: no lake/driftwood, no markers; no ridgeline, no crossing site. Closure linkage: the range's waiting reconfigures the silence from oppressive to charged. Strong integration; essential to method and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup: "After the guardianship ended" anchors the frame early. Development: the time since (fourteen days of silence, eleven prior crossings) creates cumulative pressure but does not tighten a single choice. Payoff: "today she meant to answer that caller." Two gates (setup, payoff). The timeframe contextualizes her quest but does not function as a live clock that narrows options in the moment. Cost is implied (she's been stripped, exiled) but the temporal pressure is backstory rather than a countdown. Mid-low band; functional context, not a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "to harvest insights from failure" stated in paragraph four. Development: crossings one, four, seven, nine each taught her something; today's crossing acts on accumulated knowledge. Payoff: she steps through to answer the caller. The motivation is dramatized through repeated action (eleven crossings) and the final choice. Two beats (study, confrontation). Causal pressure: her desire drives method (markers, crossings) and the step-through. Cost connection: the step forecloses safety. Friction: the motivation is more told ("she meant to answer") than shown via a torn choice. Solid integration but short of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: "canyon hush," "avalanchingly quiet" establish tone in the opening. Development: tone modulates through "stripped," "folded inward," "copper-tasting dark." Payoff: "held its silence like a breath, like a promise." Coherent through turns; the hush is oppressive early, charged at the end. The tonal shift reweights the silence from weight to potential. Closure linkage is direct. Specificity: the similes and sensory detail sustain the tone. Strong integration; the tone charges the final image and supports the Accumulative lens.</comment>
