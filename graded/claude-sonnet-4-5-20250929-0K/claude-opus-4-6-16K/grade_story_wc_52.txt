<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marguerite's grief work is embodied through concrete action—sharpening the knife, selecting strokes, placing the finished lion—with clear internal contradiction between drowning and containment. The carving session delivers a credible micro-choice with visible cost: she surrenders the illusion of control to make space she can survive. Minor slip: "hauntingly practical strokes" edges toward label-speak where the prose could trust the dramatized action. The renunciation is earned and forecloses magical-thinking paths with on-page weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (widow, loft, Arles, eleven months post-death). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through sensory density and the kettle's live deadline, then shifts at the scream into a cadence of acceptance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marguerite completes the carving, drinks the tea, and crystallizes her stance—grief as rhythm, not tragedy—with visible cost (the year of drowning, now contained). The final image reweights "here and gone" from wound to peace. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight, kettle hum, and loft interior constrain the scene's live pressure and charge the final image. Sensory detail—lanolin/sawdust/musk, amber light, tobacco ghost—filters through Marguerite's attention hierarchy and is purposefully withheld until the carving invokes memory. The rough lion on the sill catches "rain-light…the color of rust, of dried blood, of autumn, of peace," directly reweighting prior material. The body (hands dusted with ash wood) and recurring object (kettle) combine to function as micro-setting that alters tactics and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: contain the uncontainable through a bounded ritual. The kettle deadline imposes live pressure; Marguerite's agency is choice and endurance—she begins carving, persists through memory flickers, and completes the rough lion before the scream. One meaningful tightening: the accumulation of "here and gone" fragments narrows her options to either continue drowning or press grief into form. The cost is visible—she foreclosed magical reunion and accepted the rhythm—and the final tea-drinking stance crystallizes that trade-off under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: containment (lion-taming lesson), the kettle ritual, and the carving's rough honesty. "Here and gone" shifts from wound (his laugh, his step) to peace (steam rising, rhythm of life) without a stated moral. The final image—tea, dusted hands, unfinished lion—offers a resonant answer to grief's borders through specific objects and accepts ambiguity (the lion is "not beautiful…honest"). No thematic echo or late moralizing; the reweighting is earned by prior sensory and conceptual density.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight focus on Marguerite; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during carving, pulling back slightly for the tea). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices lanolin, rust light, the shape of Theodor's feet in boots—widow-specific filters. Diction remains character-particular ("practicality had become her art form") with brief elevation ("reliquary holds bones") that reads voice-motivated rather than authorial intrusion. One micro slip: "through crystallized time" risks register mismatch, but the phrase is used once and does not recur to become a tic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high—most lines do dual work (advance carving and memory). Minor scaffold: "She had learned this from Theodor himself, who had always said" and "She thought of his hands, how they smelled" use slightly generic stems, but not enough to loop or stall. The figurative cluster in paragraph six ("crystallized time…amber weight…reliquary holds bones") borders on density overload in a reflective beat, yet remains legible and the closure image is clean. No paraphrase loops; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—widow carves to contain grief while the kettle boils—synthesizes ritual, craft, and deadline into a specific, non-obvious frame. The lion-taming metaphor (fear poured into a steady vessel) transforms stock grief tropes through occupational detail and embodied action. The rough honesty of the finished lion and the "here and gone" rhythm avoid sentimentality. Minor swappability: the kettle could be replaced with another timer without fundamental breakage, lowering irreplaceability slightly. Risk-taking (accumulative lens, quiet closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the ending feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marguerite (lion tamer's widow) drives every on-page choice: purchasing the blank, sharpening the knife, beginning the carving, and placing the finished lion. Her widow status supplies the stake (containment vs. drowning) and the lion-taming metaphor that shapes her tactic. She is present in setup, middle action, and closure. The character is causally indispensable and her decisions create the story's sole turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ash wood blank is purchased after the funeral (setup), handled and carved across multiple beats (middle development), and placed on the windowsill where light reweights it at closure ("rust…dried blood…autumn…peace"). Its pale smoothness, yielding texture under the blade, and rough final form are irreplaceable specifics. Removing it breaks the story's logic and closure image. The element accumulates pressure and transforms meaning across all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Here and gone" shapes stakes (memory's rhythm vs. drowning) and tactics (the bounded kettle window). It recurs as a lived constraint in paragraph five (his laugh, his step, the silence) and is repriced at closure in the steam's vanishing and the final realization that this is "not a tragedy but a rhythm." The concept constrains Marguerite's on-page choices and charges the ending with conceptual cost. Strong integration with minor swappability: another ephemerality phrase could function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" appears as a descriptor for her carving strokes and is dramatized through mending costumes, filing claims, and sharpening the knife—practicality as her art form after Theodor's death. The trait constrains her method (deliberate cuts, not artistic flourishes) and enables the carving's completion. It is set up early, applied in the middle action, and informs the closure image (unfinished lion, honest rather than beautiful). Slightly label-reliant; stronger showing would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The action "contain" anchors the story: Theodor's lion-taming lesson ("contain the animal's fear"), Marguerite's stated goal ("contain something—press the uncontainable"), and the closure realization (emptiness has form and edges she can survive). It drives the carving tactic, narrows her options, and is reweighted at the end when containment shifts from struggle to rhythm. Removing "contain" dismantles the story's causal spine and thematic closure. The verb is indispensable across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through crystallized time" is named once in paragraph six as a descriptor for the kettle-measured ceremony; the method is signaled (the ritual window, amber weight of seconds) and matters insofar as the deadline shapes Marguerite's urgency. It reappears obliquely in the final tea moment. Functional participation in middle and closure, but the phrase itself risks being swappable with "bounded time" or "ritual duration." Strong thematic fit; moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is anchored in paragraph two, supplies the amber rust light that filters through the carving session, and returns at closure when Marguerite stands "beneath the rain-beaded skylight" with dusted hands. The setting pressures her sensory experience (constellation of water, rust-hued warmth) and charges the final image. Theodor's whip and boots deepen the widow context. The loft is causally essential to tone and closure but could be compressed to "loft" without breaking the logic; minor specificity premium for "skylight."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The kettle timeframe is signaled in the opening line ("only these few minutes—the span of water heating from stillness to scream"), tightens pressure across the carving beats, and culminates in "The kettle screamed" as the turn that releases Marguerite into the tea-drinking closure. The live clock alters her tactics (she must finish before the scream) and the scream itself marks the boundary between ritual and acceptance. Indispensable across all three gates with visible cost: the deadline forced containment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to harvest lessons from loss" is stated explicitly in paragraph six ("not to worship, but to harvest lessons from loss") and dramatized through Marguerite's carving—she extracts containment and edges from the wreckage. It drives her choice to begin, persists through the carving, and is repriced at closure when the lesson becomes rhythm rather than instruction. Slight label-reliance lowers the score; the dramatization through carving and tea is strong, but the stated phrase risks being a thematic summary. Still, it constrains her tactic and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" is seeded in paragraph two ("amber and rust…warmth that belonged to neither joy nor sorrow but to something quieter, something settled") and culminates in the final image ("rust, of dried blood, of autumn, of peace"). The tone modulates from mournful inventory (paragraph five's "here and gone" fragments) to the closure's steady acceptance. It charges the final tea moment and the lion on the sill. The tone is coherent, purposeful, and indispensable to the story's emotional arc and thematic closure.</comment>
