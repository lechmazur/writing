<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voss's sensory map-making and nerve-graft particulars ground her perceptual mode throughout. Her motivation—to find her mother and expose covered-up truth—escalates from passive mapping to active plan-building at closure, but the final beat ("She would build a map others could follow") reads as declaration rather than contradictory impulse acting in scene. Interiority is concrete and embodied (fingertips on plating, grafts translating texture), though the vision-beat with her mother and the administrator borders on told summary rather than lived tension. The piece earns a meaningful shift from passive weaving to active accountability with visible cost (the shard is "nearly spent"), but the ending lacks the layered contradiction or mistake-under-pressure that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—data accumulates across vision-crossings until the final vision yields the complete truth and new coordinates. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening graph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Voss shifts from passive mapper to active truth-sharer, and the shard's near-destruction forecloses further passive crossings with visible cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the penultimate vision reveals her mother's deliberate exile and the administrators' coverup, reweighting all prior crossings. The causal chain is linear and motivated; no major breaks. Cost is legible on-page (shard "cold and cracked further, nearly spent") and the stance crystallization is clear, though the final action is stated intent rather than executed move, keeping it just shy of 8.0+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The repair bay's corroded hull plating, severed coolant lines, and cracked viewport anchor spatial choreography and constrain Voss's sensory work. The green glass shard functions as micro-setting, recurring across beats and charging the final image as "cold and cracked further, nearly spent." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (nerve grafts translate texture/temperature into spatial data). The operational-bay vision contrasts vividly with the decommissioned present, and the tarp on grated floor grounds the crossing ritual. The setting shapes choice—Voss must return to this specific bay to access the shard's resonance—but does not impose urgent environmental pressure (no countdown, no intruder) that would tighten tactics further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: discover where her mother went and why the record was sealed. Pressure accumulates across vision-crossings until the penultimate vision delivers both answers and new coordinates, narrowing options to one path forward. The protagonist's agency is clear—she chooses to map passively for nine years, then shifts to active plan-building at closure. The shard's cyclical spontaneity and near-exhaustion impose a ticking constraint. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vision reveals the administrator's coercion and her mother's self-exile, reweighting all prior grief. Cost is visible (shard nearly spent, years of solo grief), and the final stance forecloses passive waiting. No antagonist on-page in present time; pressure is retrospective and internal, which is coherent but limits immediacy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the green shard as key, nerve grafts as sensory translation, cyclical crossings as patient cartography. The withheld-truth motif reweights from personal grief to systemic coverup, and the final image—"universe hummed with directions home"—offers resonance without stating a moral. Her mother's deliberate exile to protect other worlds charges the emotional truth without sentimentality. Subtext operates in the vision-beat (administrator's threat, mother's redirection) and in Voss's internalized "weight of the withheld truth…not crushing, but solid, like ballast." No thematic echo or prompt-language intrusion. The piece invites reflection on complicity, silence, and the cost of love, though the ending's shift to active plan ("build a map others could follow") edges toward articulating its own thesis rather than leaving it fully implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct and character-specific: Voss "listened" through nerve grafts, translating electromagnetic residue into spatial data. Diction ("dense network of nerve grafts threaded beneath her skin," "murmur of half-remembered dreams," "liminal phase") is controlled and voice-consistent, technical but not clinical. The vision-beat shifts to present-tense action ("Her mother stands…is gripping…is telling") for immediacy, then returns to past for framing—a purposeful modulation. No dialogue on-page to judge. Filter verbs appear sparingly and fit the contemplative mode. The prose compresses technical backstory efficiently (slip-drive, parallel universes, cyclical spontaneity) without scaffolding, though "cyclically spontaneous in its activation" verges on expository summary rather than dramatized discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences layer character state, world rule, and plot advancement. Rhythm varies naturally with a few parallel-structure runs ("She could only map—record…note…triangulate") that serve accumulation rather than template cadence. Opening and closing images anchor well. Minor loop: "the hum built. The bay dissolved" could integrate more tightly, and "She was a sensory map maker, one of the last" reads as label-only appositive without immediate scene pressure. The phrase "cyclically spontaneous in its activation" is a conceptual summary rather than concrete observation; "it didn't open on command but on rhythm" clarifies but still abstracts. No major scaffold or synonym churn. Clarity remains strong under the speculative premise, and propulsion holds through the vision-beat climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sensory-mapper protagonist and nerve-graft interface offer a fresh angle on the "lost parent" quest. Parallel-universe crossings as cartographic data-collection (rather than adventure tourism) and the cyclically spontaneous shard mechanic transform familiar SF tropes. The vision-beat revelation—mother's deliberate self-exile to collapse the corridor—earns hindsight inevitability from the fused diagnostic lens and "coordinates that didn't belong to this universe." The repair-bay setting and slip-drive calibration ground the premise in lived-in detail. Risk-taking is moderate: the structure is linear accumulation rather than mosaic experiment, and the ending declares intent rather than executing a bold on-page move. The emotional arc (grief → understanding → action plan) is emotionally truthful but follows a recognizable template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Voss is present throughout; her sensory mapping drives every beat. She makes micro-choices (hold the shard, let herself drift, calibrate grafts for new purpose) and the final decision to "build a map others could follow" shifts from passive to active stance. Setup early, development across vision-beats, payoff in final paragraph. However, most middle action is passive observation during visions; her agency crystallizes only at closure. The nerve-graft specificity and map-making lens are character-particular and irreplaceable. Two gates solid (setup, payoff); middle development is observational rather than choice-driven, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The green glass shard appears in five beats: intro ("pulled from belt pouch"), explanation of its fused origin and hummed coordinates, the crossing ritual ("fingers wrapped around the glass"), post-vision state ("cold and cracked further, nearly spent"), and final pocket ("pocketed the shard"). It is causally essential—without it, no crossings occur—and its near-destruction at closure imposes visible cost and forecloses future passive mapping. Setup early, development in crossing-beat, payoff as spent artifact charging the shift to active plan. Specificity high (fused diagnostic lens, cyclical resonance). Swappability low. Causal pressure strong. Cost connection explicit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" is present as method and metaphor: Voss crosses into parallel-universe versions of the repair bay to triangulate her mother's path. The concept shapes her nine-year quest and the climactic vision's revelation. Setup early ("weaving between worlds the way a cartographer threads survey lines"), development across vision-beats, payoff in final coordinates. However, the weaving is largely backstory summary; on-page we witness one crossing only. The concept frames stakes but does not constrain present tactics—she waits for the shard's cycle rather than navigating competing worlds in real time. Two gates met; middle development is summary rather than live choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" constrains Voss's access to crossings—she cannot command the shard but must predict its eleven-day rhythm and wait for the liminal dream-state. This attribute is explained early and governs the crossing-beat action. It imposes a patience cost (nine years of mapping) and the shard's near-exhaustion at closure ties the attribute to final stakes. Setup present, development implicit (she has learned to predict the cycle), payoff in the exhausted shard. However, the attribute is told rather than dramatized in a failed attempt or mistimed crossing; we do not see her struggle with spontaneity on-page, only its past consequences. Cost connection present but oblique.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Redirect" is the pivotal action in the vision-beat: the administrator demands her mother redirect the slip-drive to open a permanent corridor; she refuses and redirects it at herself instead, collapsing the passage. This action explains the nine-year mystery, redefines the mother as hero rather than victim, and gives Voss new coordinates and moral clarity. Setup in the vision, payoff immediate (truth revealed, map complete). The redirect is irreplaceable—swapping it for "sabotage" or "overload" would lose the mother's agency and protective intent. Causal pressure high; the redirect creates the entire present-day situation. Cost visible (mother's exile, Voss's grief). However, the action occurs in a vision/flashback rather than present-tense choice by the protagonist, capping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Through parallel universes" is the method Voss uses to gather data: each crossing shows a version of the repair bay where her mother still works. The method is explained early, shapes the nine-year quest, and the final vision delivers coordinates to "the corridor's far anchor." Setup early, development across crossings (though only one is dramatized on-page), payoff in new coordinates. The method is essential to the plot—without parallel-universe access, no truth is discoverable—but mechanics are told rather than constrained in action. We do not see Voss navigate universe-differences or adapt her approach; the method is passive observation. Two gates met; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay is the sole setting, present in every beat. It provides the corroded hull plating Voss touches, the cracked viewport admitting light, the grated floor and tarp for the crossing ritual. The bay's decommissioning nine years ago links to her mother's vanishing, and the operational-bay vision contrasts with the present dereliction. Setup immediate, development in vision-beat, payoff as Voss stands and calibrates for new purpose. The setting grounds sensory work and anchors the crossing, but does not impose urgent pressure—no intruder, countdown, or environmental hazard forces a tactical shift. Spatial choreography is clear. Swappability moderate (any mother-associated site could serve). Cost connection weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears once as the liminal phase enabling crossings—Voss must hover between sleep and waking for the shard to pull her consciousness sideways. The timeframe is poetic and atmospheric but does not tighten on-page decisions; we do not see her struggle to enter or maintain the state, nor does the dream-phase impose a countdown. Setup present (paragraph explaining the cycle and liminal requirement), no middle development, minor payoff (she "let herself drift toward the threshold"). The phrase enriches tone but is not causally active. One gate met (setup). Swappability high (any trance or altered state would function).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voss's motivation—"to discover the weight of that withheld truth"—is stated early and drives every beat. She seeks not just the fact of her mother's disappearance but "how heavy it had been for the people who chose silence, and whether that weight justified the years of grief." The vision-beat delivers both answers, and the closure beat shows her internalizing the weight ("not crushing, but solid, like ballast") before shifting to action. Setup early, development across crossings, payoff in the ballast line and new plan. The motivation is character-specific and thematically resonant. However, the "weight" metaphor is articulated rather than embodied in a contradictory choice—she does not face a dilemma where forgiveness and accountability pull against each other on-page. Cost is felt but not tested.</comment>
