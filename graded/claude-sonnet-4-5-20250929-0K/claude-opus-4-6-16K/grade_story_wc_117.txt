<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are clear and rooted in professional identity balanced with maternal desperation. Wren's selective mutism is embodied through concrete gestures (beetle-watching, ear-to-arm listening) rather than clinical labels. The mother's final choice to gift the locket and resume playing shows micro-choices under pressure, though the resolution feels slightly too tidy—Wren's sudden willingness to sing arrives without sufficient internal friction. The embodied emotion (sunflower negotiation with light, door opened after long winter) avoids therapy-speak in most beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, one continuous scene on the ridge, clear who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The eclipse functions as a situational pressure that crystallizes Wren's breakthrough, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration (the child moves from silence to song). The closure lands on the page with visible cost—Elara surrenders the locket, a keepsake she "never left behind"—and the situational lens holds. One meaningful deepening occurs when Wren stops the music and listens to her mother's pulse, linking body to sound.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sage, limestone, Douglas firs, and the eclipse's pewter light are vivid and purposeful. The environment directly constrains the climactic moment: totality creates the "dark and holy" frame that loosens Wren's awe. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately (birds stop, temperature drops, corona blazes) and the final returning light charges the ending. The "dreaming roots" motif recurs with thematic weight. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: will Elara's "ordinary magic" reach Wren's hidden voice? The eclipse tightens pressure by creating a singular environmental window. Wren's agency—stopping the guitar, pressing her ear to Elara's wrist—drives the turn. One visible cost: Elara relinquishes the locket she carried daily. The tightening is sufficient for this length, though the breakthrough feels somewhat convenient rather than fully fought-for.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of "ordinary magic" emerges through concrete action—the guitar's open tuning, the pulse-listening, the returning light—rather than assertion, until the final paragraph explicitly names it twice. That late thematic echo ("It was not a miracle. It was something better: [...] Ordinary magic") undercuts earned resonance with a stated moral. The locket as evidence of beginning and the eclipse as metaphor for hidden/revealed light work through image. The ending otherwise offers a non-literal answer to whether wonder can be nurtured.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly bound to Elara's perceptions ("cautious but bright," "patience had begun to taste like helplessness"). Diction is controlled and distinct: "sunflower negotiates with light," "door opened after a long winter." Wren's two spoken lines—"It's still there" and "Play again?"—feel natural and earned. Distance modulates purposefully during the totality beat. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and most lines carry double duty (setting + emotion, action + theme). However, the final paragraph falls into explicit moralizing ("It was not a miracle. It was something better [...] Ordinary magic. The kind that does not heal all at once but opens a door and leaves it open") that summarizes rather than trusts the image. A minor paraphrase loop: "the sage swayed, and the dreaming roots beneath them held the ridge steady, and the light returned in full" stacks conjunctions without added pressure. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are strong, and figurative language (corona "like a secret told in silver") stays coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The solar-eclipse-as-breakthrough frame is a familiar template (cosmic event triggers emotional healing), and the story does not fully transform it through character-specific invention. The locket, open tuning, and pulse-listening are concrete and particular, yet the arc—mute child finds voice during a celestial wonder—follows a well-worn path. The specificity of music therapy and the "dreaming roots" phrase add texture, but the synthesis feels more competent than surprising. Risk-averse choices (tidy resolution, stated theme) favor safety over boldness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's "mellow" adaptiveness is shown on the page: she tunes to "open tuning that let every strum ring wide and forgiving" and plays "chords that followed the wind." Her decision to bring Wren to the ridge, to keep playing during totality, and to gift the locket are key turns that alter Wren's engagement. Present from the opening, causal across three beats (arrival, eclipse, gift), and shaping the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The locket appears in the opening ("never left behind"), returns in Elara's gesture during totality, and closes the story in Wren's hand as the light returns. Its meaning shifts: from Elara's talisman to evidence Wren can trust. The curl inside catches returning light, charging the final image. Three distinct beats, causal role in the gift decision, and irreplaceability (a generic keepsake would lack the biological link). Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" is named early ("the ordinary magic she believed in") and structures Elara's approach: she "hummed alongside silence" rather than forcing. It shapes her choice to bring Wren to the eclipse and informs the ending's emotional logic. However, the concept is explicitly restated in the final paragraph ("Ordinary magic. The kind that does not heal all at once") rather than trusted to image. On-page stakes are affected, but the late summary lowers score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Softly adaptive" is dramatized in Elara's methods: open tuning, following the wind, watching Wren without crowding. It enables her tactical patience during totality and her decision to offer the locket only after Wren initiates contact. The trait constrains her professional reflex to "force breakthroughs" and creates visible tradeoff—her patience "had begun to taste like helplessness." Present across two beats with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Wren's act of linking—stopping the music, pressing her ear to Elara's pulse—is the story's pivot. It redefines the problem from "will Wren speak?" to "can Wren trust the persistence of connection?" and directly enables the breakthrough. Signaled by the body-turn in the middle, paid off in speech, and irreplaceable: no other action carries this exact causal and thematic weight. Essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The eclipse is signaled early ("she had read about the eclipse"), its mechanics matter (totality at 11:47, corona, darkness, temperature drop), and it creates the pressure window that forces Wren's awe and loosens her response. The shared moment during totality is the story's climax. The method shapes every tactic after 11:40 and charges the final image with returning light. Present in setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is introduced early, described through tactile and olfactory detail (sage between limestone, fir roots), and the "dreaming roots" phrase recurs with thematic weight. The ridge provides the elevation and isolation necessary for the eclipse's full effect. The flat stone where Wren sits and the beetle in the dust ground her attention. The setting pressures the climax by offering totality and constrains the ending by supplying the swaying sage. Three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Beneath the hush of dreaming roots" is a poetic phrase borrowed from the trail guide, mentioned twice but never functioning as a timeframe. It gestures toward depth and hiddenness thematically but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. The actual time anchor is the eclipse countdown (11:40, 11:47), which does create urgency. The prompt element itself is ornamental; the eclipse clock does the real work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to nurture lifelong wonder" is dramatized through her profession, her choice to bring Wren to the ridge, her playing, and her gift of the locket. The friction between this motive and her fear that "ordinary magic was not enough" creates on-page cost. The motivation shapes the eclipse gambit and the final image of Wren singing. Present in setup and payoff, with visible tradeoff (surrendering the keepsake).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is embodied in Elara's "cautious but bright" hope, in Wren's final expression ("cautious and exuberant at once"), and in the tonal balance between tentative hope and breakthrough joy. The tone modulates across beats: professional restraint, eclipse awe, quiet triumph. It charges the final image—"quietly, imperfectly, wonderfully"—without becoming static or sentimental. Coherent and purposeful across the arc.</comment>
