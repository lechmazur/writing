<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's compulsion to count heartbeats embodies her internal state with specificity, and her progression from counting to stopping at closure is earned. The ink-and-shard method shows character-driven ingenuity under pressure. Minor weakness: the reflective passages occasionally drift toward summary ("she'd learned no appeals board would expedite") rather than maintaining embodied present-tense pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story employs a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: heartbeat counting establishes a cadence, the ink-pattern ritual layers texture, and the final cessation of counting delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to release). Orientation anchors cleanly (observatory, post-storm, Maren alone). The cost is legible: she stops counting only after reconstructing her record, foreclosing her former self. One meaningful deepening—her shift from angry appeals to patient analog defragmentation—tightens stakes sufficiently for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The opal dome and snow-laden observatory create atmosphere and the porcelain shard functions as a tactile constraint throughout the ink-pattern work. Spatial choreography (ridge, door, central table, radio equipment, scanner) remains clear. The translucent panels and "cathedral-like" refracted light charge the solace tone at closure. Minor limit: occupational detail (optical pattern recognition, hexadecimal sequences) reads plausible but is not tested under pressure in a way that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring her legal existence—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when the satellite window opens and she must complete the ink patterns within that narrow timeframe. Agency manifests as patient, deliberate action (drawing patterns, guiding ink) rather than confrontation. Cost is visible: she abandons vindication and the woman who trusted systems. The pressure is Accumulative rather than causally reversing, fitting the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: algorithms that believe certificates over pulses, smashed teacup as emblem of fragility, defragmentation as literal and metaphorical reassembly. The final line ("stopped counting") delivers a non-literal answer to the question of how one proves existence when systems erase you. The porcelain shard recurs with reweighted meaning (breaking/reassembling). No overt moralizing; the conceptual repricing (human presence vs. database record) charges the ending without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice is distinct: precise, technical diction ("hexadecimal sequence," "ionosphere") matches Maren's methodical mindset. The counting motif and terse sentence rhythms reflect her compression under pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during ink work, slightly wider during backstory). Minor issue: a few filter verbs ("she felt the solace") could be tighter, though they don't disrupt immediacy significantly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong information density and rhythm variation. Opening and closing images anchor effectively ("buried eye" / "stopped counting"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Metaphors are coherent (snow as burial, opal as eye, ink as blood/identity). Minor scaffold: "Each beat was evidence. Each beat was rebellion" approaches template parallelism but serves thematic purpose and doesn't obscure causality. Peak beats remain clear and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The collision of analog/digital, bureaucratic death, and patient ink-pattern hacking offers a fresh angle. The opal observatory and porcelain-shard tool are specific and non-obvious. The transformation test holds: swapping names/places would lose the precise blend of digital purgatory and optical-scanner workaround. Risk-taking is moderate (accumulative structure, quiet ending) and succeeds without obscuring clarity. Slight conventionality in the "legally dead protagonist" frame, though execution elevates it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's status as a death-certificate survivor frames every choice: her compulsion to count, her shift from appeals to analog workarounds, her final cessation of counting. Present in setup, middle tactics, and closure. The element is causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The porcelain shard appears in three beats: kept after smashing the teacup (backstory anchor), used to guide ink across the grid (middle work), and pressed into ink for the final pattern. Its curved edge and jagged-aftermath metaphor charge the closure. Specific, irreplaceable tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Digital ghost" is signaled early (locked out of accounts, algorithms believing the certificate) and shapes all tactics (analog workaround, ink patterns interpreted as data). It reweights the ending: she transitions from ghost to living record. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Heartbeat counting appears in every section, constrains her mental state, and enables the rebellion-as-proof tactic. The cessation of counting at closure ("stopped counting") delivers the emotional and conceptual payoff. Specific cost: she must resolve her status before she can stop. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Defragment" is introduced early as metaphor and method (gathering scattered shards of digital existence, reassembling identity). It drives the ink-pattern work and the satellite-sync climax. Swapping it for a generic "restore" would lose the computing metaphor's precision. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Spilled ink on gridded paper, interpreted as hexadecimal via optical pattern recognition, is signaled and demonstrated in the middle section. The method shapes her attempts (tilting shard, controlling rivulets) and the final pattern. Mechanics matter on the page. Could score higher with earlier setup; first full explanation arrives ~mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The opal observatory supplies the legacy scanner system, the satellite window, and the solace tone. Snow and translucent dome charge the cathedral-like atmosphere at closure. The setting's analog-era equipment is causally necessary: modern systems reject her. Essential resource and constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the radio static clears" gates the satellite-sync window and creates urgency (narrow window, "Three hundred and eight heartbeats. The satellite window held"). Time pressure is present and tracked via heartbeats, though the exact duration and consequences of missing the window remain slightly soft. Functional but not maximally taut.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Fetch wisdom from failure" is stated explicitly ("to mine every rejection letter for clues") and dramatized: she learns database architecture from each failed appeal, shifting from anger to patient method. The friction between vindication-seeking and acceptance of loss drives the arc. Present in motive and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" coheres throughout: refracted opal light, cathedral-like dome, snow-muffled quiet, the peace of working alone. Tone modulates subtly (backstory frustration compressed, present calm sustained) and charges the final cessation of counting. The ending image ("closed her eyes...stopped counting") delivers solace earned through prior texture. Strong closure linkage.</comment>
