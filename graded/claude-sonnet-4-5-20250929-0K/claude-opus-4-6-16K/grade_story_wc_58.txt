<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's defining trait—writing obituaries for the living—is established early and concrete, but she makes no decisive choice that forecloses a path. Eli's interiority is richer: the thread, the phantom table-setting, the daughter's absence all embody contradiction and loss. The final lines grant him resonance, but Maren remains observational; her departure is declared, not earned through on-page conflict. The piece delivers credible endurance (Eli) without the protagonist driving a turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (Vethara, seawall, garden). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes "what we love does not leave us simply because it has gone" with felt cost—Maren will sail, adding herself to the record of departures. The piece deepens via accumulation (linden leaves, crimson thread, explained absences) rather than causal reversal. Cost is visible but the protagonist does not drive it; the ending reconfigures meaning without a decisive protagonist choice, slightly limiting closure strength.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden, dry fountain, gold linden leaves, and crimson thread all pressure tone and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (seawall, palace, garden bench) remains clear. The thread functions as micro-setting, recurring twice with reweighted meaning (torn carpet, then wound on wrist at closure). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("bruised light of late October"). Environment constrains Eli's duty and charges the final stillness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Eli's duty to explain absences vs. disappearing into that duty. The piece deepens through accumulation (table for twelve, the thread, the obituary reading) rather than causal reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens. One meaningful intensification occurs when Maren reads the obituary aloud and Eli responds ("You make it sound like I mattered"), but Maren's agency is observational—she does not face a trade-off with visible cost. Eli's endurance is legible but not protagonist-driven. Escalation is modest; the cost (Maren's spring departure) is declared, not tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—inhabitation of absence, the architecture of loss, presence held in language—emerges organically from Eli's acts (the thread, the phantom table, projecting presence into emptied rooms) and the obituary device. The final line reweights prior material without stating a moral: "became the proof that what we love does not leave us simply because it has gone." Subtext operates in silence and image (the fraying thread, bare branches). No overt philosophizing; the concept integrates cleanly with character goal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren with clean access to Eli's reported speech and gesture. Perceptual signature is literary and slightly elevated ("lonesome splendor," "bruised light") but consistent and voice-motivated. Dialogue feels natural and advances intimacy ("You make it sound like I mattered"). Distance modulates appropriately; Eli's interiority arrives via Maren's observation and his own disclosure. No head-hopping. Register remains controlled; no therapy-speak in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings differ. Information density is high in the opening third ("obituaries for the living—not eulogies") and the garden description. Minor scaffold: "She understood" appears twice in close proximity (thread paragraph, projecting-presence paragraph), creating a light template cadence. "Lonesome splendor" recurs three times, borderline loop but serves tone. Figurative language is dense ("slow, deliberate punctuation," "bruised light") but mostly coherent. Propulsion slows mid-piece during reflection on healing geography; one paraphrase loop around "explained absences." No artifacts touch closure. Apply −0.4 for scaffold/loop presence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obituaries-for-the-living conceit is fresh and the crimson thread image is specific. "Explained absences" and "projecting presence" offer non-obvious angles on caretaking and memory. Execution is literary and committed. The piece resists easy sentiment, embracing ambiguity (Maren will leave; Eli will remain). Slight derivative echo: the premise (stranger cataloging a vanishing world) and the autumn-palace-emptiness setting trend toward familiar elegy templates. Transformation through the thread and the obituary device rescues originality, but the emotional arc (intimate encounter, inevitable parting) is well-trodden. No bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her role (writing obituaries for the living) frames the narrative. She observes, converses, writes, and reads passages to Eli—functional involvement across beats. However, she makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path; her spring departure is declared in exposition, not dramatized. The obituary reading (middle beat) advances intimacy but not conflict. Eli's choices (remaining, showing the thread) drive what resonance exists. Maren's decisions do not create key turns. Present and logically consistent, but replaceable with another observer-scribe archetype. Setup clear, middle functional, closure participation passive (she will leave, stated not shown). Cap 4.6 for missing causal middle development; score 4.2 for observer posture.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crimson thread appears twice with evolving meaning: first when Eli shows it and explains the torn carpet (causal origin, embodied memory), then in the final paragraph where it catches October light during the obituary reading, charging the closure image. Early signal (second scene), middle beat (he turns his wrist "as though showing a scar"), closure reprise (the thread as proof of fraying continuity). Specific, irreplaceable object that embodies Eli's stake. Visible cost tied to it (the carpet tore, the palace's wholeness ended). The thread constrains no on-page choice but reweights meaning twice. Two solid beats, closure linkage strong, specificity high. Score 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Explained absences" is named early ("healing seemed to live in...explained absences") and governs Eli's role (answering the door, keeping the record). It shapes his on-page stance (remaining to tell visitors the household departed) and drives the thematic frame. The obituary itself is an explained absence. Middle beat: Eli describes his daughter's departure and the phantom table-setting, enacting the concept. Closure: Maren will become "another explained absence." Setup and thematic payoff strong; middle involvement present but not a high-pressure choice. The concept charges tone and meaning but does not narrow options in a dramatic beat. Score 6.4 for thematic integration with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" is demonstrated on the page (Maren's obituaries "rendered in vividly descriptive language") and governs her method. Early signal (paragraph one). Middle: she writes about Eli's hands, the rooms, the grain of every banister—descriptive density enacts the trait. Closure: the final obituary line is quoted, demonstrating vivid language. However, the trait does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; it enables her work but does not create friction. Present across beats, affects tone and intimacy, but no tradeoff. Setup, middle, closure participation all present. Score 5.8 for consistent presence without cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Intimate" describes the relationship that develops ("Their conversations grew intimate"). Setup: the garden meetings begin. Middle: Eli discloses his daughter, mornings when he sets the table for twelve; Maren reads him passages and he listens with eyes closed. Closure: "two people briefly present to each other." The action (growing intimacy) enables the obituary's emotional charge and Eli's response ("You make it sound like I mattered"), which is the story's key affective turn. However, the intimacy is narrated summary more than dramatized pressure. One key turn (the reading and reply) traces to it. Swappable with "trust" or "connection" with minor edits. Score 6.9 for shaping one key turn without high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"By projecting presence" is named mid-story: Eli "described rooms...projecting presence into emptied spaces so convincingly that she could smell the cedar." Maren realizes "this was its own form of healing." The method is signaled and its mechanics explained (language makes the palace alive). It appears in the middle beat (his descriptions) and informs the thematic closure (remaining as proof). However, the method is told rather than shown constraining a tactic; we do not see Eli's projection tested or altered under pressure. Setup implied, middle explained, closure thematic echo. Lyric reprise without causal work. Score 6.1 for purposeful seed and thematic payoff without on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shadowed garden is the story's sole location after the opening seawall beat. Anchored early (paragraph four: stone bench, dying lindens, wild hedgerows, dry fountain). The garden recurs in every scene with Eli, supplies the October light and falling leaves that charge tone, and appears in the closure beat ("the garden held them...linden branches nearly bare"). Autumn's decay mirrors Eli's situation. The setting does not impose a tactical constraint (no weather shift, no intruder) but its sensory particulars (shadows, gold leaves, brittle basin) pressure tone and the final image of "lonesome splendor." Setup, sustained middle presence, closure participation strong. Score 7.6 for tonal constraint and closure charge without causal pressure on choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the last ship sailed" is the opening anchor and governs the winter isolation ("she would winter here among strangers"). The timeframe creates situational constraint (Maren cannot leave until spring) and is referenced at closure ("She would sail on the first spring ship"). However, the time window is static backdrop; no ticking clock alters moves, no seasonal shift forces a decision on the page. The constraint is declared and accepted without cost. Setup strong, closure callback present, but no middle escalation tied to time. Score 5.3 for framing constraint without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To understand the geography of healing" is Maren's stated goal (paragraph two) and frames her travel. She notes that in Vethara "healing seemed to live in...explained absences," and writing Eli's obituary becomes her method. The motivation is setup and thematically resolved, but Maren faces no on-page friction between this desire and competing costs. Her choices are observational; the obituary writing is recounted, not dramatized as a difficult trade-off. Desire is told, not conflicted in scene. Setup clear, thematic echo at closure, but no middle choice driven by this want vs. obstacle. Score 4.8 for ornamental thematic presence without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears three times: opening ("that lonesome splendor of things still beautiful in their decline"), middle (describing the October garden), and closure ("the lonesome splendor of the season's turning"). The tone is consistent, modulates with the garden's decay (gold leaves to bare branches), and charges the final image of two people "holding the fraying thread of what still held." Coherent through turns, stable yet evolving density, and inseparable from the closure's emotional register. The phrase itself borders on loop but functions as leitmotif. Score 8.3 for tonal control that charges closure without being static.</comment>
