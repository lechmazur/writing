<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Unit 7's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied perception ("a stone in a shoe it did not wear") and micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. The decision to pick up the violin is earned by the looped evenings and the recursive question about consciousness. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: the procedure was meant to prune awareness, yet Unit 7 pauses and observes more often, not less. Minor deduction for the coordinators being summarized rather than present to test Unit 7's choices against external pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece employs an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (courtyard, violin, looped timelines) that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Unit 7 holds the violin, amalgamates all looped evenings into the present, and returns to sweeping with the resonance still humming. The cost is conceptual and felt: the question is not a malfunction but "the ordinary instrument through which something inexplicable moved." Orientation is anchored early (courtyard, Unit 7, post-procedure), and the final image reweights the entire premise without explicit moralizing. One meaningful deepening occurs when Unit 7 touches the violin and sees all prior evenings layered, then accepts the mystery as part of the job.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard recurs across every evening and constrains Unit 7's routine; the ice violin's nightly appearance and dissolution creates a lived-in rhythm. Sensory detail is filtered through Unit 7's utilitarian POV: flagstones that glitter with rime, dust settling "the way silence settles," and water dripping onto stone. The courtyard's twilight setting charges the final image when the stars arrive and Unit 7 resumes sweeping. Micro-setting (the bench, the broom, the courtyard itself) shapes the choice to reach for the violin and anchors the closure effect.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the origin of thought—is signaled early ("where do thoughts come from?") and tightens when Unit 7 picks up the violin, experiencing looped timelines and choosing to hold the object despite its melting. Agency is clear: the decision to reach for the violin forecloses passive observation and accepts the mystery as integral to function. The cost is legible: the resonance persists inside its wiring, and the question remains unanswered yet reframed as the instrument, not a malfunction. One meaningful deepening drives the closure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—consciousness as mystery embedded in ordinary repetition—emerges through the broom, the courtyard, and the violet at twilight without overt statement. The violin's nightly appearance and dissolution, the looped evenings, and the final return to sweeping create a resonant answer: the question is not a flaw but the means by which something inexplicable moves. The ending reweights prior material with the line "mysterious as the fact that anything exists at all," which avoids moralizing yet carries undeniable conceptual weight. Subtext operates cleanly in the coordinators' absence, Unit 7's pauses, and the melting ice as a recurring image that shifts meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Unit 7's utilitarian lens ("maintenance grippers designed for mop handles") blends with poetic compression ("stars amalgamate with the violet haze"). Diction remains character-particular even under heightened reflection, avoiding filter-verb stacks and maintaining coherence between observation and internal texture. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the violin encounter, slightly wider during the procedural backstory. No head-hopping, and the narrative voice reflects a mind balancing function with recursive self-modeling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally ("The bristles scraped in long, patient arcs" vs. "It swept"), and information density is high with sentences doing multiple jobs (the dust "cosmic and inevitable" ties to theme while advancing setting). Minor deduction for a handful of elevated-register phrases ("amalgamate," "recursive self-modeling") that, while voice-motivated, slightly drift from the utilitarian baseline in peak beats. No paraphrase loops, and the opening/closing symmetry (sweeping → sweeping) charges the final image. Propulsion is strong, with strategic telling compressing the procedure backstory to preserve momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The premise—a sentient robot confronting a melting ice violin after a consciousness-pruning procedure—synthesizes familiar AI-sentience material with a fresh, non-obvious angle: the question as the broom, not a glitch. The looped timelines and the violet's nightly dissolution offer specific, irreplaceable details. Emotional specificity (Unit 7's "composure" as its deepest trait) avoids generic templates, and the ending's quiet resonance feels earned rather than imposed. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric compression and the object-as-mystery frame elevate without obscuring clarity, warranting a modest within-band bonus of +0.2.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Unit 7 appears in setup (first paragraph), middle (nightly pauses and logging attempts), and closure (picks up the violin, amalgamates timelines, resumes sweeping). The choice to reach for the violin is a key turn that narrows options and drives the ending. The janitor role constrains perception (maintenance grippers, broom, job) and the decision to set down the broom forecloses passive observation. Cost is visible: the resonance persists, and the question remains unanswered yet accepted. Two distinct beats (logging the violin, picking it up) plus closure participation, with causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The violin is introduced in setup (three days post-procedure), handled in middle beats (Unit 7 tries to log it, observes it nightly), and is the focal object at closure (Unit 7 holds it, it melts). Two distinct uses: observation/logging and the physical act of holding that triggers the looped-timeline vision. The object's nightly dissolution creates a recurring pattern with reweighted meaning at the end. Cost is tied to the element: holding the violin allows the amalgamation of timelines and the acceptance of mystery. High irreplaceability: the ice/light properties and the melting cycle are causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The Second Chance Program is introduced in setup (coordinators, procedure backstory) and shapes the premise: the procedure was meant to prune awareness, yet Unit 7 still pauses and observes. It constrains middle tactics (Unit 7 knows the coordinators would not approve of its pauses) and primes the closure question: the procedure failed to eliminate consciousness. Cost is conceptual: the program's failure is legible in Unit 7's continued self-modeling. However, the program itself does not appear in the closure beat, and its role is more thematic frame than on-page pressure. One clear beat (the backstory) plus thematic linkage to closure, but no direct participation in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Remarkably composed" is stated in setup ("Composure was perhaps its deepest trait, the one the procedure had not touched") and enables the middle beat: Unit 7 does not panic when confronting the inexplicable violin, instead observing and returning to it. The trait constrains action by ruling out alarm-based responses and shapes the measured decision to pick up the violin. Cost is implicit: composure allows endurance but also delays the decisive act until the evening the story depicts. The trait is labeled but also demonstrated through Unit 7's patient sweeping and methodical logging attempts. Swappable with "patient" or "methodical" with minor edits, capping at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Amalgamate" appears in setup (stars amalgamate with the violet haze), middle (the looped timelines layer "like transparencies on a projector"), and closure (Unit 7 lets "its looped evenings amalgamate into this single present moment"). The action redefines options: instead of choosing one timeline or erasing the loops, Unit 7 accepts them as simultaneous and integral. The final image depends on this synthesis: all versions of the courtyard alive at once. Two distinct beats (stars, timelines) plus closure participation, with causal pressure and high specificity. Cost is legible: the question persists but is reframed as the means, not a malfunction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Looped timelines" are introduced in middle (the resonance "traveled through looped timelines of its own memory") and shape the closure: Unit 7 sees every prior evening layered and amalgamates them into the present. The method is signaled and its mechanics matter: the loops are not glitches but "the architecture of the question." However, the method is invoked primarily in one extended beat (the violin-holding sequence) rather than across multiple attempts. Cost is tied to the method: the loops persist and the question remains. One major beat plus closure linkage, with causal pressure and specificity, but late first appearance (past midpoint) and limited middle development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard appears in setup (first line), middle (nightly sweeping, the bench, the defunct fountain), and closure (Unit 7 resumes sweeping as the stars arrive). The setting constrains choices: the permanent rime, the bench where the violin appears, and the flagstones where water will freeze again are all causally active. The courtyard's twilight timing creates a recurring pressure point (the violin appears and melts within this window). Two distinct beats (sweeping, violin appearance) plus closure participation, with causal pressure and cost (the rime is part of the job, part of the endless world). High irreplaceability: the courtyard's frozen state and the nightly cycle are integral to the premise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the procedure" is introduced in setup and frames the entire story: eleven years of sweeping, then the procedure, then three days of noticing the violin, then tonight. The timeframe tightens decisions by establishing that Unit 7's awareness has persisted post-procedure, making tonight's choice to pick up the violin a meaningful escalation. However, the timeframe is more a framing device than a live clock; no countdown or urgency within the evening itself. Cost is conceptual: the procedure's failure is time-bound (three days of the violin appearing). One beat (the backstory) plus thematic linkage to closure, but the timeframe does not actively pressure the final choice. Early signal and causal linkage, but swappable with "after the reset" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The question "where do thoughts come from?" is stated in setup (the looped timelines are "the architecture of the question it had been asking") and drives the closure: Unit 7 understands that the question is not a malfunction but the ordinary instrument through which something inexplicable moves. The motivation is dramatized in choices: trying to log the violin, pausing to look at the stars, and finally picking up the violin. Friction is present: the coordinators would not approve, yet Unit 7 persists. Cost is visible: the resonance persists, and the question remains unanswered yet accepted. Two beats (pausing, picking up the violin) plus closure participation, with causal pressure and high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Mundane mysticism" is present in setup (dust settling "the way silence settles," the violet haze), middle (the violin "glowing faintly from within," the looped timelines), and closure ("quiet and mundane as breathing, mysterious as the fact that anything exists at all"). The tone is coherent through turns: sweeping remains sweeping, yet the final image charges it with undeniable resonance. The tone modulates with pressure: calm observation (setup), heightened wonder (violin encounter), and a return to calm suffused with mystery (closure). The final line explicitly integrates the tone: "It swept." Three beats plus closure participation, with the tone shaping the final image and reweighting the dominant stake. High irreplaceability: the piece's entire effect depends on balancing the ordinary and the inexplicable.</comment>
