<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is consistently character-particular, rooted in her observatory work and dream chronicling. The contradiction between choosing "distance" and the unavoidable pull of her mother's telegram drives micro-choices (reading it again, writing the letter). The final dream acceptance feels earned by the writing act, though the embodied cost of grief could be more physical and less abstracted. No therapy-speak intrudes at peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elena accepts shared grief through the dream's open hands, with the stone remaining but lighter—a visible on-page cost that forecloses solitary endurance. The Accumulative lens holds: reflection anchored to present stimuli (telegram, telescope, daylily) reweights the dominant stake through the writing act. Orientation anchors (observatory, Elena, night, telegram) arrive within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful deepening: understanding the temple prayers shifts her from avoidance to witnessing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Observatory setting is vivid and purposeful: red lamp preserving night vision, telescope trained on Cygnus, leather-bound volumes. The daylily (micro-setting object) constrains the final tactile choice (hand on daylily as mother's hand) and charges closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elena's astronomical priorities. Minor miss: the Anatolian highlands temple remains abstract, though it doesn't harm the single-location present frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (confronting unshared grief) is signaled early via the unread telegram and lucid dream motif. One meaningful tightening: rereading the telegram under the red lamp crystallizes the temple prayers as personal invitation, forcing Elena to write. Agency is renunciation-as-action (accepting shared burden) with visible cost (ending solitary self-sufficiency). Escalation operates through Accumulative pressure: understanding builds across star observation, dream recall, and the writing act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (shared burdens, witnessing as healing) emerges organically from the variable stars metaphor, temple inscriptions, and dream figures without thematic echo. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the stone doesn't disappear but becomes lighter when held together, reweighting prior solitude with undeniable cost. The daylily's recurring sweetness and the eclipsing binaries' "breathing" rhythm layer meaning without forcing symbolic freight. Minor drift: "heals with words" is asserted late ("she was a woman who healed with words") rather than fully shown through prior stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent narrative distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: astronomical lexicon, dream-chronicler framing, preference for "eclipsing binaries because their variations could be explained by geometry." One register slip: "the natural consequence of closeness" in Elena's letter feels slightly elevated past her established voice under grief's pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Strong final image coheres with established rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the star-observation passage. Minor paraphrase loop: "shared burdens" concept is restated across three near-adjacent beats (star paragraph, "shared burdens" realization, dream figures) without added texture between iterations, applying −0.2. One template cadence in the star catalog paragraph ("Some were... Others were...") is brief and voice-motivated, so no penalty. Closure beat is artifact-free.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The variable stars / shared burdens synthesis is fresh and specific to Elena's dual vocations. The dream figures holding the stone is a vivid, non-obvious image. Transformation test passes: swapping names and setting would gut the astronomical metaphor's precision. Minor derivative element: the distant-daughter-returns-to-archaeologist-mother's-wisdom frame echoes common templates, though the lucid dreaming and star-mapping particulars elevate it. No proximity echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's lucid dream chronicler role frames her nightly practice and the recurring two-figures dream (fourteen prior recordings). The attribute enables the closure: descending into sleep "with purpose" and finally accepting the open hands is a direct enactment. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (dream recall), and payoff (final sleep descent). Causal pressure: her dream-interpretation habit supplies the insight that reweights the telegram. Cost: abandoning solo chronicling for shared witnessing. Reasonably irreplaceable, though "dream journal keeper" could substitute with minor edits, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The daylily-pressed telegram appears in three distinct beats: initial unfolding (setup), rereading under red lamp (middle turn), and final tactile touch as mother's hand (closure). Its "faint sweetness" recurs with shifting charge: first as persistent memory, then as defiance of time, finally as embodied connection. Specific properties (pressed stillness, honey color, scent) are irreplaceable. Causal: the daylily's sweetness triggers Elena's sensory memory and primes the writing act. Cost linkage: touching it "as though it were her mother's hand" crystallizes acceptance. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Shared burdens is seeded early (eclipsing binaries "sharing the same gravitational burden"), restated at midpoint realization ("shared burdens. That was what her mother had been trying to tell her"), and enacted at closure (stone held between them, lighter). It shapes Elena's dominant stake: moving from solitary star-mapping to accepting witness. Causal: understanding this concept drives the writing act and dream descent. Minor swappability: "mutual support" or "companionship" could substitute with edits. Cost: visible in the final image (stone remains, but shared). Present across all three gates with clear pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Heals with words" is introduced late (final third: "she was a woman who healed with words, though she had never permitted herself to believe it") and primarily operates as thematic claim rather than on-page constraint. Setup absent until that assertion. Middle involvement: her prior dream chronicling and star cataloging in "leather-bound volumes" suggest wordwork, but the healing dimension isn't tested under pressure until the letter-writing beat. Payoff: writing the letter is the enactment, and it drives closure. Cost: minimal—writing doesn't visibly foreclose an alternative path. Late cap at 4.6 would apply, but the writing act's centrality at closure and the dream/catalog groundwork lift it modestly within the allowable band. Swappable with "processes through writing" without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Witness" is seeded early (temple inscriptions as witnessing suffering), articulated at midpoint ("the act of witnessing another's suffering is itself a kind of healing"), and enacted at closure (Elena witnesses her own grief, accepts the dream figure's witness). Major turn: realizing the dream figures' open hands were an invitation to witness reweights her entire stance. Causal: this insight drives the writing and the final dream descent. Cost: visible in surrendering solo endurance. Irreplaceability: strong—"acknowledge" or "accept" lack the relational, outward-facing charge of "witness." Present across all three gates with clear pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through variable stars" is established early (telescope on Cygnus, eclipsing binaries as metaphor for shared burdens) and returns at closure ("the variable stars of Cygnus pulsed their ancient light... remarkably like breathing"). Mechanics: the distinction between eclipsing binaries (geometry-driven dimming) and intrinsic variables provides the conceptual scaffold for Elena's insight. Middle constraint: her preference for binaries reflects her desire for predictable structure, which the shared-burden realization challenges. Not deeply causal—the stars supply metaphor but don't block or enable a tactical choice under pressure. Present in setup and payoff with thematic weight; middle use is interpretive rather than action-driving. Lyric reprise charges the final image but doesn't alter options. Swappability: another astronomical phenomenon (e.g., binary orbits without variability) could serve with edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Observatory setting anchors the piece (curved walls, main telescope, red lamp, leather-bound volumes) and supplies the variable stars that drive the metaphor. Setup: strong—anchored in first paragraph. Middle: the red lamp detail (preserving night vision) is specific but doesn't constrain a choice under pressure. Payoff: "outside" reprise of Cygnus stars at closure charges the final image. The setting enables Elena's nightly practice and dream work but doesn't apply immediate tactical pressure (e.g., isolation doesn't block her from writing or dreaming). Micro-setting element: the daylily functions more actively than the room itself. Reasonably integral but not indispensable—most elements could function in another isolated research site.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "when understanding dawns" is literalized in the midnight setting and the pivotal sentence: "Now, in the midnight solace of the observatory, understanding dawned." Setup: "Tonight, though, she could not sleep" signals the present urgency. Middle: rereading the telegram and recalling fourteen prior dream recordings compress prior time into present realization. Payoff: the final sleep descent enacts the shift from withholding to accepting. The dawn metaphor is apt for the accumulative lens—understanding accumulates rather than striking suddenly—but the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions (no external clock pressures her). Cost is conceptual (ending avoidance) rather than time-bound. Present across beats with thematic coherence; moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To decode temple inscriptions" is the mother's goal, not Elena's live desire on the page—she "abandoned that work years ago." The telegram reveals the mother's completed decoding, which then shifts Elena's stance. Setup: present via telegram and backstory. Middle: the decoded message ("prayers for those who carry too much") reframes Elena's avoidance as the true problem. Payoff: understanding the inscriptions enables her insight, but Elena's enacted desire is to witness her own grief, not decode further. Friction between wants: yes—her choice of "stars over stones" created the distance she now confronts. Cost: accepting the decoded meaning forecloses her prior rationalization. Swappability: the mother's obsession could center on any unfinished scholarly work; "temple inscriptions" add Anatolian specificity but aren't mechanically necessary. Present but one step removed from protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" is established in the opening (fog erasing the world, remote peak) and the realization beat ("in the midnight solace of the observatory, understanding dawned"). Tone coheres: quiet, reflective, elegiac without sentimentality. Modulation: the writing act and final dream descent deepen solace from isolation to shared rest ("the stone... was lighter"). The tone charges the closure image: "breathing" stars, hand on daylily, descent into purposeful sleep. No tonal breaks or forced intensity. Strong fit with Accumulative lens and Resonant Reconfiguration closure. Minor gap: "solace" as comfort isn't tested against opposing pressure (urgency, anger)—it remains stable rather than hard-won, limiting upper range.</comment>
