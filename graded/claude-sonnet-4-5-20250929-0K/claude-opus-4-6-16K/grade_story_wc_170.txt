<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The painter's motivation is concrete and her interior contradiction—giving away heartbeats while teaching others to distribute the cost—drives a credible arc. The relationship with Lisha applies immediate pressure and alters the painter's stance by the end. Interiority occasionally edges toward label-speak ("wonder," "grace") but remains largely embodied through action and micro-choices. The final choice to stay and teach is earned by the mirage she sees of herself surrounded by students, foreclosing the path of solitary erosion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of rain-light mirages early and accumulates pressure through the borrowed-heartbeat cost until the painter sees her own future and chooses to stay. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of two voices braiding lullabies reweights the dominant stake with felt cost—her heartbeat silence narrows "just slightly" on the page. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lisha's counter-melody stabilizes the water-images and reveals the painter's own possibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and pooled rainwater constrain the painter's method and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the painter's calm perception. Spatial choreography remains clear across the terrace and belltower. The violet evening and amber-rose light modulate with the emotional arc, and the final "quiet harmony of indigo and amber" directly shapes the ending's tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether the painter can sustain her work without disappearing entirely. The mirage of herself surrounded by students is a meaningful tightening that narrows options—she can distribute the cost or continue eroding alone. Agency is clear: her decision to stay and teach Lisha forecloses the path of solitary erosion with visible cost (the silence between heartbeats). The hush-before-bells timeframe imposes a recurring constraint that shapes each attempt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—permissions versus promises, erosion as medium, distributed cost—emerges through the water-images and borrowed heartbeats without overt statement. The final image of two voices braiding lullabies offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the work can be carried forward and the cost shared. The coded lullabies shift meaning from bedtime comfort to revelatory tool. The piece resists moralizing; the painter's choice is presented as a discovered possibility, not a tidy lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited. Perceptual signature is consistent: the painter notices melody, light refraction, and the silence between her own heartbeats. Diction ("prism parapet," "echoing terrace," "luminous could-be") is elevated but remains voice-motivated and controlled. No head-hopping. The prose modulates with emotional intensity—calm description opens, wonder deepens when she sees her own mirage, and the final lines breathe with restored rhythm. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor overwriting in the opening third: "as though the architecture itself were remembering aloud" and "a second language waiting to be decoded" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching, though neither obscures causality. No loops or scaffold. The final image—"a rest resolving at last into the note it had always been waiting to become"—charges the closure without overreach.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mirage-painter premise is specific, and the borrowed-heartbeat cost is a fresh angle. The combination of song-as-medium, water-images, and mirror-persuasion feels purposeful rather than checklist-driven. The emotional arc—teaching to distribute cost rather than eroding alone—avoids template resolution. Risk: the piece commits fully to its lyric, non-linear method. One friction: the "moth who loved the moon" lullaby and "river that borrowed the sky's color" feel slightly generic within the otherwise vivid conceit.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The painter is present throughout, her choices drive all key turns (singing to create mirages, teaching Lisha, deciding to stay), and her final decision to remain in Vellara forecloses the path of solitary erosion. Setup, development, and closure participation all present. Causal pressure clear. Cost tied directly to her: the borrowed heartbeats narrow, then widen slightly when she teaches. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prism parapet after rain appears in three distinct beats: opening description, the violet evening when the mirage forms, and the final scene where the painter sits "on the prism parapet" at dusk. The object enables the water-images that are the painter's medium. Closure linkage strong: she sits on it as she teaches Lisha the final song. Setup early, development clear, payoff integral. High specificity—its light-splitting property is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Borrowed heartbeat shapes stakes throughout: the painter gives away a fraction of her living time with each mirage, the silence between beats grows, and this cost drives her decision to teach others so the burden can be distributed. Setup early, development across multiple beats (the cost is described, she experiences it, Lisha's involvement offers a solution), and closure hinges on it—the silence narrows when she teaches. Visible cost on the page. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Perceptively calm appears twice: opening description and again when the painter stares at her own mirage ("her calm deepening into something closer to wonder"). The trait constrains her method—she works without haste despite the erosion—and enables her decision to stay rather than flee. Present in setup and closure, but only one mid-scene use that visibly alters tactics. Cost connection present but not foregrounded.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Grace appears in two beats: "She moved through this erosion with grace" (describing her acceptance of the borrowed-heartbeat cost) and the final paragraph's verb form "gracing the world with visions." The first use characterizes her endurance; the second charges the closure image. Setup mid-story, closure participation clear. The trait enables her sustained work but is somewhat swappable with "dignity" or "composure" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Coded lullabies signaled early, mechanics detailed (altering familiar songs to thread frequencies that make water tremble into shapes), and method used in all three mirage beats. The painter teaches Lisha the trick of a counter-melody, and together they sing the lullaby about the moth, creating the decisive mirage. Closure depends on this method: the final lines describe "two voices—one elusive, one young—braided lullabies into the rain-light." Setup, development, and payoff all strong. Irreplaceable; removing this exact method breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Echoing terrace in spring is present throughout: opening description establishes acoustics and seasonal rain, the terrace provides the rainwater medium for mirages, and children follow her there. The spring rains enable the work (prism effect after downpour). Closure scene unfolds on the terrace. Setup immediate, development clear (the space constrains her method and attracts students), payoff integral. High specificity: the echo and rain-catching parapet are irreplaceable features.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hush before bells appears in three beats: the mirages last "only over the hush before the bells rang," the painter and Lisha sing during one such hush, and "The hush before the bells ended" dissolves the decisive mirage. The timeframe tightens decisions—mirages are ephemeral, work must be completed before the bronze tongues strike. Setup early, development across attempts, payoff: the final mirage dissolves when the hush ends, but the painter stays anyway. Causal pressure clear; irreplaceable constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation to persuade mirrors to show possibilities is stated early and drives all on-page action: she sings to create mirages, the mirrors amplify them, and her singular goal is dramatized through each attempt. Conflict arises from the borrowed-heartbeat cost. The mirage of herself surrounded by students reweights this motivation—she realizes she doesn't have to disappear to fulfill it. Setup immediate, development across beats, closure hinges on it. Desire and cost friction clear on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dusky harmony is established early ("violet evening," "amber and rose," "dusk settled into its quiet harmony of indigo and amber") and modulates with emotional pressure—calm opening, wonder at the decisive mirage, resolution in the final dusk scene. The tone charges the closure image: the harmony of two voices braiding lullabies mirrors the visual dusky harmony. Coherent through turns, no static mood. The final line's "rest resolving at last into the note" echoes the tonal concept. Strong closure linkage.</comment>
