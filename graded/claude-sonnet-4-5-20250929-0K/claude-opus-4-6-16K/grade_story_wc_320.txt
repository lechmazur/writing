<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior is vivid and embodied through her professional stance ("listening for the spaces between language"), but motivation remains largely told through backstory rather than tested on-page. The choice to leave the star fragment as monument feels symbolic rather than costly—no path is foreclosed. Internal contradiction is minimal; her eleven-year quest proceeds without friction or stakes that force her to weigh competing goods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density, the receiver's needle movement, and the city's resonance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the shard of hush deepens and the towers vibrate. Cost is conceptual and felt—the moment passes, leaving only coordinates and the next ruin—but the closure reweights her quest with quiet inevitability. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The suspended city, gorge updrafts, and lunar perigee constrain Maren's timing and location, charging the closure beat when the towers resonate. Sensory detail (corroded steel mesh, wind through lattice, moon's proximity) is filtered through her professional attention and tightens as the signal arrives. The star fragment serves as micro-setting, its brass catching moonlight in the final image to anchor her ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the shard of hush again—is signaled early and pursued through one meaningful tightening when the receiver's needle pins past zero. Agency is attention and ritualized endurance; the cost is conceptual (always moving to the next ruin) but legible. No reversal complicates the beat; coincidence (lunar perigee) enables but does not resolve, as the shard passes and she begins again.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the particulars of ruins, silence nested in static, and the star fragment as monument to endings that seed new transmissions. The final notebook entry ("Begin again") offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution; her faith in beginnings hiding in endings is tested by the signal's brevity and her perpetual motion, creating meaningful ambiguity without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices "the architecture of silence," tunes by "discarding assumptions," and registers a null signal as "presence, dense and luminous." Diction ("shard of hush," "seed of quiet," "hammock slung between forgetting and remembering") is purposeful and voice-specific. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from close interior to wider atmospheric sweep without head-hopping. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual momentum. Figurative density is high throughout ("jaw of broken teeth," "tuning fork struck by proximity," "sculptor learning to see inside marble") and occasionally stacks without clear payoff ("seed of quiet," "shard of hush," "pocket of profound stillness" in close succession). Information density is strong; minimal scaffold or loops. The closure beat ("Begin again") is clear and propulsive, though mid-passage metaphor accumulation approaches overwriting without full pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The celestial signal interpreter profession and the concept of listening for silence's architecture offer fresh angles on ruin-exploration and signal-hunting tropes. The hollywood star fragment as carried talisman and the suspended radio-tower city are specific and purposeful. Emotional truth (her solitary perseverance, the practicality of her faith) avoids generic templates. The ending's synthesis—coordinates, timestamp, brass catching moonlight, "Begin again"—feels earned and non-obvious, though the quest-without-resolution frame is familiar.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's choice to climb the central tower, adjust the receiver, and leave the star fragment are present across the beat. Her professional method (discarding assumptions, listening for silence) enables the signal discovery, and her decision to record and move on shapes the ending. The element drives the accumulative arc but does not face a reversal or costly trade-off that would elevate it further.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The hollywood star fragment appears in the middle (Maren touches it in her pocket, reflecting on fame as temporary signal) and returns in the ending (placed on the railing as monument, brass catching moonlight). The reprise reweights it from private talisman to public marker. Two distinct beats with charged closure participation, though its material properties (brass, terrazzo) do not constrain a choice—it functions symbolically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shard of hush is the object of Maren's search, shapes her tuning method (listening for "a specific quality of quiet"), and materializes on-page when the static thins and the receiver needle moves past zero. It drives the central beat, alters her tactics (holding breath, letting it speak), and the ending hinges on its brief appearance and passage. The concept is indispensable to the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" describes the updraft hum in the opening paragraph ("a low vibration that lived in her molars and her fingertips simultaneously") and recurs when the towers resonate at the climax. The attribute colors atmosphere and signals the moment of transmission but does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost. Present and purposeful but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tuning the receiver is Maren's core action: she adjusts the dial "not toward clarity but toward a specific quality of quiet," the dial resists then gives, the static thins, and the shard appears. The action is irreplaceable—her method of tuning by discarding assumptions drives the discovery. Removing it would collapse the story's causal chain and the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By discarding assumptions" is signaled early as Maren's method ("learned to tune...not by calibrating to known wavelengths but by discarding assumptions") and enacted on-page when she adjusts the dial away from clarity toward a "quality of quiet." The method shapes her approach and the discovery, appearing in both setup and climax. Functional and specific, though the mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The suspended radio-tower city appears in the opening line, frames the entire scene, and its structural features (swaying platforms, wind through lattice steel, gorge updrafts, antenna clawing at the sky) constrain Maren's climb and enable the signal's reception. At the climax, the towers resonate and vibrate, making the setting causally active. The ending reprise ("the city swaying beneath her") recharges the image. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is signaled in the opening paragraph ("Tonight was lunar perigee, the moon swollen close enough to taste") and triggers the signal's arrival ("The moon rose...and the signals began"). Time tightens the window for transmission and shapes Maren's timing. The moon's arc marks the signal's passage. The element is essential to the story's causal logic and appears in setup, climax, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—"to find the beginning in every ending"—is told in the middle via backstory and the star fragment's symbolism. It is dramatized lightly when she records coordinates and writes "Begin again," but no on-page choice forces her to weigh this desire against a competing cost. The motivation frames her quest but remains more thematic anchor than source of friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" coheres across the piece: Maren's professional terminology (celestial signal interpreter, portable receiver, dial position), concrete sensory grounding (corroded steel, updrafts, brass fragment), and matter-of-fact recording of coordinates balance the lyric register ("shard of hush," "seed of quiet"). Tone modulates under pressure when the towers resonate, then returns to her notebook's pragmatic brevity. The tone charges the final image and supports the accumulative lens.</comment>
