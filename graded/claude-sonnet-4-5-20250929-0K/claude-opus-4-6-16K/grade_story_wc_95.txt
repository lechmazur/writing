<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Erasmus is established with concrete physical details (mechanical arm, needle card handling) and a clear professional identity. His interior remains somewhat abstract—"belonged to an institution versus belonging to an idea" feels thesis-like rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice reads as predetermined by voice rather than forged under pressure; no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges on the page. Mother's philosophy ("every question was a thread") operates as backstory anchor but doesn't create a micro-choice that alters present stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Situational with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The overture decoded from the sundial establishes stakes early, and the final walk-away constitutes a clear renunciation with implied professional cost (warrants remain, chair/immunity forfeited). However, the cost remains told rather than felt—no on-page consequence that narrows later options within this scene. The closure lands as Earned Stasis under the situational lens, but the price is oblique rather than undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Glass atrium, brook, and sundial are anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("green-tinted glass that caught the morning light"). The needle card functions as micro-setting, handled twice with tactile specificity. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The sundial's coded angles constrain Erasmus's choice by making the overture legible, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting/object pressure a decision. Minor: the brook's "indifferent commentary" and "rippling bands" edge toward decorative lyricism without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (defect or remain independent) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Solenne enters and the abstract overture becomes a face-to-face negotiation. The final question ("does your Academy want a philosopher, or a weapon?") and walk-away constitute protagonist agency, but the turn feels more like a stance declaration than a pressure-driven narrowing of options. The warrants and immunity offer real stakes, yet no on-page complication tests Erasmus's commitment; Solenne's challenge is met with rhetorical certainty rather than costly choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (institutional loyalty vs. intellectual integrity) emerges through concrete images (sundial cipher, needle card, mechanical arm as past-debate scar). However, the final exchange risks thematic echo: "does your Academy want a philosopher, or a weapon?" followed by "There is. And that difference is my answer" states the thesis rather than letting the image land it. The needle card's symbolic weight (mother's seamstress philosophy) is told more than dramatized. No non-literal final image reweights prior material; the walk-away is literal closure without conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: controlled diction ("velvet gauntlet," "diplomatically fierce"), sardonic interiority, and embodied details (mechanical arm clicks). Dialogue carries subtext—Solenne's "I'm sure I don't know what you mean" and final "Is there a difference, Professor?" feel goal-driven. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Minor: Solenne's voice ("the brook outside were applauding") briefly mirrors Erasmus's ornate register, reducing distinctness. The phrase "dignified chaos of the moment hung in the glass-filtered air" edges toward narrator intrusion with thematic summary rather than POV-filtered perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong verbs ("murmured," "scattered," "whirred") and varied syntax. Opening and closing lines frame stakes cleanly. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "Either a negotiating tactic or simple cowardice. Erasmus suspected both" restates the prior clause without added pressure (−0.2). "The dignified chaos of the moment hung..." offers abstract summary when the scene has already dramatized the elements (−0.3). Figurative density ("velvet gauntlet," "oscillations of an argument not yet spoken," "diplomatic tea") clusters without pattern-teaching, edging toward overwriting in the final third (−0.3). No artifacts touch closure directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dueling philosopher + mechanical arm premise is fresh, and coded sundial cipher adds specificity. However, the core arc (invitation to defect, principled refusal) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The needle card's backstory (seamstress mother, "questions into destinations") reads as imported wisdom rather than pressure-forged insight. Solenne's "smile while declaring war" posture is vivid but not developed beyond the stock diplomatic adversary. The story commits to its premise but doesn't surprise within it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character present throughout; his mechanical arm is handled in opening beat and clicked mid-scene, and his dueling-philosopher identity frames the stakes. His final choice (walk away) alters tactics (no defection, warrants remain). However, the choice feels preordained by voice rather than forged under pressure; no visible cost in this scene beyond implied future consequences. Two beats (arm adjustment, final departure) plus closure participation, but causal pressure is limited. Setup clear, development (sundial decoding) functional, payoff (departure) present but not indispensable—a generic philosopher could walk away with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Needle card introduced early with backstory anchor (mother's seamstress philosophy), handled in second beat ("opened it, touched a needle"), and placed on sundial symbolically. Three touches across beats; returns with reweighted meaning at closure ("closed the needle card with a click"). However, its function remains symbolic/reflective rather than causal—it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The card charges the final image but could be replaced by another maternal keepsake without breaking story logic. Setup strong (+0.8), beat involvement modest (+0.4), closure linkage lyric rather than causal (+0.5), swappability high (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Hidden overture shapes the entire story: decoded from sundial in first third, frames negotiation stakes, and the refusal constitutes the closure. Erasmus's tactics (reading cipher, confronting Solenne, walking away) all trace to the overture's terms. Setup immediate (+0.8), beat involvement (decoding, confrontation) (+0.9), causal pressure (narrows options to accept/refuse) (+1.2), closure linkage direct (+1.4). The concept is indispensable—without the secret proposal, no negotiation or refusal. Removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Attribute applied to Solenne ("diplomatically fierce," "smile while declaring war," "velvet gauntlet"). Appears in second half only (−0.4). Described rather than dramatized in choice; her dialogue pursuit is goal-driven but the "fierce" quality remains label-level. No visible on-page cost or tradeoff linked to this trait. Setup missing (−cap 4.6), development decorative, payoff absent. Could swap "shrewd" or "calculating" with minor edits (−0.6). Ornamental use (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Action mentioned in backstory ("debates over Kant's categorical imperative that had escalated…into a Viennese courtyard") and signaled in Erasmus's title/identity, but no on-page fencing occurs. The "fusion of philosophy and swordsmanship" is told as Academy interest, not dramatized. His departure is a walk, not a duel. Setup present (identity established early) (+0.3), development absent (no sword drawn), payoff missing (closure is dialogue + walk). Summary-only use (−0.8), swappable with "debate" or "argue" (−0.6). Cap at 4.6 for missing setup in action; further penalties lower to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sundial cipher introduced early ("half-painted sundial…coded angles…each unpainted segment corresponded to a letter"), decoded in first third, and its output (overture terms) drives the entire negotiation. Mechanics matter: Erasmus traces the dial's edge with mechanical fingers, calculating angles. Setup strong (+0.8), beat involvement (decoding, needle card placement on dial) (+0.9), causal pressure (makes overture legible, enabling choice) (+1.4), closure linkage indirect (referenced in final exchange) (+0.4). The method is specific and irreplaceable (+0.6). Could score higher if the sundial itself appeared in closure image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Glass atrium and brook anchored in opening, present throughout. The sundial pedestal supplies the cipher resource; glass walls scatter morning light and throw "rippling bands" during the confrontation. Setting provides the stage and one key resource (sundial), shaping the negotiation's legibility. Setup immediate (+0.8), beat involvement (light imagery, sundial use) (+0.9), causal pressure modest (enables decoding but doesn't alter tactics beyond that) (+0.7), closure linkage (Erasmus exits "along the brook") (+0.5). Micro-setting (atrium interior) functional but could be swapped for another contemplative venue with minor edits (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "while waiting" established in opening ("He was waiting"). Solenne's lateness is noted ("either a negotiating tactic or simple cowardice"), and the wait is filled with sundial decoding. However, elapsed time is vague—no clock tightens the window or alters Erasmus's tactics. The wait enables reflection but doesn't create urgency. Setup clear (+0.8), development (waiting filled with action) (+0.4), payoff absent (closure isn't time-driven). Lyric reprise possible (waiting → departure) but cost not tied to duration. Swappable with "upon arrival" (−0.6), ornamental (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Motivation ("to turn questions into destinations") introduced via mother's backstory, repeated in Erasmus's reflection on the needle card, and echoed in his final question to Solenne. The desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choice—Erasmus never wavers or pays a visible cost on the page; his stance is firm throughout. Setup present (backstory anchor) (+0.3), development (reflection on needle card) (+0.4), payoff (final question traces the motif) (+0.5), but friction between want and cost is absent (−0.8). Summary-only use of motivation (−0.6). Lyric reprise lifts it slightly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone "dignified chaos" is present: dueling-philosopher premise, mechanical arm precision, absurd sundial cipher, brook's "indifferent commentary," and ornate diction ("velvet gauntlet," "oscillations of an argument"). However, "chaos" remains controlled—no tonal rupture or modulation under pressure. The final image ("dignified chaos of the moment hung in the glass-filtered air") tells the tone rather than embodying it. Setup strong (established early through voice and details) (+0.8), development (sustained across beats) (+0.4), payoff (explicitly named but not charged in final image) (+0.3). Label-only in closure beat (−0.5), static mood rather than modulating (−0.4).</comment>
