<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interior is rendered with concrete particulars—the carbide lens as talisman, the physical act of listening through glass—and her final realization ("willingness to be changed by what you hear") emerges from embodied discovery rather than assertion. The grandfather backstory anchors her present search without stalling momentum, and the shift from reconstruction-as-fidelity to reconstruction-as-response feels earned. Minor deduction: the epiphany moment edges toward diagnostic clarity ("connection was never the sound. It was the listening") that risks over-articulation, though it remains tied to the lamp's concrete function. Single-POV interiority is strong and contradictory impulses act simultaneously when she questions her own assumptions mid-work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density increase (blackout silence → restored power → recording playback → lens-mediated listening) and cadence shift at the revelation beat reweights the dominant stake with conceptual cost (abandoning fidelity-as-truth). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the final bell strike and textured silence reconfigure her relationship to lost sounds, foreclosing the reconstruction path with visible cost ("stopped reconstructing the world and started touching it"). Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs when she holds the lens to her ear and hears presence rather than pitch, narrowing her methodology and forcing the final stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The laboratory as archive of extinct frequencies, the workbench, the monitor light casting "golden shadows," and the grid's restored hum provide concrete spatial anchors that pressure Maren's methodology. The carbide lens functions as micro-setting: holding it to her ear alters the sound's "presence," constraining her choice to abandon frequency-matching. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional ear (overtone color, "grain and weave"), and the eleven-day blackout silence charges her return with urgency. The Andalusian mine shaft's 1962 collapse and Asturias coal seams root the setting in verifiable geography without catalog padding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering the texture of connection) is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren questions her fidelity assumption and listens through the lens, which narrows her options and forces the final reconception. The resolution is protagonist-driven: her choice to strike "not to reconstruct… but to answer" forecloses the archival path with visible cost (her three-year methodology is renounced). Agency is renunciation with on-page cost; no antagonist is required. Pressure escalates through sensory accumulation and the "powerfully gentle" revelation that presses "the way deep water presses."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (connection as mutual transformation rather than archival accuracy) emerges through the lamp's concrete function: her grandfather carried it "to see the faces… share it," not conquer darkness. The final image—bell overtone spiraling into "gold and violet" against the mine recording—offers a non-literal answer without stating a moral. The "artificial pilgrimage" frame avoids sermonizing by grounding revelation in the lens's physical mediation and the textured silence that follows. Subtext operates in the shift from "reconstruction" to "touching," and the closing line's "warm, granular, alive" silence charges prior material without summary. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the stance is embodied in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and apt; perceptual signature is character-specific (Maren notices overtone color, "gold and violet," and sound's "grain and weave"). Diction remains within her register: technical terms (spectral harmonics, carbide lens, acetylene flame) are profession-bound and purposeful. The phrase "powerfully gentle, the revelation arrives" modulates psychic distance intentionally to mark the beat's weight. Syntax and rhythm tighten under pressure: the final paragraph's stacked clauses ("not a museum… a living room… recognize each other") accelerate toward closure without obscuring clarity. No dialogue; interior monologue avoids filter-verb stacks and therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or theme without padding. "The texture of connection is not a frequency to be matched. It is the willingness to be changed by what you hear" edges toward abstract declaration, costing −0.3 for slight expository tilt in a peak beat. Minor scaffold: "Connection, she thinks" and "An artificial pilgrimage: a journey…" front-load definitions that could emerge through action alone (−0.2). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Figurative language (golden shadows, "luminous seam") is coherent and tied to the lamp motif without mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prism-song bell ringer vocation and the carbide lens as listening tool offer a fresh synthesis: reconstructing extinct sounds through crystal overtones is specific and non-derivative. The "artificial pilgrimage" frame risks abstraction but is grounded in the laboratory's concrete function and Maren's embodied methodology. Emotional specificity (grandfather's lamp as talisman, eleven-day blackout silence in her bones) avoids generic templates. The turn—listening through the lens changes presence, not pitch—feels earned in hindsight and transforms the archival premise. Minor deduction: the revelation's phrasing ("willingness to be changed") trends toward platitude without additional idiom to anchor it in Maren's unique voice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices create two key turns: questioning her fidelity assumption (midpoint) and striking the bell "not to reconstruct… but to answer" (closure). Early setup (hired three years ago, her gift described). Middle development: she sets down the bell and listens through the lens, altering her methodology. Closure participation: the final bell strike is her active decision, foreclosing the reconstruction path. Causal pressure narrows options with visible cost (renouncing her three-year method). High irreplaceability: the story requires a reconstructor who can abandon fidelity for connection.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Early setup (workbench placement, grandfather backstory). Two distinct beats: held up to monitor light ("golden shadows pool"), then held against her ear like a stethoscope (sound changes presence). Closure linkage: final paragraph reprises "golden shadows settle" and ties the lamp to the "luminous seam where connection lives." Causal pressure: listening through the lens enables the revelation that fidelity is not truth. Cost connection: abandoning reconstruction means the lens's original archival purpose is transformed. High irreplaceability: its concave shape and acetylene history are unique; no generic talisman could replace it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Early setup (paragraph four defines artificial pilgrimage). Development: the concept frames her movement through the laboratory "the way a penitent moves through chapels," shaping her expectation of revelation. Closure linkage: final paragraph states "her pilgrimage, artificial as it was, has propelled her to… the trembling border," reweighting the journey's validity. Causal pressure is moderate: the concept colors her stance but does not directly narrow tactical options in the bell-striking work. Swappability risk: "curated journey" could replace it with minor edits, though the pilgrimage–chapel parallel adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Early signal (title motif implicit in "texture" search). Payoff: "Powerfully gentle, the revelation arrives. It does not crash over her. It presses… enormous and quiet and everywhere at once." The trait constrains the revelation's delivery method and charges the final image's "warm, granular" silence. Causal role is moderate: the gentle quality shapes how she receives the insight (willingness to be changed) rather than forcing a tactical choice. Cost connection: renouncing forceful reconstruction for gentle answering carries conceptual cost. Irreplaceability: "gentle" alone is generic; "powerfully gentle" is more specific but trends toward oxymoron without additional embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Early expectation: blackout ended, Maren returns to propel her search. Development: the revelation "propels her" to the border where connection lives (stated in final paragraph). Closure linkage: the verb appears in the ending summary. Causal role is weak: the action is mostly metaphorical; her physical return and bell-striking do the tactical work. Swappability: "drive," "carry," or "move" could replace with minor edits. Lyric reprise (setup → payoff) without middle dramatization limits score under the gate model.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Early signal (paragraph nine: "This is where Maren works by questioning assumptions"). Development: she questions her fidelity assumption, enabling the lens-mediated listening that changes the sound's presence. Closure participation: the final bell strike enacts the questioned method ("not to reconstruct… but to answer"). Causal pressure: questioning narrows her options and forces the renunciation with visible cost. Specificity: the method is concrete (matching frequency versus being changed by sound) and irreplaceable; no synonym substitutes cleanly. Two distinct beats (questioning, then answering) plus closure linkage elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Early setup (paragraph one: Laboratory of Lost Sounds, archive of extinct frequencies, electromagnetic locks). Development: the laboratory's archive function pressures her fidelity methodology, and the workbench provides the concrete space for lens use. Closure participation: final paragraph's "the laboratory is not a museum of loss but a living room" reweights the setting's meaning. Causal pressure: the archive's preservation ethos shapes her initial assumptions and the ending's rejection of reconstruction. Irreplaceability: a generic studio would lack the extinct-sound mission that frames her quest.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Early setup (paragraph one: eleven-day blackout ended, power grid stabilizes, Maren returns). Development: "with the grid freshly alive and the silence of eleven days still ringing in her bones, she wonders" frames the questioning beat. Closure participation: "The grid hums its steady, restored current through the walls" in final paragraph. The timeframe enables the return but does not tighten decisions under a live clock; Maren works at her own pace. Lyric reprise (blackout silence → restored hum) reweights the search without imposing tactical pressure. Swappability: any return-after-absence could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Early setup (paragraph three: "she cannot name what she is truly searching for. Connection… the grain and weave of what it feels like when one consciousness genuinely touches another"). Development: the desire drives her bell work and the questioning of fidelity. Closure participation: the final bell strike and textured silence embody discovered connection, foreclosing the reconstruction path with visible cost. Causal pressure: the search narrows her methodology and forces renunciation. Friction between want (to name texture) and cost (abandoning three-year archival method) is on the page. High irreplaceability: no generic goal substitutes cleanly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Early setup (carbide lens held to monitor light, "golden shadows pool across her fingers, amber and wavering"). Tone modulates: initial archival calm → questioning uncertainty → "powerfully gentle" revelation → "warm, granular, alive" silence. Closure charge: "The golden shadows settle" in final paragraph ties tone to the lens motif and charges the ending image. Coherent through turns: the golden-amber palette unifies sensory description without static repetition. Causal role is moderate: tone colors perception but does not constrain choices. Irreplaceability: "golden" is specific to the lamp; generic "warm light" would lack the acetylene-flame history.</comment>
