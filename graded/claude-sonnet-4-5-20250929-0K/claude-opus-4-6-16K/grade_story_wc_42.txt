<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular—"every broken lens was a kind of grief" operates as both metaphor and lived expertise. Her motivation to stay and repair while others evacuate is embodied through decades of accumulated knowledge and the mentor relationship with Kazuo. The final choice to stop the clock hand feels earned by prior causality, though the daughter subplot is mentioned once without return, and the emotional progression from grief to acceptance could show more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page with felt cost: stopping the clock hand is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) that forecloses escape and commits to remaining, charged by the comet photograph and the prior meditation on "escape velocity." The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered imagery (spinning hand, calibration by leaf-fall, comet tail) and the final cadence shift reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. One meaningful deepening (restructuring the array through the mountain's damage) tightens the thematic question without requiring multiple causal reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lunar observatory setting pressures the central choice: the unstable mountain foundation becomes both obstacle and calibration tool, enabling Maren's restructuring method. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her professional lens—"taste starlight," "sound of a leaf falling"—and the volcanic summit above clouds provides both literal and metaphoric altitude. The clock on the workshop wall functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-location frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to repair the array and witness the ephemeral despite foundational instability. The earthquake provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options—decommission versus restructure—and Maren's agency (staying, restructuring through damage) drives the escalation. The comet capture provides visible payoff with felt cost: she has committed her life to this precision. The conflict between "escape velocity" (her daughter, Kazuo's death) and her gift of staying creates authentic tension, though the ache to leave is more told than dramatized in a micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: repair as response to transience, calibration by listening to damage, staying as the opposite of escape velocity. The final image—stopping the clock hand so it resumes normal pace—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The comet photograph and its "luminous ache" tail reweight prior material (grief, ephemerality, witness) with earned complexity. The mentor Kazuo and the daughter provide thematic texture without descending into thesis statements, and the piece resists tidy resolution while maintaining coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited through Maren; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close and reflective. Perceptual signature is distinct—"monks understood silence, as a discipline of sustained attention"—and diction remains within her technical-poetic lexicon throughout. No dialogue appears; interior voice is consistent and purposeful compression ("She stayed because the ephemeral cannot wait") fits the lyric-accumulative mode. Syntax and rhythm reflect the focalizer's meditative precision under pressure, and no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks dull the immediacy of peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and propulsion is strong: "She stayed because of the cameras. She stayed because the ephemeral cannot wait." Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs—and figurative language is controlled (comet tail as "brushstroke of luminous ache"). Minor template cadence in the "She stayed / She repaired / She made" triad and a few stock metaphors ("spidered through," "ghost-edge") keep this below 8.5, but zero paraphrase loops and clarity remains high. The final image reconfigures the spinning-hand motif with precision and no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of camera repair, escape velocity, and grief through calibration-by-listening offers a non-obvious angle that feels earned in hindsight. The lunar observatory and "by the sound of a leaf falling" method provide fresh, specific texture. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact particulars. Small deductions for the slightly familiar mentor-death and absent-daughter accents, and the "luminous ache" phrasing edges toward stock lyricism, but the conceptual integrity and unified vision elevate the whole.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout, frames the opening, and her decision to stay and restructure drives the middle turn; her final choice to stop the clock hand provides closure agency with visible cost (commitment to remaining). Three distinct beats plus closure participation. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The spinning clock hand is introduced early (setup), used as a recurring atmospheric anchor (development), and charged at closure when Maren stops it, reweighting the "escape velocity" versus "remain" tension. Appears in three distinct beats with escalating symbolic freight and decisive action at the end. Cost is tied directly to the object's final state.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Escape velocity shapes the array's mission (tracking objects leaving Earth's gravity), informs Maren's emotional state (the ache to leave), and is explicitly contrasted with her gift of staying. The comet at escape velocity becomes the proof of success. Concept operates across multiple beats and charges the closure meditation, though its mechanics remain thematic rather than plot-driving in a narrow sense.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Changelessly constant" describes the clock hands' correct hour/minute state, the restored array's calibration goal, and the final clock resumption. It appears early and is reprised at closure with reweighted meaning. The trait constrains Maren's method (seeking stable baselines) and is visible in the ending image, but the cost connection is oblique and the trait could be paraphrased without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Restructure" is the central action—Maren proposes to restructure the array rather than replace it, works through three moons doing so, and the successful comet capture proves the restructure. The action drives the major turn (staying versus evacuating, old versus new instruments) and the ending would fail without it. Specific mechanics (re-grind lenses, realign mirrors) anchor the action in on-page detail with felt duration and cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kazuo's teaching of calibration "by the sound of a leaf falling" is introduced early as backstory, defines Maren's method during the restructuring work ("she listened…mapped resonant frequencies…let the broken mountain teach her"), and implicitly enables the array's success. The method shapes middle choices and is causally necessary, though the mechanics are more evoked than dramatized in a single on-page beat with immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The Aldrin Lunar Observatory on a volcanic summit above clouds is established immediately, provides mission context (tracking escape-velocity objects), and the earthquake/unstable foundation becomes both obstacle and calibration resource. The setting constrains Maren's options (can't use lowland replacement) and enables her restructuring tactic. Micro-setting (workshop, dome, clock) recurs and charges the ending. Strong setup, development, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The earthquake initiates the conflict and marks the moment "the second hand wouldn't stop spinning." Time pressure is implicit (three moons of work, the ephemeral cannot wait) and the timeframe's instability is woven throughout. The clock malfunction provides a live temporal marker that alters the protagonist's final gesture. The shaking foundations constrain tactics on the page with visible cost to prior calibration work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is dramatized through Maren's mission (capture fleeting comets), her choice to stay during evacuation, and the three-moon restructuring effort. The motivation is tested against the ache to leave and made visible in the pristine comet photograph. Friction between the desire to witness and the cost of remaining is embodied in the final act of stopping the clock, choosing constancy over flight. Setup, development, and closure all engage the motivation with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" coheres from the opening ("every broken lens was a kind of grief") through the meditation on loss (Kazuo, the daughter) and culminates in the comet's tail as "brushstroke of luminous ache." Tone modulates with pressure—elegiac in reflection, taut during the restructuring summary, resonant at closure—and charges the final image without becoming static. The tone is integral to voice and theme, supporting the ending's emotional and conceptual weight.</comment>
