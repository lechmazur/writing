<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's defiance is consistent and embodied through her preparation and execution. The interiority is concrete and character-particular ("the old defiance harden behind her sternum"). Internal contradiction appears in her waiting calmly for noon after her act, accepting both victory and potential erasure. The ending choice—sitting down to wait—feels earned by her methodology and carries visible cost (she may lose her memory even as the canyon remembers).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: Lira has made truth immortal through plural refraction; the cost is legible (her memory may be erased, but the canyon now holds what she knows). The priest's recognition that "forgiveness enforced is not forgiveness" reweights the premise. Orientation anchors early (towers, canyon, her imprisonment). One meaningful tightening occurs when the bone-priests arrive and she articulates the irreversibility of her act. The lens holds; because/therefore linkage drives her preparation to echo-poetry to the priest's dawning calculation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bone towers constrain and enable her tactic: she discovers and exploits their acoustic properties to refract truth. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through urgency ("mist threaded between them, catching in the hollows"). The canyon's echo-mechanics are established early and charge the final image when "echoes of her voice continued their long, recursive journey." Spatial choreography is clean (spiral staircase, top chamber, oculus above, pale spire visible). The setting is irreplaceable; no other environment could provide the recursive amplification her plan requires.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: avoid memory erasure while preserving the truth. Pressure escalates when she begins the poetry, then tightens when the priests arrive and she articulates the irreversibility. Her agency—choosing to refract rather than hide—forecloses the path of silence and accepts the cost of potential memory loss. The final choice (sitting down to wait) crystallizes her stance with visible cost: she may be stripped of memory, but the truth is now plural and permanent. One decisive tightening driven by protagonist action under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image and action: forgiveness-as-amputation versus truth-as-permanence. The canyon's refraction becomes the central metaphor without overt statement. Subtext operates in the priest's "controlled mask" and his recognition that "the price of it had just become higher than the Synod could pay." The ending offers a resonant answer: "She had made the truth immortal by making it plural." No moralizing; the final image reweights prior material (single truth versus many echoes) with undeniable pressure. Complexity embraced—her memory may be gone, but the act persists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lira; distance is controlled and voice distinct ("charcoal-stained fingers," "pigment and bile"). Perceptual signature is clear: she notices acoustics, tests echoes, hears the canyon as an instrument. Free indirect style is clean ("They wanted one truth erased. She would make that impossible"). Dialogue when present ("You cannot absolve a canyon") advances plot and carries subtext. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at peak moments. Diction remains within her lexicon (artist, defiant, strategic). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (setting + character + stakes). Figurative language is controlled and purposeful ("the fingers of something buried and still dreaming," "splitting it the way a prism splits light"). Minor loop: "silence into a hum" and "the silence of people listening" echo slightly but serve different beats. One brief scaffold in "She began before the first priests stirred" could be cut. No major artifacts touch closure. Grammar and punctuation clean; sequence clarity maintained. Opening and closing lines are strong and charged.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of canyon-as-archive and echo-as-refraction is specific and non-obvious. The defiant-artist trope is transformed through the acoustic mechanics and the plural-truth concept. Turns feel earned in hindsight (her imprisonment time spent testing verses). The premise commits fully to its implications: she cannot save her own memory, but she can make erasure impossible. Risk-taking in the extended metaphor (sound as permanent record) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on this exact setting and method. Bold choice to make the victory partial and the cost real.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Defiant artist: setup (first paragraph establishes her history and sentence), development (she tests verses in imprisonment, then executes the plan), payoff (she sits down to wait, accepting potential memory loss while the canyon holds her work). Her choices create the key turn (beginning the poetry) and the closure stance (waiting for the ritual). Causal pressure: her defiance enables the tactic and narrows options (she cannot escape, only refract). Closure linkage: her final choice crystallizes her identity. Cost visible: memory erasure looms. Irreplaceable: the story requires an artist who sees truth as something to multiply, not hide.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Pale spire in mist: setup (visible through the oculus, "the place where absolution would be administered"), payoff (returns in the final paragraph as she waits). Missing middle development—it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic between first mention and ending. Present in two beats but functionally static; it marks the ritual location but does not alter her plan or reweight meaning at closure. Swappable with another distant landmark. Lyric reprise exists but without charged reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Price of forgiveness: setup (ritual "would strip the offense... but also strip the memory"), development (shapes her entire tactic—she must act before the ritual and make erasure of one truth impossible), payoff (she accepts the price may still be paid to her, but not to the truth itself; the priest recognizes "the price of it had just become higher than the Synod could pay"). Causal pressure throughout: the concept defines her goal (preserve truth despite forgiveness-as-amputation) and the stakes (memory versus permanence). Closure linkage undeniable: her final stance rests on having changed what forgiveness can and cannot erase. Irreplaceable and specific.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Innocently mischievous: setup (she discovers "something innocently mischievous about this canyon: it did not merely repeat sound, it transformed it"), development (this property enables her entire tactic—refracting one truth into many), payoff (the echoes continue "their long, recursive journey" at closure). The trait is attributed to the canyon, not Lira, but it constrains her method and enables her success. Causal work across two beats (discovery, execution). Visible tradeoff: the canyon's playful transformation is weaponized, and the cost is her potential memory. Specific and irreplaceable to the mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Refract: setup (declared early: "She would make that impossible" by refracting the truth), development (she "let the canyon's acoustics shape her phrasing," creating refractions: "silt, silt, guilt"), payoff ("She had made the truth immortal by making it plural"). This action redefines the entire conflict: instead of hiding or defending one truth, she multiplies it. The major turn traces directly to this method. Closure hinges on it: the priest's recognition and her final stance both rest on successful refraction. Irreplaceable; swapping for "repeat" or "echo" would collapse the conceptual logic. Cost tied to it: plural truths cannot be erased, but her singular memory can.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Impromptu poetry sessions: setup (she "spent her imprisonment... scribbling verses on scraps of her own clothing, testing them against the echoes"), development ("impromptu poetry, composed and spoken aloud in rapid succession, each verse a facet of what she knew"), payoff (the poems continue cascading through the towers at closure). The method is signaled in imprisonment, executed on the page with specific mechanics (call and response with the canyon), and shapes the ending's charge. Causal pressure: the improvisation allows her to respond to each echo, creating the refraction. Irreplaceable: a prepared speech would lack the adaptive, multiplying quality. Cost connection: the ephemeral method produces permanent record.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes: setup (opening paragraph anchors location and acoustic property), development (she climbs the tallest tower, exploits the echo-mechanics to refract truth, the canyon "multiplied her voice, sent it cascading through every tower"), payoff ("the canyon has it now... You cannot absolve a canyon"). The setting supplies the essential resource (recursive echoes) and pressures her tactic (she must act before priests wake, must use the acoustics before the ritual). Micro-setting (the top chamber, the oculus) and macro-setting (canyon network) both matter. Irreplaceable: no other environment provides the permanent, transforming echo she needs. Closure depends on it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Before the ritual: setup (ritual at noon, she acts "before dawn, before the ritual, while the Synod's bone-priests still slept"), development (she begins and completes the poetry before the priests reach her chamber), payoff ("She... waited for noon"). The timeframe tightens her window and creates urgency. Two beats: the pre-dawn action and the noon approach at closure. Causal work: the clock constrains her tactic (she must finish before interception) and charges the final image (she waits for the consequence). Minor friction: the exact duration is vague, but the pressure is legible. Live clock alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Refract a single truth into many: setup ("She would make that impossible" by splitting truth like light through a prism), development (dramatized in the poetry beats: she transforms one fact into "versions the Synod could never fully gather"), payoff ("She had made the truth immortal by making it plural"). Desire is embodied in her preparation, tested under pressure (priests arrive mid-act), and fulfilled with visible cost (her memory may be taken, but the plural truths remain). Friction between want (preserve the truth) and cost (her own erasure) drives the final stance. Irreplaceable and specific to her artist identity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Forged hush: setup ("The forged hush they had maintained for years was shattered"), payoff ("a new kind of silence: the silence of people listening"). Tone of imposed quiet versus breaking silence coheres through the narrative. The canyon's hum "pressed against the teeth" establishes acoustic oppression early. Modulates with pressure: her voice cascades, the air becomes "thick with her testimony," then resolves to listening silence. Charges the final image: the forged quiet is replaced by an active, plural silence that cannot be re-forged. Specific and purposeful; the tone is not static but evolves under the central conflict.</comment>
