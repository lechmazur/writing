<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mirela's characterization is consistent and purposeful: her gently persistent walks, list-making, and refusal to demand entry embody her trait through micro-choices that alter tactics. Her decision to ring the bell and declare the anonymous-support model represents an earned stance crystallization with visible cost (foreclosing secrecy, exposing vulnerability). Interiority remains concrete—"She held the bag and understood"—without label-speak. Minor weakness: secondary volunteers and townspeople remain undifferentiated silhouettes, though they do not obscure Mirela's arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through recurring midnight runs, the bell's introduction, and the evening gathering, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the ridge "hums with accumulated silence." Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost—anonymity becomes a shared practice, foreclosing individual recognition. Orientation anchors quickly (arbor, ridge, exile community, sanctions). One minor slip: the three-month sanctions extension feels summarized rather than pressured, slightly softening escalation visibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor recurs purposefully: shelters anonymous donations, hosts the bell-ringing, and anchors the final image ("the ridge itself seemed to hum"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"curved columns... like ribs," "footsteps on dry earth," "the creak of a basket handle"—and the arbor's easternmost column marks discovery. The body (Mirela's palm holding the bell) and the object (bell, bags) function as micro-setting that charges closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across shelter rows and the arbor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (community survival under sanctions) is signaled early and tightens through food scarcity, then deepens when Mirela chooses to declare the system publicly, foreclosing the donor's secrecy. Agency is renunciation and stance crystallization—she decides it "did not matter" who gave, accepting that cost. The midnight runs and bell-ringing represent meaningful tactical shifts under the Accumulative lens. Weakness: the sanctions lifting after three months is told rather than shown, and no immediate on-page antagonist tests Mirela's choice to ring the bell.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (dignity preserved through anonymous care; intergenerational mutual support) emerges from particulars—the linked-hands bell design, midnight silence, pride vs. hunger—without meta-commentary. The final image offers a non-literal answer: anonymity becomes "a living thing" that "hums," reweighting the opening arbor and bell with conceptual cost (individual credit erased for collective resilience). Mirela's arc is inextricable from the thematic question. No soapboxing; the bell's resonance encodes the theme without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV anchors consistently to Mirela's perception: "She was gently persistent in this way" and "She held the bag and understood" maintain stable psychic distance. Diction is controlled and voice-particular—"amplified quiet, the kind where every small sound carried meaning"—with no head-hopping. Dialogue (Mirela's brief speech) is purposeful and goal-driven, establishing the model without exposition. Minor slip: "those who could give, give anonymously" momentarily elevates register, though it fits the public-declaration context.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is lean and rhythmically controlled: "knocked twice, waiting, knocking once more" varies cadence without template stems. Information density is high—"She made lists" anchors character and tactic in three words. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is purposeful: "ribs of some ancient creature" and "a living thing" charge images without overwriting. Minor weakness: "the creak of a basket handle" and similar micro-sounds list slightly in the midnight-run passage, though they serve the "amplified quiet" motif.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of anonymous charity + exile community + bell as召唤 (召唤 =召唤) mechanism feels specific and earned, avoiding template refugee narratives by centering the logistics of dignity. The midnight-run method and the bell's linked-hands design offer fresh inflection. Weakness: the sanctions-as-external-pressure frame and the wise-elder-leader archetype are familiar; transformation occurs through Mirela's tactical choices (lists, midnight runs, public declaration) rather than premise novelty. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative structure and quiet ending cohere without gimmickry but do not radically challenge form.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mirela (exile community leader) drives all key turns: initiating midnight runs after finding the first bag, organizing distribution, ringing the bell to declare the model, and deciding anonymity "did not matter." Her choices alter tactics (from secret receipt to public gathering) and foreclose paths (donor secrecy). Present in setup (morning walks), development (midnight runs), and payoff (bell speech, final reflection). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability is high—remove her and the arc collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The antique silver bell appears in three beats: discovery among donations (linked-hands design noted), the evening gathering (rung to召唤 people), and the closing image (rung "each evening at dusk"). It constrains choice—Mirela must decide whether to ring it publicly—and charges closure by encoding the intergenerational theme. Early signal (~50% mark) is slightly late but transformed prior material (anonymous gifts) into communal ritual. Specificity (engraved hands, old-country origin) and cost (publicity vs. secrecy) elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Anonymous donations shape the entire arc: the first bag incites the midnight runs, the recurring gifts sustain the community, the bell's anonymity test forces Mirela's public declaration, and the closing image hinges on "people caring for one another without needing to be known." The concept alters tactics (secret vs. open giving), narrows options (pride vs. need), and charges closure with conceptual cost (erasure of individual credit). Setup, development, and payoff are all causally active. Irreplaceable and fully integrated.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is embodied in repeated on-page actions: knocking twice, waiting, knocking once more; distributing parcels in darkness; never demanding entry. The trait constrains tactics (she cannot force help) and enables the midnight-run model (soft approach allows pride to sleep). Visible cost: her persistence extends the labor and forgoes immediate transparency. Present in setup (morning walks), development (midnight runs), and payoff (she "never discovered" the donor, accepting the cost). Strong causal and thematic linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Declare" occurs at the central turn: Mirela rings the bell and publicly names the anonymous system, redefining the community's approach from secret charity to open mutual support. This action alters options (foreclosing donor secrecy, inviting new participants) and charges the ending (the model spreads, the bell becomes ritual). Present in development and payoff; the declaration is irreplaceable—swapping it for a quieter gesture would collapse the public-vs-private tension. Cost is conceptual (loss of protective anonymity) and social (exposing need).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Midnight food runs are signaled early (~40% mark), detailed in mechanics (volunteers, baskets, doorstep placement, silence language), and recur across beats: organizing after the first bag, the amplified-quiet passage, and the closing summary ("never stopped"). The method constrains tactics (timing, silence, no waking) and charges closure by encoding dignity-preservation. Removing this exact method would break the "amplified quiet" motif and the pride-vs-need calculus. Strong causal, thematic, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor anchors every major beat: community gathering site (setup), location of anonymous donations (easternmost column), site of the bell discovery and public declaration (development), and the closing image ("the ridge itself seemed to hum"). It constrains choice (public vs. private space) and charges closure by encoding the transition from exile shelter to ritual center. Specificity (curved columns, fired clay, "ribs of some ancient creature") and recurring use elevate integration. Minor: the arbor's structure does not actively pressure a choice mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sanctions period frames urgency (five months in, aid stopped, food scarce, children thinning) and shapes tactics (reliance on anonymous donors, midnight distribution). Time tightens decisions and charges closure (sanctions last "another three months," total eight, during which the model spreads). Present in setup, development, and payoff. Weakness: the time progression is mostly summarized rather than beat-by-beat; no single scene shows the clock narrowing options in real-time. Still, the timeframe is causally active and irreplaceable for the scarcity stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mirela's motivation (to build intergenerational support) is dramatized through her speech about "the old teaching the young" and "the young carrying water for the old," then enacted in the closing image (the model spreads across ages). Friction exists between this goal and the immediate need (hunger vs. long-term systems). The motivation charges closure by reweighting anonymous care as a durable structure. Present in development and payoff; slightly late signal (public speech ~70% mark) but the morning walks and midnight runs pre-code the ethic. Cost: she must declare the model, risking failure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is established early ("the quiet of those runs became a kind of language") and modulates across beats: silent footsteps, the bell's single tone, the ridge's hum. Tone constrains tactic (soft approach, no speeches) and charges the final image ("accumulated silence of people caring"). The paradox (loud silence) is purposeful and sustained without breaking under pressure. Coherent through turns and essential to closure—removing this tonal throughline would collapse the dignity-preservation theme. Exemplary integration.</comment>
