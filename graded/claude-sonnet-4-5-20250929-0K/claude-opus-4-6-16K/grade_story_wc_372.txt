<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivations are clear and layered: institutional duty braided with personal quest for her mother's voice. Her "gently meticulous" nature is embodied in concrete gestures (aligning pencils by graphite hardness, nanometer-by-nanometer dial turns) that constrain her method and charge the ending when precision yields emotional breakthrough. The final choice to descend carrying only a frequency number shows earned renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: the mother's unscripted message at 589nm feels slightly convenient, though it's prepared by the premise of encoded vows.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal scaffolding. Orientation anchors cleanly (Maren, frozen library, present mission). The plot moves through sampling frequencies in escalating wavelengths until the mother's voice breaks through, then restores the lattice—a Resonant Reconfiguration (the library's renewal) combined with Charged Poise (Maren departs with knowledge, not artifact). Cost is visible: the slide is "spent," and Maren carries only abstracted data, having converted presence into frequency. The causality is motivated throughout, and the ending reweights the opening stakes (salvage → personal recovery → systemic restoration). One minor seam: the leap from playing back one frequency to "the oaths restored to their lattice" compresses the mechanics slightly, but the effect remains legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frozen library is rendered with sharp sensory specificity: ice "so clear it resembled quartz," sublimating molecule by molecule, walls humming in resonance. The environment actively constrains Maren's method (she must work by light sampling because the lattice is dying) and charges the closure (walls "pulsed with renewed luminescence" when the vows return). The crystal staircase, reading plinth, and projection surface are used purposefully. Psychic filter is consistent: Maren notices alignments, focal lengths, frequency bands—details that match her meticulous professional lens. The "quartz hush" recurs and modulates appropriately under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: salvage the library by recovering the luminous vows, interwoven with Maren's need to hear her mother. Pressure escalates through the sampling process (each frequency captured, building toward the unscripted message) and the sublimation clock creates urgency. The mother's voice at 589nm is the decisive tightening that narrows options: Maren can restore the library or hoard the personal message, and she chooses both by recording and playing back, accepting the slide's expenditure as cost. The resolution is protagonist-driven with visible price (the emulsion spent, artifact now relic). One beat: the "ice brightened and sublimation slowed" moment lands slightly告 convenience, though it's prepared by the vow-lattice premise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: love measured against oblivion, preservation as both duty and intimacy, the exactness required to hold meaning in a dissolving world. The magic lantern slide that loses its image to restore the archive enacts the theme without stating it. The mother's encoded message—"I loved you enough to preserve the world you would inherit"—reframes the abandonment Maren felt, and the final image (frequency number in notebook, voice in lattice) answers the thematic question with visible cost and no moral summary. The "gently meticulous" motif recurs purposefully to bind character trait to thematic stakes. No overt philosophizing; the quartz hush and sublimation carry symbolic weight through physical consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV held cleanly throughout. Narrative distance is stable and apt: close enough for embodied perception ("her hand trembled"), distant enough for lyric register ("filaments of gold streaming from their lips like visible song"). Diction is elevated but consistent, matching Maren's archival precision and the speculative-literary frame. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she detects misfiled documents "by the weight of a drawer," logs frequencies against phoneme tables, works "one nanometer at a time." The prose rhythm modulates appropriately—longer, measured sentences during technical work; shorter when the mother's voice breaks through. Minor note: a few stock phrases ("perpetual silence," "visible song") approach ornament but remain voice-plausible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most lines do two jobs). The opening establishes coordinates, suspension, ice-as-quartz, and the preserved-sound conceit in one paragraph. Technical vocabulary (spectral sampler, nanometers, phoneme tables) is precise and integrated without exposition dumps. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity is strong throughout. Minor dings: "gently meticulous" appears three times (opening trait, closing reprise, one mid-story label); "luminous" recurs five times in slightly decorative ways; and "molecules locking back into crystal around a voice that refused to vanish" in the climax stacks modifiers heavily. The final image—"measured the exact distance between love and oblivion and found it survivable"—risks abstraction but earns it through prior concrete work. No artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—recovering encoded vows from a magic lantern slide via frequency sampling to restore a sublimating archive—synthesizes archival fantasy, light-as-memory, and mother-daughter longing in a fresh configuration. The mechanics (wavelengths translated to phonemes) are specific and non-obvious. The emotional core (Maren's secondhand memory of her mother, the unscripted message hidden in a spectral band) transforms the salvage-mission frame. The closure image—carrying a frequency number rather than the artifact—feels earned and particular. Risk is present: the high-concept magical mechanics could overwhelm character stakes, but they remain integrated. One friction: the "frozen library above the clouds" and "luminous vows" motifs brush against stock fantasy tropes; the piece elevates them through Maren's meticulous method and the cost of spending the slide.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren as "orderly records chief" frames her professional competence and constrains her method (she builds the spectral sampler, cross-references phoneme tables, logs each frequency). Her institutional role generates the salvage mission, and her precision enables the technical breakthrough. The trait recurs in the ending ("packed her instruments with the same care she brought to everything") and charges the closure by linking professional method to personal recovery. Present in setup, middle choices, and ending; drives two key beats (assembling the lantern, frequency sampling). Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide is handled in four distinct beats: unpacking from velvet, inserting into housing, adjusting focal length, and recognizing its spent state at the end. Its unique property (emulsion encoding the vows as light frequencies) is irreplaceable; no other artifact could perform this function. The slide's transformation from vessel to relic enacts a key cost and charges the closure. Early signal, middle use, closure participation, and high specificity. The slide is causally active and its state change (full → spent) alters Maren's situation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" shape the dominant stake (recover them to restore the lattice) and drive Maren's method (sampling light to extract encoded speech). The concept appears in the premise, the unfolding discovery (gold filaments from lips, phonemes at specific wavelengths), and the resolution (vows restored to lattice, walls pulsing). It's not merely thematic decoration; the mechanics of light-as-oath constrain Maren's technical approach and generate the story's central pressure. Present across all three gates with causal impact, though the mechanics of how playing back one frequency restores the entire lattice compress slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" is embodied in concrete actions: aligning pencils by graphite hardness, detecting misfiled documents by drawer weight, turning the dial "one nanometer at a time," packing instruments with care. The trait constrains her method (she cannot rush the frequency sampling) and enables the breakthrough (precision yields the hidden message at 589nm). The attribute recurs in the final paragraph as the mother's voice is described as "gently meticulous in its own right," linking character to closure image. Early signal, middle constraint, closure echo; visible cost (the slow, exacting work under a sublimation clock).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Measure" drives the entire plot: Maren measures the vows by isolating frequency bands, translating oscillations to sound, cross-referencing phonemes. The action is irreplaceable (no other method is offered) and shapes all middle beats. The mother's final message frames measuring as an emotional act ("measured the exact distance between love and oblivion"). The verb recurs in the ending image, reweighting the technical procedure as thematic statement. Present early, active throughout, and charged at closure. Specificity is high; "sampling frequencies" is the visible tactic, "measure" the conceptual spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"By sampling frequencies" is signaled early (spectral sampler, dial one nanometer at a time) and its mechanics matter: each wavelength yields a syllable, and the unscripted message appears at an unpredicted frequency (589nm). The method constrains Maren's choices (she must work sequentially through the spectrum) and enables the discovery. The technique is irreplaceable within the story's logic. Present in setup and middle with causal pressure; the ending depends on having completed the sampling. Minor note: the method is dramatized more as procedure than struggle, so the cost is indirect (time, the slide's expenditure) rather than tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The frozen library pressures Maren's choices through its sublimation (time limit, whole shelves ghosting) and provides the resource she needs (the ice lattice that can hold vows). The quartz-clear ice, crystal staircase, and reading plinth are used purposefully. The environment's response to the recovered vows (walls humming in resonance, ice brightening, sublimation slowing) is causally active and charges the closure. Early anchoring, middle constraint (the dying lattice creates urgency), and closure participation (restoration visible in the setting's transformation). Specificity is high; "above the clouds" and "no name, only coordinates" add texture without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"While illusions fade to memory" (sublimation as timeframe) creates urgency: shelves are "already gone translucent," and Maren must work before oblivion claims the rest. The sublimation process is visible (molecule by molecule) and pressures her method, though no explicit countdown or clock appears. The timeframe reappears at closure when "sublimation slowed," validating the effort. Present in setup and ending with causal impact on tactics (she must complete the sampling before the lattice dissolves). The phrasing "illusions fading to memory" is slightly abstract; a more concrete sublimation marker in the middle would tighten the temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" motivates both the institutional salvage and Maren's personal quest. The desire is dramatized through her actions (assembling the lantern, logging frequencies, playing back the mother's voice) and creates friction: she wants the library saved but needs her mother's voice. The resolution honors both (she restores the vows and keeps the frequency number), though the cost is clear (the slide spent, her mother now abstracted to data). Motivation is signaled early, tested in the middle (the unscripted message at 589nm), and resolved with visible cost. The phrasing "conjure meaning" appears once in exposition; embodiment through action is strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" establishes tone in the opening ("air held still, as if sound itself had been preserved under glass") and recurs at the climax ("warm against the quartz hush") when the mother's voice breaks through. The tone modulates appropriately: measured and precise during technical work, warmer when the personal message arrives, then returns to quiet resolve at the ending. The hush is tied to setting (clear ice, perpetual silence) and charges the closure by framing sound as both absence and presence. Coherent through turns with one purposeful modulation. Minor note: "quartz hush" as a phrase appears twice; the concept (frozen silence) pervades but could constrain a mid-story choice more directly.</comment>
