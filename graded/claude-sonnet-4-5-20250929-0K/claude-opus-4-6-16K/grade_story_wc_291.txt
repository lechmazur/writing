<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's prosopagnosia constrains her methodology—she catalogues through texture and gesture, sketches hands rather than faces—and these choices drive the investigation forward. Her motivation is layered: the inability to remember faces shapes both her artistic technique and her need to "awaken dormant empathy." Internal contradictions surface in the methodical control versus the emotional drive, though the peak choice (calling Callahan) feels slightly undercooked—the decision itself carries minimal visible cost or hesitation on the page. Backstory is substantial but anchored to present stimuli (the ribbon, the quarry, the sketches) and tilts her stance toward action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear causal chain: Maren descends to the quarry → examines the ribbon → reconstructs the timeline through her sketches → identifies Aldric Maret → calls Callahan. Orientation anchors (quarry, Maren, the cold case) land cleanly within the opening paragraphs. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (clarity emerging from mist, the case reopenable) with conceptual cost legible in the final image: "something had cleared" after fourteen months. The drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative overtones (mist, ribbon, hands accumulate toward the breakthrough), and the ending holds under that hybrid without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry is vividly rendered—"mist pooled...like something alive," drill-scarred granite, the standing water—and it constrains Maren's choices: she sets up her easel "in the shadow of the tallest wall, where the mist thinned enough to see her paper." The ribbon fragment is handled tactilely: she presses it between her fingers, feels the weave and adhesive, pins it to her drawing. Spatial choreography is clean (descent, quarry floor, north face, climbing out), and the mist thickens at the end to charge the final image. The quarry functions as more than backdrop; it pressures her process and anchors the metaphor of obscured/revealed truth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reopening Sera Lukin's cold case—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Maren's methodical reconstruction: the ribbon, the sketches, the hands that "seized" Sera's wrist. The tightening occurs when she identifies Aldric Maret and places the call, narrowing investigative options and foreclosing the case's dormancy. However, the escalation is more linear than reversing; no live complication arises to test her commitment or force a trade-off. The cost is conceptual (fourteen months of effort crystallized) rather than visibly paid on the page, which keeps the score in the 7s rather than higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Maren's condition and method: the interplay of sight and blindness, evidence and intuition, "the deepest human truths lived in the spaces between seeing and feeling." The ribbon and hands function as particulars that anchor abstraction. The piece resists moralizing until the penultimate paragraph, where "to awaken dormant empathy" and "unifying opposites" edge toward thematic statement but remain tied to her lived practice rather than detached philosophizing. The final image—mist thickening as "something had cleared"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly filtered through Maren's perceptual signature: she catalogues "through texture and gesture," notices hands and posture rather than faces, and her narration reflects this selective attention. Diction is controlled and specific—"furrowed," "degaussed," "lance"—without register drift. The single line of dialogue ("I have enough to reopen it") is clean and purposeful. Psychic distance modulates intentionally: close during the sketching process, pulling back slightly for the reflective context. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong: "The quarry had not yielded stone in forty years, but it still yielded secrets" opens with clear stakes and voice. Information density is high; most lines advance character, investigation, or atmosphere without padding. Minor loop: "She did not forget" followed immediately by backstory that reiterates her commitment could be tighter. A few elevated constructions—"furrowed hush," "the engine of her entire life"—read slightly writerly but remain within the piece's tonal register and do not obscure clarity. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; grammar and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of prosopagnosia and portrait artistry offers a fresh, non-obvious synthesis, and the investigative method (reconstructing through hands rather than faces) grows organically from that premise. The quarry setting and the ribbon fragment feel specific rather than generic. However, the cold-case-reopened arc and the methodical-detective-solving-old-mystery frame are familiar; the piece transforms them through Maren's condition but does not radically subvert genre expectations. The final thematic statement about "awakening dormant empathy" edges toward prompt-fulfillment language rather than earned surprise. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's face blindness is seeded early (second paragraph) and shapes her investigative method across multiple beats: she sketches hands instead of faces, reconstructs through gesture and posture, and this constraint enables her breakthrough (identifying Aldric's fencing grip). Her decision to call Callahan closes the piece, altering the case's status. The trait constrains and enables with visible cost (she cannot recall Sera's face, forcing reliance on other markers). Present in setup, development, and closure; causal pressure is clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment appears in three distinct beats: Maren withdraws it from her satchel, presses it to feel the weave and adhesive, and pins it to her drawing to anchor "the physical to the rendered." It drives her descent to the quarry (the fragment was found there) and participates in the composite that identifies Aldric. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage. The object's physical properties (weave, fray, adhesive stiffness) matter and constrain her reconstruction. Could score higher if the ribbon itself imposed a cost or tactical tradeoff rather than serving as evidence placeholder.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cold-case premise frames the entire story: Sera's disappearance fourteen months prior, the stalled investigation, Maren's hire by Callahan to "bring it back." It shapes stakes (reopening the case) and tactics (Maren's quarry visit, sketch reconstruction). Present in setup and drives the ending call. However, the piece does not dramatize competing pressures or costs specific to cold-case work (e.g., faded evidence, witness reluctance, institutional resistance). The concept operates more as context than constraint; the story could function with minor edits as a live investigation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Very methodical" is seeded early ("methodical about everything—her descent, her breathing, the way she catalogued") and demonstrated across beats: she cross-references sketches with the timeline, sets up her easel deliberately, and reconstructs step-by-step. The trait enables her breakthrough (systematic review of hand sketches) and reflects her coping strategy for prosopagnosia. Present in setup and development; the trait constrains her pace and style but does not impose a visible cost or tradeoff on the page (e.g., missing a time-sensitive clue due to thoroughness). Functional but not essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Lance" appears twice: "trained to lance forward with lethal accuracy" (describing the fencing grip) and "she lanced through the comfortable numbness that let cold cases stay cold" (thematic metaphor in the penultimate paragraph). The first use identifies Aldric's profession and ties to the physical evidence (the callus ridge). The second is metaphorical and ties Maren's method to the concept. Present in development and closure participation, but the action is not executed on the page—Maren does not literally lance or perform a fencing move. The metaphor reweights prior material but could be swapped for another precision metaphor with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Unifying opposites" is stated twice: in the backstory ("by unifying opposites: the curve of a jaw with the void where recognition should live") and in the penultimate paragraph ("By unifying those opposites, sight and blindness, evidence and intuition, she lanced through the comfortable numbness"). The method is articulated rather than dramatized in distinct beats. It frames her artistic practice and investigative philosophy but does not constrain a middle choice or appear as a tactic under pressure. Present in setup (via backstory) and closure (thematic statement), but no middle development where the method shapes an on-page decision. Lyric reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quarry is established in the opening and shapes multiple beats: Maren descends the switchback, kneels by standing water, sets up her easel where mist thins enough to see, and climbs out as mist thickens. The environment constrains her process (visibility, location of the ribbon fragment on the north face) and charges the final image ("mist thickened...but...something had cleared"). Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage. The quarry's physical properties (mist, granite walls, standing water) are integral to the investigation and metaphor. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the evidence disappears" is present in backstory: "fourteen months ago," "investigation stalled within weeks," "evidence disappeared—photographs corrupted, witness statements retracted." It motivates Maren's involvement and establishes the case as cold. However, the timeframe does not create on-page pressure; no ticking clock tightens Maren's choices, and the elapsed fourteen months function as context rather than constraint. Present in setup but absent from development and closure. The piece could function at a different post-disappearance interval with no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"To awaken dormant empathy" appears only in the penultimate paragraph as an internal reflection: "She did it to awaken dormant empathy—her own and the world's." The motivation is told rather than dramatized in choices. Maren's on-page actions (descending, sketching, calling Callahan) pursue justice and case resolution; the empathy motive does not constrain or complicate those choices. Absent from setup and development; appears as thematic claim at closure without visible cost or friction. Label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" appears twice: "The silence here was not empty but furrowed, heavy with the hush of questions" and the callback "the furrowed hush of the quarry." The tone—quiet, contemplative, weighted with questions—is sustained through diction ("curling," "pale granite scarred," "mist pooled") and modulates with pressure: the mist thickens at the end as "something had cleared," charging the final image. The tone coheres across turns without static uniformity. Early signal, present through beats, closure linkage. Strong integration.</comment>
