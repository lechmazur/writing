<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vela's interior is well-embodied—"synchronized breathing" with the frost and months of grinding mirrors show character-specific competence under constraint. The motivation to capture the dream is sustained through concrete action (sextant repair, calibration, twilight timing). Minor slip: the dream's initial appearance is told rather than dramatized, weakening the inciting pressure. Emotional arc from longing to resonance is earned, though the final shift ("become the surface") edges toward abstract without full embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Vela achieves resonance with the dream by erasing boundaries, not trapping it—the sextant gleams, blossoms drift upward. Cost is conceptual and felt (she abandons force for surrender) but could be more viscerally legible on the page. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: grinding mirrors, calibration, frost-light, synchronized breathing build density toward the final crystallization. Orientation is clear by paragraph two (who, where, fog district). One meaningful deepening occurs when she matches her breath to the district's pulse, dissolving the boundary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The fog, calcified trees, copper vats, and frost-light are vivid and purposeful. The sextant's cracked arc and thin mirrors constrain Vela's approach (she must reverse its function). The twilight frost moment—air crystallizing into "prismatic corridors"—directly enables the capture by creating the optical conditions she calibrated for. Micro-setting (workshop in cider house) anchors early; the orchard district's perpetual haze shapes every tactical choice. Sensory hierarchy (light bent through moisture, breath synchronized to ice formation) reflects her professional lens and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture the runaway dream) is signaled in paragraph three and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the frost-light creates a fleeting window that forces immediate action. Agency is clear—Vela's months of preparation and synchronized breathing enable the capture. Cost is conceptual (she must surrender control, "become the surface") but the on-page price—her transformation from trapper to resonant medium—could be more viscerally dramatized. The escalation is driven by protagonist competence under constraint (grinding, calibrating, timing), fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (boundaries between longing and possession, ruin and restoration) emerges through concrete particulars: mirrors that "hold images," a dream that "tears from the surface," a sextant that "erased boundaries between celestial and terrestrial." The final image—blossoms drifting upward into a glass sky—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the physicality of breath, the reversal of the sextant's purpose, the shift from trapping to becoming. No thematic echo or label-speak; the orchard's restoration is felt, not declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Vela's perceptual signature (light's "angles at which light remembered," "fog turned every direction into the same direction"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though phrases like "staggering clarity" and "light that had no earthly source" edge toward elevated register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during breath synchronization, slightly distant during exposition). No dialogue present. Minor slip: "frozen songs" and "glass mountains rising from nothing" are vivid but occasionally drift into poetic abstraction that slightly loosens the tight POV anchor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with strong figurative coherence: mirrors "sang when she breathed," fog "drowned corridors," frost "crystallized into billions of suspended ice needles." Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs. Minor overwriting in the final beat: "light that had no earthly source" and "sky made entirely of glass" stack elevated metaphors without adding pressure. No loops or scaffold detected. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the frost-light sequence. One minor register drift: "collapsing them into a single observed angle" reads slightly technical for the lyric tenor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—mirror-maker uses a broken celestial instrument to capture a dream by reversing its boundary-erasing function—is specific and non-obvious. The shift from trapping to resonance ("become the surface") transforms the capture-quest trope through earned causality. Risk is present: synchronized breathing as method, Accumulative lens without traditional conflict, and the quiet closure all heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. The orchard-in-fog premise is familiar, but the sextant's reversal and the frost-light window make it feel inevitable in hindsight. No template echoes detected; voice and world cohere as singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vela makes multiple on-page decisions: grinding mirrors for the sextant, calibrating to fog instead of stars, timing her attempt to the frost moment, synchronizing breath to match the district's pulse. Her final choice—surrender control to "become the surface"—enables closure. Early signal (paragraph one), middle development (weeks preparing, reversing sextant function), payoff (breath synchronization captures dream). Causal pressure: her competence and months of work narrow options and earn the final resonance. Cost: she abandons force for resonance, a visible shift in approach.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sextant appears in paragraph four (rubble find), is transformed in paragraph five (grinding new mirrors, reversing function), and is actively used in paragraphs six-seven (raised to catch frost-light, eyepiece pressed, final gleam). Three distinct beats. Causal: its boundary-erasing principle guides Vela's method. Closure linkage strong: "the broken sextant gleamed with a light that had no earthly source" charges the final image. Specificity high: its cracked arc and hybrid mirrors are irreplaceable. Cost tied: reversing its celestial function enables the dream's capture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Erasing boundaries is not mere theme—it shapes tactics on the page. Vela reverses the sextant's function (it "erased boundaries between celestial and terrestrial"), calibrates mirrors to dissolve directional distinctions in fog, and synchronizes breath to dissolve "the boundary between mirror and world." Paragraph seven: "She had erased the boundary between longing and the thing longed for." The concept drives middle choices (grinding, calibration) and articulates closure (resonance vs. trapping). Cost: she must abandon control to achieve resonance. Early signal implicit, middle and payoff explicit.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" is stated in the opening line but functions more as thematic contrast (solid amid fog) than an on-page constraint. It does not visibly enable or block a choice with cost. The trait is consistent with her methodical work (grinding mirrors, calibration), but those actions don't hinge on "groundedness" specifically—they'd work with any patience-oriented trait. Lyric reprise potential (grounded → becomes resonant surface) is present but not charged with visible tradeoff. Setup and thematic color only; no middle or closure cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Recreate" drives the central action: Vela doesn't repair the sextant but resurrects its principle in reverse (paragraph five). This choice defines her method and shapes two beats (preparation, frost-light capture). Paragraph five: "learning to recreate the sextant's function in reverse—not measuring boundaries, but dissolving them." Major turn traces to this action; swapping it would require full plot redesign. Payoff: the recreated instrument enables closure. Cost: reversing a celestial tool to earthly fog-logic demands weeks and risks failure. Early signal, middle development, closure linkage all strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Synchronized breathing is signaled in paragraph six and executed in paragraph seven: "Inhale as the crystals grew. Exhale as they settled. Through synchronized breathing, she matched herself to the rhythm of the district." The method is specific and irreplaceable—it's the mechanism that dissolves boundaries, not the sextant alone. Two beats: anticipation (paragraph six setup) and execution (paragraph seven). Closure linkage: breath-sync enables the dream's capture by creating resonance. Cost implicit: any mistiming would break the match. Setup slightly late (midpoint), but middle use and payoff strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district supplies the fog that Vela must calibrate for, the frost-light window that enables capture, and the spatial anchor (workshop in cider house, observatory at northern edge). Three beats: establishes world and her trade (paragraphs one-two), provides the sextant (paragraph four), and creates the frost-light condition (paragraph six). Causal: fog's perpetual haze and twilight frost directly shape tactics. Closure linkage: "the fog closed in again" frames the ending. Micro-setting (calcified trees, copper vats) grounds early. Cost: the district's ruin is both problem and resource.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Upon the shimmer of twilight frost" anchors paragraph six and creates urgency: "that rare instant when the temperature dropped sharply enough to crystallize the fog." The timeframe is specific, fleeting, and tightens decision—Vela must act during this brief optical window or wait indefinitely. Two beats: anticipation (weeks of preparation aimed at this moment) and execution (paragraph six-seven). Causal pressure: frost-light enables the sextant's function. Closure: the moment passes, fog closes in, but the dream is held. Cost: mistiming would forfeit months of work. Setup in final third slightly late but payoff strong.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Capturing the runaway dream is the sole dominant stake, stated in paragraph three and sustained through all action. Friction between want (possess the dream) and cost (must surrender control to achieve resonance) emerges in the final beat: "She had not trapped the dream... she had become the surface in which it could finally rest." Two beats: initial failure (dream flees, paragraph three) and final success (paragraphs six-seven). Causal: desire drives preparation, timing, and method. Closure: desire is fulfilled but transformed—capture becomes resonance. Setup, development, payoff all strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Glass mountains" as tone manifests in the prose: "prismatic corridors that cut through the white like glass mountains rising from nothing, sharp and translucent, terrible and beautiful." The tone is crystalline, austere, and elevated throughout—calcified trees, frozen songs, sky "made entirely of glass." Coherent across turns; modulates slightly (clinical in mirror-grinding, lyric in frost-light). Charges final image: the sextant's unearthly gleam and upward-drifting blossoms embody the glass-mountain aesthetic. One minor slip: "terrible and beautiful" states rather than enacts the tone. Setup, middle consistency, and payoff strong.</comment>
