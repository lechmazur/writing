<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior is vivid and embodied—her envy of the locust shell's escape and her shift from "playing softly when she should have played with revolution" land as genuine contradictions. The three-year backstory grounds her choice without flattening present pressure. Motivation escalates cleanly from preservation to liberation, and the final grief-wonder duality reads earned. Minor: the statues' awakening relies more on mechanical description than on dramatized inner conflict, limiting full 8+ entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal spine. Orientation anchors (sky-bridge, orchard, statues) land by ~100 words. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the orchard transformed, the living locust as proof, and Elara's grief-wonder synthesis reconfigure prior material with visible cost (years lost to soft playing). The frequency discovery → statue dance → tree uprooting sequence coheres causally. Escalation tightens through one meaningful deepening (playing the frequency with revolutionary intent). Cost is legible on the page in the final paragraph's "years...in its beautiful cage" and her own regret.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard's "rigid rows," "mathematical precision," statues' "granite feet grinding soft furrows," and the warped sky-bridge after transformation supply concrete spatial anchors and constrain Elara's tactics (she reads patrol rhythms, plays from the bridge to avoid convergence). The locust shell on the railing and the split fruit scattering seeds function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection (bark groaning, mossy heartwood, luminous green locust) is purposeful and POV-filtered. The transformed geography (trees shifted three feet, roots tangled above surface) evolves causally and the ending image depends on it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawakening beauty vs. enforced order) is signaled early and escalates through one decisive tightening: Elara's choice to weave the frequency into revolutionary tempo. Agency is clear (her bow controls the statues' hearts, her music uproots the trees), and the cost is visible on the page ("her fingers burned," years of soft playing wasted, the orchard's prior captivity). The reversal—from preservation to liberation—narrows options (she cannot return to safe softness) and the price lands in the final paragraph's grief. No requirement for multiple reversals is violated; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (beauty vs. order, captivity vs. wildness, grief and wonder from the same root) emerges organically from the orchard's transformation and Elara's interiority without overt statement. The locust shell as "a map of departure" and the statue's mossy heartwood return motifs with reweighted meaning. The final image—"grief and wonder...grew from the same root. And the root, at last, was free"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists binary resolution: beauty is reclaimed but years are lost, and the complexity lingers. Minor: "should have played with revolution in her bones" edges toward thematic echo but is anchored in embodied regret.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited; Elara's perceptual signature (noticing the locust shell's "exact shape of life, holding nothing but air," envying its escape) is specific and consistent. Diction ("miracles left unattended turn strange," "playing softly when she should have played with revolution") fits her voice. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the shell discovery, wider at the orchard's transformation). Minor: "the gap between knowing and understanding" and "grief and wonder...grew from the same root" approach therapeutic abstraction but remain anchored in concrete action (playing the frequency, watching the transformation).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short crisis beats: "Bark groaned. Branches reached"; longer reflective: "She had learned to read their rhythms..."), and information density is high (most lines do multiple jobs). No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats. Clarity is strong except for one brief filter-verb stack ("had learned," "had discovered," "had known") in the backstory paragraph, which slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure cause/effect. The locust shell's "crumbled to dust, its purpose completed" risks mild purple prose but serves closure. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor figurative density ("the gap between knowing and understanding," "bloom over symmetry") in one reflective beat does not reach penalty threshold but limits 8.5+ entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis (musician liberating an enchanted orchard by playing the guardians' crystal-heart frequency) is specific and non-obvious. The locust shell as instruction, the statues revealing mossy heartwood, and the grief-wonder pairing at closure feel earned in hindsight. The piece commits fully to its premise (music as physical force, statues with hearts) and follows implications without retreat. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on this violinist, this orchard, these statue-hearts. Minor: the "mechanical world beyond the orchard walls" remains abstract and the setup (three years of soft playing, frequency discovery) leans toward template quest logic (patient hero finally acts), preventing full 8.5+ entry. Risk-taking (lyric compression, accumulative design) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara present from line one; her decision to play the frequency (middle) drives statue stillness and tree uprooting; her final stance (grief-wonder synthesis, watching the living locust) closes the arc. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, visible cost (years wasted, fingers burned). Early signal, irreplaceable agency, specific inner conflict.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Locust shell appears early (touched, envied), reappears on the railing during the climax, crumbles to dust as "a map of departure" at the transformation's peak, and the living locust at closure reweights it. Two functional beats (discovery, crumbling) plus lyric reprise. Setup and payoff strong; middle development is contemplative rather than choice-constraining, capping higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Breaking free" shapes every beat: Elara's envy of the shell's escape, her realization she played too softly, the trees uprooting from the grid, the statues cracking to reveal heartwood, the final declaration "the root, at last, was free." Drives tactics (frequency choice, revolutionary tempo), alters options (orchard cannot return to order), charges closure image (living locust, tangled roots). Early signal, pervasive causal pressure, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" describes Elara's music in the opening and contrasts with the ending's recognition she "should have played with revolution." Constrains early tactics (soft playing syncs with statue rhythms but preserves captivity) and the attribute's abandonment enables the climax. Present in two beats (early description, final regret) with a visible tradeoff (years lost). Lyric coherence but not sustained middle pressure; caps mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Uproot" is the climax's physical turn: "The trees were remembering how to move, how to uproot themselves from the grid." Directly follows Elara's frequency choice, redefines the orchard's state, and the uprooted/tangled roots at closure prove irreversibility. Causal spine, closure linkage, irreplaceable verb. Early primed (statues enforce grid), executed mid-story, echoed at end (roots free). Small gap: the action is tree-driven rather than Elara's direct hands-on choice, limiting pure 9+ agency claim.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Crystal hearts that "beat in unison, signaling through heart rhythms" introduced early, mechanics explained (quickening pulse triggers convergence), and Elara's tactic (playing the frequency, syncing their tempo to her waltz) is the story's central method. Shapes attempts (she reads rhythms for three years, finally plays them), enables climax (statues still, trees move). Two beats (explanation, execution), causal pressure, closure dependency. Swappability slight (could be another signal type) but the heart/resonance metaphor integrates with theme, supporting mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Orchard policed by living statues is premise, constraint (patrol routes, convergence threat), resource (crystal hearts as exploit), and closure proof (statues crack, trees lean, geography shifts). Present in every beat: opening description, Elara's rhythm-reading, the frequency gambit, transformation, final image (branch that should not exist). Causal pressure (she must avoid convergence), spatial choreography (sky-bridge position), and ending depends on transformed layout. Early signal, pervasive, irreplaceable, charges final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"The gap between knowing and understanding" articulated explicitly mid-story as the timeframe for Elara's discovery process ("months" to know frequency, "longer" to understand its use). Frames the arc (three years of soft playing vs. tonight's action) and the realization arrives "not as logic but as a feeling." Two touches (explicit statement, implicit contrast at closure). Shapes pacing and her inner shift but does not tighten on-page decisions beat-to-beat as a live clock would. Thematic coherence, lyric resonance, but limited tactical pressure; mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To reawaken beauty" stated early and dramatized through contradictory choices: three years of cautious playing vs. tonight's revolutionary tempo, envy of the locust's escape, final grief for wasted years. Desire pressures her tactic (frequency choice), conflicts with cost (fingers burn, years lost), and the ending reconfigures it (beauty reawakened but "tarnished, edged with grief"). Early signal, causal friction, closure linkage, visible tradeoff. Slight abstraction in phrasing ("reawaken beauty") keeps it from pure 8.5+ irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Tarnished wonder" coheres across the arc: opening's "miracles left unattended turn strange," Elara's envy and doubt, the transformation's visceral detail (bark groaning, fruit splitting), and the ending's explicit synthesis "tarnished, edged with grief for the years...but grief and wonder...grew from the same root." Modulates with pressure (cautious opening, revolutionary middle, bittersweet close) and charges the final image (living locust, tangled roots, "wonder...tarnished"). Purposeful, pervasive, integrates theme and emotional arc without static repetition.</comment>
