<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mei Lin's interior world is concrete and particular—her understanding of fortunes as "compressed meaning" and her lighthouse work as continuation of that gift. The backstory integration is purposeful, anchoring her present isolation in past causality. Minor weakness: the diplomat's final moment feels more illustrative than embodied, lacking the contradictory texture present in Mei Lin's sections. The renunciation (island exile) carries visible cost and her acceptance of the pattern is earned through accumulated particulars.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens dominates: the piece teaches a pattern of compression and recurrence (fortunes → lighthouse beam → final fortune) by the first third and pays it off cleanly. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Mei Lin, lighthouse, post-investigation present). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—"The beam turned. The fortunes waited"—with felt cost (isolation, surveillance, permanent exile). One meaningful deepening: the final fortune's arrival on the mainland reweights all prior material, confirming the inevitability she has accepted. Cost is legible in "outlast every attempt to decode them," crystallizing her endurance as both power and prison.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: its beam's rhythm (two seconds on, four off) becomes both her work and her metaphor, constraining her daily reality and enabling the thematic payoff. The island's remoteness is causally active (supply boat timing, helicopter visit). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"salt-eaten stairs," the Atlantic "threw itself"—without catalog excess. The mason jars accumulate tactile presence across beats and anchor the investigators' scene. The rocky isolation shapes every choice and the closure image depends on lighthouse-as-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: Mei Lin's need to escape scrutiny while preserving her gift. The investigation scene deepens pressure (photographing every slip, the agent's disturbed reaction) without resolving it, confirming she remains under watch. The final beat tightens via the diplomat's unease—her influence persists despite exile, reweighting her "orchestration" as inescapable rather than controlled. One visible cost: permanent isolation with no closure to surveillance. Agency is renunciation (accepting the island, continuing to write) with on-page consequences. The piece lacks a mid-story reversal but the accumulative design earns the deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (inevitability of truth, compression of meaning) emerges organically from fortunes, microdots, and the lighthouse beam without thesis statements. The final image—"like open secrets patient enough to outlast every attempt to decode them"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (can prophecy be controlled?) without moralizing. Subtext operates in Mei Lin's calm acceptance versus the investigators' fear. Minor slip: "Which was, of course, the truth" edges toward explicating what the prior image already achieved. The fortune-as-microdot parallel deepens without forcing allegory, and the ending reweights all prior material through one charged recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady with no head-hopping; psychic distance contracts appropriately during the investigation helicopter scene. Perceptual signature is distinct—Mei Lin notices compression, patterns, rotating assertions—vocabulary (cryptic, steganography, orchestrate) fits her dual expertise. Rhythm modulates purposefully: longer, contemplative sentences in present-day lighthouse sections contrast with tighter beats during the backstory inciting incident. The final paragraph's cadence ("The beam turned. The fortunes waited.") charges closure. Minor weakness: "accidentally prophetic" and "familiar enigma" feel slightly prompt-adjacent in diction, though both are anchored in concrete examples. No dialogue present; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences layer action, image, and implication without padding. Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm breathes with scene needs. Figurative language (fortunes "curling like small white tongues," meaning "expanded inside the reader's mind like ink in water") is vivid and coherent. Two minor frictions: "By all accounts" is editorial scaffolding; the phrase "openly, certain" in the penultimate paragraph repeats the open-secret motif without adding new pressure. The paraphrase loop "Which was, of course, the truth" after "openly, certain" restates rather than advances. These artifacts do not touch the closure beat but slightly dull momentum. No grammar errors; pronouns track cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of fortune-cookie writer, espionage microdot, and lighthouse keeper is specific and non-obvious, with the compression metaphor binding all three. The accumulative structure (jars of fortunes, recurring beam rhythm, final diplomat callback) feels purposeful rather than gimmicky. Minor deduction: the core premise leans on a familiar "writer's words come true" template; transformation arises through the lighthouse setting and the microdot parallel, but the inciting scandal (diplomatic luncheon → arrest) reads somewhat convenience-plotted. The final image's reprise of an old fortune is a strong callback. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic backstory, reflection-heavy present) succeeds without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mei Lin's profession as cryptic fortune writer is present in setup (first paragraph), drives the middle investigation beat (showing jars, agents' reactions), and charges the ending (old fortune surfaces, reweighting her power). Her specific skill—writing compressed, ambiguous truths—shapes her lighthouse work and the thematic closure. Causal pressure: her gift caused exile and continues to operate despite her retreat. Cost is tied to the profession throughout. Two beats plus closure participation; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The microdot appears in setup (inciting incident: attache arrested, specs embedded in receipt dot) and charges one middle beat (investigators' steganography analysis). It does not return at closure. The object enables the plot (her exile) but is not handled again after the investigation paragraph. Functional across two beats but absent from the ending image, limiting payoff credit. Specificity matters: the microdot-as-compression parallel enriches theme, but it does not constrain the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Open secrets" as concept shapes stakes explicitly: fortunes are described as "truths so plain they hid in daylight," her gift finds them and presses them flat. The lighthouse beam is an "open" assertion, and the final line crystallizes "open secrets patient enough to outlast every attempt to decode." The concept alters tactics (she writes despite surveillance, knowing they cannot suppress what is already visible) and charges the closure image directly. Present in setup metaphor, investigation scene (analysts find "nothing actionable and everything unsettling"), and the ending's capstone phrase. Indispensable to theme and final meaning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is named early ("her supervisor once called her, half joking, half afraid"), dramatized in the inciting beat (fortune predicts betrayal before the arrest), and tested in the investigation (agents search for intentional codes, find none). The trait constrains her freedom (exile) and enables the closure (diplomat receives three-year-old fortune that comes true). Visible cost: she cannot control or stop the gift. Two beats plus ending participation; causally active with tradeoff legible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Orchestrate" is signaled early ("by directing flow, she could orchestrate safe passage"), enacted in her lighthouse work (guiding ships with beam rhythm), and reweighted at closure ("orchestrating the dark, directing the flow of everything"). The action defines her method and the final image depends on it—her fortunes and beam both direct without chasing. Three beats; irreplaceable verb that unifies profession and exile. Cost: orchestration implies control she does not fully possess. Could "guide" replace it? Barely, but "orchestrate" carries the complexity and ambition that charges the theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"By directing flow" as method appears in setup (lighthouse beam directs ships through the strait), is implicit in her fortune-writing (directing reader interpretation), and charges the ending ("directing the flow of everything that moved through it"). The mechanics matter: two seconds on, four off; narrow strait; accumulating jars. The method shapes her understanding of both roles and the final image depends on continuity of method. Two beats plus closure; causal and thematic. Slightly more replaceable than "orchestrate" (could be "guiding passage"), capping at mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse on Gannet Rock is introduced early (second paragraph: "so remote that the supply boat came only twice a month"), pressures all choices (isolation constrains her tactics, the spiral staircase holds the jars, the lantern room is her workspace), and anchors the closure image ("a light pulsed in the distance—two seconds on, four off"). The setting is irreplaceable: her exile requires remoteness, the beam's rhythm becomes her metaphor, and the rocks literalize the diplomat's fortune. The Atlantic's physical threat and the investigators' helicopter visit both depend on island geography. Three or more beats; indispensable to stakes and final meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After last orders" appears once in the supply-boat description ("after last orders at the harbor pub, when the captain was just sober enough"). It colors the island's remoteness but does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or return. No middle development or closure participation. Present but ornamental; swappable with any phrase indicating irregular/risky supply schedules. Functional setup detail that enriches atmosphere without constraining choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To transpose her life into a new key" is named explicitly in the transition to the island ("So she transposed her life into a new key"), drives her choice to apply for the posting, and is implicitly tested throughout (she continues writing despite exile, the investigators return, her influence persists). The motivation shapes her acceptance of isolation and the Earned Stasis closure. Friction: the desire is articulated but not deeply conflicted on the page—she seems to have successfully transposed without visible longing for the old life. Two beats; cost is exile itself. Strong but slightly one-directional.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Familiar enigma" as tone is established early (her fortunes "landing somewhere between nonsense and revelation," agents find "nothing actionable and everything unsettling") and sustained through modulated beats: calm in present-day lighthouse work, sharper during the investigation, contemplative at closure. The tone charges the final image: "open secrets patient enough to outlast every attempt to decode them" crystallizes the enigma as both resolved and ongoing. The oxymoron (familiar + enigma) fits the accumulative design and the ending's simultaneous clarity and mystery. Coherent modulation without static flatness; indispensable to the conceptual repricing.</comment>
