<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied—her examination of the lens, her ledger ritual, her shift from institutional belief to personal witness. The relationship crucible between Maren and Jonah lands cleanly: she comes prepared to eavesdrop, finds herself "held by the resonant hush of his honesty," and chooses transparency over reputation. Jonah's silence-turned-invitation reads as consistent character logic, and his relief at the end ("Light through a crack") feels earned. Minor slip: Maren's eleven-year familiarity with his hand is told rather than shown through a micro-choice in the present, but the final ledger notation forecloses passivity with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the forecourt hum, the doodles, the lens clarity, and Maren's ledger notation layer meaning until the final image reweights institutional silence with personal registry. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): Maren's formal notation forecloses institutional myth, and the cost is her professional risk in sealing testimony under her registry. Orientation anchors early (forecourt, night registrar, tickets over three nights). The tightening occurs when she picks up the lens and "the center was true. That was enough"—a single decisive cadence shift that narrows her options and commits her stance. Cost is legible: she signs beneath his testimony, staking her institutional authority.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt constrains the meeting (Jonah emerges "from beneath the eastern colonnade," his footsteps "produced a tone like a struck glass") and charges the closure: "The forecourt hummed around them, crystal singing with the memory of rain." The lens-as-micro-setting reweights perception—"through its core she could see the colonnade behind him sharpened to impossible detail"—and enables Maren's choice. Sensory detail is purposeful (quartz-veined stone, water pooling in engravings, amber light) and filtered through Maren's professional habit of listening and witnessing. The rain-slicked crystal hum becomes a recurring anchor that recurs with shifted meaning at the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Maren's professional integrity versus institutional loyalty, signaled early by the tickets and her recognition of Jonah's hand. One meaningful tightening: Jonah reveals the lens and Calloway's directive, forcing Maren to choose between belief and evidence. Her agency is dramatized—she picks up the lens, tests its clarity, opens her ledger, and signs—forecloses passivity with visible cost (professional risk). The escalation is driven by Maren's shift from suspicion ("belief was easier than investigation") to transparency ("You register what's real"). No antagonist on the page, but Calloway's shadow and institutional myth supply coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme of honesty-as-liberation emerges through concrete particulars: Jonah's eleven-year silence, the lens hidden inside unregistered documents, Maren's ledger notation. The final image—"the resonant hush of two people who have chosen, finally, to believe each other"—reweights the opening hum without stating a moral. The lens metaphor (scratches blur the periphery, "but the center was true") subtly mirrors the thematic calculus of partial truth versus institutional myth. Subtext operates in Jonah's doodles, his "not triumph, but relief," and Maren's shift from eavesdropping to witnessing. Minor slip: "freed by honesty" is articulated in the penultimate paragraph, edging toward thematic echo, but it's embedded in her realization rather than direct address.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Maren's professional lens: she studies signatures "searching for the tremor of truth beneath the line," listens to the forecourt hum "the way she studied late-night signatures." Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent (registry, witness, record). Dialogue is sparse, natural, goal-driven: "You came." "You drew a door." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during the lens examination, receding slightly for the final hush. Diction remains within Maren's plausible lexicon (registry, ledger, seal, testimony). No head-hopping; Jonah's interiority is inferred through gesture and speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, controlled rhythm, high information density. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image ("The crystals whispered"). Metaphors are coherent (spiraling eye = witness, hand-rooted tree = buried life, half-open door = invitation). Minor accumulation: "resonant hush" appears three times (opening concept, middle beat, final line), bordering on template cadence but functioning as purposeful motif. One small loop: "after rain" in the opening and "memory of rain" at closure nearly paraphrase, though the second reweights the first. No grammar slips, clear choreography, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of institutional myth, cryptic visual language, and sensory setting (crystal forecourt as witness chamber) feels specific and non-obvious. The lens-as-proof transforms the trope of hidden evidence by making clarity itself the contested stake. Maren's profession (night registrar) and her eleven-year adjacency to Jonah's silence are purposefully integrated rather than decorative. The doodle cipher (spirals, trees, door) adds a fresh layer without quirk-for-quirk's-sake. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines. Transformation test: the plot would not work with generic names and places; the forecourt's acoustic properties and Maren's registry authority are load-bearing. Minor familiarity: wrongfully accused archivist and redemption-by-evidence are well-worn, though the execution elevates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (quiet night registrar) is present throughout, signals early (first paragraph), drives two key beats (recognition of Jonah's hand, decision to notate testimony), and her final ledger notation is the closure action. Her professional role constrains her choice (registry seal stakes her authority) and charges the ending. Specific cost: she commits institutional power to Jonah's version, forecloses neutrality. High irreplaceability: her registrar authority makes the notation legally and thematically weighted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lens appears in three beats: Jonah reveals it midpoint, Maren examines it ("held it to the light"), and its clarity metaphor ("scratches at the edges blurred the periphery, but the center was true") enables her decision. Causal pressure: the lens is proof Calloway's directive and Jonah's refusal. Closure linkage: "That was enough" follows the lens test and triggers the ledger notation. High specificity: a projector lens with scratched edges and a clear core is irreplaceable for the truth/perception theme. Cost connection: Maren's choice hinges on the lens evidence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The concept (freed by honesty) shapes stakes: Jonah's honesty is the inciting revelation, Maren's transparency (ledger notation) is the closure action. Development beat: Maren shifts from suspicion to transparency when Jonah says "You register what's real." Closure participation: the final paragraph states "Jonah had been freed by honesty, not his alone but hers," which edges toward theme-echo but follows dramatized choice. Causal pressure: honesty narrows options (Maren must commit or refuse). Minor deduction: the concept is articulated late rather than inferred entirely from image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ambiguously clear is present in the doodles ("images that meant nothing until they meant everything"), signaled early (second paragraph), and enables the middle beat (Maren decodes the invitation). The trait constrains: she must interpret cryptic visuals to understand Jonah's motive. Closure linkage: the doodles' clarity (spiraling eye = witness, door = invitation) justifies her arrival and primes her shift to transparency. Cost connection: decoding the doodles risks misjudgment. Moderate irreplaceability: "cryptic but legible" could swap for "coded signal," lowering the top band slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Eavesdrop appears twice: Maren "had come prepared to eavesdrop on his intentions" (setup) and "the crystals themselves were eavesdropping" (middle beat metaphor). Development: her intent to eavesdrop sets the initial stance, but the actual turn (picking up the lens, opening the ledger) does not trace to eavesdropping mechanics; she shifts to direct witness instead. Closure participation: absent in the final image. Functional but replaceable: "assess" or "gauge" could substitute with minor edits. Moderate causal work in setup only.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method (cryptic doodles on concert tickets) is signaled early (second paragraph), detailed at length (spirals = eyes, trees = hands, door = invitation), and enables the middle beat (Maren decodes the invitation and arrives). The mechanics matter: without the doodles, Maren would not recognize Jonah's intent or trust the meeting. Closure participation: indirect; the doodles prime her shift but do not appear in the final image. Cost connection: decoding risk. Moderate swappability: "coded letters" could replace with structural edits, lowering the top band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt after rain is present throughout, signaled in the opening line, and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure ("The forecourt hummed around them, crystal singing with the memory of rain"). Causal pressure: the setting enables the meeting (Jonah emerges from the colonnade, his footsteps "produced a tone") and charges the ending (the hum becomes witness). Specificity: quartz-veined stone, water in engravings, harmonic hum when wet—all irreplaceable. Cost connection: the forecourt's acoustic properties mirror transparency and witness, thematically essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe (after words become unnecessary) appears in the opening ("hours when the world stopped explaining itself") and the final line ("after words become unnecessary, what remains is the resonant hush"). Lyric reprise: the phrase seeds early and returns with reweighted meaning (from solitary to shared witness). However, it does not constrain middle choices or tighten decisions; time pressure is absent. Moderate thematic charge at closure. Swappable: "in silence" or "beyond speech" could replace with minor tonal shift.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren's motivation (to thaw mistrust with transparency) is dramatized: she arrives to gauge Jonah's story, tests the lens evidence, and commits by signing the ledger notation. Conflicted choice: institutional loyalty versus personal witness. Two beats: recognizing Jonah's hand (setup), notating testimony (closure). Cost: professional risk in staking her registry seal. Specificity: "thaw mistrust with transparency" is tied to her registrar role and the lens metaphor. Minor deduction: the motivation is articulated late ("her willingness to thaw mistrust with transparency") rather than inferred entirely from action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Resonant hush is present throughout: the opening ("quiet night registrar," "soft harmonic hum"), middle beats ("resonant hush of his honesty"), and closure ("the resonant hush of two people who have chosen, finally, to believe each other"). Tone modulates with pressure: quieter in the opening solitude, charged when Jonah speaks, deepening at the ledger notation. The tone charges the final image: silence becomes shared witness rather than institutional erasure. High coherence; the hush is load-bearing for theme and closure. Irreplaceable: "stillness" or "quiet" would lose the acoustic texture.</comment>
