<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is embodied and particular—cellular memory firing, pressing finger to broken pin until nearly drawing blood. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: resentment as "load-bearing" structure versus the body's older instructions. The woman remains schematic (patient hands, strategic silence) but serves her function without requiring deeper interiority. Final choice—setting the music box down gently rather than fixing or discarding—earns its cost through prior cellular pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (holding brokenness differently, "door instead of wall") with visible emotional cost—weeping freely in the market. Hybrid lens: accumulative texture (soundless sanctuary, cellular melody) crystallizes into a Charged Poise moment where resentment's architecture is released. Orientation anchors quickly: Thessaly market → sanctuary → return. Single meaningful deepening: the broken pin shifts from absence to "shifting grace," reweighting Maren's twenty-three-year structure. Cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary constrains perception—no auditory feedback forces reliance on cellular sensation. Music box recurs with shifted function: first visual (broken pin), then haptic (pressing until nearly bleeding), charging the final release. Micro-setting (body as archive) drives the turn. Market sensory anchors (cobblestones, vendors, child laughing) frame the sanctuary's negation and provide return coordinates. The broken pin's tactile specificity—sharp edge, precise shape—charges Maren's final gesture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release resentment versus preserve identity's load-bearing structure) signals early and tightens through the music box demonstration. One meaningful turn: cellular melody playing back forces confrontation with adapted grace. Agency expressed as renunciation—setting down rather than fixing—with visible cost: "the whole structure of her identity might collapse." The woman's patience creates situational pressure without overt antagonism. Price is emotional (weeping) and structural (door/wall reconfiguration).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (grief adaptation, continuing around brokenness) emerges through music box mechanics without statement. The broken pin functions as resonant particular: not repaired but held differently. Final image—"silence she carried finally shaped like a door instead of wall"—reweights the entire sanctuary experience and resentment architecture without moralizing. Cellular memory as metaphor earns its keep by dramatizing the body's archival wisdom versus conscious anger. "Shifting grace" operates through action (melody flowing around gap) rather than declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Narrative distance stable throughout; free indirect remains clean ("silence implies the absence of something that could exist"). Diction controlled and apt—"scheming pacifist," "load-bearing," "calcified"—without register drift. Perceptual signature (architectural metaphors, body-mapping precision) stays consistent. Minor slip: "the cells of her wrists and the marrow of her sternum and the soft tissue behind her knees" risks list-catalog in a peak beat, but specificity justifies rhythm. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from external (sanctuary walls) to somatic (cellular firing).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density high; sentences often double-job (setting + interiority). Rhythm modulates well—short declaratives ("She was not alone") against longer architectonic builds. Minor template slip: "Not [X]. [Variant X]" pattern repeats (silence/negation, fixed/forgotten, lesser/different). "Scheming pacifist" coinage strong. Figurative language occasionally stacks ("reality shifted," "folded," "buckled," "thinned") but remains legible. No paraphrase loops. Final image propulsive. Proofreading clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary as cellular-memory theater offers a non-obvious synthesis of grief processing. "Scheming pacifist" as character type feels fresh. Risk: cellular memory could veer mystical but stays embodied through specific sensation-mapping. The woman's threshold appearances and silent intervention transform the guide archetype through inaction as strategy. Weakness: music box as mother-memory object is familiar territory; the broken pin's grace-through-adaptation lands the transformation but doesn't fully escape the template. Emotional specificity (resentment as architecture, silence as door) elevates execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scheming pacifist appears in setup (hospital, bridge, sanctuary), drives middle choice (music box demonstration), and her patient architecture enables Maren's final release. Her method—rearranging stones so "the door was always open"—is dramatized through the cranking action and silence that forces cellular confrontation. Causal pressure: without her reappearance and the music box, Maren's resentment structure remains intact. Present in closure as she fades, having altered Maren's stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Music box appears early (setup: woman holds it up), constrains middle choice (Maren feels broken pin, presses until nearly bleeding), and charges closure (setting it down gently, not fixed/forgotten). Three distinct beats: visual identification, haptic confrontation, release gesture. Irreplaceable: the mother's identical box and the broken pin's gap are load-bearing for both cellular memory trigger and shifting-grace metaphor. Visible cost tied to object: letting go of fixing it mirrors releasing resentment's architecture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Shifting grace" is seeded (missing note as gap), demonstrated on-page (melody adapts around broken pin, "not lesser but different"), and reweights closure (holding brokenness differently, door vs. wall). The concept actively shapes Maren's final choice—she doesn't repair the pin but accepts continuation through adaptation. Present in two beats: music box demonstration and final gesture. Conceptual cost: abandoning perfection and the identity built around wronged-daughter anger.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The woman "reappears when needed, always in thresholds" is established early and constrains narrative structure—she arrives when reality shifts, enabling the sanctuary confrontation. Attribute visible in three prior moments (hospital, bridge) via backstory and current sanctuary appearance. Causal role: without her threshold appearances, Maren remains trapped in market reality. Slight dock: the reappearance mechanism itself (how she knows when/where) remains unexplained, reducing irreplaceability slightly; another guide could theoretically serve, though her patient method is specific.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Convince" operates through the woman's patient demonstration (turning crank twice) and Maren's cellular response rather than argument. The action drives middle beat (body remembers melody) and enables closure choice (Maren sets box down). However, the method is non-verbal cellular persuasion rather than traditional convincing—the woman "did not argue... did not convince through logic." Present but refracted through the story's mechanics. Swappable with "teach" or "show" without major structural loss, though the patient, non-coercive quality fits "scheming pacifist."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cellular memory introduced early ("cells remembered the melody"), its mechanics detailed (body's archive, lullaby before language, cells dividing in crib), and drives the turn (firing in sequence, body playing melody back). Method shapes Maren's experience—no sound exists, only somatic sensation—forcing confrontation with pre-verbal imprint. Present in two beats: initial recognition and second cranking where cells recall "original instructions." Causal: without this mechanism, the soundless sanctuary and music box lack persuasive power. Specificity (wrists, sternum, knees) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Soundless sanctuary established immediately, its mechanics detailed ("not silence... but deeper negation"), and crucially constrains the middle choice—no auditory feedback forces Maren to rely on cellular sensation. Setting returns at closure as walls thin, releasing her to market noise. The sound-negation property is indispensable: the music box's melody must be felt rather than heard to bypass Maren's conscious defenses. Two beats: entry/disorientation and the forced somatic experience. Without this exact setting property, the cellular memory method fails. Charges final image: sound returning "all at once."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Reality shifts" anchors entry (cobblestones dissolve, air folds) and exit (walls thin, pulling back toward market). Timeframe pressure operates as ontological rather than clock-driven—Maren exists in threshold space while the woman teaches. Present in three moments: entry fold, sanctuary duration, exit shift. The shifts constrain by removing Maren from daily causality, enabling confrontation. Slight dock: no ticking urgency within sanctuary; time feels suspended rather than tightening choices. Still, the frame is necessary—without reality-shift mechanism, the encounter lacks its dislocated, threshold quality.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation seeded early (resentment as load-bearing, twenty-three years), tested in middle (pull it out and identity collapses), and dramatized at closure (setting box down, weeping, releasing). Internal conflict vivid: anger as architecture versus body's original instructions. The woman's question—"Will you let it go?"—forces choice with visible cost. Maren's final action (not fixing, holding differently) earns the release through cellular pressure. Two beats with friction: recognition of resentment's function, then renunciation. Cost legible: weeping, structural collapse risk, door/wall reconfiguration.</comment>
