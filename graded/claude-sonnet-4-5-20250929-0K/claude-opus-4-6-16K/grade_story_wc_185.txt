<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vael's interiority is specific and embodied through her mapkeeper inheritance, and her decision to use the echo chamber stone emerges from embodied perception of the ice patterns. The character's micro-choices (crawling to the smooth ice, waiting for the stone to absorb) drive the closure with visible cost—she stakes her life's work on an intuitive reading. Minor slip: the energy beings' shift to reverence at the end lacks sufficient contradiction or resistance to feel fully earned as character interaction, though Vael's internal arc remains clean.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Vael's search for the bloom of hush → reading ice cracks as acoustic map → capturing the interference pattern → projecting peace outward. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the storm finds its quiet) with visible cost: the caves are permanently altered, Vael must chart a new peace rather than preserve the old. The final image—mapping fresh ripple marks while energy beings watch—reconfigures her role from archivist to negotiator with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The harmonic caves function as active constraint: their acoustic properties drive Vael's tactics (seeking interference nodes, reading frozen stress patterns). The ice sheet in chamber seven is micro-setting that enables the solution—crack patterns as frozen sound map. The gently luminous quality charges multiple beats (quartz seams, smooth ice, echo chamber stone, final scene) and participates in closure. Spatial choreography (moving deeper, kneeling, crawling to the corner) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the ripple marks and thus her inheritance—is signaled immediately and tightens when the energy beings' presence begins fracturing the patterns. The ice-reading beat meaningfully narrows options: Vael finds one smooth patch that reveals where frequencies cancel. Agency is clear: she chooses to use the echo chamber stone, and the projection of hush forecloses the path of violent expulsion or passive destruction. Cost is visible: the old scripture is gone, replaced by a "new peace" she must chart from scratch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bloom of hush emerges as theme through concrete particulars: canceling waves, smooth ice, the geode's absorption. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing—coexistence is not harmony restored but a new language the caves must learn. The "hammered repose" that "softened from iron to copper to something almost like breathing" avoids abstract resolution; it remains a negotiation with cost. The final image of Vael mapping fresh ripple marks reweights her role from preserving scripture to chronicling living change, and "the storm had not ended. It had found its quiet" delivers conceptual repricing without thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Vael's perceptual signature (reading surfaces as language, filtering sound through mapkeeper idiom). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "hammered repose," "bloom of hush," "echo chamber stone" feel organic to her inheritance rather than authorial ornament. The prose modulates appropriately—compressed syntax during the search, expansive rhythm at closure. Minor texture slip: "something she chose to call reverence" reads slightly hedged rather than committing to the POV's interpretive confidence, but it does not break distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance situation or image. Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language ("rivers of pale fire," "a bell being forged") remains coherent. Two pattern issues prevent higher scoring: "gently luminous" recurs five times across the text (ice, beings' light, echo stone, final scene) with diminishing specificity, approaching decorative repetition. Additionally, "resonance/resonate/resonant" appears in seven distinct lines, creating mild synonym churn. Neither obscures causality, but the texture feels slightly algorithmic in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—acoustic mapkeeper uses frozen sound patterns to find interference nodes—is specific and non-obvious. The synthesis of harmonic caves + energy beings + ice-crack divination + echo chamber stone feels inevitable in hindsight. However, the energy beings' immediate compliance ("as though they had been waiting for someone to show them how to be quiet") leans toward wish-fulfillment resolution without sufficient friction. The transformation from screaming to whispering happens too smoothly given the three-day crisis setup, undercutting the risk that would elevate this into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vael's role as ripple-mark mapkeeper frames the opening, drives her middle choice (reading ice cracks via mapkeeper knowledge), and shapes the ending where she charts new marks. Her decision to use the echo chamber stone and her final act of mapping fresh patterns are protagonist-driven turns with visible cost—her life's work is transformed rather than preserved.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone is introduced early (her grandmother carried it), used in two distinct beats (absorbing the hush from smooth ice, projecting it outward), and charges the closure (the hush blooms chamber by chamber). The stone's mechanics—crystals calibrated to capture resonance—constrain her tactic and enable the resolution with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Bloom of hush is signaled in paragraph four (grandmother's teaching), shapes Vael's search tactic (seeking the interference node where noise gentles), and delivers the closure effect when the echo stone projects that pattern outward. The concept alters options: without finding this specific acoustic phenomenon, she cannot solve the crisis. It participates in the final image ("the hush bloomed") with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Gently luminous appears early (quartz seams, smooth ice patch, echo chamber stone when it absorbs hush, final scene), and the smooth luminous ice signals the interference node Vael needs. However, the trait functions more as atmospheric marker than hard constraint—other sensory cues (sound, crack patterns) could substitute with minor edits. It enriches texture but does not drive irreplaceable causality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Conjure is the climactic action: Vael raises the echo chamber stone, invokes the mapkeeper's words, and the stone projects the captured hush outward. This act redefines options (the energy beings dim, the screaming softens) and delivers the closure reconfiguration. The story hinges on this exact action—passive observation or physical intervention would not achieve the same resonance-based resolution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Examining crack patterns in ice is introduced early (paragraph eight), and its mechanics matter: cracks map acoustic forces, smooth ice reveals cancellation nodes. The method constrains Vael's approach (she must read stress patterns, not guess) and enables the middle turn (finding the one smooth, luminous patch). Swapping it for generic "listening" would weaken causality; the ice as frozen record is specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Harmonic caves pressure every choice: their acoustic properties cause the crisis, guide Vael's search (seeking interference nodes within chambers), and supply the ice resource (thermal chaos from energy beings froze surface water). The seventh chamber's ice becomes micro-setting that alters tactics. The caves' new ripple marks in the ending image complete the setting's arc from screaming to charting coexistence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrived" is anchored ("three days ago") and creates urgency—fracturing ripple marks establish immediate stakes. However, the time pressure does not tighten decisions beat-to-beat; Vael's search proceeds without visible time cost or escalating consequence. The timeframe frames rather than constrains, keeping it in mid-7s rather than higher integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to find the quiet in the storm is dramatized through Vael's search, signaled explicitly in paragraph four, and tested in the ice-reading beat where she chooses to trust her mapkeeper knowledge. The motivation costs her: she cannot restore the old scripture, only chart a new peace. Friction between preservation (want) and transformation (cost) is visible on the page and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Hammered repose is introduced early ("enormous, a hammered repose that struck her body like a bell being forged") and modulates with pressure: harsh during search, softening at closure ("from iron to copper to something almost like breathing"). The tone charges the final image through the contrast between violence and negotiation. However, "hammered repose" as phrase feels slightly imposed rather than emergent, keeping it below 8.0.</comment>
