<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edwin's motivation is embodied through three years of practice, the deadline framework, and his final singing despite seeing Bea. Interior contradiction shows in "mournfully eager" and his refusal to stop when he sees her trembling lip. The final cost—Bea's laughter "harder-won, shaped by everything she'd lost"—is earned and specific. Minor deduction: Bea's interior at the tunnel entrance leans slightly toward therapeutic phrasing ("the place where her mother's voice used to live") but recovers with embodied trembling.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: Bea's new laughter crystallizes options with visible cost (it's "not the room-filling sound of her childhood"). Causal lens holds: father's notebooks → Edwin's practice → deadline pressure → tunnel attempt → Bea follows → sound "macerated her careful composure" → laughter emerges. One meaningful tightening (Bea's appearance) narrows Edwin's options and deepens the stake. Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two. Cost is legible in the transformed quality of the laughter and the three-year trajectory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tunnel's acoustic properties constrain Edwin's method and charge the closure: "geometry… concentrated… into a frequency." The concrete details (quarter mile, smooth concrete, six leaf blowers on stands, interference patterns) ground the attempt. The tunnel functions as micro-setting that enables the pivotal beat—sound "finding" Bea's sealed spaces. The final echo image depends entirely on the chamber's reverberant properties. Spatial choreography (mouth to entrance, Edwin turning to see Bea) remains clear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore Bea's laughter) is signaled early and tested continuously. The deadline (tenth birthday, final grain) creates urgency; the party's failure forces Edwin into the tunnel. One major tightening: Bea's unexpected arrival raises the stakes and transforms Edwin's solitary attempt into a shared moment. Agency is clear—Edwin keeps singing despite seeing her. The cost is visible: Bea's new laughter is "harder-won," not the childhood version, and Edwin has accepted this diminished restoration rather than selling the estate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tunnel's dual function: engineering joy versus acknowledging loss. The story resists easy restoration—the laughter returns "small… newer, harder-won," not the childhood version. The final image (echo of something restored) answers the thematic question non-literally: grief can be acknowledged but not erased. "The tunnel didn't heal those spaces. It simply acknowledged them" avoids moralizing by staying concrete. The leaf blowers, initially absurd, gain resonance as instruments of "the unspoken." No late symbolic convenience; all elements seed early.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Edwin's POV until Bea's paragraph, which shifts to her focalization at a clear transition ("She stood at the tunnel's entrance"). The prose carries Edwin's particular filter: "mournfully eager," "the way rain softens earth that has been packed too hard." Diction remains consistent and specific ("macerated," "granular"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during the singing, pulling back slightly for the final image. No head-hopping within paragraphs. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear sparingly and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "Bea had blown out her candles with the focus of someone defusing a bomb" conveys action, emotional state, and characterization). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the leaf-blower sequence, breathing in the final paragraph. Minor deductions: "the things people carried but never named, the weight between words" is near-paraphrase in adjacent clauses (−0.2). "True haunting made audible" and later "simply acknowledged them" trend slightly abstract for peak beats. No loops or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The leaf-blower symphony premise is specific and non-obvious, avoiding the grieving-parent template through acoustic engineering and the father's legacy. The tunnel as "acoustic experiment… cathedral" synthesizes setting and method freshly. Bea's laughter returning "small… newer, harder-won" resists the tidy restoration trope. The ending's restraint—Edwin "listening to the echo of something restored"—earns its ambiguity through prior particulars. Risk-taking (the absurdist leaf blowers, the dead-serious execution) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Edwin's role as conductor is established early ("leaf blower symphony conductor… practicing since the silence came") and drives two key beats: the tunnel setup and the decision to keep singing when he sees Bea. His choice to continue despite her appearance is the story's pivot. The conductor identity is irreplaceable—his understanding of frequencies and his father's notebooks make the attempt possible. Cost is visible: three years of practice, the deadline pressure, and the final acceptance of a diminished restoration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pull cords appear in the opening frame ("pull cord handles wrapped in electrical tape worn thin by grief") and once more in action ("He pulled the first cord"). The "worn thin by grief" detail charges the handles thematically but they don't recur or constrain a later choice. The handles signal Edwin's long practice but could be replaced by switches or buttons without structural loss. They don't participate in closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Tending to the unspoken" is established through Edwin's understanding ("He had spent his life tending to it") and the father's theory, then drives the entire tunnel attempt: sound reaching "the part of the human heart that language couldn't touch." The concept shapes tactics—Edwin sings to "give the unspoken a voice." It's enacted at closure when the tunnel "acknowledged" Bea's sealed spaces rather than healing them. The laughter's return literalizes what was previously unspoken. Irreplaceable and causal across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Mournfully eager" appears once in the text ("carrying the desperate energy of a man who refuses to accept a final answer" expands it). The trait enables Edwin's descent despite three years of failure and constrains his method—he's not triumphant or certain, which colors his off-key singing. It's visible in his decision to keep singing when he sees Bea trembling, choosing connection over technical perfection. The trait contributes to tone but could be conveyed through action alone; the label adds precision without being indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Macerate" appears twice with distinct function: first as verb ("walls macerated into something granular") describing the tunnel's acoustic transformation, then as the key beat ("macerated her careful composure… the way rain softens earth"). The second use is the story's fulcrum—sound breaking down Bea's defenses without cruelty. The word's specificity (grinding into particles, softening through moisture) makes the mechanism concrete and charges the closure. Swapping for "dissolve" or "break down" would lose the textural precision and the callback structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Half-sung lullabies are signaled mid-story ("Then Edwin began to sing") and the method is specified: "Hush Little Baby," "All the Pretty Horses" fed into the machinery, torn apart and reassembled by the tunnel. The off-key quality and the songs' origin (ones he sang to infant Bea) shape the emotional charge. The method is irreplaceable—recorded music or instrumental sound wouldn't carry the father-daughter history. It enables Bea's response and appears in the final beats ("he sang, off-key and aching"). Two beats, causal, closure-linked.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is established in paragraph one with specific mechanics (quarter mile, smooth concrete, acoustic experiment, six leaf blowers arranged for interference patterns). It constrains method—Edwin must use this exact space for the frequency theory to work. The tunnel's geometry "concentrated… into a frequency" is the mechanism that reaches Bea. The setting shapes multiple beats: the father's legacy, Edwin's three-year practice, the sound's physical transformation, and the final echo. The closure image ("echo of something restored") depends entirely on the chamber's reverberant properties. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled early ("the night after the final grain slips through the hourglass… Bea's tenth birthday") and creates urgency—this is Edwin's deadline. The party's failure hours earlier drives him into the tunnel. Three years of practice and the arrival at the terminal moment shape his "mournfully eager" state. The timeframe tightens the decision (now-or-never pressure) and its aftermath quality charges the tone. It doesn't tick visibly during the tunnel scene but the deadline framework makes the attempt legible and necessary. Two beats, strong causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The motivation (restore Bea's laughter) is established in paragraph two, dramatized through three years of failed attempts ("no amount of cartoons or tickling or desperate clowning"), tested at the birthday party, and drives Edwin's tunnel descent. Friction between want and cost is visible: Edwin's deadline means selling the estate if he fails. The motivation shapes his choice to keep singing despite vulnerability when Bea appears. The closure reconfigures the goal—the laughter returns but "small… newer, harder-won," not the original version, an acceptance with visible cost. Indispensable and conflicted across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"True haunting" is enacted through the tunnel's transformation of lullabies into "something older, stranger" and the description of sound as both intimate (childhood songs) and uncanny (torn apart, "words became unrecognizable"). The tone charges Bea's reception: sound entering "through the parts of her she'd sealed shut." It modulates under pressure—initially mournful and desperate, then shared and resonant in the final echo. The final image ("echo of something restored") maintains the haunting quality—not triumphant restoration but spectral acknowledgment. The tone is coherent through turns and integral to the closure's affective charge.</comment>
