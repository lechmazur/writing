<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is fully realized through contradictory impulses—eccentric collector yet methodical investigator, isolated yet deeply empathetic. Her choice to keep rather than release the boutonniere is earned through prior causality and forecloses a path with visible cost (refusing the sea's logic of erasure). Interior texture is strong: "the sea spoke most honestly in the spaces between its sounds" is character-particular perception. Minor slip: the dying man's fragment "Lise" and his "patience of someone who had been practicing" edges toward elevated diction but remains within acceptable poetic compression for this voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly via Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren's refusal to drop the flower forecloses the expected release with visible cost—"a keeper's purpose was to hold the light a little longer than seemed reasonable." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the investigative middle deepens through pattern-building (logbook, train tickets, borrowed wool) and the final act reweights all prior particulars through the decision to keep. Orientation anchors early (lighthouse keeper, eleven years, opal dock). One meaningful tightening occurs when the logbook opens to reveal "For Lise, who waited at the opal dock," narrowing Maren's understanding and charging her final gesture with borrowed grief made permanent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The opal dock constrains the final choice—its iridescent surface and mist charge every appearance, and Maren's return there to stand "where Lise might have stood" makes setting indispensable to closure. Micro-setting (lighthouse kitchen table, logbook's swollen binding) enables discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "bruised light of nautical twilight," "mist erased the boundary between water and air." The lighthouse beam's "slow arc overhead" mirrors Maren's patient accumulation without stating theme. Only minor gap: the Alpine man's arrival mechanics remain vague, but this does not harm pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (decode the stranger's gesture to understand borrowed grief) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the logbook reveals Lise's wait. The discovery narrows Maren's options and forces her final choice between release and preservation, a trade-off with visible cost: she commits to "hold the light a little longer than seemed reasonable," refusing easy closure. Agency is renunciation with on-page price—carrying borrowed grief "for the rest of her years." Escalation operates under the Accumulative lens: each fragment (train tickets, old laces, coastal wool) deepens the mystery until the logbook crystallizes it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (borrowed memories, the ethics of keeping versus releasing, witnessed isolation as purpose) emerges from particulars without statement. The boutonniere shifts meaning three times: dying man's token, historical echo in the logbook, permanent star on Maren's coat—each reprise reweights the stakes. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally: "some things must be kept, not released" is shown through Maren's pinning gesture, not declared. Subtext operates in gaps: "borrowed and permanent and hers" fuses contradiction. The piece invites reflection on whether Maren's choice is generosity or appropriation, resisting tidy morals.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren reads absences ("observing gaps"), and her attention lingers on salvaged fragments. Voice modulates under pressure without breaking—elevated diction ("meticulous care," "nautical twilight") is consistent with her literary collector's mind and the contemplative tone. No head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens appropriately: "Maren's hands trembled" embodies emotion without filter-verb stacking. The dying man's Alpine accent and fragmented speech distinguish him briefly. Minor note: "stopped breathing with the patience of someone who had been practicing" is poetic but slightly risks overwriting; it holds because it aligns with the established lyric register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with strong imagery: "opal dock stretched into the mist like a pale finger pointing toward nothing" anchors voice and stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "four train tickets with different departure cities and no arrivals printed" advances mystery and characterizes the man). Minor loop: "borrowed memories" appears three times across the piece; the second mention ("she had been doing the same thing") edges toward paraphrase but reweights through self-recognition, so the effect is defensible. No filter-verb stacks or synonym churn. One phrase ("as if the book had been waiting for this particular twilight to exhale") risks purple but lands within the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: lighthouse keeper as curator of strangers' losses, investigative method via absences, and the ethical choice to keep rather than release borrowed grief. The combination of Alpine boutonniere, coastal wool, and opal dock is non-obvious and specific. Transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend entirely on these particulars. Risk-taking in the quiet, reflective ending heightens stakes without gimmickry—Maren's refusal is bold because it defies both narrative convention (cathartic release) and the sea's expected dominion. The "borrowed and permanent and hers" paradox is a singular authorial stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's eccentricity (collecting tide charts, logbooks, buttons) is established early and directly enables the investigation—she already possessed the logbook that solves the mystery. Her choice to keep the boutonniere is the story's decisive turn and forecloses release. Present in setup, middle (investigative method), and closure (pinning gesture). Causal pressure is strong: without her collector's habit, the logbook would not be available. Cost is visible: she commits to carry borrowed grief permanently.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The boutonniere appears in four beats: pulled from water, pressed into Maren's hand by the dying man, sketched in the logbook, and pinned to her coat at closure. Each appearance reweights meaning: token → clue → historical echo → permanent star. Causal: the flower's preservation (despite salt and current) signals care that drives Maren's investigation. The object is irreplaceable—its Alpine origin and meticulous preservation are unique properties that matter. Closure linkage is indispensable: "a small white star against the dark wool, borrowed and permanent and hers" charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Borrowed memories" shapes Maren's investigative lens explicitly: she recognizes the man carried "pieces of other people's stories, wearing them like armor or like evidence," then realizes "she had been doing the same thing." The concept constrains her final choice—keeping the boutonniere is an acceptance of borrowed grief. Present in setup (man's fragments), middle (Maren's self-recognition), and closure (boutonniere as borrowed and permanent). The phrase appears on the page and alters tactics: it reframes her collection habit as ethical stance. Minor limiter: the concept is slightly tell-heavy ("borrowed memories" is named) rather than purely dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" appears twice as description (her accumulation habit, her lantern) and once as enacted trait: Maren returns to the dock despite authorities closing the case, and she refuses to drop the flower despite convention. The trait enables her investigation—persistence drives her to force open the logbook and walk back to the dock at night. Cost is visible: her refusal to release the boutonniere commits her to lifelong witness. The phrase "softly persistent against the thickening dark" charges the final image. Present in setup (described), middle (enacted through investigation), and closure (lantern image).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Investigate" is the central action that drives all middle beats: Maren spreads her collection, opens the logbook, decodes the man's borrowed fragments, and returns to the dock. The investigation is "not for the authorities...but for herself," establishing motive. Major turn occurs when the logbook reveals Lise's wait, redefining the mystery as historical and recursive. Present in setup (decision to investigate), middle (active beats), and closure (investigative conclusion informs her choice to keep). The action is irreplaceable—without investigation, the story becomes passive receipt of a gift. Cost: investigation leads to burden of permanent witness.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" is signaled early ("she began by observing gaps. This was her method for everything: reading what was absent rather than what was present") and demonstrated through specific beats: no identification, train tickets with no arrivals, new shoes with old laces, Alpine flower with coastal wool. The method constrains her investigation—she reads absence rather than declaration. It shapes the logbook discovery: the swollen binding was a gap she'd left unforced for eight years. Present in setup (named method), middle (enacted across clues), and closure (the method's patience mirrors her final choice to hold rather than release). Minor limiter: the method is somewhat tell-declared before being shown.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The opal dock is indispensable: its iridescent surface and mist charge every appearance, and it serves as the story's recurring anchor and final stage. The dock constrains Maren's investigation—it's where the man arrived and where Lise waited, making it the site where past and present converge. Spatial: "far edge," "slick with condensation," "glowed faintly, holding its own ghostly light." The dock's specific properties (opal, mist-obscured) make it irreplaceable. Closure linkage is decisive: Maren returns to stand "where Lise might have stood," and the dock becomes the charged frame for her refusal to drop the flower. Present in setup (opening image), middle (investigative anchor), closure (final stage).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Nautical twilight" anchors the opening ("last bruised light") and establishes tone, but time does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The investigation unfolds across three days (man found, authorities come and go, Maren investigates "tonight"), but the clock is loose rather than pressuring. The timeframe supports atmosphere (mist, fading light) but does not alter tactics—Maren could investigate at any hour without consequence. Present in setup (named and described) and closure (night walk with lantern), but missing middle development as constraint. Lyric allowance applies: the twilight charges the mood and final image, reaching mid-6s, but lacks causal pressure for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To decode a stranger's final gesture" is Maren's explicit motivation, stated early and enacted across investigation beats. Friction is present: she investigates "not for the authorities...but for herself," and the emotional cost (accepting borrowed grief permanently) creates tension between curiosity and burden. The motive drives the logbook discovery and shapes her final choice—decoding leads to understanding that the gesture was recursive (man following Lise's memory), which makes Maren's keeping an ethical choice rather than sentimental impulse. Present in setup (decision), middle (active pursuit), and closure (motive fulfilled with cost). The desire is conflicted: decoding brings clarity but imposes lifelong witness.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is coherent throughout and charges the final image decisively: Maren's eleven-year solitude, the dying man's solitary arrival, Lise's historical wait, and Maren's closing stance ("stand at the edge and refuse the dark its full dominion") all embody isolation transformed into purpose through witness. Tone modulates under pressure—opening contemplation, investigative focus in the middle, quiet defiance at closure—without breaking. The phrase "witnessed isolation had taught her that some things must be kept" directly links tone to thematic choice. Present in setup (lighthouse keeper for eleven years), middle (solitary investigation), and closure (final image of Maren alone on the dock, holding light and grief). Irreplaceable: the tone makes the keeping gesture resonant rather than sentimental.</comment>
