<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aldric's interiority is concrete and embodied—"hollowed," the trembling hands, the deliberate armor removal—with clear motivation rooted in withdrawal and rediscovery. The progression from hidden to "bare and human and terrified and radiant" earns the final stance through physical choices that foreclose retreat. Minor slip: "shivering bliss" and "radiant" edge toward label-only at peak moments, slightly diluting embodiment. The arc from visor-down isolation to unsnapped vulnerability carries visible cost and contradictory terror/bliss that acts simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Aldric's ritual completes, the greenhouse erupts, reality fractures into "raw material of dawn," and he stands "woven back into the living world" with felt cost (armor stripped, face exposed, terror present). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—luminous details, alchemical particulars, choreographic patterns build density until the final cadence shift reweights possibility itself. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, knight, program) arrive early. One tightening: the program's discovery narrows his stance from gardener to performer of forgotten rites, crystallizing at closure with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse—breathing soil, mercury pears, gold resin, glass ceiling of endless night—constrains and enables the climactic ritual; the program lies beneath a specific tree, and the orchard's response (blossoms, new roots, scent of metals) charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and vivid without catalog excess. The body (armor removal piece by piece) functions as micro-setting, each clasp a wall coming down. Environment actively participates in closure: trees "erupted," air "filled," roots "broke the surface" where he stepped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconnection to purpose and the living world—signals early ("withdrawn," "hollowed") and tightens when Aldric recognizes the program's patterns as his order's lost rituals. The greenhouse "waiting for a knight" deepens urgency. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to move, to unsnap each piece of armor, to murmur the vow, forecloses the gardener role with visible cost (terror, exposure). The final image of fractured dark and "almost unbearably bright" possibility registers pressure and price. One micro-turn (realization "not a gardener. A knight.") sets up closure without duplicating the decisive act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—allegiance to becoming rather than fixed causes—emerges through particulars: the program's "Third Surrender," unsnapping armor as prayer, the vow "I serve the thing that might become," and the orchard's transformation into "raw material of dawn." The final image (visor fallen, face upward, reality shifting) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and gesture: each armor piece a wall, the murmured words "beneath memory," the program's puppet knight with crossed sticks. No thematic echo or sermon; the ending reweights prior material (seven years of night, withdrawn service) through embodied ritual and breathing roots.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: diction ("hollowed," "scooped out," "factually mystical") and rhythm reflect a withdrawn knight's formal, measured interior. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("documented in alchemical treatises, reproducible, yet defying every natural law") is legible and voice-motivated. Under peak stress (final ritual), syntax shortens ("He was capturing it") without losing texture. Minor slip: "shivering bliss," "almost unbearably bright," and "terrified and radiant" cluster elevated modifiers at closure, edging toward stock intensity rather than sustained specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully—long opening, shorter beats during armor removal. Figurative language is mostly coherent ("endless night folded," "draft through cracked glass"). Two frictions: "shivering bliss" recurs without fresh recontextualization; "raw material of dawn, the possibility of light waiting to be shaped" paraphrases the same idea within one beat. Loop penalty −0.3. No template cadence or major filter-verb stacks. Strong propulsion through action and image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—alchemical greenhouse, puppet-program choreography encoding knightly rites, murmured vow to possibility—is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of the "withdrawn knight" trope through mystical horticulture and ritual pattern-matching feels inevitable in hindsight. The vow "I pledge to the shape that has not yet formed" avoids platitude through concrete action (armor removal, root-breaking steps). Risk-taking (factually mystical setting, allegiance to formlessness) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Fresh inflection: marionette diagrams as living liturgy.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Withdrawn knight present throughout; his recognition of the program's patterns and decision to perform the ritual ("began to move," unsnapping armor) create the key turn that drives escalation and closure. Early signal, middle choice, closure participation all met. Specific cost: exposure, terror, renunciation of gardener passivity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Program introduced early (dwarf pomegranate tree), handled on-page ("hands trembled," "set down the program"), its choreographic notations guide his movements through the ritual, and its pages "fluttered" at closure with reweighted meaning (puppet to pattern-keeper). Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. Irreplaceability high: exact diagrams enable the forgotten rites.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Murmured allegiance shapes stakes ("the murmured words that meant he was no longer withdrawn but woven back") and is performed on-page ("He whispered it as he moved," "I pledge to the shape that has not yet formed"). Present at closure, alters options from isolation to integration. Causal work clear; cost tied to vulnerability and spoken vow.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" constrains the orchard's behavior (trees respond to ritual, roots emerge as silver) and enables the climactic transformation. The trait is demonstrated early (mercury pears, breathing soil, "reproducible, yet defying every natural law") and pays off when the orchard erupts with blossoms. Cost: the world's contradictions require surrender, not control. Present across beats and at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Unsnapping (gorget, vambrace, pauldron, visor) is the physical spine of the ritual; each piece removed is "a wall coming down," and the final visor-drop precedes the orchard's full transformation. The action is irreplaceable—armor defines his withdrawal, its removal enacts surrender. Causally central, repeated across beats, charges closure. Visible cost: nakedness and terror.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Forgotten patterns signaled early (program's choreographic notations, "footwork drilled into him as a squire"), constrain his movements ("The forgotten patterns guided his feet"), and shape the ritual's success. Mechanics matter: exact steps and turns make roots break surface. Present at closure ("patterns, and breath, and the allegiance"). Causal role in middle and ending beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Greenhouse shrouded in endless night pressures the entire narrative: seven years without sunlight, glass ceiling showing darkness, trees that respond to ritual. It supplies resources (program beneath tree, breathing soil, luminous fruit) and transforms at closure (fractured dark, blossoms, scent of metals). The setting is indispensable—remove it and the story's logic collapses. Early signal, middle constraint, ending charge all met with high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"As reality shifts" frames the timeframe; the endless night "rippled," constellations "rearranged," and the greenhouse responded in real-time to Aldric's movements. The shifts tighten urgency—"Outside the panels, reality shifted—he could feel it"—and the final "reality shifted one final time" marks closure. Present early and at ending, alters tactics by signaling the orchard's readiness. Mid-high band: tracks pressure but is not as causally tight as other elements.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to "capture the shape of possibility" is dramatized through Aldric's realization ("He was capturing it"), his spoken vow ("I serve the thing that might become"), and the ritual that gives "form through motion, through surrender." Conflicted: terror and bliss act simultaneously. Present in middle choice and at closure with visible cost (exposure, terror). Causal role solid; slightly less irreplaceable than object or action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Shivering bliss" appears explicitly early ("shivering bliss move through him") and modulates under pressure: terror coexists with radiance at closure ("terrified and radiant"), and the final image is "crystalline, trembling, blissful, and almost unbearably bright." Tone coheres across beats and charges the ending. Minor slip: "shivering bliss" could be more embodied at first mention. Present setup to payoff.</comment>
