<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is concrete and her hierarchy of values—accuracy as prayer, integrity over safety—drives her choices under pressure. The decision to retrieve soil samples is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of safe observation. Minor slip: the "credibly curious" attribute is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene, and the final sitting "until it became night" reads passive rather than a charged renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure is Earned Stasis—Elara sits with dusk "like armor she had earned," foreclosing flight with visible cost (surveillance, professional threat). The piece accumulates pressure through pigeon testimony, redacted reports, and the followers, then resolves to a stance crystallization. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first two paragraphs. One tightening—the soil-sample coordinates—narrows her options and the final image reweights her devotion with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as micro-setting: it constrains choice (she cannot flee after being followed home) and charges the final image ("silence settle around her like armor"). The linden tree's "soft, trembling coins" and fountain murmur are filtered through Elara's meteorological lens. Spatial choreography is coherent. Minor gap: the anemometer is set down in the opening line but never returns; the eastern bank instruments and convoys are summarized rather than shown, slightly weakening the occupational specificity under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth-recording vs. bureau suppression) is signaled early and tightens through redacted forms, pigeon arrivals, and surveillance. The soil-sample coordinates force a trade-off: retrieve evidence or remain safely observing. The final choice—logging the slip and planning tomorrow's retrieval—narrows options with visible cost (professional jeopardy, physical risk). One meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens: the followers confirm that her lateral mapping has been noticed, raising the price of continued recording.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme (integrity as solitary devotion vs. complicity through silence) emerges from concrete actions—filing anomalies, logging pigeon testimony, planning the retrieval—without thesis statements. The final image ("the unremarkable was where truth survived, in margins and decimal places") offers a resonant answer to the central question through particulars. Minor slip: "accuracy was her form of prayer" edges toward thematic echo, and "politics that corroded the bureau's upper floors" is slightly abstract. The ending resists a moral and reweights prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-limited with tight psychic distance. Elara's perceptual signature—storm data, barometric readings, wind vectors—filters every observation. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("soft, trembling coins," "four knots, unremarkable"). Minor slip: "She was credibly curious" and "the kind of person who asked questions that sounded routine but opened locked doors" read as narrator intrusion rather than dramatized through her choices. No dialogue present; all beats are internalized action and reflection anchored in present stimuli.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high, rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language ("copper light," "coins on the flagstone") is controlled. Minor scaffold detected: "For eleven years she had been" and "Three months ago, the eastern district" are expository blocks that stall momentum. "She understood why they had followed her" restates what the prior paragraph already showed. The phrase "layers of tranquility" and "fountain murmur beneath bird call beneath the distant hum" approach stock lyricism without full embodiment. No loops touch closure; penalties remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—storm recorder as truth bridge, pigeons as covert testimony network, quarantine as evidence suppression—feels specific and non-obvious. The lateral mapping method (cross-referencing atmospheric particulates, convoy schedules, medical reports) is freshly applied. Risk is present: the protagonist's passivity (sitting rather than fleeing) could alienate readers, but the piece commits fully. Minor derivative element: the lone whistleblower vs. corrupt institution is a familiar template; transformation through meteorological specificity and pigeon mechanics elevates but does not fully escape the genre scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as storm recorder shapes stakes (her data forms the evidentiary bridge) and enables the lateral mapping. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (filing anomalies, cross-referencing), and closure (logs the slip, plans retrieval). Two distinct beats: filing redacted forms and deciding to retrieve samples. Causal pressure: her meticulous records make her a threat, triggering surveillance. Closure linkage: she closes her logbook and sits with earned resolve. Swappability: a nurse or supply clerk could perform similar lateral mapping with minor edits; the meteorological specificity constrains but does not render the role indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The message tube appears in three beats: first arrival five weeks ago, more arriving intermittently, and the newest tube with soil coordinates. Causal work: the tubes supply testimony that, cross-referenced with Elara's data, reveal the suppression. Closure linkage: uncapping the newest tube and folding the slip into her logbook directly shapes her next-day retrieval plan. Specificity: brass tube, nurse's handwriting, dates and symptoms. Minor swappability: encrypted digital messages or coded letters could serve the same function with modest rewriting, reducing indispensability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rogue quarantine zone is the story's dominant stake generator: it creates the evidence Elara must record and the suppression she must resist. Present in setup (three months ago seal), middle (atmospheric particulates, convoy mapping), and closure (soil samples buried inside the zone). Causal pressure: the zone's unofficial status and the cover-up drive the surveillance and threaten her career. Closure participation: the coordinates point inside the zone, making retrieval the next beat. High irreplaceability: remove the zone and the entire conflict collapses; no near-synonym exists.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" is labeled in one sentence ("She was credibly curious, the kind of person who asked questions...") but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible cost in scene. Setup present (mid-story summary). Development: the attribute enables her lateral mapping (cross-referencing schedules, symptoms, weather). No direct closure linkage; the final choice stems from integrity rather than curiosity. Cost: her curiosity makes her a target (surveillance), but this is told rather than shown in a micro-choice under pressure. Swappable: "methodical" or "persistent" could replace with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears once: "she had begun to intuit a shape that no single data stream could reveal alone." This realization (the zone conceals a manufactured outbreak) is the story's central knowledge turn. Setup unclear (the verb arrives mid-story). Development: the intuited shape drives her understanding and next moves. Closure linkage modest: she acts on the intuition by planning retrieval, but the verb itself does not reappear. Causal work: the intuition redefines the stakes from disease containment to evidence suppression. Swappability: "deduce," "infer," or "conclude" could replace without major edits, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"By progressing laterally" is named once: "By progressing laterally—mapping logistics against weather data against pigeon-delivered medical reports—she had begun to intuit a shape..." Setup present (mid-story). Development: the method enables her to see the suppression pattern invisible to single data streams. Closure mechanics: she plans to use "a route dictated by wind corridors she knew were unmonitored—another lateral step." Two beats, both tied to evasion and synthesis. Specificity: cross-referencing disparate streams. Modest swappability: "triangulating" or "synthesizing" could serve similarly, though "lateral" carries spatial connotation that fits her wind-corridor tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The courtyard appears in setup (first scene beat), middle (pigeon arrivals on the wall), and closure (sits beneath the linden until night). Micro-setting work: after being followed, she cannot flee; the courtyard becomes the space where she processes threat and commits. The linden and fountain provide sensory anchors that charge the final image ("layered tranquility," "silence settle around her like armor"). Causal constraint: the courtyard is where the pigeons land, making it her information node. Cost: remaining visible in the courtyard after surveillance is a risk she accepts, foreclosing flight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"After being followed home" anchors the story's present frame: she has just returned under surveillance. Setup immediate (first paragraph). Development: the followers' presence tightens her options (she cannot leave, must act carefully). Closure: the timeframe compresses decision ("Tomorrow she would retrieve the soil samples"), and sitting until night becomes an act of visible endurance. The clock is not live-ticking but the "after" creates urgency. Modest time tracking: dusk → night passage is felt but not granular. The timeframe shapes the choice to stay rather than flee, adding cost to her stance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To nurture integrity in solitude" is stated once: "she performed it to nurture integrity in solitude, far from the politics that corroded the bureau's upper floors." Setup present (early). Development: the motive is dramatized through her filing anomalies despite redaction and logging pigeon testimony despite risk. Closure: folding the slip into her logbook and planning retrieval enact the integrity motive with visible cost (career, safety). Friction between want (solitude, accuracy) and cost (surveillance, confrontation) is legible. Minor label-only slip: the phrase itself is told; the choice to stay in the courtyard rather than flee shows the motive under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Layered tranquility" appears twice: opening courtyard description and final image ("the courtyard held its layered tranquility—fountain murmur beneath bird call beneath the distant hum"). Tone modulates: the opening tranquility is routine; the closing tranquility is charged with surveillance threat and her resolve ("silence settle around her like armor"). Setup strong, closure reprise reweights the calm as a form of resistance rather than escape. Coherence across turns: the tone remains contemplative even as pressure mounts, fitting the Accumulative lens. The calm becomes a weapon ("armor she had earned"), transforming passive atmosphere into active stance.</comment>
