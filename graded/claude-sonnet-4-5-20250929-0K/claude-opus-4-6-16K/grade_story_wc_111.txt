<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is embodied through her forty-three years of vine-dressing and the physical reality of hands once smooth, now withered. Her fabrication of luck indices arises from a clear hierarchy of values—survival in the maze she knows—and the marble-polishing ritual grounds her commemorative impulse in tactile detail. The assessor remains functional but flat, present only to apply external pressure. Internal contradiction between her "wisely pragmatic" deception and her belief that it's "the most honest thing she had ever done" operates thematically but doesn't create on-page friction in her choices at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure at closure. The piece accumulates through marble ritual, hedge behavior, and the assessor's arrival to a Charged Poise moment when "the hedge swayed toward Maren in the windless air" and even the assessor sees it. Orientation anchors early (Helical Maze, post-Quantification, Maren as vine dresser). The closure reconfigures the stakes—her mended deception versus the garden's knowledge—into a visible standoff where "the numbers disagreed" but the hedge's lean toward her offers undeniable pressure. Cost is conceptual and relational: her fraud remains unresolved, the assessor's tablet cannot account for the anomaly, and the moment crystallizes without resolving the external threat, qualifying as Charged Poise under RR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The maze itself constrains Maren's choices and charges the final image: she reads the hedgerows "the way a sailor reads water," the hedge bends toward her path in defiance of programmed geometry, and in the windless air it sways toward her at closure. The marbles, clay bowl on stone bench, and copper wire inscriptions ground her ritual in tactile micro-setting. Sensory hierarchy reflects her expertise—she knows turns not by memory but by how hedgerows lean. The setting is not postcard; it acts as co-agent in the final beat, making the assessor's tablet irrelevant.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Maren's mended deception will let her remain in the maze she has tended for forty-three years. The assessor's arrival tightens pressure when he notes the anomalous growth pattern. The hedge's curve "toward the path Maren always took" and her retrieval of a marble to commemorate the moment constitute a meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens: she marks a small victory even as the assessor's presence threatens exposure. The final beat—"The garden knows me"—crystallizes her stance with the cost legible in "the numbers disagreed" and the assessor's tablet unable to account for what is happening. One clear tightening (assessor's scan) and one deepening (hedge sway in windless air) suffice at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: cracked marbles wound with copper wire, hedgerows that lean toward their gardener, and the contrast between algorithmic luck indices and embodied knowledge accrued over four decades. The closing image—"the hedge swayed toward Maren in the windless air"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether gardens know their gardeners without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution: her fraud remains unresolved, the assessor's numbers still disagree, yet the maze's behavior charges the moment with undeniable pressure. No thematic echo or label-speak; the particulars (cracked glass, frost heave, copper inscription) accumulate to reweight the Quantification premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Maren's expertise: "She knew which turns led to dead ends not by memory but by the way the hedgerows leaned." Diction matches her voice—"wisely pragmatic," "mended deception," "stitched in small, precise dishonesty"—without register drift. The assessor's brief dialogue ("This growth pattern is anomalous") contrasts cleanly with Maren's terse reply. Psychic distance tightens at closure when the hedge sways and "for one unmeasurable moment, even he could see it." No head-hopping; the piece respects what Maren can know and filters all perception through her decades of bodily engagement with the maze.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("She lied.") alternate with longer, textured constructions ("It was survival stitched in small, precise dishonesty, and it let her remain in the maze she had tended since her hands were young and smooth."). Information density is high—marbles, copper wire, frost heave, hedge geometry—without padding. The closing beat avoids summary: "the hedge swayed toward Maren in the windless air" dramatizes the moment rather than explaining it. Minor scaffold appears in "That was the thing she wanted to prove" (telling what the prior paragraph already showed) and "Maren looked up into the green and the gold and the brown" (color list without fresh perception), costing −0.3 for two instances of near-paraphrase. No loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—falsified luck indices in a post-Quantification world where gardens know their gardeners—offers a fresh synthesis of surveillance bureaucracy and embodied knowledge. The marble ritual (cracked glass, copper wire inscriptions, polishing) particularizes her commemorative impulse beyond generic "small victories." The hedge that curves toward Maren's path and sways in windless air transforms the familiar trope of human-nature bond into on-page causality that defies the assessor's tablet. The closing beat feels earned in hindsight: forty-three years of her breath and sweat have threaded her nervous system through root and stem, making the maze's lean toward her inevitable rather than convenient. Slightly conventional in its sympathetic-gardener-versus-cold-system framing, but the cracked marbles and the "windless air" detail elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices drive the narrative: she fabricated her luck index (backstory setup), she moves through the maze reading the hedgerows, she retrieves and polishes a marble when the assessor questions the anomaly, and she speaks the closing assertion "The garden knows me." Her status as "withered vine dresser" for forty-three years shapes every perception and tactic. Present in setup, middle choice (marble retrieval), and closure assertion.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The marbles appear in three beats: introduced with their history ("thirty-one, each one cracked"), handled mid-scene when Maren retrieves one and wraps it with copper wire to commemorate the hedge's curve, and charged at closure when the assessor watches her inscribe today's date. The cracked surfaces and copper-wound specificity matter—they embody her decades of small victories. Their presence in the final beat elevates the moment when "the numbers disagreed" but the marble-marked victory stands. Strong integration; removing them would flatten the commemorative method and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Mended deception" frames Maren's survival tactic from the opening and shapes the stakes throughout: her falsified luck indices let her remain, and the assessor's scan threatens exposure. The concept recurs explicitly—"Her mended deception—those falsified numbers that kept her here—was, she believed, the most honest thing she had ever done"—and the closing beat hinges on it: "the numbers disagreed" yet the hedge's behavior validates her claim. The paradox (honest dishonesty) charges every choice. Indispensable to plot logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic" appears twice as a label: "she did what any wisely pragmatic woman would do: she lied" and "Wisely pragmatic to the last" when she answers the assessor. The trait enables the opening fabrication and her evasive reply about the hedge following light, but the label itself does no causal work that "pragmatic survival instinct" couldn't supply. Present in setup and one middle beat; constrains tactics but is not irreplaceable. Mid-band: shapes one turn but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Polishing appears in two beats: the ritual description ("she would polish each one, turning it in her palms until the glass caught whatever light filtered through") and the live action when "She polished it once between her palms" before setting it on the path. The act embodies her commemorative method and charges the moment when the assessor watches. The polishing itself—cracked surfaces gathering warmth like planets—particularizes the ritual. Removing it would leave the marble-marking intact but lose the embodied texture. Essential across beats; not quite indispensable (the copper-winding could carry the ritual alone), so upper-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Commemorating small victories elaborately" is signaled early (thirty-one marbles, each inscribed with date and deed on copper wire), mechanics detailed (polishing, wrapping, inscribing), and dramatized at closure when Maren retrieves a marble, polishes it, sets it at the hedge's base, and inscribes today's date while the assessor watches. The method shapes her identity and provides the tangible proof that counters the assessor's tablet. The elaborateness—copper wire, date inscription, polishing ritual—matters; a simple tally wouldn't charge the final image. Present in all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The Helical Maze is indispensable: its innermost chamber houses the marble collection, its hedgerows "so tall they swallowed sound" create isolation, its corridors force the assessor to follow Maren's path, and crucially, the hedge's curve toward her path and its sway "in the windless air" at closure provide the on-page proof that "gardens know their gardeners." The maze's anomalous geometry defies the assessor's tablet and supplies the story's decisive image. Spatial choreography (stone bench, junctions, hedge walls) remains coherent. Early signal, beat involvement (assessor scanning corridors), and closure participation (hedge sway) all met with irreplaceable specificity. Story logic fails without this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"After the Quantification, after luck became measurable and algorithmically assigned" frames the premise and creates the stake: Maren's falsified luck index is the only reason she remains. The timeframe tightens her situation—old hands were dismissed, optimized strangers replaced them—and the assessor's arrival with his tablet makes the temporal pressure live. The post-Quantification world rules constrain her options (she must maintain the deception) and charge the closure when "the numbers disagreed" but the hedge's behavior offers counter-evidence. Present in setup, shapes middle tactics (her evasive answer), and reweighted at closure. Strong integration; not quite indispensable (a generic surveillance-state frame could substitute), so mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To prove that gardens know their gardeners" is Maren's explicit motivation ("That was the thing she wanted to prove") and drives her choices: she reads the hedgerows as responsive, she believes "the maze had become an extension of her body," and at closure she asserts "The garden knows me." The motivation is dramatized in her reading of the hedge's lean and the marble-marking ritual. It conflicts with the Quantification system (which reduces cultivation to data) and is tested when the assessor questions the anomalous growth. The hedge's sway in windless air at closure vindicates her belief with visible cost: the assessor's numbers still disagree, her fraud remains unresolved. Desire shapes tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" saturates the piece: "The climbing roses had erupted in a late, furious bloom even as the lower leaves curled brown and dropped," "The roses above them were blooming and withering in the same breath, petals opening even as others fell." The tone modulates with pressure—early lushness ("green cathedral"), mid-scene urgency (assessor's scan), closing poise (windless sway)—and charges the final image when simultaneous bloom and decay frame the moment "the numbers disagreed" but the hedge offers undeniable proof. The tone is coherent, purposeful, and indispensable to the thematic reconfiguration. Fully integrated; story's emotional logic depends on this exact tonal register.</comment>
