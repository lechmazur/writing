<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Solenne's internal life is built through images and patient action, but her agency arrives late—the harvest is complete before page one, leaving only the execution. The courtesan's "chaste" contradiction is declared more than it shapes present micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion is sparse; much rides on "years of patience" in reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final smile-and-sigh feels asserted rather than earned by visible cost in the closure moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (courtesan, House, silver courtyard, prism sanctuary) arrive cleanly within the opening lines. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: threads and echoes accrete toward a pattern-break when the golden thread sings the Mistress's voice into the crystal walls. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Solenne becomes free "between that sigh and that smile," a crystallized reconfiguration where the cost (years of patience, the risk of discovery) is felt even if not yet paid on the page. The echo spreading through the House satisfies the lens and offers visible consequence, though the protagonist's final change is more stated than dramatized in a decisive action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The silver courtyard under snow and the prism sanctuary are rendered with vivid, purposeful detail—"walking across felt like crossing a frozen lake of light." Snow settles on flagstones, branches, and crystal panels, creating a micro-setting that charges the closure image. The sanctuary's acoustic properties (crystal amplifies echoes) directly enable the climactic act. Sensory selection is disciplined and serves the story's tonal aims without tourist-catalog breadth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—achieving freedom by revealing the charter's expiration—is signaled early and pursued with coherent method. However, the harvest of threads occurred off-page over years; the on-page action is execution only, not a tightening choice under live opposition. The Mistress and other courtesans exist as context, not present antagonists who adapt. The echo's spread provides consequence but arrives after Solenne's choice is already made, weakening the sense of a price paid in the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: the lullaby of conformity versus patient defiance, the architecture of control versus threads of truth. The final image—"the snow kept falling, serene and alarming in its indifference"—resonates without moralizing. However, "She had defied the lullaby of conformity not with a shout but with patience" is a thematic echo that risks tell. The piece invites reflection on freedom, surveillance, and collective liberation through concrete particulars, though the protagonist's epiphany ("she became free") is more asserted than earned through a visible on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature: "Her body moved through rooms with a poetic gravity, every gesture a verse, every stillness a stanza." Diction remains stable and purposeful; figurative language is dense but coherent. Focalization is tight; no head-hopping. The risk is register elevation—"yield, mirror, please" and "the residue of a moment" press toward abstraction—but the voice remains character-particular and the compression supports the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift; information density is high. The opening lullaby ("yield, mirror, please") and closing image (snow as indifferent witness) frame the arc cleanly. However, figurative density is high throughout: "poetic gravity," "verse," "stanza," "residue of a moment," "ribbons of color," "light itself seemed to pray." In the prism sanctuary beat, nearly every sentence carries metaphor without rest, risking overwriting even within an accumulative lens. A few paraphrase loops appear: "the echo continued to resonate" after "let it sing" and "The Mistress's voice filled the pavilion." No major artifacts touch closure, so penalties remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "chaste courtesan" premise and the prism sanctuary as resonance chamber offer fresh angles on the captivity/liberation arc. The harvest-of-threads motif is specific and non-obvious. However, the story's architecture—patient rebel collects evidence, reveals truth, liberates community—follows a familiar template. The "years of patience" and off-page preparation reduce present-tense risk. The synthesis is competent and lyric, but the central action (untangling threads, playing the golden echo) feels more ritual than struggle, limiting ingenuity in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Solenne's choice to cross the courtyard and play the golden thread drives the closure, but the harvest itself occurred off-page. She is the lens and agent, yet her defining work (collecting threads) is retrospective. On-page, she executes a plan rather than making a tightening choice under live opposition. Setup is early, development is implicit (years of gathering), and payoff is present (she becomes free, doors open). Causal pressure is moderate; the cost is stated ("years of patience") but not dramatized in a present trade-off. The character is essential to closure but her peak decision is execution, not a turn that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary appears in the opening paragraph (setup), is entered and used in the central beat (development), and its acoustic properties enable the closure (payoff). It is handled across multiple beats: Solenne crosses the courtyard to reach it, kneels inside, and stretches the golden thread between crystal facets to amplify the echo. Its specific mechanics—crystal walls that amplify echoes—are irreplaceable; no other setting would function identically. The sanctuary charges the final image as the echo spreads outward. Swapping it for a generic "secret room" would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "harvest of echoes" is the story's engine: Solenne collects threads carrying confessions, treasons, and the Mistress's admission. The concept shapes her long-term strategy and the climactic act (playing the golden thread). However, the harvest itself is retrospective; the on-page action is untangling and amplifying, not gathering under pressure. Setup is early (threads in the box), development is summary ("years she had been collecting"), and payoff is functional (the echo liberates the House). The concept constrains the ending but does not narrow present options or force a visible trade-off in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" is label-only: "Her body moved through rooms with a poetic gravity, every gesture a verse, every stillness a stanza." The attribute is described but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. It functions as characterization and tone but does not alter tactics or create a trade-off. Mentioned early, absent from middle choices, invoked thematically at closure ("every gesture a verse") without causal pressure. Swappable with "graceful" or "deliberate" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unlock" is the story's hinge: the golden thread "was the echo that would unlock everything." The action occurs on-page when Solenne stretches the thread between crystal facets and lets it sing, liberating the House. Setup is early (the key metaphor), development is the untangling work, and payoff is decisive (doors begin to open). The unlock is irreplaceable; no other action would function identically. However, the act itself is ritual execution rather than a choice under live opposition, moderating causal pressure. The unlock is essential but the cost tied to it is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is both method and constraint: "Each thread had to be separated without breaking, because a broken thread lost its echo." The method is signaled early (the box of threads), executed in the prism sanctuary beat (painstaking work by touch and instinct), and shapes the climax (separating the golden thread last). Its mechanics matter on the page and are irreplaceable. However, the untangling is presented as patient work already mastered, not a struggle under present pressure. The method enables the unlock but does not force a visible trade-off or narrow options in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The silver courtyard under snow is rendered vividly and appears in setup (opening paragraph), development (Solenne crosses barefoot, leaving impressions), and payoff (she steps out as the echo spreads). The snow functions symbolically—"serene and alarming in its indifference"—and the courtyard's pale stone and ornamental plum trees anchor the setting. However, the courtyard does not constrain tactics or supply resources that alter the outcome; it is a transit space and lyric frame rather than a micro-setting that pressures choice. The prism sanctuary does the causal work; the courtyard charges the tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Between that sigh and that smile, she became free." The timeframe is a lyric compression rather than a ticking clock. It appears only at the closure beat, offering no setup or middle constraint. The phrase is evocative and charges the final image but does not shape tactics, narrow options, or create urgency. Time is untracked through the untangling work; the story moves in accumulative rhythm, not against a deadline. The timeframe is a thematic flourish rather than a structural constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To defy the lullaby of conformity" is the story's explicit motivation, stated early ("the lullaby of conformity: yield, mirror, please") and reprised at closure ("She had defied the lullaby of conformity not with a shout but with patience"). The desire is dramatized through Solenne's chaste refusal and her secret harvest. However, the friction between wants and costs is retrospective—years of patience already paid—rather than a present struggle. The defiance is essential to the arc but more backdrop than on-page conflict. The motivation is told more than it is tested under live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Alarming serenity" is established early ("the silence inside was so complete it felt alarming, a serenity that pressed against the eardrums") and sustained through the untangling beat and closure ("The snow kept falling, serene and alarming in its indifference"). The tone modulates subtly: urgency is muted by patient action, yet the stakes remain high. The oxymoron charges the final image without contradiction. However, the tone does not shift under pressure; it remains static across beats. A coherent, purposeful tonal control that supports the accumulative lens and elevates the ending.</comment>
