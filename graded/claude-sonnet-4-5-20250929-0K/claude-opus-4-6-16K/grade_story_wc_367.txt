<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear—she wants to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows—and her prophetic nature drives the central tension. However, her "laughing storm herald" trait remains largely asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The examples of past prophecies (fisherman's cathedral bell, bleeding moon) read as backstory attestation rather than present choices under pressure. The final moment lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path; she continues her routine without meaningful change or renunciation earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (emerald lighthouse, Maren climbing at night) and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens through layered imagery. However, closure relies on Charged Poise—the feeling that dawn is "being steered into existence"—without a decisive change or visible cost on the page. The final image reweights prior material conceptually but the cost remains abstract and proclaimed rather than dramatized. The three prophecy examples (fisherman, child, ships) feel illustrative rather than causally linked to the present climb, weakening the before/after legibility required at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse is vividly realized through mineral veins, total internal reflection mechanics, and the hand-blown glass wick that channels light through crystalline structure. Sensory detail is purposeful—green luminescence, salt-starred sky, wind pouring through the gallery—and filtered through Maren's ritual familiarity. The setting constrains her nightly routine and charges the final image, though spatial choreography of the lamp room could be sharper. The micro-setting (the wick apparatus) functions as both tool and constraint, elevating the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—shaping a new dawn that remembers darkness—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal; Maren performs the same ritual she has performed every night without meaningful tightening or new pressure. The prophecy about "ships with sails made of questions" introduces a potential turn but remains abstract and unfulfilled on the page. No visible cost alters tactics or forecloses options; the routine continues unchanged, and the storm she feels building never materializes into present complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between old world (print newspapers, predictable horizons) and new world (formless, terrified), embodied in Maren's dual role as prophet and lighthouse keeper. The image of light that "included shadow" and the paradox of "shadowed elation" avoid platitudes. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit theme statement ("someone had to stand at the boundary and laugh and weep and cast the kind of light that included shadow") when the prior imagery could have carried the weight. The ending reweights prior material but stops short of a non-literal answer, leaning instead on conceptual assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with purposeful compression ("half-gasping, half-singing," "luminous grief that is indistinguishable from joy") that remains legible under the Accumulative lens. Psychic distance is stable; the narrative certainty matches Maren's prophetic but not omniscient perspective. The prose texture—archaic phrasing like "equal parts glow and shadow," "epochs when the coast was forest"—feels appropriate to character and setting. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("indistinguishable from joy," "formless, terrified, lurching between nostalgia and amnesia") that reads more authorial than filtered through a working lighthouse keeper's idiom, particularly in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language ("shadows pooled at her feet like obedient animals," "dawn was hours away, but she could feel it already") serves the lyric mode. Information density is high in the lighthouse mechanics passage. However, adjacent sentences often restate the same idea with synonym churn: "She wanted to shape a new dawn using these ancient shadows, to steer the world toward a morning that remembered its darkness" paraphrases the same concept twice. The phrase "equal measure" appears twice in close proximity. Template cadence runs in several passages ("She was the one who told them when the gales would come, when the tides would surge, when the sky would crack open"). These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 within the Non-closure cap, lowering the score from mid-7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse keeper, accidental prophet, and total internal reflection as both literal and metaphorical device offers a non-obvious premise. The post-print-newspaper timeframe and "ships with sails made of questions" add fresh inflection. However, the "reluctant prophet in a liminal role" template is widely used, and transformation through specific lived detail is limited; Maren's daily life and material constraints remain abstract. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode but the emotional arc—laughing herald continues her nightly ritual—lacks the bold risk or irreversible choice that would elevate originality into the high 7s or beyond.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her role as storm herald frames the piece, but her choices do not create key turns. She performs the established routine—climbs, lights, laughs, prophesies—without decision points that alter tactics. The prophecy about ships is spoken "half-gasping, half-singing" and "she didn't know what it meant," positioning her as vessel rather than agent. Early signal (+0.5) and closure presence (+0.4) lift the score, but lack of causal pressure or visible cost caps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass lantern wick appears in setup (description of the apparatus), is handled in the lighting beat ("She struck the flame. The wick caught"), and its total-internal-reflection properties charge the final image of dawn being steered "one reflected beam at a time." Three beats (+1.4), causal involvement in the central ritual (+0.8), closure linkage (+1.0), and irreplaceability (hand-blown, threaded with impurities, channels light through crystalline structure) combine for solid integration. However, the wick's specific properties do not constrain a choice or force a visible cost, preventing entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Otherworldly routine" is explicitly named mid-piece and shapes the structure: Maren's nightly climb, lighting, laughter, and prophecy form the arc. The routine provides the frame for her motivation (shaping dawn using ancient shadows) and the final image (dawn steered into existence). Setup clear (+0.6), two beats (the climb and lighting sequence, the prophecy moment) (+0.9), and closure linkage (the routine continues but is reweighted as active steering) (+0.9). Swappability is low; removing the routine collapses the piece. Reaches 6.1 with all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is established early with two prior examples (cathedral bell, bleeding moon) and demonstrated in the present scene when she speaks about ships with question-sails. Setup (+0.6), middle beat (the prophecy itself) (+0.4), and closure participation (villagers respond, lending weight to her words) (+0.5). However, the trait enables rather than constrains; there is no visible cost or tradeoff to her prophecies. The attribute could be replaced with "intentional prophet" or "divinely inspired" with minimal structural change, capping the score at mid-5s despite presence across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Steer" is the verbal spine: Maren's explicit motivation ("to steer the world toward a morning"), the lighthouse's historical function ("light could be steered not only outward but inward"), and the closing image ("being steered into existence, one reflected beam at a time"). Early signal (+0.7), present in her internal stance throughout (+0.9), and closure centrality (+1.2). The action redefines her nightly routine from passive ritual to active shaping. However, the steering remains metaphorical and abstract; no on-page moment shows her physically or tactically steering with visible consequence, limiting irreplaceability. Strong thematic integration but mid-causal pressure keeps it at 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Total internal reflection is explained in the setup (historical engineers, angled glass panels, light trapped and amplified), demonstrated when she lights the wick ("light cascaded through the angled panels, ricocheting, intensifying"), and metaphorically charged at closure ("one reflected beam at a time"). Three beats (+1.4), causal role (the mechanism enables the light that "includes shadow") (+1.0), closure linkage (+1.1), and high specificity (the physics detail is precise and irreplaceable) (+0.6). The method shapes her means of achieving the goal, though it does not constrain a choice with visible cost, preventing entry to 8+.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse is established immediately and remains the sole location. Mineral veins create green luminescence, the tower's total-internal-reflection structure traps and amplifies light, and the open gallery admits wind that triggers her prophecy. Setup (+0.8), multiple beats (climb, lamp room, lighting, prophecy moment) (+1.4), closure charge (the tower's glow guides the ships she prophesies) (+1.3), and irreplaceability (no other structure could combine these properties) (+0.7). The setting supplies both the tool (wick) and the conceptual frame (light that includes shadow), elevating integration to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the last print newspaper" is mentioned in the opening line and establishes the post-collapse world, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. The three-year gap is noted, and the present is "tonight," but no clock or deadline pressures her choices. The historical detail colors atmosphere but remains ornamental to the central action. Early mention (+0.4) and thematic coloring (+0.3) provide minimal credit, but swappability (could be "after the internet collapsed" or any other marker) and lack of causal work cap the score at 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Maren's desire "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated explicitly mid-piece and frames her nightly ritual. The motivation is present in setup (implicit in her role), developed in the reflection on old versus new world, and echoed at closure ("dawn was hours away, but she could feel it already"). Setup (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure presence (+0.8). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no friction between this want and a competing cost or fear appears on the page. The lack of visible tradeoff and the late explicit statement (not signaled early through action) cap the score at 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Shadowed elation" is embodied from the opening ("laughter was the only sound her body knew... unbearable and wonderful in equal measure") and sustained through "luminous grief that is indistinguishable from joy" at closure. The tone modulates with pressure—laughter rises as the storm builds, the final trumpet-like herald carries both elation and grief—charging the ending image. Setup (+0.7), coherent modulation across beats (+1.0), closure charge (+1.2), and specificity (the oxymoron is purpose-built for this character and moment) (+0.6). The tone is indispensable; removing the shadowed elation collapses the thematic and emotional arc, justifying 7.3.</comment>
