<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-specific, with crystallizing scars embodying stress without therapy-speak. Her hierarchy of values shows clearly in the choice to inscribe herself despite "old panic," and the crow-quill superstition grounds her belief system in lived contradiction. The final choice to continue inscribing is earned by her prior crystallization and the on-page softening of scar tissue, foreclosing retreat with visible cost. Minor: the "nine years old" reflection could have anchored more tightly to a present micro-choice earlier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren kneels in the arriving storm, quill in hand, with the new rune legible and the next scar waiting—options crystallized, cost undeniable, stance reconfigured from observer to active inscriber. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the ceremony, scar transformation, and storm convergence deepen in a single scene without causal reversals, and the final image reweights the opening breath-between-storms motif with pressure. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph (who, where, when). One meaningful deepening: the first inscription transforms rigid crystal into syntax, altering her relationship to all prior wounds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating platform, gorge layers, and moisture-thick air constrain Maren's solitary ritual and charge the closure: altitude "strips pretense," anchor-runes flare under storm pressure, and the basalt table grounds each implement with spatial clarity. The crow quill and clay bowl function as micro-setting that enables the inscription. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her scholar's priorities: ghost-nettle's "iron and green silence," crystallized scars "clicking," dissolving flakes. The storm's arrival alters conditions at closure, and the rotation motif tracks coherently across the piece.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform scars into legible syntax—is signaled early and tightens when Maren presses quill to scar despite crystallizing panic. One meaningful deepening: the rune takes hold, the lattice loosens, and the glyph repeats in miniature, proving the method works and redefining every remaining scar as sentence-in-waiting. Agency is decision and execution under pressure; the second storm's arrival raises cost (wind, rain, flaring runes) yet she begins again, foreclosing retreat. No antagonist required; the accumulative lens holds. Cost is felt in "audacity" and visible in the dissolving crystal and the act of kneeling through violence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—finding grammar for survived wounds—emerges from the rune inscription and crow-quill superstition without stating a moral. The scar-as-sentence and "belief had been enough to let her rest" motifs recur with shifted weight: childhood superstition becomes adult syntax. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: scars remain but hold language, and "altitude strips pretense" until only the essential remains. No thematic echo or label-speak in the ending. The piece invites reflection on the sufficiency of belief and the cost of rendering pain legible, resisting easy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with clean focalization. Perceptual signature is distinct: scholar's reverence for implements, scars as "white lattice," storm layers as "pages of a book." Diction remains within Maren's lexicon ("resonance condition," "phoneme," "glyph") without Wikipedia intrusion. Purposeful compression in "She exhaled" and "She picked up the crow quill once more" modulates rhythm under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance tightens appropriately at the inscription beat. No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("watched," "remembered") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance setting, character state, or ritual progress. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Minor template cadence in the opening ("the clay bowl, the dried leaves…the water flask") does not recur. One paraphrase loop: "the scars caught light" and "the scar tissue crystallized" restate the stress mechanism across adjacent beats but add detail each time, limiting penalty. Figurative language is controlled and coherent ("pooling like spilled ink," "dawn moving across a valley floor"). No grammar slips, no orphaned pronouns. The final paragraph's syntactic variety ("Rain struck…Maren did not move…she understood…she picked up") propels cleanly into closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of rune scholarship, bodily scars as substrate, and childhood superstition repurposed as adult grammar is specific and non-obvious. The floating tea-ceremony platform and crystallizing scar tissue avoid stock fantasy tropes. Emotional truth—superstition worked because belief allowed rest—grounds the magical turn. The transformation test passes: the story would collapse without Maren's scholar identity and scar history. Minor: the "breath between storms" frame and the master-taught ritual echo familiar training-arc beats, though the altitude-as-honesty insight and the decision to inscribe living flesh elevate execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout; her choices (setting out implements, pressing quill to scar, continuing after success) drive all beats. Her scholar identity shapes perception (gorge as book, phoneme precision) and the decision to inscribe herself is the story's hinge. Present in closure: she begins the next scar. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and two distinct beats (preparation, first inscription, decision to continue). Swappability is low: "rune scholar" is load-bearing for the inscription logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crow quill appears in setup (placed beside bowl), is used in the first inscription (pressed along scar, phoneme whispered), and returns in closure ("picked up…once more"). Its asymmetric edge and childhood origin (dead crow, protective superstition) are specific and reweighted: childhood belief becomes adult tool. Two distinct beats plus closure reprise. Causal pressure: the quill enables the rune and embodies the method. High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"A breath between storms" is signaled early (violet/darker curtains, corridor of stillness) and frames the ritual's timing window. It shapes stakes: Maren performs in the pause, and the second storm's arrival at closure tests endurance. The concept charges the final image: she kneels "between violence and violence" and continues. Causal pressure is moderate—it sets conditions but does not alter her choices. Closure linkage is strong; the motif recurs with reweighted meaning ("what had happened and what would come").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Crystallization is introduced early ("when stress built…the scar tissue crystallized") and constrains the first inscription: "old panic answering the altitude." The trait enables plot logic (scars as substrate) and is transformed on-page: crystal "softened, warming beneath the quill's path." It appears in closure indirectly (flakes dissolve, lattice loosens). Two beats: stress trigger, transformation. Causal pressure and specificity are high; cost is visible in the dissolving flakes and the choice to continue despite panic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Shed" occurs mid-story when "rigid crystal shed from her skin in flakes so thin they dissolved." This action is the physical proof of transformation and the turning point that earns her decision to continue. It is irreplaceable: no other verb captures the lattice releasing. Causal: shedding proves the method works. Closure linkage is indirect (she begins again because shedding succeeded). One major beat, high specificity, but late first appearance (~60% mark) caps slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Youthful superstition (crow quill, sleeping with feather under tongue, belief in protective magic) is seeded early and reweighted: "The superstition had worked not because of magic but because she had believed herself protected." This method frames the adult inscription as belief-made-syntax. It appears in one major reflective block and shapes the quill's use. Closure linkage is thematic (belief suffices) but not mechanical. Two gates (setup, payoff via reflection and quill use); middle development is light. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The floating platform is anchored early (sixty feet above gorge, basalt, anchor-runes) and pressures Maren's solitude and altitude-as-honesty insight. It supplies the table, constrains movement during the storm, and charges closure: "the platform into a slow rotation…anchor-runes flared violet beneath her knees." The setting shapes tactics (must kneel, must endure weather) and is present in the final image. Three beats: setup, rotation, storm arrival. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Held breath" is signaled early ("She held the breath. In the held breath, time flattened") and used to compress the reflection and first inscription. It does not recur or tighten decisions after the first third; the storm window takes over as timeframe. One beat involvement, no closure linkage. Lyric reprise: the opening breath motif returns thematically in "breathless stillness" but does not constrain the final choice. Mid-band for early signal and one clear use, but no escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren's desire to "give each wound its grammar" is dramatized in her choice to inscribe despite crystallizing panic and is tested when the rune succeeds: "Every scar on her body was a sentence she had survived without syntax." The motivation drives preparation, first inscription, and the decision to continue. Friction between cost (dissolving flakes, kneeling through storm) and desire is visible. Closure linkage is direct: she picks up the quill again. Three beats, causal pressure, and high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Saturated hush" is established early ("air so thick with moisture it seemed to have texture, weight, a pulse") and modulates under pressure: ghost-nettle's "green silence," the "breathless stillness," and the deepening hush as the second storm advances. Tone charges the final image: "the hush deepened around her…saturated, breathless stillness unique to the space between violence and violence." Coherent through turns, purposeful intensification, and closure linkage. High band for rhythmic control and motif charge.</comment>
