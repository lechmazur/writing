<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Esme's motivation is clear and her role as operator is well-established, but her interiority remains largely abstract. The callers (Gerald, Lina, Mr. Okufor) are sketched through their wounds rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "teach endings how to begin" principle structures their arcs but feels asserted rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; much is summarized rather than shown in pressured moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates caller stories and the glass disc motif, building toward a conceptual repricing of the "loop" as spiral rather than repetition. Orientation anchors early (Tunnel 7-C, Esme, phone booth). The closure lands with cost—Esme commits to permanent estrangement and the callers' transformations are earned through repeated contact—but the final image is more thematic statement than reweighted pressure. Causality is loose (the glass disc "haunts" acoustically without mechanical grounding), yet the accumulative lens tolerates this.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tunnel setting is vivid and specific: steam pipes, maintenance lamp hum, acoustic margins. The glass harmonica disc charges the final image by threading into the tunnel's acoustics and reweighting each caller's wound. Spatial choreography is clean (niche, phone booth, service ladder). The tunnel constrains Esme's estrangement and the disc's resonance shapes the callers' returns, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor deduction: the "hum of streetlamps" timeframe is more atmospheric than spatially constraining.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Esme's estrangement as instrument to midwife others' beginnings. The piece deepens through accumulation (Gerald, Lina, Mr. Okufor) and the glass disc introduction shifts the pitch of the loop. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is more additive than tightening; no visible cost forecloses a path for Esme herself. The callers' transformations are summarized ("He started volunteering") rather than shown as on-page choices with trade-offs. The "loop as spiral" realization reweights the stake conceptually but does not narrow Esme's options or force a sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the glass disc and wrong-number architecture: mistakes as genesis, loops as spirals, estrangement as creative instrument. The final image—"an ending curl back on itself and crack open into the raw, trembling pulse of a beginning"—reweights prior material without stating a moral. The "one degree" metaphor is specific and earned. Minor deduction: the thematic vocabulary ("estrangement," "loop," "beginning") is repeated almost to the point of echo, risking over-articulation. No diagnostic label-speak or prompt-language intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Esme; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("throat that had swallowed its own echo," "raw, trembling pulse"). The perceptual signature—acoustic focus, switchboard metaphors—is consistent. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful (Gerald's weeping/apology, Mr. Okufor's "Again"). Minor deduction: some elevated register ("cultivated this estrangement deliberately," "nurtured every one with the same careful principle") edges toward writerly distance rather than Esme's lived idiom under pressure. Filter verbs ("understood," "learned to read") are present but not excessive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and imagistically strong ("slim acoustic margin," "geometry test she had actually passed"). No loops or scaffold. Information density is high. Minor deductions: two instances of paraphrase redundancy ("the loop was not repetition. It was a spiral" immediately followed by elaboration of the same idea) and slight overwriting in the opening ("the way a gardener might cultivate nightshade: with patience, gloves, and full knowledge" is vivid but slows the beat). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. The final line is rhetorically charged but borders on thematic summary rather than image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—wrong-number friendships as therapeutic instrument, a glass harmonica disc haunting tunnel acoustics—is fresh and specific. The "loop as spiral" turn is conceptually earned. The synthesis of estrangement, acoustics, and emotional transformation feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative design, summary-rich character arcs) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the emotional arcs (Gerald's volunteering, Lina's rage-to-music) are told rather than shown, reducing the transformative surprise. No close echoes of famous work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Esme's role as operator frames the entire piece and her choice to descend and answer wrong numbers drives the setup. Her cultivation of estrangement and the decision to "keep them talking" shapes all caller interactions. However, her own choices do not create key turns; she remains an instrument for others' arcs. The final greeting ("Stay") is a stance crystallization but lacks a visible cost or tactical shift for Esme herself. Present in closure but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass harmonica disc appears in the second half, introduced by Lina. It is handled on the page (held to lamp, traced with wet finger) and its acoustic haunting reweights every subsequent caller interaction. It shapes the "loop as spiral" realization and charges the final image ("the glass disc singing in the pipes"). Strong closure linkage and causal pressure (the note shifts pitch, enabling transformation). Minor cap for late arrival (~40% mark) and the disc does not constrain a choice, only enables thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cultivated estrangement is signaled early ("cultivated this estrangement deliberately") and structures Esme's descent and her switchboard role. It shapes her tactic of keeping callers talking and her refusal to climb back up. The principle alters her options (she forgoes connection to facilitate others' beginnings). Present in closure ("the estrangement was the instrument"). However, the concept is more thematic frame than on-page constraint; no moment where estrangement forecloses a live alternative with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Melodically haunted" describes the tunnel's acoustic state after the glass disc is introduced. The haunting enables the callers' transformations (the note "lived in the pipes" and became "the hold tone"). It is specific and irreplaceable. However, it does not constrain an on-page action with cost; it is an atmospheric condition rather than a tactical pressure. Present in closure but passive. No visible trade-off tied to the haunting itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Loop" is central: Esme loops Gerald's grief, Lina's rage; the glass disc's recurring note loops through the tunnel; the conceptual turn—"the loop was not repetition. It was a spiral"—redefines the stake and charges the ending. The action shapes multiple beats (Gerald calling back on purpose, Lina's progression, Mr. Okufor's "Again"). Strong thematic and structural integration. Minor deduction: the loop is more conceptual tool than physical action with visible cost; swapping "loop" for "cycle" or "return" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Wrong-number friendships are the core mechanism, signaled early and sustained throughout. The switchboard catches mistakes "like a web catches moths"; each caller (Gerald, Lina, Mr. Okufor) arrives via misdial and stays. The method shapes Esme's tactics (she "kept them talking") and the closure ("You've reached somewhere you didn't mean to. Stay"). Strong setup, development, and payoff. Minor deduction: the friendships are recounted rather than dramatized in pressured scenes, reducing causal visibility.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel is vividly established (niche, steam pipes, concrete, maintenance lamp) and houses the phone booth and switchboard. It enables Esme's estrangement (sixty feet below ground) and the acoustic haunting (pipes carry the glass note). The service ladder facilitates Lina's descent with the disc. Present throughout and in closure. However, the tunnel does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is stage more than pressure. Micro-setting (the disc, the phone) does more causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Between the hum of streetlamps" is poetic framing for the acoustic margin in which the phone rings. It is mentioned in the opening and closure but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. No live clock or temporal pressure. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical. Swappable with "after midnight" or "in the quiet hours" without structural loss. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Esme's motivation—to "teach endings how to begin"—is stated explicitly and structures her approach to each caller. It drives her descent, her tactic of looping grief and rage, and her final stance ("ready to answer"). The motivation is conceptually clear and thematically charged. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted on-page choices with visible cost. No moment where teaching endings competes with another want or imposes a sacrifice. Present in closure but more principle than friction.</comment>
