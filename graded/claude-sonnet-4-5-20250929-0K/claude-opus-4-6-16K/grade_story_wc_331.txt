<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is richly textured through her grandmother's inheritance and hyperbolic-geometry worldview, but her character operates primarily in observation and arrangement rather than pressured choice. Paul functions as witness rather than applying interpersonal pressure. The ending registers a realization ("understood that she had not created this resonance but reawakened it") but the cost of this discovery—what path it forecloses, what she must now renounce or endure—remains abstract rather than embodied in a concrete micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (Maren, library, odd hours). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Maren's methodical rearrangement builds density toward the resonance moment. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (she recognizes the resonance was always present), but the cost—what this recognition demands of her next, what option it forecloses—is felt atmospherically rather than made concrete in the final image. The "waited for the next odd hour to begin" gesture nods toward Earned Stasis but does not dramatize a visible trade-off or refusal on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The library setting is vividly particular (telegraph office bones, volumes that exist nowhere else, hyperbolic filing) and the scarf functions as a recurring tactile anchor. Maren's body and movement through stacks shape the accumulative pressure. The final image of books "curving gently toward one another" extends the hyperbolic-geometry motif into spatial choreography, charging closure with conceptual weight even if physical constraint on choice is light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding "the place where stories live"—is signaled early and Maren's rearrangement provides a coherent escalation under the accumulative lens. The reversal (she reawakened rather than created the resonance) deepens understanding but lacks a visible price: no tactic shifts, no resource spent, no path visibly foreclosed. Paul's passive observation and the hum's arrival feel like atmospheric validation rather than a cost-bearing turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the hyperbolic-geometry metaphor, analog-memory inheritance, and the tension between arrangement and discovery. The ending's insight—that resonance was always encoded, not invented—offers a non-literal answer to "where stories live" without moralizing. The scarf and grandmother's analog-memory practice ground the theme in tactile particulars, avoiding abstraction. Minor slip: "the space between... that expanding manifold" edges toward meta-commentary in the fourth paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable; diction reflects Maren's educated, lyrically inclined perspective ("terrible, aching coherence," "frequency she could almost tune"). Perceptual signature is consistent (she notices textures, curvatures, emotional frequencies). One register wobble: "hyperbolic geometry was the architecture of memory itself" reads slightly expository mid-paragraph four, though it functions as character conviction rather than narrator intrusion. No dialogue appears; Paul's silent observation maintains focalization discipline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the library-description and grandmother passages. Minor loop: "She placed... She moved... She placed" in paragraph six uses template cadence across three sentences (−0.4). The phrase "not on the page, not in the reader's mind, but in the space between" stacks negations in a way that slightly blurs propulsion. Figurative language (curves, frequencies, resonance) remains coherent and pattern-taught, avoiding mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, analog memory, and library arrangement is specific and non-obvious. The grandmother's telephone-operator inheritance and Maren's filing-by-"emotional frequency" offer fresh detail. Risk: the piece leans heavily on atmospheric accumulation without a sharp on-page cost at closure, staying in the "safety middle" of lyric ending without decisive renunciation. Transformation is present but the premise (eccentric librarian discovers hidden order) brushes familiar territory without fully departing from it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her rearrangement drives the accumulative structure. Setup: clear by paragraph two. Development: the Tuesday rearrangement occupies paragraphs six–eight. Payoff: she appears in the closure paragraph with the realization and the scarf gesture. Her actions enable the resonance discovery, but the key "choice"—understanding she reawakened rather than created—is cognitive rather than a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Causal pressure is moderate; swappable with another thoughtful curator without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The scarf appears in paragraph three (setup), paragraph nine ("ran her fingers along... feeling its frayed silk"), and the closure paragraph ("draped the scarf over her shoulders"). Three beats with escalating tactile engagement. The scarf anchors the analog-memory inheritance and charges the final image with continuity. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; its function is thematic resonance rather than plot mechanism. Closure linkage is strong but causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Analog memories are explained in paragraph three and thematically echoed in "analog grain of paper and ink" at paragraph ten. The concept frames Maren's worldview but does not shape on-page tactics or choices—she files by emotional frequency (a related but distinct principle) and uses hyperbolic geometry (the method), not analog-memory logic, to execute the rearrangement. Present and coherent but functionally ornamental; the story's mechanics would hold with minor edits replacing this label.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is attributed by regulars in paragraph four and demonstrated through filing-by-emotional-frequency and hyperbolic rearrangement. Setup is clear. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a pressured choice with visible cost; it describes her behavior rather than creating friction or trade-off. Label-only use without on-page consequence beyond characterization color.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The action "reawaken" appears explicitly in paragraph ten: "understood that she had not created this resonance but reawakened it." Setup: implicit in the rearrangement effort (paragraphs four, six–eight). Development: the rearrangement beats build toward this discovery. Payoff: the realization is the closure turn. The action redefines the nature of Maren's work (discoverer vs. creator) and provides the conceptual hinge. Removing "reawaken" and substituting "create" would flatten the thematic turn, confirming essentiality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is introduced in paragraph four, described as shaping Maren's filing system, and explicitly drives the rearrangement: "Each placement followed the curvature she had calculated on sheets of graph paper." Setup and development are clear. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how curvature determines which volume goes where is asserted, not shown—and the geometry does not visibly fail, require adjustment, or constrain her choices under pressure. Present across beats but functions more as thematic dressing than plot lever.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The library is introduced in paragraph one, detailed in paragraph two (unique volumes, poetry-science fusion), and provides the spatial and conceptual arena throughout. The stacks and reading nook anchor Maren's movement and Paul's observation. Closure: "inside, the books curved gently toward one another" uses the setting to charge the final image. The library's specificity (telegraph-office bones, unique volumes) enriches atmosphere, but it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Strong thematic integration; moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"While patrons browse" appears in paragraph six ("while patrons browsed the narrow aisles in their habitual solitude") and Paul's presence confirms the timeframe. However, the browsing creates no urgency, no ticking clock that tightens Maren's decisions. Time is ambient rather than a constraint. The element is present and consistent but does not shape tactics or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the place where stories live" is articulated in paragraph four ("she could find the place where stories live") and drives the rearrangement project. Setup and development are clear. Closure: the realization that stories live "in the space between" and were always present answers the quest. The motivation is told and intellectually coherent but not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible costs—Maren pursues it without friction, sacrifice, or a moment where another desire tempts her away. Functional but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone of "observed solitude" is established early (odd hours, solitary patrons, Paul's silent watching) and sustained through Maren's quiet, methodical work. The tone modulates subtly at the resonance moment—"a resonance, as if every volume had begun to hum"—charging the final image without breaking the contemplative register. The ending's "waited for the next odd hour to begin" and "old friends who had finally been seated close enough to talk" extends the tone into warmth without sentimentality. Coherent and purposeful across the arc.</comment>
