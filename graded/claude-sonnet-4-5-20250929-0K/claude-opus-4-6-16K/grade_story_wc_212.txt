<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and specific—her understanding of "vortex inheritance" and seed-saving craft anchor motivation in embodied perception. The attention-as-force action (kneeling, decreasing entropy) shows purposeful choice under pressure, and the final seed-collection embodies a turn from grief-vault to continuation. Internal contradiction is present in "furiously tranquil" embodiment, and the ending forecloses passivity with visible cost (night-long labor). Minor slip: "she understood" appears twice as a filter shortcut in peak beats, slightly diluting immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the atrium shifts from tomb to vault reopened, with cost legible in the night-long seed-saving labor and the "borrowed time" realization. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through ice clarification, seed reveal, and starlight-drink image, reweighting the dominant stake (reclaiming maternal inheritance). Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words (Maren, atrium, post-hatching). One meaningful deepening: the acorn cap shifts from mysterious object to measurement-vessel, narrowing options and triggering the entropy-reversal action. Cost is visible in the night's work and the acceptance of trust over certainty ("trusted what she could not see").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The icebound atrium constrains choice (Maren must clarify ice to access seeds) and charges the final image (starlight through fractured glass, seeds on stone). Micro-setting detail—acorn cap placement, ice texture, oak branches—recurs with reweighted meaning. The atrium's "crystalline stillness" and "vortex" pattern anchor worldbuilding in tactile, purpose-driven specifics. Sensory hierarchy matches urgency: cold as "second skeleton," ice reorganizing via attention. Spatial choreography (door, floor center, glass ceiling, seed patterns) tracks cleanly across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim maternal seed inheritance) is signaled early and tightens once: egg-hatching prompts reopening, ice clarification reveals seeds, and Maren commits to night-long collection. Agency is clear: kneeling, focusing attention, decreasing entropy, drinking starlight. The tightening forecloses passivity with visible cost (night's labor, acceptance of trust). Accumulative lens holds: pressure coheres through pattern recognition (vortex, acorn cap as cup, "borrowed time" texture) rather than external antagonist. No luck solves; Maren's bloodline skill enables the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (dormancy as patience, inheritance as trust across time) emerges through concrete particulars: seeds as "compressed time," ice as grief's freezing point, the acorn cap filled with starlight. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"wild serenity of continuation"—via image (working through night, rustling wings) rather than statement. "Borrowed time" texture is earned through seed-grain specificity. Subtext operates in gesture (breathing warmth onto packets, not looking up at hatched creature). Minor note: "furiously tranquil" appears twice, risking label-reliance, but both instances are embodied in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: seed-saver idiom ("heirloom," "dormancy," "vortex inheritance"), precise natural detail (oak tannin, Carolina African Runner peanuts), and compression-focused syntax ("grief itself had a freezing point"). Distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction remains within Maren's plausible lexicon, though "thermodynamic" and "decrease entropy" edge toward elevated register—acceptable given her maternal-line knowledge. Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses during the entropy-decrease beat, longer cadences in reflection. No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character, world, or atmosphere. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with pressure (short phrases during entropy action, longer in setup). Minor artifact: "She understood" appears twice as a shortcut filter in key moments (acorn cap realization, egg signal), slightly dulling immediacy. Template stem "Maren [verb]" recurs but not excessively. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. Figurative language (ice as fist, cold as skeleton, vortex as heartbeat) is coherent and sparse. Proofreading clean; tense stable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of seed-saving craft with entropy-reversal bloodline and grief-as-ice is specific and non-obvious; removal of any element would collapse the logic. "Vortex inheritance" as thermodynamic tendency rather than genetic code offers fresh framing. Emotional truth (night's patient labor, trust in the unseen) grounds the speculative premise. The acorn-cap realization—measuring not substance but concept—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric compression and the starlight-drink image heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test passes: plot cannot transfer unchanged to different names/setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren's choices create all key turns: she decides to reopen the atrium (inciting), kneels to place the acorn cap (setup), focuses to decrease entropy (peak action), drinks starlight (commitment), and collects seeds through the night (closure labor). Introduced immediately; drives setup, middle action, and ending. Causal pressure high; specificity (seed-saver bloodline, vortex inheritance carrier) irreplaceable. Cost visible in night's work and acceptance of trust. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.6, cost +0.5 = strong 8+ range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The acorn cap appears in three beats: mother's deathbed gift (setup), placed at atrium center (middle action), and filled with starlight/drunk (closure turn). Its function shifts from mystery to measurement-vessel, enabling the entropy action. Causal: Maren's understanding of "fill it" unlocks the peak choice. Irreplaceable: its size and maternal provenance charge the final image. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6 = high 8-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vortex inheritance shapes stakes (bloodline duty to reverse disorder) and tactics (attention as radical force, counterclockwise pull). Introduced early via mother's journals; enables the ice-clarification action. Mechanics matter: "decrease entropy" is the method, vortex is the inheritance pattern. Cost is implicit in the night's labor and acceptance of bloodline responsibility. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.7 = mid-high 7-band. Slight swappability (could substitute other metaphysical inheritance) keeps it below 8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" appears as label twice (atrium descriptor, ending phrase) and is embodied once in Maren's kneeling action—clenched stillness releasing into motion. It constrains the final image tone but does not enable a distinct choice with visible cost. Present early +0.5, closure linkage +1.2, embodied once +0.4, but ornamental repetition −0.5, label-reliance −0.3 = mid-7 range. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but lacks causal pressure in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reopening the atrium is the inciting action that redefines all options: grants access to seeds, triggers ice clarification, and enables the closure labor. Introduced in opening paragraph; the door-latch turn launches the plot. Irreplaceable: without reopening, no seed recovery possible. Early signal +0.8, causal pressure +1.6, closure participation (seeds accessed) +1.4, specificity +0.7 = strong 8.9. The action's consequence (night's work) carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Decreasing entropy is signaled midway ("she did what her bloodline had always done") and executed in one extended beat (kneeling, focusing, ice clarifying). Mechanics matter: attention applied with specificity forces disorder to retreat. Shapes the peak turn but introduced at ~50% mark. One beat +0.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage (seeds revealed) +1.2, late signal −0.4 = mid-7 range. Not swappable (the method defines the inheritance), but single-use limits integration depth.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The icebound atrium under starlight constrains choice (ice must be clarified to access seeds), supplies the closure image (stars through fractured glass, spiral seed patterns), and embodies the thematic turn (tomb to vault). Introduced in opening; present in setup, peak action (ice clarification), and ending (working by starlight). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.7, specificity +0.6 = high 8-band. Micro-setting (acorn cap, floor center) also functions as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe (after egg hatches, three days post-discovery, through one night) tightens decisions: hatching signals readiness, night's span tracks Maren's labor. Time anchors early and reappears in the ending ("worked through the night"). Does not create acute pressure (no ticking clock forcing speed) but structures causality. Early signal +0.6, closure mention +0.8, moderate pressure +0.6, but vague tracking in middle beats −0.3 = mid-6 range. Could be more urgent to reach 7+.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation ("discover the texture of borrowed time") is revealed midway as Maren's realization, shapes the peak understanding (time as granular, seed-studded), and charges the final image (seeds as futures held in trust). Dramatized through touch and perception, not told-only. One beat +0.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, but late emergence (second half) −0.5, no conflicting cost −0.2 = low-6 range. Lyric resonance lifts it, but it could constrain an earlier choice to deepen integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Wild serenity modulates across the piece: opening's "crystalline stillness," peak's "furiously tranquil" embodiment, ending's "wild serenity of continuation." Tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image (working calmly through night, trusting the unseen). Present early +0.6, closure linkage +1.4, modulation under pressure +0.8, but static in middle beats −0.2 = mid-high 7-band. The tonal consistency elevates thematic resonance without forcing a single mood.</comment>
