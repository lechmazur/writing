<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren is embodied through her thrift-curator lens and micro-choices (saving the mug, waiting as discipline), but her interior mostly observes rather than contradicts itself under pressure. Gerald, Rosa, and Tomas remain functional witnesses without distinct agency. The ending choice to contact the facility and bring the locket feels inevitable given her established traits, but the story summarizes rather than dramatizes the peak moment with Dolores, flattening the cost of presence into a told epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece assembles Dolores's portrait through neighbor testimony, building density until the property-manager notice forces advocacy. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren distributes the ending to neighbors, the courtyard returns to amber stillness, and she reaffirms her thesis ("listening heals"). Cost is conceptual—the radical truth that presence matters—but the final image doesn't sharply reweight prior material; it restates the opening posture. Orientation anchors early (courtyard, Maren, dawn, mailbox mystery by paragraph three). One meaningful deepening occurs when external intrusion (notice) converts listening into advocacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard is vividly rendered (bougainvillea, tiled fountain, amber light, honey color) and returns at closure to charge the final image with "suspended amber" and the murmuring fountain. The aged locket and the mailbox are handled across beats and constrain Maren's choices. Sensory detail is filtered through Maren's thrift-curator attention. Spatial choreography remains clear across the complex. The "sandstorm" simile in the opening and the recurri repetition of honey-colored light create a coherent atmospheric frame that supports the "calm" tone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: solve the mailbox mystery and honor Dolores's unheard story. The property-manager notice is the single on-page reversal that tightens options and pushes Maren from passive listener to advocate. Agency is present (she contacts the facility, brings the locket), but the peak act—sitting beside Dolores, telling her about the letters—is summarized in two sentences without dramatized friction or visible tradeoff. Cost is conceptual (the "small radical truth"), legible but not viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme ("listening heals") emerges from Maren's method and the courtyard accumulation, but the final paragraph states it overtly: "the small radical truth she carried...that listening heals, not by fixing what is broken, but by refusing to let it go unheard." This moralizing summary replaces a resonant image with an articulated thesis, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5 for final-paragraph prompt language). The locket and courtyard motifs recur purposefully, but the ending opts for assertion over implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited. Maren's perceptual signature is strong: she "had trained herself to see what others discarded, to hear the whisper of significance beneath the ordinary." Diction is elevated but consistent with her curatorial lens ("violent pinks," "gravitational pull," "chain of testimony that wound through the building like roots"). Psychic distance is controlled. The few lines of neighbor dialogue are goal-driven but brief. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Voice modulates appropriately with pressure, and the lyric register supports the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template runs. Information density is high (each neighbor's testimony adds a layer). Minor scaffold appears: "The fountain murmured. The light was still honey-colored, still calm, still holding everything in that suspended amber" recycles the opening's amber-light motif without advancing pressure, reading as lyric decoration rather than causal propulsion (−0.2 for paraphrase loop in the final beat). "She had proven nothing dramatic, only the small radical truth she carried..." is meta-commentary that tells rather than shows the thematic payload (−0.3 for therapy-adjacent summary in peak beat). Clarity and concision are otherwise strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The locked-mailbox mystery and thrift-curator protagonist offer a fresh angle on themes of listening and discarded lives. The accumulative structure—assembling Dolores through neighbor testimony—feels organic. However, the core emotional arc (a lost person honored, connection restored) is familiar, and the ending opts for thematic assertion over surprising synthesis. The "sandstorm calm" tone is vivid but not transformative. The piece commits fully to its premise but doesn't risk a non-obvious turn; the resolution is tidy and compassionate without friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren (discerning thrift-store curator) is signaled early, her curatorial lens filters perception throughout, and her choice to contact the facility is the key turn. Her discernment trait shapes her method (sitting, waiting, listening) and is present at closure when she "distributed the story's ending." However, the peak decision is summarized rather than dramatized, limiting causal pressure. Swappable with "compassionate social worker" with minor edits (−0.4). Two beats (waiting, advocating) +0.9; closure linkage +0.7; causal pressure moderate +0.8; early signal +0.5; summary-only advocacy −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The aged locket is introduced in paragraph five (Gerald's testimony), returned when Maren brings it to Dolores ("She brought the locket. Dolores held it and wept"), and its engraving "Still Here" resonates thematically. Three beats (Gerald's story, Maren's visit, Dolores's reaction) +1.4; early signal +0.5; closure linkage (used at the climax) +1.2; causal pressure (Gerald "still had it," Maren carries it to Dolores) +1.0; specificity (engraving, hairline crack) +0.6; the locket's return is told rather than shown with embodied cost −0.5; irreplaceability moderate (any keepsake could serve similarly) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The locked mailbox (Unit 7B, brass-front, no key, eleven weeks, accumulating letters) is introduced in paragraph four and frames the mystery. It shapes Maren's stake (solve the mystery, honor Dolores) and appears obliquely at closure when neighbors look at it after learning the ending. Two beats (setup, closure glance) +0.9; early signal +0.5; causal pressure (drives the investigation) +1.0; closure linkage (Tomas "looked at the mailbox and then at the dawn sky") +0.7; the mailbox itself is static—no one unlocks it or retrieves the letters on the page, limiting physical agency −0.6; swappable with "unclaimed packages" or similar mystery −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Leads through following" (discernment through listening) is introduced in paragraph two ("discernment was not about judgment but about listening deeply"), demonstrated across the middle when "each story led Maren to the next person, a chain of testimony," and reaffirmed at closure ("presence was the truest form of listening"). Three beats (setup, neighbor chain, Dolores visit) +1.4; early signal +0.6; causal pressure (the method enables the investigation) +1.2; closure linkage (she sits beside Dolores and says nothing) +1.0; cost connection (waiting, not forcing) +0.4; the trait is told more than shown in constrained choices −0.6; label-only in final reflection ("listening heals") −0.3; irreplaceability moderate (patience or empathy could substitute) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The action "hear" appears in Rosa's testimony: "Dolores used to hear things no one else did, birdsong beneath the freeway noise, the fountain's particular rhythm when rain was coming." It characterizes Dolores but does not drive Maren's on-page choices or closure. One beat (Rosa's story) +0.4; mid-story introduction (paragraph six) −0.3; ornamental (describes Dolores's past ability without current action pressure) −0.8; no closure participation −0.0; swappable (Dolores could "notice" or "sense" with identical effect) −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Through neighborhood storytelling" is the method Maren uses throughout: she sits in the courtyard, neighbors find her, each testimony leads to the next ("First came Gerald...Then came Rosa...Then Tomas"). The method is signaled early (paragraph five), drives the middle investigation, and culminates when "Maren distributed the story's ending to the neighbors who had built its middle." Four beats (Gerald, Rosa, Tomas, ending distribution) +1.4; early signal +0.6; causal pressure (the method enables the mystery's solution) +1.4; closure linkage (neighbors receive the ending) +1.2; specificity (chain of testimony, roots beneath tile) +0.7; cost connection (waiting as discipline) +0.5; the method is somewhat passive, limiting visceral stakes −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The courtyard (Almeda complex, tiled fountain, bougainvillea, iron bench, amber/honey light, dawn) is introduced in paragraph three and returns at closure with identical descriptors ("The fountain murmured. The light was still honey-colored"). It provides the spatial anchor for Maren's listening practice and the neighbor encounters. Three beats (Maren's arrival, neighbor meetings, ending distribution) +1.4; early signal +0.6; closure linkage (final image in the courtyard) +1.0; the courtyard constrains Maren's method (she waits there) +0.8; tone support (sandstorm calm, suspended amber) +0.5; the setting is more postcard than tactical resource −0.5; swappable with any communal gathering space −0.5; static reprise without evolution −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes" is specified as the timeframe. The property-manager notice ("contents to be destroyed if unclaimed within thirty days") arrives late (paragraph eight) and is the sole external pressure that converts Maren from listener to advocate. One beat (notice triggers action) +0.4; late introduction (second half) −0.4; causal pressure (forces the turn) +1.2; closure linkage (the advocacy leads directly to the Dolores visit and ending) +1.0; cost connection (the thirty-day deadline raises stakes) +0.4; the timeframe is event-based rather than a ticking clock, limiting urgency −0.5; no time tracking during the Dolores visit or courtyard scenes −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation "to prove that listening heals" is articulated in the final paragraph ("the small radical truth she carried...that listening heals"). It is implicit in her dawn practice (waiting, gathering testimony) but never dramatized as a conflicted desire with on-page cost. Two beats (dawn waiting, Dolores visit) +0.9; the motivation is told rather than shown in friction −0.8; no competing want or fear tests the thesis −0.0; closure linkage (final assertion) +0.7; the motivation is label-only and reads as authorial thesis rather than embodied need −0.6; late explicit statement (final paragraph) −0.4; generic (empathy or compassion could substitute) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" tone is established in the opening simile ("stillness like the eye of a sandstorm") and sustained through "amber light," "suspended," "honey-colored," and the fountain's murmur. It returns at closure with "still honey-colored, still calm, still holding everything in that suspended amber that made the courtyard feel like a place outside of time." The tone is coherent, modulates subtly with the property-manager intrusion, and charges the final image. Three beats (opening, middle courtyard scenes, closing) +1.4; early signal +0.7; closure linkage (tone anchors the ending) +1.4; causal pressure (the calm enables Maren's listening practice) +0.8; specificity (eye of sandstorm, amber suspension) +0.6; static reprise without evolution −0.5; the tone is more atmosphere than constraint −0.3.</comment>
