<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maret's motivation is embodied through concrete action—scraping sediment, cataloging artifacts—and his intellectual stance creates genuine conflict with the factions above. The cog examination dramatizes his agonizing process with sensory particulars (fish-oil lamp, chisel work) rather than abstract philosophizing. Internal contradiction appears in "the familiar weight of futility" paired with persistent work, showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to continue excavating despite futility earns the Earned Stasis closure, though the cost remains more philosophical than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening: Maret, sewer ledge, post-plague Theriac. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each artifact and sediment layer deepens the central conflict between evidence-based knowledge and ideological narrative. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maret's final act of scraping "another millimeter into the past" crystallizes his stance with the cost legible in "no one will remember how to build the pumps" and the city's willful amnesia. The because/therefore chain holds: plague killed craftsmen → flood destroyed workshops → survivors argue ideology → Maret excavates to preserve methods, with his futility acknowledged but endured.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sewer setting actively constrains and enables: "dry ledge above a black canal" provides both workspace and isolation, "limestone bedrock" explains survival, and the sedimentary layers become the literal medium of inquiry. The cog examination under fish-oil lamp and the chisel scraping limestone are tactile, tool-driven moments that charge the work. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (ledge, canal, wall, tilted plazas above). The final image ties environment to stance: the dark water, the guttering lamp, and the sediment layers converge to frame Maret's solitary remembering as both method and futility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving knowledge methods against ideological erasure—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation operates through accumulation: individual cog → forty relics → millimeter-by-millimeter excavation, each deepening the gap between Maret's evidence and the factions' narratives. The reversal is quiet but present: his rational rebellion yields no converts, foreclosing persuasion while he persists in preservation. Cost appears in "You are all going to drown again" and the visible futility of lecturing "no one," but the price could be more viscerally felt—his isolation and the city's coming doom remain conceptual rather than physically or relationally charged in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conflict between evidence and ideology, memory and erasure, without moralizing. The cog—"neither sacred nor purely mercantile"—concretizes the inadequacy of both faction narratives. "The sediment does not lie" and the ghost mechanism that "kept perfect time" offer non-literal answers to the central question of how truth survives collective amnesia. The final image reweights prior material: Maret's solitary remembering becomes both futile and essential, the act itself the only preservation possible. No thematic echo or sermon mars the ending; meaning accumulates through the particular objects and Maret's embodied labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Maret's particular perceptual signature: he notices precision engineering, strata like "corrupted text," and epistemological distinctions. Diction stays consistent—"rationally rebellious," "abrasive calm," "insufferable politics"—reflecting his academic bent without register drift. The single line of dialogue ("You are all going to drown again") reads as character-specific utterance to the void, matching his isolation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during cog examination, wider when surveying factions above, tightening again at closure. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances character (Maret's method), world (post-flood Theriac), or thematic pressure (evidence vs. ideology). Rhythm varies purposefully—longer analytical sentences during reflection, shorter declaratives at closure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; sentence openings vary organically. The opening hook "Maret had not chosen the sewer. The sewer had simply been the last thing that refused to drown" anchors voice and stakes immediately. Figurative language (sediment as "sentence written in mineral and decay," strata as "corrupted text") remains controlled and voice-motivated without overwriting. The final beat propels cleanly: "The lamp guttered. The city remembered nothing, so he remembered for it."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The combination—philosopher-scavenger in post-plague sewer excavating sedimentary truth against competing ideologies—feels specific and freshly synthesized rather than template-driven. The cog as precision artifact embodying both factions' partial truths offers a non-obvious angle on the knowledge-vs-ideology premise. Maret's "rationally rebellious" stance avoids both zealotry and mere contrarianism, grounded in concrete method (chisel, mason's patience, technical manuals). The transformation test holds: swapping names and setting would gut the particularity of limestone strata, chronometer mechanics, and the sewer as archive. Minor risk: the setup leans toward allegory (Restorationists vs. Foundationists), but Maret's embodied labor and the cog's specificity prevent it from becoming a mere thought experiment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maret appears throughout, frames the opening, and his decision to persist ("picked up his chisel... scraped another millimeter") constitutes the closure beat. His choices—excavating, cataloging, lecturing—create the central pressure and the Earned Stasis ending. Setup early, development across multiple beats (cog examination, relic cataloging, addressing the void), and payoff as the final action. Causal work: his philosophical stance generates conflict with factions and drives the preservation attempt. Cost: futility acknowledged yet endured. The character is indispensable to both logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cog appears in two distinct beats: initial discovery/examination under lamp (detailed engagement with teeth, corrosion, technical manuals) and placement beside forty relics as a representative artifact. It concretizes the theme—precision engineering from "marriage of astronomical knowledge and commercial ambition"—and its properties (teeth meshing with ghost mechanism, chronometer function) prove irreplaceable for demonstrating both factions' incompleteness. Setup by first third, development through extended examination, payoff as it charges the closure metaphor of mechanisms that "kept perfect time." Removing it would require a different artifact to carry the neither-sacred-nor-mercantile argument; cost connection is conceptual but clear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Competing narratives (Restorationists vs. Foundationists) shape the external pressure and Maret's rationale for excavation. They appear early, frame the stakes (preserve evidence vs. ideological rewriting), and constrain his tactics—he cannot persuade either side, so he preserves artifacts. The concept drives multiple beats: his rebellion against "both stories incomplete," the cog as counter-evidence, and the closure acknowledgment that factions will drown again. Payoff: the final image implicitly contrasts his solitary memory-work against their arguing. Strong causal role, though the factions remain off-page voices rather than embodied antagonists, limiting felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Rationally rebellious" is dramatized through action: Maret defies factions "loudly," but his defiance is "footnoted" and "came with citations"—rebellion constrained by evidence. This trait enables his confrontational speech to the void and his persistence despite futility, while constraining him from ideological shortcuts. Setup via "His rebellion was footnoted," development in rejecting both narratives based on the cog, payoff in continuing excavation despite acknowledged futility. The trait shapes tactics (why he scrapes sediment rather than preaching) and charges the ending irony. Visible tradeoff: his rationality isolates him, foreclosing persuasion while preserving method.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Agonize" is the subject of an entire beat: "He would agonize over a single artifact for days. Weeks." The cog examination dramatizes this—turning it under lamp light, consulting manuals, feeling futility—and it drives the preservation attempt. The action explains his slow accumulation (forty relics), his isolation (no time for politics), and the cost (millimeter progress while the city argues). Setup early, development through the extended cog beat, payoff as he returns to agonizing work in the final lines. Removing "agonize" and replacing it with casual examination would gut the time pressure and Maret's character-specific method. Indispensable to escalation and closure rhythm.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sedimentary-layers method appears in the title beat: "scraping through strata the way a scholar might parse a corrupted text, layer by layer, each one a sentence written in mineral and decay." It's signaled early, shapes tactics (chisel, mason's patience, dentist's precision), and the mechanics matter—deeper layers = older truth. Development: the method explains how he found the cog and why progress is slow. Payoff: "scraped another millimeter into the past" in the final beat. The method constrains (slow, solitary) and enables (access to pre-flood artifacts). Strong integration; the specific approach is load-bearing for both character and theme.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sunken city ruins provide the existential pressure (drowned civilization), the resource (sediment archive), and the spatial structure (sewer vs. tilted plazas above). Setup immediately: "waters rose and swallowed the city." Development: ruins supply the artifacts, isolate Maret in the sewer pocket, and house the arguing factions. Payoff: "The city remembered nothing, so he remembered for it"—the ruins' amnesia charges the closure. The setting is indispensable: remove the flood and the sedimentary archive, preservation urgency, and factions' ideological contest all collapse. Micro-setting (dry ledge, canal, limestone wall) further constrains tactics and alters the final image's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the plague ends" anchors the timeframe early and explains the urgency—craftsmen dead, workshops gone, techniques vanishing. It shapes Maret's motivation and the factions' emergence. However, the timeframe remains static rather than tightening; there's no live clock or escalating deadline within the story's window. The plague aftermath pressures the stakes conceptually (lost knowledge) but doesn't alter tactics beat-to-beat. Setup strong, thematic linkage clear, but development and payoff are weaker—time doesn't constrain the final choice or charge the image beyond the general post-catastrophe context. Functional and necessary for world logic, but replaceable with another catastrophe without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Preserving ancient methods is Maret's engine: it drives excavation, cog examination, relic cataloging, and the closure decision to continue. Setup early: "To preserve ancient methods... this was what drove him. Not nostalgia. Survival." Development: the cog demonstrates a method (chronometer assembly) that would otherwise vanish; the plague's elimination of craftsmen dramatizes the friction. Payoff: "no one will remember how to build the pumps" and the ghost mechanism that "kept perfect time" charge the ending with the cost of failed preservation. The motivation is tested against futility and isolation, creating genuine internal friction. Indispensable—remove it and Maret's actions lack coherent rationale.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Abrasive calm" coheres throughout: Maret's flat declarative to the water ("You are all going to drown again"), his detached analysis of faction narratives, and the steady chisel work under acknowledged futility. The tone modulates subtly—sharper during "insufferable politics," quieter during lamp-lit examination—but maintains consistent cool friction. Setup via "his voice flat with abrasive calm," sustained through "rationally rebellious" and "footnoted" defiance, payoff in the measured final beat where lamp guttering and millimeter scraping produce charge without heat. The tone shapes reader experience and charges the closure by refusing melodrama. Strong integration; a warmer or more passionate tone would undercut the Earned Stasis effect.</comment>
