<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her trait (hearing unspoken words) is established, but her peak choice—surrender rather than effort—arrives without on-page contradiction or internal resistance. The glass-cage metaphor for trapped creativity is vivid yet borders on stock; her grandmother's whispered method supplies all agency, leaving Elara passive at closure. Embodied emotion is present ("gasped," pressing palms) but the final transformation reads as received rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through celestial imagery and the astrolabe's arc across seven meteors, culminating in the archway moment where stardust residue shatters the glass cage. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Elara surrenders effort and allows words to arrive). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Cost is felt—three years of gray work, the renunciation of control—but the final beat's causality is thin: the astrolabe points, she kneels, the cage shatters without dramatized friction or micro-reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway is vivid and specific, its black rock and pulsing green-violet light filtering through Elara's moonstruck perception. The astrolabe's copper-and-bone materiality and the frozen ground she presses anchor the body in space. The archway constrains the final beat (she must kneel here, where the star fell) and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate test. Minor slip: "northern ridge" and "columns" lack tactile follow-through in mid-scene action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and pursued across the meteor-tracking sequence. One tightening occurs when the astrolabe points downward at the archway, narrowing her search to this exact site. The kneeling moment reweights options (surrender replaces search), but no on-page reversal tests her commitment; the glass cage simply shatters on contact. Cost is felt (three years of gray work, the final relinquishment of control) but not visibly paid in a choice that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—creation through surrender, not effort—emerges from the astrolabe's mechanics and the grandmother's encoded wisdom. The glass-cage image and "remembered stardust" motif recur with shifted meaning at closure. No overt thesis statement mars the ending, though "Rest. That was the secret" edges toward label-speak. The final image (words arriving like meteors, dark whispering back) offers a resonant answer without moralizing, but the epiphany feels granted rather than earned through on-page friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with distinct perceptual signature: moonstruck, attuned to unspoken words, cosmos-vocabulary ("magnetized light," "rete," "velocity of vanished fire"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("furious and mute") to wider cosmic frame. Minor slip: "remembered stardust" and "unwritten calendar" recur as thematic labels rather than enacted perception. No dialogue to assess. Diction remains character-consistent with only hairline drift into elevated register ("dissolved in exhaled breath").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance image, character, or atmosphere. The opening's moonstruck wordplay and "funeral silks" metaphor anchor voice. Minor loops: "unspoken words" appears thrice without reweighting; "the astrolabe pointed" / "she raised the instrument" / "aligned its sights" paraphrase the same gesture. Figurative density in the closure beat ("poured out like auroral light," "flooding her veins," "words arrived like meteors") stacks three vehicles in rapid succession without grounding action between them. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; propulsion is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—astronomical navigation as creative method, stardust residue as muse—is specific and non-obvious. The grandmother's forged astrolabe and "constellations that matched no modern chart" add texture. Transformation test: swap "creativity" for another trapped quality and the arc holds with minimal edits, indicating moderate swappability. The glass-cage metaphor and "moonstruck" pun echo familiar craft-struggle tropes. Risk-taking in structure (multi-paragraph wind-up to a lyric closure) heightens atmosphere but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her tracking of meteors spans the middle, but her key choice at closure—kneeling and surrendering—is reactive rather than volitional; the astrolabe's directive ("Here") and the earth's unspoken word do the causal work. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (tracking, kneeling +0.6), closure linkage (+0.4), but passivity at the turn (−0.8) and swappability (another seeker could follow the same arc with minor edits, −0.5). Late-scene cost is felt but not chosen.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The astrolabe is introduced early (second paragraph, +0.6), handled in at least three beats (alignment under the archway, turning rete, pointing downward, +1.2), and drives the closure choice by directing Elara to kneel (+1.4). Its copper-and-bone materiality and impossible constellations render it irreplaceable (+0.6). Minor friction: the mechanics of "calibrated not to navigation but to memory" remain abstract; we see it point but not how memory-traces work (−0.3). Strong causal pressure and specificity lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Remembered stardust is seeded early (grandmother's method, +0.5), shapes the search tactic (tracking meteors to their landing sites, +0.8), and at closure the "residue" becomes the unspoken word that shatters the glass cage (+1.2). The concept is irreplaceable: swap it for "creative energy" and the celestial logic collapses (+0.5). Friction: mid-scene the concept is told ("every streak of light left a residue") rather than shown in earlier landing-site discoveries (−0.6). Closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The trait is established in the opening (Elara hears unspoken words, +0.4) and recurs as atmospheric color ("confessions swallowed," "prayers dissolved"), but it does not constrain or enable a key on-page action with cost. At closure she hears the earth's unspoken word—yet the hearing is passive reception, not a choice-altering tradeoff. Label-only mention across most beats (−0.6); no visible cost tied to the trait (−0.5). Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rest is seeded as the grandmother's secret midway through ("Rest. That was the secret"), then enacted at closure when Elara "lay beneath the archway" and "let the words come without reaching." The action redefines her prior search-and-effort stance (+1.6), forecloses the grasping path (+0.8), and charges the final image ("she whispered them into the dark," +1.4). Early implicit setup (surrender vs. effort tension, +0.4), two distinct beats (realization, enactment, +0.9), high irreplaceability (+0.6). Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method—tracing meteor paths—is introduced early (grandmother's instruction, +0.6), structures the middle (tracking seven meteors, +0.8), and the astrolabe's mechanics enable the final directive ("pointed downward. Here," +1.0). Causal pressure is clear: without the method, Elara cannot locate the archway site (+0.9). Friction: the "silver lines across hand-drawn maps" and "velocity of vanished fire" remain abstract; we do not see one landing-site discovery on the page (−0.7). Closure linkage solid but mechanics partly told.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archway is introduced early (second paragraph, +0.6), its "columns rose from black rock" and "corridor of sky that pulsed green and violet" supply vivid spatial anchors. It constrains Elara's final choice (she must kneel here, where the star fell, +1.0) and charges the closure image (auroras painting her closed eyelids, +1.2). Two beats: arrival and kneeling (+0.9). Minor friction: mid-scene the archway is static description; its black rock and frozen ground do not alter her tactics between arrival and kneeling (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "unwritten calendar" appears early as the astrolabe's feature and recurs at closure ("the first page of an unwritten calendar that would never need to end"). It reweights time from constraint to open possibility (+0.8) and is irreplaceable within the celestial logic (+0.4). Friction: between setup and closure the calendar is ornamental; "days she refused to number, weeks she let blur" tells rather than shows time pressure (−0.8). No middle beat where unmeasured time alters a tactic (−0.5). Lyric reprise without causal involvement caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Freeing trapped creativity is introduced early (third paragraph, "trapped… inside a cage of glass," +0.6), drives the meteor-tracking sequence (+0.8), and the glass cage's shattering at closure dramatizes the stake's resolution (+1.0). Minor friction: the motivation is told in extended summary ("Her paintings had gone gray. Her poems read like receipts") rather than shown in an on-page failed attempt (−0.7). No mid-scene moment where the trapped state costs her a choice (−0.4). Felt cost at closure is strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Shadowed rapture is coherent from the opening's moonstruck lyricism through the aurora-lit closure ("shifting emerald and violet"). Tone modulates with pressure: the glass-cage beat tightens into urgency, the kneeling moment releases into surrender. The final image ("she whispered them into the dark, and the dark whispered back") crystallizes the tone with undeniable charge (+1.4). Minor slip: mid-scene exposition ("That was the secret her grandmother had encoded") flattens into explanation rather than sustaining the tone's lyric register (−0.4).</comment>
