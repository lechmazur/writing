<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vael's interior life is concrete and character-particular: mercury-glass eyes, buried seer talents, nightly vision-substitution as coping mechanism. The choice to stop substituting reality at the end is earned by the stone's discovery and language recovery, with visible emotional cost ("the weeping was itself a kind of thunder"). Minor slip: the mother's singing and the town's erasure are told rather than shown in micro-choices under pressure, relying on summary backstory to establish stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the piece accretes pressure through layered images (bookstore-as-labyrinth, buried key metaphor, language-as-home syntax) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration when Vael stops substituting reality and finds home "finally legible." Orientation anchors (mountain bookstore, Vael shelving, eleven years) arrive within ~150 words—acceptable. Cost is felt in the weeping and the years of avoidance now ended. One tightening occurs when the feather unlocks the stone, reweighting all prior searching into sudden access. The lens holds cleanly to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly realized through specific details: corridors spiraling like nautilus chambers, mine shafts, cliff-face alcoves where wind turns pages. The stone's location ("corridor so deep the air tasted of iron") grounds the discovery spatially. The feather as micro-object charges the final beat by enabling the unlock. Setting subtly mirrors internal state (labyrinth = grief's structure) without overt symbolism. Occupational detail (shelving, twine-and-chalk navigation) is purposeful and scaled to the conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding home's shape through the lost language—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening: the accidental feather-touch opens the buried seer gift, forcing Vael to face what she'd severed. The weeping and decision to "let the world arrive as it was" foreclose the nightly substitution habit with visible emotional cost. Pressure accumulates through years of searching, then the discovery deepens her stance. No antagonist required under Accumulative lens; coincidence (finding the stone) complicates rather than resolves, as the real turn is internal acceptance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—home as syntax, not geography—emerges organically from the stone's language, the bookstore's labyrinth, and Vael's nightly substitutions without overt statement. The final image ("the shape of home—not restored, but finally, finally legible") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. "Home is not a place. Home was a syntax" risks didacticism but is integrated through the stone's actual inscriptions pouring through her. Subtext operates in the buried-key metaphor and the way grief hollows spaces words can fill.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the stone discovery, wider in the opening frame). Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity: "mercury-liquid quality," "substituted reality nightly," "hidden, interior thunder." Perceptual signature is consistent—Vael notices threads, textures, and architecture. Minor slip: "the body finds alternatives" and "home was a syntax" edge toward essayistic register in a few beats, slightly outside lived interiority under peak pressure, though voice remains coherent overall.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("mercury-glass seer," "nautilus shell," "language seed itself"). Information density is high—most lines advance character or atmosphere. Slight overwriting in the middle third: "the weeping was itself a kind of thunder—hidden, interior, shaking foundations no one else could see" stacks metaphors without added clarity. "Each word was a small room. Each phrase, a corridor" risks becoming a decorative list. No loops or template cadence; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—bookstore-as-labyrinth teaching that home is internal structure, accessed via lost language and seer gift—feels specific and non-obvious. The feather-as-needle-on-vinyl moment is a fresh inflection. Trope transformation: the "chosen one with buried powers" frame is grounded in grief's tactile reality (substituting visions, shelving books for eleven years) rather than quest mechanics. Minor derivative note: the "lost language restores identity" premise echoes fantasy templates, but the story personalizes it through syntax-as-architecture and the mother's specific tongue.</comment>
