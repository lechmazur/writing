<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior is highly particular—her observational stance shapes every perception, and the contradiction between rehearsed anger and her tangential approach creates genuine tension. The shift from anger to connection is earned through the jade cicada exchange and her micro-choice to reach for his wrist. Her professional lens filters all emotion through tidal-pool metaphor, which stays consistent under pressure. Minor: the "something with wings" at closure reads slightly label-heavy, nudging just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (grotto, pools, cicada, stars) and the pause itself functions as the transition period. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the moment she reaches for his wrist and offers the "cut off/connected" metaphor forecloses anger with visible cost. The final wave entering and pools merging charges the image with undeniable pressure. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. Cost is legible: she releases six years of anger and accepts her mother's choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The grotto micro-setting constrains the conversation (isolated, tidal, starlit) and the blenny's movement in the pool mirrors Maren's observational stance, charging her pivot. The jade cicada's tactile detail (warm, ridged veins) and the incoming tide's sound create sensory pressure that drives the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The tidal pools function as both setting and recurring object that reweights the closure when they begin to merge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is relational restoration versus sustained anger, signaled early and held. The tightening occurs when her father reveals the cremation secret, narrowing Maren's options to rupture or reconnect. Her tangential speech about tidal pools is a tactical choice that foreclosures direct anger, and reaching for his wrist is the decisive act with visible cost (abandoning rehearsed fury). The incoming tide operates as situational pressure that times the resolution. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient here.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: transition periods, the cicada's resurrection cycle, pools cut off versus connected. The final image (pools merging, "something with wings") answers the central question—how to metabolize grief—without stating a moral. The jade cicada shifts from her mother's artifact to Maren's inheritance, a non-literal resurrection that reweights prior material. No thematic echo or sermon; the tidal-pool metaphor does thematic work through dramatized observation and choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: every observation filters through tidal-poolchronology ("texture of time," "transition period"). Distance is stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and advances the reconciliation without exposition. The father's single line "She loved watching you work" carries enormous subtext. Rhythm modulates beautifully—short beats during the cicada exchange, longer accumulative sentences as the tide enters. Zero filter-verb stacks or voice drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, image, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully (the pause description, the blenny flicker, the final wave). The opening grounds voice and stakes cleanly. Minor: "something older and stranger, something with wings" at closure feels slightly abstract and could be more concrete. One paraphrase near "the pause that followed was not silence" / "water dripped" slightly echoes structure but does not obscure causality. No loops, template cadence, or register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal-pool observation as metaphor for grief reconciliation is fresh and specific. The tangential approach (speaking sideways about pools rather than directly about anger) is a non-obvious tactic. The jade cicada as resurrection symbol is apt but borders on conventional Eastern motif. The grotto setting and transition-period frame elevate the material above template. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the quiet ending succeed. Transformation test passes: the specifics of marine chronology and this particular father-daughter dynamic are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren's identity as tidal-pool chronicler shapes her observational lens throughout and drives her tactical choice to speak about pools rather than confront anger directly. Her professional frame enables the tangential approach and constrains her to see the pause itself as a transition period. Present in setup (opening paragraph), middle (blenny observation triggers insight), and closure (pools merging). Causal pressure is strong; the trait is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The jade cicada appears in three beats: father holding it, the exchange, and Maren pocketing it. Its tactile warmth and carved veins matter on the page. The cicada's resurrection symbolism reweights at closure when she calls it "a small, patient resurrection." It drives the reconciliation beat (he offers it, she accepts) and charges the final image. Specificity is high (dark green, wing veins, warm from holding). Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Transition periods frame the entire story from the opening thesis, shape Maren's understanding of the pause itself ("this pause was itself a transition period"), and provide the conceptual architecture for the closure (pools merging, anger transforming to "something with wings"). The concept alters her tactics—she chooses to wait and observe rather than attack. It appears in setup, controls middle strategy, and charges the ending. Indispensable; removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is demonstrated through her steady, curious voice and the blenny observation that seeds her insight, but it does not create a visible cost or tradeoff. The trait enables her tangential approach and filters her perception, but it could be replaced with "careful" or "patient" without major structural loss. Present in setup (notebooks, observational voice) and middle (blenny beat), but closure linkage is indirect. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Foresee" is dramatized when Maren says "I can foresee what happens if I stay angry" and applies her tidal-pool knowledge to predict stagnation. This insight drives her choice to reach for his wrist and abandon anger. The action appears in setup (implicit in her study of pools), is articulated mid-scene, and shapes closure. Strong causal role, but the beat could be rewritten as "I know" with only minor edits. Specific enough to score solidly but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tangential approach is signaled early ("the truth of things revealed itself sideways") and executed when Maren speaks about tidal pools instead of her mother's ashes. The method drives the reconciliation beat and is her conscious tactical choice. It appears in setup (the star-viewing metaphor), middle (the pools speech), and shapes closure (indirect connection rather than direct confrontation). Mechanics matter: her choice to approach sideways alters the outcome. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto's isolation and tidal nature pressure the conversation (no escape, rising water creates urgency). The ceiling opening frames the stars, the pools reflect constellations, and the incoming tide times the resolution. Setting provides the blenny that triggers insight and supplies the final image (pools merging). Present in setup, middle (spatial details constrain movement), and closure (tide entering). Micro-setting as active constraint; removing it would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pause frames the entire middle section and is explicitly named as a transition period. Maren understands "this pause was itself a transition period—the space between knowing and responding." The timeframe tightens decisions (incoming tide pressures resolution) and the ending marks the pause's end. Present in setup (implied), dominates middle structure, and articulated at closure ("the pause between them ended"). Strong thematic and structural role, though the clock is more conceptual than urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's desire to discover the texture of time is articulated in her speech to her father and has driven her eleven years of work. The motivation explains her observational stance and why she filters grief through tidal metaphor. Present in setup (seventeen notebooks), articulated in the pools speech, and indirectly shapes closure (time moving differently in the grotto). Friction between professional detachment and personal grief is present but not maximally dramatized. Solid but not indispensable.</comment>
