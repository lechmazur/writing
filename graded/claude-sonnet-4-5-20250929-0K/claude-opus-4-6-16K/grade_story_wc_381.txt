<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her summoning method shows interiority through the tactile layering of silences. However, her character remains largely static—the piece offers no internal contradiction or struggle beyond technical execution. The moment with her mother's origami wing gestures toward emotional depth but never complicates her present choices or forces a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: silences layer and deepen until the prophecy dissolves. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who/where/when by the second paragraph). The closure—prophecy unmade, generals forgetting, Elara woven into silence—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) with conceptual cost visible in the wing's darkening and her exhaustion. One persistent issue: the causal chain from brook to world-scale hush lacks concrete intermediate steps, creating a compression that feels asserted rather than traced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The brook and origami wing function as micro-settings that constrain and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: moonlight pooling in eddies, paper trembling against current, the wing darkening. The nocturnal haven's spatial coherence holds throughout. However, the world beyond—markets, northern kingdoms, generals—remains abstract, never grounded in a second concrete location that would test Elara's reach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (silence the prophecy before war) is signaled early and pressured by the contagion's spread. The summoning itself provides one meaningful deepening as silences layer and flow. Yet the escalation operates off-stage—we're told generals sharpen swords and merchants repeat fragments, but no on-page reversal tests Elara's method or forces a tactical shift. The cost (exhaustion, the wing's transformation) is legible but arrives as aftermath rather than trade-off mid-attempt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: silence as power, incompleteness holding its own charge, the choice of mercy over sharp words. The origami wing's return with reweighted meaning—completed by silence rather than another fold—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final image avoids moralizing and the "tranquil blaze" motif accumulates genuine pressure. One slip: "the kind of forgetting that feels like mercy" edges toward thematic statement rather than trusting the image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Elara's perceptual signature clear: she notices textures of silence, the dual memory of soil and starlight, the brook's gentle sound. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during summoning, widening to the world's response). The prose carries a distinct lyric texture. Minor deduction: "the tranquil blaze of her craft" and "terrestrially cosmic in nature" briefly lift into elevated register that, while voice-consistent, borders on ornamental in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Clarity holds throughout. However, several figurative clusters in high-pressure beats blur rather than sharpen: "terrestrially cosmic," "transparency of the whole," "illumination of stillness that burned through noise the way dawn burns through fog." Two paraphrase loops: the prophecy's dissolution is restated across three sentences in paragraph six, and "the brook still moved" / "the night still cradled her" in the final paragraph. Template cadence: "she called...from deep caves...from the space...from the pause" in paragraph five. Aggregate penalty −0.8 for density and loops touching key beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—summoning silence to unmake a contagious prophecy—offers a fresh angle on magic-as-subtraction. The origami wing's incompleteness holding power is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Emotional specificity in the final image (exhaustion, the moment of not being solitary) avoids generic templates. However, the oracle-prophecy-war setup and the solitary-last-practitioner frame follow familiar fantasy templates without deep transformation through lived detail or moral calculus. The piece commits fully to its premise but the surrounding scaffolding reads derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's decision to hush the prophecy frames the story and her method (calling silences, layering them) drives the summoning sequence. She kneels, opens the satchel, sets the wing on water, closes her eyes, and begins—each choice advances the attempt. However, no mid-attempt complication forces a tactical pivot or value hierarchy. The character is present across all three gates (setup, development, payoff) but her choices do not create a key turn; the summoning proceeds as planned from beginning to end.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The origami wing appears in three distinct beats: opening (mother's gift, terrestrially cosmic memory), summoning (floats on brook, trembles, absorbs prophecy), and closure (darkens, folds inward, carried into shadow). Its incomplete state and dual memory (soil/starlight) enable the summoning method and its final transformation charges the ending image with irreversible cost. The wing is causally active and visibly reweighted at closure, making it nearly indispensable. Minor deduction: the mechanics of how it absorbs encoded sound remain asserted rather than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The smoothed hush concept shapes the entire story: Elara's goal is to weave silences into a single hush large enough to absorb the prophecy's noise. It drives her method (layering silences) and alters the world's state (generals forget, merchants lose the words). The hush is present in setup (stated goal), development (the summoning), and payoff (prophecy unmade). However, it operates more as stakes-label and thematic frame than as a tactical constraint that narrows her options under pressure. Swapping "smoothed hush" for "woven quiet" or "gathered stillness" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The paper's terrestrially cosmic nature—pulp harvested under a meteor shower, dried beneath open sky, fibers carrying dual memory of soil and starlight—is described in paragraph three and supplies the origami wing's power. This dual memory arguably enables the summoning by holding both ground and void. However, the attribute is never tested on the page; we do not see Elara choose this paper over another or pay a cost for its cosmic nature. It remains ornamental exposition that enriches texture but does not constrain or enable a dramatized action. Setup present, but development and payoff gates missing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Flow defines the story's method and imagery: silences flow through the brook downstream and upstream simultaneously, the hush spreads outward, the wing is carried into shadow. The concept appears in setup (brook's movement), development (silences defying current), and payoff (brook carries the wing away). Flow enables the summoning's reach and charges the final image. However, the action is somewhat swappable—"spread," "ripple," "diffuse" could replace "flow" with similar effect. The dual-direction flow (upstream and downstream) is specific but its mechanics remain asserted.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mapping silence is signaled early as Elara's "precise and ancient" method and described in paragraph five: she locates every pocket of quiet and weaves them. The method drives the summoning sequence and its success. However, the mechanics remain abstract—we see her calling silences and feeling textures, but the "mapping" aspect is told rather than shown through on-page spatial or tactical choices. The method is present in all three gates and functional but could be replaced with "weaving silence" or "gathering stillness" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook anchors all action. Elara kneels there (paragraph one), uses the brook's surface to float the wing (paragraph four), and the brook carries silences and the wing (paragraphs five and seven). The setting is present in setup, development, and payoff. The brook's gentle passage and its ability to carry things both directions enables the spell's reach. However, the haven's "unchanged since childhood" quality and its patient holding of Elara feel more atmospheric than constraining—removing the brook and placing the summoning in any still water would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "amid whispered secrets" is present throughout: the prophecy spreads for three weeks before Elara acts, circulates from village to village during her summoning, and is finally unmade. The time pressure shapes her motivation (act before the prophecy assembles into irreversible directive). However, the three-week window is backstory; the present-scene summoning has no visible clock or countdown that tightens her tactics. The timeframe is setup and thematic but does not drive on-page escalation or alter her method under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation—hush the prophecy before war—is stated early and drives every choice: traveling to the brook, withdrawing the wing, summoning silences, watching the prophecy dissolve. It appears in setup (paragraph two: "motivation was singular"), development (the summoning itself), and payoff (prophecy unmade, generals forgetting). The desire is dramatized through action rather than merely told. Minor deduction: the motivation faces no internal friction or competing want; Elara never weighs the cost of intervention against another path, so the motivation is singular and uncontested rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tone "tranquil blaze" is signaled in paragraph five ("the tranquil blaze of her craft") and sustained through imagery: gentle passage, warmth from a hearth, stillness that burns through noise without violence, the nocturnal haven holding her. The paradox of peaceful power modulates appropriately—close and focused during the summoning, widening to include the world's response, then returning to intimacy in the final lines. The tone charges the final image (breath joining the brook's sound, patient and unchanged). Minor issue: the phrase "tranquil blaze" itself appears only once as direct statement rather than being fully embodied across all pressure points.</comment>
