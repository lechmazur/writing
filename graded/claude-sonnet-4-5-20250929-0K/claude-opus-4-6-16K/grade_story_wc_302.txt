<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mirenne's interior is richly layered with concrete perception—the watch measurement, her pen pressing grooves, stopping breath at her mother's words—and her agency culminates in removing the veil and writing the letter. However, the emotional arc tilts heavily toward revelation rather than contradiction; the mother's unspoken words arrive as information that clarifies rather than forcing a choice between competing goods. The final act (writing the letter) feels like an earned response but lacks visible cost or foreclosed path; we don't see what she sacrifices or what stance she abandons to make that choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraphs; the Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (cyclical text → watch measurement → transcription → mother's passage → letter-writing forms a density increase toward a final cadence shift). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the second letter's identity is revealed and Mirenne's act of writing reweights the premise (silence as loss versus silence as alive resource). The cost is conceptual—she shifts from seeker to sender—but the felt price (what she forfeits by unveiling, what speaking costs her personally) remains oblique. One meaningful deepening is present but the stakes don't narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The library glows with vivid, specific detail—luminous ribs, amber radiance, warm paper and rain-memory scent—and the mist's cyclical behavior mirrors the text's unfolding pattern, charging the final image when "the mist carried her words outward." The watch serves as micro-setting (timing the cipher's cycles) and constrains her method of transcription. Spatial choreography is clean (shelves → volume → journal → watch → fresh page) and the setting's rules (organized by weight of silence, text cycling) are learned through action and observation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—documenting the unspoken to break silences—is signaled early and accumulates through three transcribed passages. Pressure deepens when the third passage reveals her mother's voice, forcing Mirenne to confront personal shame rather than abstract collection. However, the turn (recognizing the second letter must come from her) arrives as realization without a visible tradeoff; she doesn't weigh competing choices or forfeit a live option. The watch enables her method but coincidence (finding her mother's words) precipitates the shift rather than protagonist agency narrowing the field.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely through the cipher's cyclical text, the watch measuring trust-duration, and the library's organizing principle (weight of silence). The mother's passage personalizes the inquiry without moralizing, and the final letter—"I found the place where it went, and it is still alive"—offers a resonant answer without stating a thesis. The veil removal gains symbolic charge from prior setup. Minor slip: "propagating toward her through layers of fog and time" in the opening tilts toward abstract philosophizing, though the image recovers specificity when the letter becomes the one she writes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is strong in phrases like "text appearing and vanishing in a cyclically reversed pattern" and "pressing her pen hard enough to leave grooves in the next three pages." Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during reflection—"propagating toward her through layers of fog and time," "the tidal rhythm of all things withheld and released"—that strains against the concrete action beats. No dialogue present; voice modulates appropriately from cautious observation to charged recognition. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she realized") cluster in key beats but remain voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and most sentences advance character or atmosphere with strong specificity: "The veil was never protection. It was my shame." Propulsion is generally clean. Deductions: paraphrase loop in "She pulled a volume...opened it. The pages were blank, then not blank, then blank again—text appearing and vanishing...each revelation undoing itself before reassembling" restates the cycling without added pressure (−0.2). Elevated metaphor density in opening third ("veil had always dreamed behind her," "propagating...through layers of fog and time") without pattern-teaching (−0.4). Stock phrase "her heart racing" and "cautious exuberance" stated rather than embodied in motion. No artifacts touch closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The Library of Unspoken Words and its organizing principle (weight of silence replacing utterance) offer a fresh synthesis; the cyclically reversing text and the watch's trust-interval measurement transform familiar "lost words" material through specific mechanics. The confidence-man backstory adds lived detail. The turn—second letter is hers to write—feels earned in hindsight by the propagation-delay motif seeded early. Risk: the lyric register and non-linear temporality heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the veil's symbolic function and the "dreaming behind" opening lean toward template lyricism.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mirenne's choices—timing the cipher, transcribing passages, removing the veil, writing the letter—create the story's arc. Setup clear (arrives seeking the library), development present (uses the watch to read, stops at mother's passage), payoff solid (removes veil and writes). However, the key turns feel more reactive (responding to the mother's words) than proactive narrowing of options. Causal pressure is moderate; the element enables rather than constrains with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The watch appears in three beats: backstory (stolen from Harlan Dex), cipher-timing (measures propagation delays), and is set down before writing. Setup strong, development functional (constrains her reading method), but payoff weak—setting it down marks a shift but doesn't charge the final image or return with reweighted meaning. Specificity is high (trust intervals, propagation delays) yet the object could be replaced with another timing device without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher shapes stakes (must time cycles to read) and tactics (watch-measured transcription) across multiple beats. Setup immediate (pages blank/not blank), development solid (she documents each cycle's phrase), payoff present (completes three passages, prompting her own writing). The mechanic—text constructing/deconstructing—mirrors the theme and constrains her method. Removing this exact element would require a different reading challenge; strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cyclical reversal appears in text (appearing/vanishing), mist (thickening/thinning), and the library's glow, shaping Mirenne's reading method and charging the atmospheric consistency. Setup immediate, development clear (she times cycles, text reassembles in new configurations), payoff moderate (mist "cyclically reversed like the text itself" before carrying her words outward). The attribute enables the cipher mechanic but doesn't impose a visible tradeoff; it's more pattern than constraint. Specificity strong, swappability low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Documenting drives the middle sequence (transcribing three passages) and precipitates the turn (recognizing her mother's voice stops the process). Setup present (she carries a journal), development strong (presses pen hard, completes father's farewell and soldier's joke), payoff solid (shifts from documenting others' words to writing her own). The action is causally central; removing it would collapse the escalation. Cost connection is moderate—effort is shown but price of transcription versus speaking isn't dramatized until the end.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Propagation delays are explained (second letter approaching "through layers of fog and time, each relay adding its own fractional hesitation") and the watch measures them to time the cipher. Setup present, development weak (the mechanic is described but doesn't constrain a middle choice), payoff moderate (the second letter's delay is explained as waiting for her to finish). The method is more thematic gloss than on-page tactic; it could be omitted and the cipher-timing would still work. Introduced early but remains largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glowing library supplies the cipher (text in volumes), organizes by weight of silence (shaping her search logic), and the mist's behavior mirrors and carries her final words. Setup vivid and immediate, development strong (shelves' amber radiance, mist curling, spatial choreography clean), payoff high (mist carries words outward, library glows brighter in final image). The setting is indispensable to the central mechanic and charges the closure. Environment constrains her method (must read in cycles) and the glow/mist recur with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe is announced (between first and second letters, three-day backstory) and pays off when the second letter's identity is revealed. Setup clear, development absent (the gap doesn't tighten decisions mid-story), payoff present (she writes the reply that is the second letter). The temporal bracket frames the premise but doesn't create urgency or alter tactics; time isn't tracked or felt as pressure. It's more structural concept than live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mirenne's desire to find the library is stated ("she had searched for this place for eleven years") and dramatized through cautious movement and transcription urgency. Setup strong, development solid (transcribing passages enacts the search's payoff), closure present (finding her mother's words personalizes the quest and prompts her to write). However, friction between wanting to find versus cost of what she'll learn is minimal; she moves through discovery without visible trade-off until the veil removal, which feels more symbolic than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cautious exuberance is embodied in "heart racing beneath the discipline of careful steps" and modulates when she "stopped breathing" at her mother's voice, then shifts to resolve in the final writing act. Setup clear, development present (tone oscillates between wonder and restraint), payoff moderate (library glowing brighter and mist carrying words outward sustain exuberance, but caution fades without dramatic cost). The tone is coherent and charges the atmosphere, though the "cautious" half doesn't shape the final image as strongly as the exuberant half.</comment>
