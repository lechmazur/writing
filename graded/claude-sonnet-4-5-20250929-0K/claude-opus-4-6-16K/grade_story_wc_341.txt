<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior work is specific and contradictory—her categorization of clouds as emotional rebellion coexists with professional discipline. The core renunciation (letting go of standard meteorology to memorialize her father through subjective data) is earned through layered grief and the tether-break catalyst. Embodied emotion is strong: "panic was just another weather system" shows her observational lens under stress. Minor slip: the pilot's silent page-turning at the end risks sentiment without showing his specific internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The tether snap at 14,000 feet anchors the premise immediately; pressure accumulates through the night as Maren fills the logbook, deepening from data-gathering to memorialization. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Conceptual Repricing): she commits to unscientific categories that circulate among pilots, reweighting her father's absence as measurable deflection. Cost is conceptual and professional (dismissal by the service) but legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the ellipsis from night to rescue is motivated and charged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gondola at 14,000–16,200 feet is concrete and pressures choice: untethered drift forces Maren to redefine her work from data to elegy. The brass telescope anchors POV filtering (dusty starlight, cirrus transparency) and charges the closure reprise. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory hierarchy matches her professional lens (barometer, ice crystals bending light). Minor: the rescue helicopter's altitude precision feels slightly expository rather than urgently perceived, but does not obscure the setting's constraint on her final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving empty spaces remember, dramatized through the logbook project. The tether break is the tightening event that narrows options—she can no longer gather standard data, only personal testament. Cost is visible: hypothermia, professional dismissal, and the choice to fill pages "half science and half elegy" forecloses her prior objective methodology. Agency is decision and endurance under accumulative pressure. No second reversal needed; one meaningful deepening (work changes to memorialization) suffices and escalates under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (absence as measurable deflection) emerges through concrete images: cirrus crystals bending starlight, the spool unwinding to a curved core, "spooled wholeness." The ending offers a non-literal answer—"the empty space caught her"—that reweights the father's disappearance as a force with texture and pressure rather than void. No overt thesis; the logbook's circulation among pilots shows theme as lived knowledge. One small slip: "the empty space caught her. It always does" risks mild abstraction, but the prior telescope image anchors it sufficiently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Maren's meteorological idiom ("pressure gradients," "resigned but not bitter" wind classification) colors all perception. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("the work had changed") to lyric remove ("sand across a grave"). Free indirect style is clean. One friction: "the particular loneliness of a Tuesday afternoon" momentarily drifts into essayistic register that feels slightly external to her voice under crisis; it recovers quickly but nudges the score down from high 8s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively: short declarative "She did not scream" anchors voice, longer lyric sentences layer the emotional classifications. Information density is high; most lines do dual work (e.g., "the stars were dusty" is both observation and thematic seed). Minor pattern artifact: "The gondola turned slowly in a wind she classified as…" and similar classification framings repeat structurally across several beats, creating a template cadence that doesn't quite reach −0.4 threshold but prevents entry into high 8s. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality; clarity remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: meteorologist who categorizes clouds by emotion to measure her father's absence is non-obvious and specific. The logbook as elegy and "dusty starlight" avoid cliché through concrete physical detail (ice crystals bending light, brass telescope, altitude instruments). Risk-taking in lyric accumulation succeeds without obscuring clarity. One check: the grief-scientist premise has adjacent templates in contemporary fiction; transformation through occupational specificity (aviation meteorology, the gondola tether) and the particular physics-of-absence calculus rescues it, but the conceptual neighborhood limits the top band slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's professional identity shapes her response to the tether break (no scream, observational calm) and drives the decision to shift from standard data to emotional categorization. Present early, active in the middle turn (reclassifying her work), and implicit in closure (the logbook circulates among pilots). Two-gate minimum met; causal pressure is moderate—her role enables the method but doesn't force a high-cost choice that only an aviation meteorologist could make. Swappability check: a different scientific observer could perform similar work with modest edits. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Brass telescope appears in three beats: initial observation of dusty stars, mid-scene cirrus study proving absence by deflection, and closure reprise on her desk "aimed at a window that faces the sky." Each use shifts meaning: from inherited tool to proof instrument to memorial anchor. Setup and payoff gates met strongly; middle development is present but slightly passive (she looks through it without the object constraining a tactical choice). Irreplaceability is high—father's gift charges every use—but the telescope doesn't narrow options so much as witness them.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Spooled wholeness" is coined mid-scene, defined on the page ("the empty core still holds the shape of everything"), and recurs thematically in the final image ("the hollow core that held the shape of everything"). It shapes Maren's stake (proving absence has structure) and the logbook's organizing logic. Setup and closure gates met; middle development is thematic rather than tactical—she doesn't choose differently because of this concept, she articulates it. Felt cost is conceptual (professional dismissal) but the concept itself doesn't foreclose a path. Solid mid-band for thematic spine without causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is asserted twice: "The absence was quietly explosive, packed with a force…" and implied in the gondola's calm drift charged with grief. The trait colors tone and stakes but doesn't enable or constrain an on-page action with visible tradeoff. No moment where being quietly explosive (rather than, say, loudly urgent) alters her choice. Setup present, closure echo weak, middle absent. Label-only use without causal pressure. Low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Memorialize" is signaled early ("she was memorializing him"), drives the middle escalation ("filling page after page…half science and half elegy"), and defines closure (the logbook as distributed secret among pilots). The action redefines her work and forecloses standard methodology with professional cost (meteorological service dismissal). Three gates met with strong causal pressure. Not quite indispensable—alternate verbs like "document" or "catalog" could stand in—but the specific elegiac weight of "memorialize" charges the father-absence theme and the final image. High-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Categorizing clouds by emotion is introduced in paragraph 4, mechanic detailed (sixty-three classifications, logbook entries), drives middle beats (adding "spooled wholeness" as sixty-fourth), and shapes closure (the logbook circulates because it records what pilots "had flown through" but never named). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The method enables her memorialization and differentiates her from standard meteorology with professional cost. Strong irreplaceability—no other method would produce the same elegiac data or thematic payoff. Solid upper band; not quite indispensable because the ending could theoretically function with a different recording method, but close.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sky gondola at 14,000 feet is anchored immediately, the tether snap forces the work redefinition, altitude and isolation constrain her to solo observation, and the setting returns in closure ("drifting at 16,200 feet, hypothermic and calm"). Three gates strongly met. The gondola's untethered state is the core constraint that narrows options to memorialization. Spatial choreography is clean (creaking, turning, drifting). Near-indispensable—removing the gondola would collapse the isolation and altitude stakes. High band; one small check is that "sky" + "observation station" could be replaced with another high-altitude platform with some edits, preventing the absolute top score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the string breaks" is the inciting event, anchored at line one. The night-long drift structures the middle (she writes until dawn), and rescue at dawn marks closure. Setup and payoff met; middle development is durational but not tactically tightening—time passing doesn't force interim choices so much as allow accumulation. Hypothermia is the sole time-cost on the page. No live countdown that alters moves. Functional spine but not a driver. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to prove that empty spaces remember" is stated early ("That was what she had come to prove"), dramatized in the cirrus-deflection study, and fulfilled in closure (the logbook as proof-artifact). Friction is present: professional dismissal is the cost, and the choice to fill pages as elegy rather than data is a visible tradeoff. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The desire drives the escalation from observation to memorialization. Not quite indispensable—alternate grief-work goals could stand in—but the specific epistemological claim (proving absence via deflection) is tightly braided with theme and method. Upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Dusty starlight" is introduced early (paragraph 2), recurs in the night-long scene ("the stars poured their dusty light across her logbook"), and charges the final telescope image ("she never looks through it without seeing the dusty starlight of that night"). Tone is coherent and modulates: lyric distance during observation, intimate during memorialization, elegiac at closure. The specific texture (tired, ancient, carrying memory of distances) matches the theme of absence-as-deflection. Strong irreplaceability—no other tonal phrase would encode the same fatigue and wonder. High band; the tone shapes the final image's resonance and is indispensable to the piece's emotional register.</comment>
