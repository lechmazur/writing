<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's expertise and sensory signature (identifying people by walk) are strongly embodied and character-particular. Her choice to guide Fen by whisper shows agency under pressure, and his transformation from GPS-reliant to attentive listener is earned through the storm's acoustic shift. The final gesture—Fen unfolding her map—closes with visible cost to his prior certainty. Minor: Fen's arc compresses quickly, and his interior remains thin compared to Maren's richly established competence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Situational lens with Accumulative/Textural support: the geomagnetic storm reconfigures the labyrinth's acoustics, forcing Fen to abandon instruments and listen. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Fen's act of unfolding Maren's map and pocketing his phone crystallizes a shift in epistemology—trust earned through demonstrated mastery—with felt cost to his professional confidence. The storm constraint and whisper-versus-shout logic hold consistently, and the final image reweights the opening claim that "shouts don't carry."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly specific (six-high stacks, corrugated steel, rain channels, acoustic pathways) and directly shapes Maren's tactics and the challenge. The geomagnetic storm alters the environment's acoustic properties, enabling the whisper-guided test. The hidden seam at Container 7712 and the painted star chart reward spatial precision. The aurora-lit gap at Junction 14 charges the confrontation scene. Environment constrains and enables choices throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving that the labyrinth's knowledge cannot be digitized—is signaled at Junction 14 and tested through the whisper-guided navigation. The geomagnetic storm tightens pressure by disabling GPS and amplifying the acoustic logic Maren commands. Fen's professional confidence narrows to tentative listening, and the discovery of the hidden panel at 7712 delivers a visible consequence: he pockets his phone and unfolds her map. One meaningful reversal (from confident stride to heel-to-toe attention) earned by protagonist agency with legible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—embodied knowledge versus instrumental mastery, the epistemology of attention—emerges organically through the whisper-versus-shout test and is never stated outright. The zodiac coin, the key with no lock, and the painted star chart layer absence-as-information without forced symbolism. The final image ("the labyrinth wanted to carry it") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: some things reveal themselves only to those who listen. The phrase "folklore" versus "definitive map" seeds the conflict early and the resolution reweights it without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited on Maren; psychic distance is controlled and her perceptual signature (acoustic awareness, folded-map semiotics) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext: Fen's "Your maps are folklore" establishes his stance; Maren's whispered commands demonstrate rather than argue. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during the storm's onset, longer syntactic moves during the guided walk. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the voice remains character-particular throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>High information density and varied syntax create propulsion. Figurative language is controlled: "auroras rippled," "whisper slid down the corridor like water," "containers sang"—all concrete and voice-motivated. The opening anchors setting and stakes efficiently. Two minor slips: "something architectural, something alive" leans slightly purple without adding new information, and "a low, omnidirectional hum that made every whisper crystalline" could be tighter. No paraphrase loops, no scaffold. Sentence openings vary; paragraph rhythm breathes with scene tempo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic labyrinth, geomagnetic storm, and folded maps as epistemological tools is specific and non-obvious. The premise—knowledge that cannot be digitized, carried only by whisper—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The zodiac coin and keyless key add mystery without gimmickry. Risk: the story commits fully to its sensory logic and resists explaining the star chart or the labyrinth's origins, trusting the reader to hold ambiguity. The transformation test holds: swapping names and setting would flatten the tale's particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's role as labyrinth maintenance worker drives every major turn: her acoustic expertise enables the whisper-guide challenge, her knowledge of Container 7712 structures the quest, and her choice to test Fen rather than argue defines the conflict. The occupation is causally indispensable; setup early, active in middle navigation, and present in the closure when Fen adopts her method. Visible cost: professional authority proven but shared.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in three beats: Maren pulls it from her pocket at Junction 14, presses it into Fen's palm as proof of hidden locks, and it unlocks Container 7712's hidden seam at the climax. Its Pisces stamp and keyhole motif signal mystery early. However, its mechanics arrive late (final third) and it resolves a problem (the hidden panel) it did not help create earlier. It charges the ending but feels somewhat ornamental compared to the whisper-logic that dominates pressure. The lyric resonance (locks without keys) ties to the brass key motif but does not constrain mid-story choices.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The folded maps concept is seeded in paragraph one, recurs when Maren offers the challenge ("Your maps are folklore"), and returns in the final image when Fen unfolds one "turning it slowly in the aurora light, watching the creases reveal a labyrinth that was not one place but many." The maps embody the story's epistemology: perspectival knowledge versus singular digitization. They shape Maren's professional identity and the thematic stakes. Middle development is thinner—they are described but not actively used during the navigation—so they function more as thematic anchor than tactical tool. Still, removing them would break the closure's symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maren's ability to identify people by walk is vividly established in paragraph two (Harjo's dragging heel, kids' syncopated bursts, smugglers' arrhythmia). However, it never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Fen is identified by his "clipped, confident stride," but the trait does not create a turn or tactical choice. It enriches characterization and setting texture but remains ornamental. Present early, but no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The challenge—Fen's demand to digitize the labyrinth and Maren's counter-offer to guide him by whisper—is the inciting incident at Junction 14 and structures every subsequent beat. It establishes the dominant stake (embodied versus instrumental knowledge), drives the navigation sequence, and delivers the closure when Fen pockets his phone and unfolds her map. The action is causally indispensable: without it, there is no conflict, no test, no transformation. Early signal, middle pressure, closure payoff with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The brass key with no lock is introduced in the challenge scene ("the key she wore on a cord around her neck") as proof that the labyrinth holds unsolved mysteries. It recurs as a thematic motif ("absence was its own kind of information") but never constrains a choice or enables an action. The zodiac coin, not the key, unlocks Container 7712. The key is present early and thematically consonant but mechanically inert—swappable with any other symbol of unfinished knowledge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is established in the opening line, built with layered detail (six-high stacks, service corridors, rain channels, acoustic pathways), and directly shapes every tactic: the storm alters its acoustics, Maren's whisper navigates its channels, and Container 7712's hidden seam delivers the climax. The setting is not backdrop but active pressure and resource. Removing it collapses the story's logic, stakes, and closure. Setup, development, and payoff all hinge on its specific architecture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm arrives in paragraph three, reconfigures the labyrinth's acoustics ("a low, omnidirectional hum that made every whisper crystalline and every shout a muddy roar"), disables Fen's GPS, and enables Maren's whisper-guided test. It tightens the timeframe (the storm is a bounded event), constrains tactics (no instruments), and charges the final image ("the storm pulsed, and the containers sang"). The storm is causally essential to the conflict's pressure and resolution. Setup, middle constraint, closure presence with cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts"—is dramatized when Maren guides Fen by whisper alone while his shouts dissolve. It structures the challenge and is paid off in the final line: "Maren's whisper traveled farther than any shout ever had—not because it was louder, but because the labyrinth wanted to carry it." However, Maren's internal desire is asserted more than conflicted; she never doubts or pays a visible personal cost for proving her point. The motivation shapes the plot but lacks friction or tradeoff within her own psychology.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone blends meticulous technical detail (rust mitigation, hinge replacement, acoustic pathways) with lyric imagery (bruised sky, containers singing, whisper sliding "like water") in a way that reads as calculated spontaneity—controlled expertise meeting improvised response to the storm. The tone modulates: clinical exposition in the opening, rising tension at the confrontation, lyric compression during the navigation, and charged poise in the final image. Coherent through turns and the tone charges the ending. Not static, but the "calculated spontaneity" label feels more externally imposed than intrinsic to the narrative voice.</comment>
