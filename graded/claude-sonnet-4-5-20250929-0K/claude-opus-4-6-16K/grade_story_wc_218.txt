<question>1</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is rendered with exceptional specificity—her "brazen calm of someone who had stopped being afraid of running out of time" embodies contradictory impulses (urgency/serenity) acting simultaneously. The shift from observation to intervention is causally motivated by the diagnosis, and her final choice to remove the wires and close the diary forecloses the path of continued direct intervention with visible cost. Minor reservation: the piece remains largely solitary, so relationship crucible and status dynamics are not tested on the page, but the Track A allowance and the strength of her internal arc more than compensate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren completes the remodel, removes the wires, and closes the diary, forecloses her own continuation with visible cost ("the last day she felt strong enough"), and the final image—light through canopy, oaks holding position—reweights prior material under an Accumulative lens with undeniable pressure. Causality holds throughout; the architectural negotiation is motivated, the wire intervention is dramatized across beats, and the ending lands with felt cost and conceptual repricing of interspecies respect. Orientation is anchored early (island, orchard, diagnosis); one meaningful deepening (from documentation to intervention) tightens options and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The living stone pillars and their lithite biology are not ornamental—they constrain Maren's wire-placement tactics, guide root-channel timing, and charge the closure image (oaks holding position, pillars accepting them). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her professional attention (mineral output, microscopic channels, pale roots in grey stone). The orchard functions as both macro-setting and micro-constraint, with copper wire and altar stone anchoring spatial choreography; the final light-column image directly reprices the architectural secret and her work within it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard survival/interspecies alignment) is signaled early and tightens once: Maren shifts from passive documentation to active remodeling, a choice that narrows her final months to this single project with visible opportunity cost. The wire intervention escalates tension (will the lithites respond?), and by month four the eastern oaks straighten—a micro turn that sets up the final beat where she removes the wires and tests whether the architecture can hold without her. Agency is renunciation (closing the diary, sitting among roots) with on-page cost (her remaining strength spent, the work complete but her departure imminent).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme—collaboration across difference, the work that outlasts the worker—emerges entirely from particulars (copper wire conductivity, lithite mineral channels, oak root negotiation) without a single thesis statement. The final image offers a non-literal answer: "two unlike things could still learn to hold each other up" is dramatized by the oaks' held positions and the pillars' acceptance, not declared. The botanical diary as autobiography and the altar-stone placement silently communicate legacy without sentimentality. Subtext operates in every gesture (wire removal as trust, sitting among roots as integration).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Maren's professional and bodily lens ("brazen calm," "systematic," perceptual signature filters everything through botanical precision). Diction remains character-particular under pressure: "Fear required a future tense she no longer conjugated" is compressed but legible, voice-motivated, and earned by the diagnosis frame. The prose modulates cleanly from clinical observation to lyric intensity at closure without head-hopping or register drift. Psychic distance contracts appropriately in the wire-placement beats and opens slightly in the final reflective image, always purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances orchard state, Maren's tactics, or thematic weight. Rhythm varies (short declaratives at the wire beats, longer cumulative syntax in the lithite exposition, stripped cadence at closure). Zero paraphrase loops or template runs; no filter-verb stacks. Minor reservation: "gently systematic" recurs across two beats in slightly varied forms, risking a faint echo, but the repetition is pattern-taught (her documented method) and pays off at closure, so the loop screen waives penalty. Figurative language ("dialogue between oaks and stone," "architecture was negotiated") is coherent and specific, not decorative.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lithite-organism premise is fresh and grounds the interspecies-respect theme in verifiable biology rather than metaphor. The remodel-not-demolish frame reorients terminal-illness narrative away from bucket-list sentimentality toward ecological stewardship with visible cost. Copper-wire conductivity as translation mechanism is specific and irreplaceable. Slight deduction: the six-months timeframe and solitary-caretaker setup echo familiar templates, though the orchard's living architecture and Maren's refusal of grief transform them enough to avoid derivative penalties.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's choices create every key turn: she decides to remodel (inciting), wraps copper wire to reintroduce species (middle beats), removes wires to test permanence (closure beat). Her renunciation (closing diary, sitting among roots) forecloses continuation with visible cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending with strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The diary appears in setup (established as eleven-year record), is referenced in middle beats (taught her copper conductivity), and returns at closure (closed, placed on altar). It constrains her method (systematic documentation informs wire tactics) and the altar placement charges the ending with legacy. Two meaningful beats plus closure linkage, but the middle use is summary rather than dramatized handling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Architectural secrets (lithite organisms, living pillars, negotiated growth) shape every tactic: Maren's wire method depends on understanding mineral deposits and biological imperatives, the orchard's failure drives the remodel, and the final image (oaks holding, pillars accepting) reprices the secret as collaborative architecture. Present in setup, middle pressure, and closure with high specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" constrains on-page action with visible cost: her methodical wire placements and daily recordings consume time and patience, her refusal to rush the lithite response delays visible results, and the trait charges the closure (systematic observation yields to trust when she removes wires). Present in setup label, enacted in middle beats, and paid off at ending. The trait is specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Remodel is the story's spine: inciting decision, method (wire redirection), escalation (lithite response, oak straightening), and closure test (wire removal, architecture holds). Every major turn traces to this action; swapping it would break the narrative. High causal pressure, irreplaceability, and closure participation with felt cost (her final strength spent on this work).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Copper wire is signaled early (conducts electrical signals lithites sense), its mechanics matter (wrapped around branches, pressed to pillars, opens mineral channels), it drives middle beats (lithite softening, root entry), and the closure hinges on its removal (oaks hold without support). Specific, irreplaceable, and causally essential across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>Temple orchard and living pillars supply every constraint and resource: lithite biology dictates wire method, pillar density causes the crisis, orchard layout guides Maren's circuit, and the final light-through-canopy image occurs within this exact setting. The micro-setting (altar stone, root clusters, mineral channels) alters tactics throughout. Indispensable to logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Six-months timeframe tightens decisions (Maren abandons patience for action, "burned away her patience for observation"), tracks elapsed time ("by the fourth month"), and the closure beat arrives on "the last day she felt strong enough"—a live clock that alters tactics and charges the ending. Present in setup, middle, and closure, though the middle tracking is compressed rather than beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Interspecies respect is dramatized through every wire placement (reintroducing oak and lithite), tested by the orchards' estrangement, and the closure directly embodies it ("two unlike things could still learn to hold each other up"). Motivation shapes all choices, faces friction (will the lithites respond? will the oaks hold?), and is paid off with visible cost (her work complete, her departure imminent). Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Brazen calm is coherent throughout—Maren's refusal of fear, systematic method under terminal pressure, and the final image ("without urgency, without grief, with steady attention") all modulate the tone without breaking it. The tone charges the closure by framing her renunciation as composed rather than tragic. Present in setup, sustained under pressure, and reprised at ending, though it remains more stable than dynamically shifting.</comment>
