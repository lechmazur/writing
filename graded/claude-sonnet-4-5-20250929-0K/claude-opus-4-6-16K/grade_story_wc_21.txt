<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Miriam's obsessive descent into the visions is embodied through concrete detail—skipped meals, whispered addresses to letters, pale knuckles gripping the desk. Her final choice to continue pressing fingers to the diary "not because she needed more data" but to honor witness shows an earned alteration rooted in her archival creed. Internal contradiction surfaces when professional duty conflicts with the pull of empathic immersion, though the piece could sharpen the cost of this choice. The woman with scarified arms remains vivid but functions more as vision-object than pressure source; Miriam's struggle is largely solo and reflective.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Miriam aboard the Bibliotheca Ascendant, eleven years cataloging erasure. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—visions intensify, cipher details accumulate, understanding deepens through density increase rather than because/therefore linkage. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Miriam transcribes, contacts descendants, prepares to search, yet continues the visions "not because she needed more data" but to honor witness—a renunciation of pure archival distance with felt cost. The thirty-nine-day breakthrough and the final choice to keep experiencing visions form a coherent tightening and deepening under the lens, though the cost could be made more visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The zeppelin's "amber conservation lamps," "acid-free enclosures," and "coolest air" micro-setting details constrain archival work and charge the final shelving act. The obsidian lagoon—salt wind, volcanic glass cutting feet, black water's stillness—returns across vision beats and anchors the cipher's solution (shoreline contours = substitution alphabet), directly shaping Miriam's breakthrough. Sensory selection reflects archival priorities: iron-gall ink smell, oilskin wrapping, paper age. The floating library's suspension "between sky and sand" becomes metaphor made spatial constraint, and the lagoon's physical contours unlock the encryption, making setting indispensable to the plot turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering and honoring erased history—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The visions function as escalation: flashes lengthen, Miriam becomes "retrocognitively trapped," witnessing the betrayal and the leader's desperate shell-message warnings. The cipher-breaking on day thirty-nine narrows options (now she can read it) and raises cost (descendants must be contacted, the site searched, witness must continue). Agency appears in her decision to keep pressing fingers to the diary after transcription is complete, an endurance choice that forecloses detachment. The cost is felt but somewhat diffuse—"searing reverie" suggests intensity, yet the story stops short of showing her professional or personal life concretely altered beyond skipped meals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the cipher structure itself: the lagoon's obsidian contours encode the alphabet, truth literally shaped by landscape and survival. "Truth was not merely found. It was honored. It was carried" lands as earned wisdom rooted in Miriam's eleven-year practice and the vision immersion. The piece resists moralizing; the woman with scarified arms "deserved a witness who would not look away" grows from concrete detail (beach debris messages, settlement names, betrayal) rather than abstraction. Subtext operates in Miriam's shift from data-gathering to empathic endurance, and the final image—floating library, suspended reverie—offers a resonant answer to the central question of how the present honors erased pasts without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Miriam; psychic distance tightens during vision immersion ("She felt the woman's anguish as if it were her own") without head-hopping into the historical figure's autonomous interiority. Diction carries archival precision—"iron-gall smell," "acid-free enclosures," "Adinkra glyph"—that roots voice in profession. Syntax modulates: long, suspended constructions in reflective passages ("a woman who believed that truth was a debt the present owed the dead") compress to shorter beats during vision intensity. The opening cathedral simile and "searing reverie" frame establish a lyric-elevated register that holds without clashing with Miriam's scholarly lexicon, though some phrases ("swollen with shelves") verge on ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high: the opening sentence establishes zeppelin, Saharan coast, archive mission, and Miriam's solemnity. Rhythm varies—long suspended openers ("The zeppelin drifted...") alternate with short declaratives ("The letters changed everything"). Minor scaffold appears: "She was the floating library's sole archivist, solemn by profession and by nature" could lose "by nature" without loss. The phrase "the particular silence that accumulates around preserved suffering" and "volcanic glass cutting bare feet" deliver concrete sensory work. A few near-loops: "whispered to the letters" / "whisper back" and the closing triad "honored. It was carried. And aboard..." where the third clause extends rather than advances. No major artifact clouds closure, and the lagoon-as-cipher payoff is clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—floating archive meets retrocognitive visions meets landscape-encoded cipher—feels specific and non-obvious. The obsidian lagoon's shoreline contours functioning as substitution alphabet is an ingenious physical-conceptual link that grows organically from the settlement's need for secrecy. The piece transforms the "hidden history" premise through the archival frame and embodied vision mechanic rather than relying on generic discovery beats. Risk-taking appears in the lyric-dense prose and the choice to make the climax a decryption rather than confrontation, though the vision mechanism itself (touch-triggered retrocognition) leans toward familiar speculative tropes without much transformation of that element's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's solemnity and archival ethos ("truth was a debt the present owed the dead") frame the narrative and drive her obsessive cipher work. Her decision to transcribe, contact descendants, and continue the visions despite completing the data work constitutes agency at closure. However, her choices mostly deepen existing commitment rather than forcing a turn between competing goods; the vision immersion escalates but does not meaningfully alter her professional stance until the very end, where the shift from data to witness is asserted more than tested.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears in vision beats (salt wind, volcanic glass, black water), structures the cipher solution (shoreline contours = alphabet), and recurs in the closing paragraph as Miriam prepares to search for it beneath the dunes. Its physical properties (obsidian contours, stillness) are causally indispensable to the decryption and emotionally charge the visions. The element shapes two major beats (vision immersion, cipher breakthrough) and is present in the ending's search preparation, making it nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The encrypted diary discovery incites the plot: Miriam's obsession begins with the misrouted crate, visions start when she touches the pages, and the cipher-breaking on day thirty-nine redefines her mission. The concept shapes stakes (uncovering Mawu-Deka) and tactics (photographing pages, cross-referencing codes, mapping lagoon contours). It appears early, drives middle beats, and the transcription/descendant contact at closure stem directly from it. The diary's transformation from obstacle to key (lagoon-as-cipher) demonstrates irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is named mid-story and constrains Miriam's perception: she is "pulled backward into someone else's seeing each time she touched the encrypted pages," and visions grow longer, forcing empathic immersion with cost (pale knuckles, hammering heart). The trait enables the witness role that defines closure. However, the mechanics are somewhat passive—she endures rather than navigates constraint—and the attribute could pressure on-page choices more directly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The parley-as-trap drives the historical betrayal Miriam witnesses in visions and motivates the leader's shell-message warnings, which in turn inform the diary's encryption strategy. The action shapes Miriam's understanding of why the settlement scattered and why the cipher was necessary. It is signaled in the vision sequence, causally linked to the diary's existence, and underpins the descendants' significance at closure. Swapping "parley" for another betrayal mechanism would require rewriting the shell-message detail and the leader's tactical calculus.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Beach debris messages—"shells and bones and knotted rope laid in precise patterns along the tide line"—appear in one vision beat as the leader's method for warning allied ships. The detail enriches the historical layer and demonstrates the settlement's tactical ingenuity, but it does not constrain Miriam's choices or directly shape the cipher solution. The method is observed rather than used by the protagonist and does not return at closure, limiting integration despite its vividness.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating library supplies the "amber conservation lamps" that enable photography, the "acid-free enclosures" and "coolest air" that govern archival shelving, and the spatial metaphor ("suspended in searing reverie") that charges the ending. Miriam's eleven-year tenure aboard roots her obsession in professional context. The zeppelin's mobility enables the planned descent to search for the lagoon. The setting shapes multiple beats (misrouted crate delivery, photography work, final shelving) and contributes directly to closure imagery.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the letters are found" anchors the narrative and the thirty-nine-day cipher-breaking creates temporal progression and escalation (visions lengthen, obsession deepens). However, the time pressure is durational rather than urgent—no external clock forces decisions, and the story could function with similar emotional arc across a different span. Time structures the piece but does not decisively narrow options or constrain tactics at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Miriam's drive "to uncover truth in tension"—discerning genuine words from colonial lures, decrypting the diary, honoring erased history—shapes every beat: the cipher obsession, the vision immersion, the transcription, the descendant contact, and the final choice to continue witnessing beyond data need. The motivation is embodied in skipped meals, whispered addresses, and the decision to keep pressing fingers to the diary. Friction appears between archival detachment and empathic immersion, costing her professional distance. The desire is tested and reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Searing reverie" is established early ("the particular silence that accumulates around preserved suffering") and sustained through lyric-dense constructions, elevated diction, and the vision sequences' sensory intensity (salt wind, volcanic glass, black water). Tone modulates appropriately: reflective in the opening, compressed and embodied during vision immersion ("her knuckles pale, her heart hammering"), elegiac at the cipher breakthrough ("Miriam wept as the sentences assembled"), and charged at closure ("suspended in searing reverie"). The tone directly supports the final image and integrates across all major beats.</comment>
