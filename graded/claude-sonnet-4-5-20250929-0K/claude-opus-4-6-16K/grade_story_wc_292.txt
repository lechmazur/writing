<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior state is well-embodied—"nervously confident tremor," "pulse hammering in her throat"—and her motivations are clear and specific throughout. The relationship with Britta is emotional and purposeful, though mediated entirely through memory and objects. Minor limitation: Maren's decision to pursue the reversal is pre-made; we see her execute a plan rather than face a choice under pressure on the page. Halvorsen remains functional but thin, applying pressure through examination rather than complication.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Halvorsen's agreement to file for reversal is a Decisive Change earned by the journals' evidence, and Maren's physical and emotional response ("dread…began to wring itself dry," the warm nail) provides felt cost. The drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture; the journals unlock the reversal, and the final image reweights Britta's sacrifice. Orientation is swift and clear (who, where, why by paragraph two). One meaningful tightening occurs when Halvorsen traces the coordinates and confirms the rockfalls match the wreck site, narrowing doubt and enabling the decision.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The weather station is vividly rendered—"ozone and mildew," "faint condensation," "salt-streaked concrete"—and the shifted jet stream frames urgency and thematic resonance (disrupted patterns, uncovered truths). The copper nail functions as a micro-setting object that charges the closure moment. Spatial choreography is clean; Maren's movements (ferry arrival, setting journals on desk, unwrapping nail) track coherently. The setting does not constrain a choice directly, which limits the score below 8.0, but it supplies atmosphere and a credible frame for the Guild liaison mechanism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reversing Britta's exile—is signaled early and pursued on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when Halvorsen examines the journals and traces the coordinates, confirming the rockfalls and making the reversal possible. Maren's agency is execution of a prepared case rather than a choice under fire; the cost is emotional release rather than a forfeiture. The story meets the 8.0-band threshold (tightening, visible cost) but lacks a second reversal or tactical trade-off to push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—cartography as justice, truth-telling at personal cost, memory reclaimed—emerges organically from Britta's sacrifice and Maren's quest. The coded stanzas and copper nail are particular, not ornamental; the final image ("A line redrawn. An exile reversed. The maps, at last, made honest.") reweights the premise without moralizing. The parallel between the shifted jet stream (disrupted patterns revealing hidden truths) and the uncovered journals is purposeful and resonant. Minor limitation: the weather station framing risks symbolic convenience, but it remains functional rather than forced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited, filtered through Maren's perspective with controlled access. Voice is distinct and literary: "spongey, absorbent, soaking up every doubt," "the restless argument between sky and sea." Dialogue is sparse but functional; Maren's declaration and Halvorsen's response advance plot without flab. Perceptual signature is consistent (cartographic metaphors, attention to physical proof). Minor slip: "the dread…began…to wring itself dry" is slightly over-processed for peak emotion, though it recovers quickly in the warm nail image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is controlled and vivid with strong rhythm: "the sea would return what the Guild had tried to bury," "something old and patient had finally exhaled." Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor loop: the phrase "new tricks" (paragraph one) and "new-pattern winds" (paragraph eight) echo without added pressure. The closure paragraph ("A line redrawn. An exile reversed. The maps, at last, made honest.") risks schematic repetition but remains charged by context. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination—map librarian, coded journals from a shipwreck, reversible exile, ancestor vindication—feels fresh and specific. The jet stream shift as a framing device for unearthing the past is purposeful, though it risks symbolic convenience. Execution is solid but not daring; the emotional arc and plot beats follow a familiar vindication template (evidence presented, authority convinced, name restored). The coded stanzas and copper nail provide texture, but the core premise does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and drives the reversal by presenting the journals and invoking Guild protocol. She makes one key choice—to bring the case to Halvorsen—though that choice occurs before the story opens. On the page, she executes her plan rather than navigating a new complication. Her idealism is embodied in the "cartography as justice" framing and the physical care with the copper nail. The trait shapes two beats (arrival/presentation, closure response) and the ending, but lacks mid-story friction or a second pivot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The copper nail appears in three beats: unwrapping at the desk, held during the journals' examination, and warm in her palm at closure. It is the "only physical proof that Britta Solvik had existed" and charges the final image with tactile, emotional weight. The nail does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—it is symbolic rather than causal—but its return with reweighted meaning (from relic to living connection) earns solid integration. Removing it would not break the plot but would flatten the closure's emotional texture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reversible exile is the story's engine: it creates the dominant stake, shapes Maren's tactics (invoking Guild protocol fourteen, presenting coded evidence), and delivers the closure (Halvorsen's agreement to file for reversal). The concept is signaled early, dramatized through the journals' examination, and resolved on the page with felt cost. The specific legal mechanism (protective intent clause) is unique enough to resist easy swapping. Removing this concept would collapse the plot entirely.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Nervously confident" is embodied in the opening ("that old nervously confident tremor in her hands: certain she was right, terrified of what being right would cost") and recurs in "pulse hammering in her throat" during the desk scene. The trait constrains Maren's emotional state but does not alter a choice or tactic on the page; it colors her execution of a pre-decided plan. Present in setup and one middle beat, but not causally active at closure. The cost is interior (dread wringing dry) rather than a forfeiture or tactical trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Question" (the standing exile via Guild protocol fourteen) is the inciting action that frames the entire scene. Maren's voiced challenge ("I need to question the standing exile") triggers Halvorsen's examination, the coordinate confirmation, and the reversal decision. The action is irreplaceable—without it, the story remains backstory. It shapes two beats (Maren's declaration, Halvorsen's response) and directly enables closure. The action itself is simple, but its consequences are decisive and charged.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coded stanzas are signaled early ("poems that, when their first letters were read vertically, spelled out coordinates"), examined on the page ("The coded stanzas were meticulous"), and validated by Halvorsen's coordinate trace. The method is specific enough to resist swapping (not just "journals" but a deliberate cipher), and it creates the causal link that enables the reversal. Present in setup, development (examination beat), and indirectly at closure (the reversal depends on this proof). The mechanics matter and are dramatized rather than summarized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The experimental weather station provides a credible frame for Halvorsen's dual role (director and Guild liaison) and thematic resonance (disrupted patterns, uncovered truths). It supplies vivid atmosphere (ozone, condensation, radar arrays, sideways rain) and anchors the story spatially. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; the reversal could occur in any Guild office. Present across all three beats but functions as backdrop rather than causal agent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The jet stream shift is the catalyst that churns the seabed and releases the Helviksand wreckage, enabling Maren's case. It is signaled in the opening line and recurs in the final paragraph ("the shifted winds carried rain sideways"). The timeframe creates thematic resonance (climate change as metaphor for uncovering buried truths) but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; the reversal scene is unrushed. Present in setup and closure, functional in backstory, but does not impose a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren's desire to honor Britta is the story's emotional and causal core: it drives her three-year investigation, the presentation of the journals, and the emotional payoff at closure ("nobody remembered"). The motivation is dramatized through embodied action (carrying the journals, unwrapping the nail, picturing the registry restoration) and carries visible cost (three years, illegal possession, "terrified of what being right would cost"). Present in setup, tested in the examination beat, and resolved in the closure image. No friction between competing wants on the page, but the cost is felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Spongey dread" is embodied throughout: "the building itself were sweating with dread," "the dread that had lived in Maren's chest for months—spongey, absorbent, soaking up every doubt—began, at last, to wring itself dry." The tone is coherent, modulates with pressure (thick room, instruments recording "restless argument"), and charges the final image (the dread wringing dry as the nail warms). The metaphor is specific and voice-particular. Present across all beats and integral to the closure's emotional texture, though the "spongey" descriptor risks slight over-processing.</comment>
