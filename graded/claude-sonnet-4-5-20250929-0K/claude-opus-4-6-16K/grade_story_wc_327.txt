<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular: the copper veins hum when she speaks the old tongue, her life's work translating texture into sound. The diamond's demand feels earned through her decades of precise sensory mapping. Internal contradiction operates through embodied perception—she traces bone grain, reads bird-flight grammar—and the final choice to speak the untranslatable word arises from established expertise. Minor slip: the backstory about six dead storytellers and Tvari's recent silence tilts toward exposition rather than present pressure, though it primes the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early: Maren at the bone tower's highest platform, canyon below, copper veins, dying language. The closure—speaking the word that makes the diamond's fracture sing and join the canyon's eternal chorus—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the language loses a speaker but gains permanence in echo, reweighting the stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds: pressure deepens through reflection on texture-to-sound translation, Old Tvari's silence, the diamond's hunger, then the single spoken word that crystallizes all prior material. One meaningful tightening occurs when she closes her fingers around the diamond and understands its need. Cost is legible: "one fewer speaker today than yesterday" and the word will outlive its speakers.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon of endless echoes constrain the central choice: Maren's word will live forever in this acoustic architecture, making the setting inseparable from the stakes. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—calcified leviathan remains, copper veins pulsing against the diamond's fracture, wind texture against skin—all filtered through her professional attention to grain and roughness. The canyon swifts drawing the glyph for "resonance" demonstrates micro-setting charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving sensory knowledge before the language dies—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure deepens under the Accumulative lens: Tvari stops speaking, the flawed diamond "demands," Maren traces the connection between internal fracture and scattered light. The tightening occurs when she recognizes what the diamond wants and speaks the untranslatable word, foreclosing the path of silence but capturing texture in permanent echo. Agency is decision with visible cost: she spends an irreplaceable word knowing "tomorrow it might have one fewer still." The cost is conceptual but undeniable—trading living speech for eternal recording.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: copper veins that hum in the old tongue, texture-words that transmit prickle and grain, light trapped inside flawed stone. The central question—what survives when direct transmission dies—receives a resonant, non-literal answer: the canyon remembers through echo, making darkness purposeful without healing the fracture. The diamond going clear-but-flawed while its flaw sings embodies the theme without stating it. No moralizing; the final image of pressing an ear to bone walls and feeling "the precise texture of broken light made whole by sound" reweights all prior material. Subtext operates in the copper veins' silence when she uses traders' pidgin, and in the bird-grammar she learned from her grandmother.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited throughout with distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices grain, roughness, the "granular roughness where clarity meets its own flaw." Diction matches her expertise—"quietly articulate," "tonal phrase," "murmuration a grammar"—without slipping into exposition. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close when tracing copper veins, pulling back slightly for the canyon's history, tightening again at the spoken word. The phrase "slowly, quietly articulate" in the climax exemplifies voice control under peak pressure. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Rhythmic control holds through reflection-heavy passages without flatness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "The copper carried stories through her blood, humming faintly when she spoke in the ancient syllables" conveys magic system, character state, and cultural erosion). Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Minor loop detected: "The old language had words for these things that the traders' tongue could never replicate. Words that were not metaphors but direct transmissions" restates without added pressure (−0.2). The climax beat—"spoke it slowly, quietly articulate, each syllable placed with the precision of a woman who had spent a lifetime mapping"—risks slight overwriting but remains voice-motivated. No simultaneity errors, clear propulsion throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of dying-language elegy with magical texture-to-sound translation feels specific and non-obvious. The flawed diamond that needs a word for its own brokenness transforms the cursed-object trope through sensory precision. Canyon-as-eternal-recording-device and bird-flight-as-grammar are fresh angles grounded in Maren's expertise. The resolution—making the flaw sing rather than healing it—offers conceptual originality. Transformation test passes: plot and arc would collapse if you swapped names and setting. Proximity check clear; no echo of famous lines. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and reflection-heavy design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's choice to speak the untranslatable word is the story's hinge; her decades translating texture enable the climax; her tracing of copper veins, reading of bird-grammar, and recognition of the diamond's hunger all drive beats. Present from opening, shapes middle understanding, and delivers closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The flawed diamond appears in opening ("opened her palm"), middle (she "closed her fingers around the diamond and felt its fracture line pulse"), and climax where it "trembled," "shifted," and "went clear." Its internal fracture is the problem Maren must voice, making it causally indispensable. Removing it breaks the story's logic entirely.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The canyon of endless echoes shapes the central stakes: Maren's word will live forever in this acoustic architecture, making her choice permanent. Present in opening description, returns when "the echoes caught her syllable and multiplied it," and the ending promises anyone pressing an ear to bone walls will feel the word. Causally drives the decision and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" appears as phrase in the climax ("slowly, quietly articulate, each syllable placed with the precision") and is embodied throughout in Maren's controlled, precise perception and speech. It constrains her method—careful placement over volume—and enables the diamond's response. Early demonstration in her tracing and reading; payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Harness" is the verb of the climax: "no storyteller before her had known how to harness a sound for the texture of shattered light." She harnesses the word by speaking it, the diamond harnesses and amplifies it outward. Present in setup (she "believed she finally understood"), executed in the ending. Swapping it would require structural rewrite; it defines her unique solution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Reading bird-flight patterns is signaled early ("learned years ago to read meaning through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight") and demonstrated when the swifts draw the glyph for "resonance," which primes her recognition. It's her grandmother's teaching made active. Present across beats but not mechanically essential to the spoken-word climax; more confirmatory than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon supply the story's central resource: eternal echo that will carry her word after all speakers die. The setting is the reason her choice has permanence. She sits at the tower's edge, the canyon amplifies her syllable, and the final image promises the walls will preserve texture. Causally indispensable; closure would fail without this exact architecture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The dying language frames urgency from the opening ("fewer than a dozen people still understood... Soon it would be fewer than eleven") and tightens at closure ("one fewer speaker today than yesterday, and tomorrow it might have one fewer still"). Old Tvari's recent silence and the language's death "in her throat" make the moment decisive. Time pressure shapes the choice to speak now.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Translating texture into sound is Maren's "life's work," demonstrated in her mapping of bone grain and wind roughness, tested by the diamond's fracture, and fulfilled when she speaks "the feeling of brightness interrupted." The motivation drives every beat and enables the climax. Friction is present: spending an irreplaceable word costs the living language even as it preserves sensation.</comment>
