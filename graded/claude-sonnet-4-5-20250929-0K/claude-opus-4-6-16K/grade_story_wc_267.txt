<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is concrete and embodied—nerve regeneration becomes a vehicle for changed perception ("the body remembers what it lost"). Her choice to remain is earned by prior causality: the letters and bloodstains shift her stance from disciplined worker to reluctant witness. The final renunciation (not breaking silence but carrying the letters) forecloses a simpler path with visible cost. Minor: the Choir remains functionally off-page; we see their effect but not their pressure as individuals.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through nerve-regeneration imagery, bloodstain discoveries, and letters, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Maren remains, refusing escape but accepting the weight of witness). Orientation anchors early (cobalt fortress, bellhop, eleven years). Cost is legible in the final image: "frostbitten hope" and the letters' weight reweight the opening's "seraphically mundane" tasks. One tightening: the fall fractures discipline, opening perception to hidden violence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The fortress is vivid and purposeful: cobalt walls, spiral staircase bloodstains, and locked piano bench all constrain discovery. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (nerve pain as "electricity," snow "endless and soft"). The staircase physically houses the evidence that shifts Maren's stance, and the final window image charges closure. Minor: the broader fortress layout remains abstract; we never see the dining hall where the choking occurred.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to leave or remain as witness. The fall is the inciting tightening—it breaks Maren's disciplined blindness and enables her to see bloodstains and find letters. Her final choice to remain (despite physician clearance) forecloses the easier path with visible cost: she accepts isolation and the burden of memory. The escalation is textural (nerve pain paralleling moral awakening) rather than causal confrontation, fitting the lens. Agency is clear: she searches, reads, and chooses endurance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—silence as violence, the cost of safety—emerges organically from bloodstains, letters, and the Choir's refusal to break vow during the choking incident. The final image ("silence…must answer for what it hides") is non-literal and reweights the opening's "holy" quiet without stating a moral. The piano bench and nerve regeneration motifs recur with shifted meaning at closure. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final beat; the letters' weight speaks through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices through a bellhop's eyes (linens, cutlery, "seraphically mundane"), then through a body relearning sensation ("crawling electricity," "burning"). POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains controlled under pressure: "unpardonable silence," "frostbitten hope" feel voice-motivated, not ornamental. Minor: one phrase—"silence could be its own violence"—edges toward thematic declaration rather than pure perception, though it stays character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and aural flow. High information density: most lines advance character, setting, or theme. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor figurative density in places ("bruise against the white sky," "silence with teeth," "last ember in a dead fire") but each vehicle is coherent and the cluster does not obscure causality. One near-stock phrase: "old blood" after "rust-brown stain that was not rust at all" slightly telegraphs the reveal.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—silent monastic retreat + workplace horror told through nerve regeneration—is non-obvious and specific. The fall/nerve-pain parallel to moral awakening avoids template plotting. Risk: the piece commits fully to its premise (no dialogue, no confrontation) and trusts accumulative pressure. Minor: the letters as hidden testimony and the choking anecdote echo familiar whistleblower/institutional-silence templates; transformation occurs through the nerve-body metaphor and the specific cobalt-fortress texture, but the core moral calculus (speak vs. remain silent) is well-trodden.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (silent-choir bellhop) drives two key beats: the fall that breaks her discipline and the choice to remain. Setup immediate (paragraph one). Her search and final stance constitute agency with visible cost. The letters and bloodstains exist because she looks; her decision forecloses escape. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Piano bench bolt appears in one extended beat (kneeling, examining, finding letters, replacing bolt). Setup mid-story (~40%). It enables discovery of the letters but does not return or constrain later choice; the letters themselves carry forward, not the bolt. Functional but single-use; no reprise or charged meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Unpardonable silence" frames the premise (paragraph one: "silence…could not be forgiven") and the ending ("silence…must answer for what it hides"). It shapes Maren's stake: whether the vow is sacred or complicit. The choking letter and bloodstains dramatize the concept's cost. Present across setup, middle pressure, and closure; integral to theme and final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Seraphically mundane" describes Maren's pre-fall relation to work (folding towels, arranging cutlery). Setup early (paragraph three). It establishes her prior stance but does not constrain a later choice; the fall breaks it. The ending references it faintly ("mundane holiness…still sustained her…like the last ember") but the trait itself is replaced rather than leveraged. Purposeful but not causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Remain" is the story's decisive action, signaled late but earned by all prior beats. Setup: physician clearance to leave. Development: letters describe others who left or died. Payoff: Maren chooses to remain "because someone had to be the memory." This choice forecloses escape, defines the ending's cost, and would break the story's logic if swapped. Indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase" is the method of discovery. Setup: the fall itself. Development: Maren notices one stain, then another, then searches further. The method shapes her investigation and is specific (not generic "she found clues"). It does not return at closure but enables the letters' discovery. Essential to one major beat; contributes to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cobalt fortress under snow: present in opening and closing images. The staircase supplies the bloodstains; the chapel houses the piano bench; the snow isolates and the fortress's silence enforces the vow. The setting constrains movement (spiral staircase, narrow window) and charges the final image ("snow falling over the cobalt walls"). Strong setup, middle use, and closure presence; irreplaceable texture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"During nerve regeneration" frames the story's present timeframe and parallels Maren's moral awakening ("the body remembers what it lost"). Setup early (paragraph four). The nerve pain recurs ("left side burning," "tingling") and shapes perception. It does not tighten a decision clock but provides thematic texture and embodied stakes. Present across beats; contributes to closure metaphor but does not force tempo.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To understand the cost of safety" is dramatized through the letters (workers who couldn't cry for help) and Maren's realization that the Choir's sacred quiet "swallowed screams." Setup implicit in the vow; middle beat makes it explicit ("the cost of safety…had cost them their capacity for mercy"). Payoff: her choice to remain as witness accepts this understanding. Strong friction between the Choir's ideal and the letters' reality.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" appears only in the final paragraph but crystallizes the entire tonal arc: cold/isolation (frostbitten) + fragile persistence (hope). The tone is coherent throughout—quiet dread, embodied pain, determined witness—and the phrase charges the closure image without stating a moral. Strong lyric reprise; the phrase reweights prior material and makes the ending's emotional cost undeniable.</comment>
