<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot's interior life is vivid and particular—"gripped reality loosely now, the way you hold a bird you're deciding whether to release" demonstrates embodied contradiction. The stroke preview motivates her quest without mechanical psychology, and her use of the parasol as talisman grounds abstraction in gesture. Minor slip: the "fold in patience" metaphor occasionally tips toward label-speak ("folded her patience into a neat square") though it recovers through concrete action. The final choice to continue working rather than pursuing the sound is earned by prior causality and forecloses the immediate path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (drift-ice marina, Svalbard, relief work). The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Margot's listening for the sound accumulates through ice-shelf calving, crate-shattering silence, then the climactic wind-carried hum that reweights her relationship to ending. Closure arrives via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she recognizes the melody, turns from the edge, and returns to work—a crystallized stance that forecloses suicide today with undeniable cost (she remains mortal, still dying, but chooses remainder). One persistent constraint (terminal diagnosis) shapes all tactics. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina supplies concrete sensory particulars—pontoons rising between grey-white slabs, the groan of living/tired ice—that pressure Margot's search. The parasol tip becomes micro-setting: she taps ice stability, tests the dock, and its brass forget-me-nots anchor the talisman function. Sensory hierarchy reflects her quest (she listens more than she sees). The final tap—"once, twice"—charges the closure image by making the tool's testing function into a gesture of commitment. Minor gap: occupational detail (cargo sorting, tenders) remains generic, but it does not harm the central conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning the sound of ending to delay or understand death) is signaled early and coheres throughout. Accumulative pressure: stroke preview → Zurich postponement → disaster relief → weeks of near-misses → the marina-edge moment when the hum arrives. That final beat tightens: she must choose between the sound (death now) and work (remainder). Her turn from the edge forecloses immediate release with felt cost—she remains terminal, but the choice is hers and visible. One meaningful deepening (the sound's arrival) narrows options under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the hum as vowel, patience folding/unfolding, the parasol's brass tip testing stability. The ending offers a non-literal answer—knowing the melody does not mean singing it today—without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution: Margot's disease remains, solace carries "weight" not "weightlessness," and the small percussion of the parasol grounds metaphysical questions in physical gesture. Minor risk: "fold in patience" occasionally edges toward abstraction, but the final image reweights it through action (folding cargo, tapping the dock) with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close; psychic distance tightens during the eleven-second preview and the marina-edge beat. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "Latin-adjacent," "trawl through their aftermath," "small percussion into the remainder of her life." Perceptual signature is selective—she listens for resonance, tests ice with brass, notices men and women with "expressions she recognized from her own bathroom mirror." No head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("She had chosen Zurich. She had chosen the date.") accelerates without obscuring. Under peak stress (the sound arrives), syntax tightens appropriately and internal texture remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentences breathe ("She closed her eyes. She did not feel afraid.") and accelerate ("She signed up… they sent her north."). Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (the stroke "unfolded" her patience, the hum "threaded through" the wind). Minor loop: "fold" recurs across folding patience, unfolding stroke, fold-in-patience metaphor—three mentions risk synonym churn, though each carries distinct function. No filter-verb stacks, no paraphrase loops. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line ("small percussion into the remainder of her life") charges the parasol motif. Figurative language (silt, bird, vowel) is coherent and apt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The euthanasia-tourist frame is recognizable, but the piece transforms it through the stroke preview (the sound, not silence) and the specific quest (learning the frequency, not choosing death immediately). The parasol-as-talisman and Arctic disaster-relief combination feel non-obvious. The "fold in patience" concept risks abstraction but earns specificity through repeated physical gestures (folding cargo, testing ice). Emotional truth (solace with weight, not weightlessness) avoids generic templates. Minor hedge: the resolution (turn from edge, return to work) reads earned but not startling—an authentic choice rather than a bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Euthanasia tourist: introduced early (Zurich clinic, terminal diagnosis, chosen date), drives the inciting decision (postponement after stroke), and shapes the marina-edge closure beat (she turns from the sound/death). Two distinct beats: postponement and final turn. Causal pressure narrows options (she could end it, chooses remainder). Closure linkage strong. Cost visible (remains terminal, foregoing immediate release).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Heirloom lace parasol tip: introduced early, used across multiple beats (testing ice, tapping dock, carried as talisman), and charged at closure ("tapped the brass tip against the dock—once, twice—and followed its small percussion"). The brass forget-me-nots add specificity. Three distinct beats. Causal role (tests stability, grounds her quest physically). Closure linkage strong. High irreplaceability (the engraved pattern and Arctic absurdity make it particular).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fold in patience: introduced early ("folded her patience into a neat square"), recurs mid-story ("a patience that doubled back on itself"), and returns at closure ("patience to fold and fold again"). Setup and payoff present; middle use shapes her listening posture. Cost connection (she must endure terminal diagnosis with unhurried readiness). Moderate causal pressure—it frames her stance more than it narrows tactical options. Some ornamental risk (metaphor leans abstract), but the physical folding (cargo, patience) ties it to action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Grips reality loosely: introduced immediately post-stroke ("Colors seemed provisional… she gripped reality loosely now, the way you hold a bird"), enables the quest (she can entertain the hum without panic), and underpins the closure turn (loose grip allows her to choose remainder without denial). Two beats. Causal role (looseness permits the listening). Closure linkage moderate (implicit in her calm turn from the edge). Cost visible (she remains untethered, dying). Specificity strong (bird image).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Trawl: signaled early ("she could trawl through their aftermath for that particular note"), shapes the middle段 (weeks of listening through collapses and silences), and pays off when the sound arrives. Two distinct beats. Causal pressure (the method structures her search). Closure linkage strong (the trawl succeeds; she hears it). Moderate irreplaceability (another search metaphor could substitute, though "trawl" fits the marina setting). Cost connection (weeks of labor, proximity to others' endings).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering: introduced early (Norwegian NGO, sent north), structures the middle段 (sorting provisions, tagging cargo, riding tenders), and provides the setting where the sound arrives. Two beats. Causal role (places her among "endings" and at the marina edge). Closure linkage moderate (she returns to the supply tent). Specificity adequate (cargo, tenders, shattered docks). Swappability risk (another solitary northern job might serve), but the relief context (witnessing others' losses) mirrors her own.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina: introduced immediately (opening line), supplies concrete constraints (pontoons, ice shelves, supply boats), and is the site of closure (marina's edge, dock, supply tent). Three beats. Causal pressure (ice to test, edge to approach). Closure linkage strong (the dock tap, the turn toward the tent). High irreplaceability (the ice's groan, the shelf collapses, the black water are integral to the sound-quest). Specificity strong (grey-white slabs, frozen planking).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>After waking up changed: setup immediate (stroke in Zurich, eleven seconds, world shifted), structures the middle (four months of postponement, weeks at marina), and underpins closure (she still wakes changed, now choosing to continue). Two beats. Moderate causal pressure (the change enables the quest but does not tighten decisions in real time). Closure linkage moderate (implicit in her ongoing alteration). Cost visible (she remains changed, unmoored). Some ornamental risk (the stroke is backstory more than live clock).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>To learn the sound of approaching endings: introduced early (post-stroke desire "to hear it again… to recognize the frequency"), drives middle段 (listening through collapses, crate-shattering), and is satisfied/reweighted at closure (she hears it, chooses not to sing it today). Three beats. High causal pressure (desire structures all tactics). Closure linkage strong (the sound arrives; she turns away). Cost visible (she forgoes immediate release, accepts remainder). Friction between wants (hearing) and costs (dying without control) is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Windborne solace: tone is coherent—melancholy yet unsentimental, with "solace" that has "weight" not "weightlessness." The wind motif recurs (wind through rigging in the stroke, wind across the ice field carrying the hum). Tone modulates appropriately (accelerates during stroke preview, breathes at closure). The final image ("small percussion into the remainder of her life") charges the solace with quiet gravity. Moderate irreplaceability (another elegiac tone could serve, though "windborne" ties to the Arctic setting and the hum's delivery).</comment>
