<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's psychometric ability grounds her interior life in specific, embodied sensation—the vials hum with storm memory, the compass reading opens like a door swinging wide. The surveyor's calloused hand and eroding confidence are concrete and contradictory, earning the final gesture of sitting without needing to understand. Minor slip: "a hunger she could not name" leans slightly toward stock phrasing, but the final renunciation (leaving the compass, sealing the vial, breathing without understanding) forecloses explanation-seeking with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren finds "the place where explanations fail" and renounces further extraction, sealing the vial with only a dash in the label field. Cost is conceptual and visible—she abandons her collecting rationale and sits in un-knowledge. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by ~25% (geosmin science → storm sensations → lagoon's patient gathering → the dash), holds it through the surveyor's compass reading, and pays off at closure when she places the compass back and does not need to understand. One meaningful deepening (the reading that opens onto older water-presence) tightens the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lagoon's "black, still, impossibly clear" water and vaulted ceiling anchor setting early. Calcium deposits half-bury the compass, the carbide light flickers in the surveyor's memory, and the cave's acoustic quality—"listening and choosing what to echo"—charges the final hush. The narrow entrance, descending passage, and moisture-dense air constrain Maren's delve and make the find plausible. The dash in the label space is a micro-setting beat: the absence of soil type reweights her collecting taxonomy at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Maren seeks "the place where explanations fail." The compass reading provides one meaningful deepening—his confidence erodes, north becomes hypothesis, then older water-presence emerges beneath. The final act (sealing the vial with a dash, replacing the compass, sitting without understanding) is driven by her prior discovery and forecloses the explanatory path with visible cost. The story delivers one tightening under the Accumulative lens; no multiple reversals are required or present, but the single deepening narrows options and reweights the collecting premise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: geosmin science is framing device, psychometry is method, but the lagoon's patient rain-gathering and the surveyor's loss of north converge on the question "where do explanations fail?" The dash in the label field and the returned compass offer a non-literal answer—renunciation of taxonomy charges the closure without stating a moral. The vial "that would hum differently from all the rest" reweights prior collecting without thematic echo. No late symbols or sermonizing; the awakening that "does not close again" stays concrete and earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices geosmin aerosol mechanics, calloused surveyor hands, calcium deposits. Narrative certainty matches her psychometric access—she feels the surveyor's confidence erode, not his thoughts verbatim. Diction remains controlled under pressure: "the rock swallowed every certainty" is compressed but voice-consistent. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "a hunger she could not name" is slightly generic, but surrounding specificity (cedar case, wax seals, precise labels) anchors voice. Rhythmic control tightens in the reading beat, then opens in the final breath.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>High information density: the opening paragraph establishes collector identity, scientific rationale, psychometric secret, and thematic search in ~150 words. Rhythm varies purposefully—long catalog sentence ("the date, the soil type, the duration…") contracts to terse action ("She knelt. She closed her eyes."). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor density slip: "She had come to delve" is slightly ornamental summary after the cave entrance is already shown. Figurative language is sparse and concrete: "doors in things," "the rock swallowed every certainty," "a small cathedral of the nearest stone." Propulsion is strong through the descent and reading; the final paragraph breathes without dragging.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise (psychometric petrichor collector) synthesizes two specific niches—geosmin science and object-reading—into a non-obvious search for epistemic limits. The factory closure opens the caves, and the lost-expedition compass grounds the historical layer without relying on trope convenience. Transformation test passes: swapping Maren for a generic treasure-hunter would break the thematic question and the vial taxonomy. Risk: the piece commits fully to quiet accumulation and renunciation without spectacle. Minor proximity check: "awakenings do not close again" and "doors swinging open" echo common motifs, but their integration with the hinge metaphor and the dash-label payoff feels earned rather than borrowed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (petrichor collector) is signaled in the opening line, drives the delve (middle beat), and makes the closure choice: sealing the 48th vial with a dash, replacing the compass, sitting without understanding. Her collecting frames expectation, the psychometric reading narrows options (she finds what she seeks), and the final renunciation of taxonomy forecloses explanation-seeking with visible cost. Present across all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Swappability test: removing "petrichor collector" would break the vial taxonomy and the thematic search for where rain-scent meets epistemic limit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The compass is found mid-story (lagoon edge, half-buried in calcium), handled in the psychometric reading beat (calloused surveyor hand, wandering needle, lost certainty), and returned with reweighted meaning at closure (she places it back "where the calcium had held it for ninety years"). Three-beat involvement: discovery, reading, and charged return. Causal role: the compass provides the surveyor's memory and thus the deeper water-presence; its return signals her renunciation. Specificity: Brunton transit and 1931 Aldworth Expedition ground it. Late first appearance (~mid-story) is the only friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Hinged awakenings" appears explicitly in the psychometric reading ("like a door swinging open on a hinge") and again at closure ("Some awakenings do not close again. They swing wide on their hinges and stay"). The hinge metaphor charges both beats and connects the reading to the final renunciation. It shapes the dominant stake obliquely—Maren seeks openings that stay open—but does not constrain a discrete middle choice. Two-gate presence (middle metaphor, closure reprise) with thematic linkage and lyric resonance; cost is conceptual (she renounces closure of understanding).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Sensibly eccentric" is established in the opening paragraph (others find her collecting "sensibly eccentric rather than outright strange" because she explains the science calmly). It frames her public rationale but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. The trait explains social acceptance and sets up the contrast between scientific explanation and psychometric secret, but remains ornamental—her actions (delving, reading, renouncing taxonomy) would proceed identically without the label. Setup-only, no middle or closure action tied to eccentricity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Delve" anchors the piece: "She had come to delve" precedes the cave entrance, the hour-long descent opens into the lagoon discovery, and the psychometric reading is the culminative delve into memory and water-presence. Maren's physical descent enables the compass find, and her psychic delve provides the surveyor's lost-north moment and the water's patient gathering. The final image (sitting in "resonant hush") completes the delve by renouncing further extraction. Three-beat causal chain: entry, descent to lagoon, depth-reading to closure. Irreplaceable: "explore" or "investigate" would not carry the earth-pressure and depth connotations.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Psychometry is named and explained in the opening ("the reading of objects through touch… each vial hummed with the memory of the storm"), demonstrated in the compass reading (she wraps both hands, the reading comes "like a door swinging open"), and implicitly present in the final vial-sealing (she lets cave air settle into glass, expecting it will hum). The method shapes two beats (vial memory, compass reading) and primes closure (the 48th vial "would hum differently from all the rest"). Setup in first paragraph, key middle use, closure participation. Minor friction: the mechanics are asserted rather than tested under resistance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon (beneath limestone cliffs, behind the shut-down factory fence) anchors the entire second half. The "black, still, impossibly clear" water and vaulted ceiling provide the discovery site for the compass; the lagoon's mineral breath and moisture settle into the final vial; the "resonant hush" charges the closure image. The cave's acoustic quality ("listening and choosing what to echo") and the calcium deposits (half-burying the compass for ninety years) constrain discovery and charge Maren's final choice to leave the compass and sit. Setting drives middle discovery and closure atmosphere with high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the factory shuts down" opens narrative access (fences cut, pumps silent, rain returns to poisoned ground) and signals urgency ("the first night after the closure"). The timeframe enables the delve and grounds the lagoon's return to natural state, but does not tighten a discrete middle choice or create a live clock. Setup-only with modest causal pressure; the story would function similarly if the factory closure were months earlier. The temporal anchor is functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To find the place where explanations fail" is stated early ("She was searching, always, for the place where explanations fail") and dramatized at closure when she writes only a dash in the soil-type field and sits "and did not need to understand." The dominant stake is clear and tested: the psychometric reading delivers the moment "when north became a hypothesis," and she renounces taxonomy in response. Two-beat involvement (opening desire, closure renunciation) with visible cost (she forecloses her collecting rationale). Minor friction: the desire is told more than shown in contradictory micro-choices before the lagoon.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" governs tone from the cave entrance ("cool, wet, ancient") through the lagoon ("dense with moisture and silence… every small sound… returned softened") to the closure image ("the resonant hush of the subterranean lagoon"). The tone modulates under pressure: urgency at the descent, electric stillness during the reading, then breathing calm at the end. The final line ("breathed, and did not need to understand") charges the hush with the cost of renunciation. Coherent through turns, present across all three gates, and the closure image depends on it.</comment>
