<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is concrete and embodied—thermal sensors mapping remembered music creates a specific perceptual signature. The motivation to compose after hyperacusis is clear and shapes her method choices. Internal conflict between what she was (composer) and what she must become operates consistently through the piece. The final moment earns a quiet acceptance with visible cost (flinching, then receiving the wind), though the arc leans more toward Earned Stasis than transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through weeks of mapping, pattern deepens from remembered sail phrase to mother's laugh to the capsizing drone, and the final wind gust reweights silence as fullness rather than void. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid)—she no longer needs to map the note, signaling integration with visible cost (the flinch, the brace for pain). Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The "three months ago" capsizing and "following weeks" compress time without confusion, and the residency frame holds pressure toward the sealed score and departure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The conservatory's dampening glass functions as both constraint (necessary silence) and charged setting (light moving across manuscripts like Braille). The tuning fork case, thermal sensors, and laptop form a micro-setting that shapes every mapping choice. Spatial choreography is clean: threshold, long table, conservatory doors. The winterglass itself returns in the final beat when wind—previously a threat—becomes a downbeat her body receives, charging the exit image with the conservatory's silence/sound paradox.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence into music) is signaled early and drives the middle mapping sequence. Escalation under the Accumulative lens deepens through grief chord, mother's melody, capsizing drone—each map adds density and specificity. The final beat tightens: carrying the sealed score out, she receives wind as music without needing sensors, a meaningful shift that forecloses the purely external method. The cost is legible (flinching, bracing) and the reversal—warmth instead of pain—earns the closure without solving hyperacusis itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (silence as medium, not void; survival's translations) emerges organically from the mapping method and conservatory frame. The phrase "unshaken marvels" and "truths that survived the wreck intact" land without moralizing, rooted in the concrete acts of sensor-pressing and transcription. The final image offers a non-literal answer: she already knows the note without technology, reweighting all prior effort as preparation rather than prosthetic. Subtext operates in the sail/capsizing memory, the embarrassment/beauty of the mother's laugh, and the strange sustained drone of near-death—each particular, each charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with a measured, slightly elevated register that suits Maren's composer background without drifting into abstraction. Perceptual signature is distinct: tuning fork metaphors, musical vocabulary (phrase, notation, downbeat), sensory detail filtered through sonic loss. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at closure (the flinch, the known note). No head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure—longer sentences during mapping weeks, shorter at the wind moment. Dialogue is absent; not needed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high across mapping beats. Minor loop: "silently expressive" and "silence was not empty" restate the core idea across paragraphs without adding pressure, though the second instance does charge the image with "unshaken marvels." The phrase "the bones were right. The bones were honest" reads as intentional emphasis rather than artifact. Figurative language (frosted panes like ribs, light like Braille fingers) is vivid and coherent. One slight register note: "rectify the intervals" in the mapping beat might read technical for urgency, but it suits her composer lens. Propulsion is clean; no major scaffolding or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise (thermal mapping of remembered music post-hyperacusis) synthesizes medical constraint with synesthetic method in a fresh configuration. The conservatory designed to study silence as medium (not void) avoids the generic recovery-art frame. Risk: the piece commits fully to the sensory inversion without explaining or softening. The tuning fork case repurposed for sensors is a specific, charged detail. One proximity concern: silence-into-music after sensory loss has prior art, but the thermal-sensor method and the "unshaken marvels" frame add enough specificity to avoid derivativeness. The final beat (knowing the note without mapping) feels earned rather than convenient.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Capsize survivor is established early (three months ago, dragged under hull, hyperacusis result) and shapes the entire premise—without the accident, no silence need, no mapping method. Middle beats map the capsizing itself ("strange sustained note, almost a drone"), turning survival into material. The sealed score on the last day completes the arc from wreck to translation. The survivor status drives the goal and constrains tactics (noise intolerance forces thermal method). Two gates solid (setup, middle); closure participation is implicit (the score exists because of survival) but not causally active in the final wind beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tuning fork case appears in three beats: arrival (salt-stained, no longer holds fork but sensors), mapping work (leather case as anchor), and departure (sealed score inside it). The object's transformation—from instrument holder to sensor holder to score container—tracks the protagonist's arc from composer to mapper to translator. The case is specific (cracked, salt-stained from capsizing) and irreplaceable (links accident to method to product). Closure linkage is present (she carries it out), though it does not charge the final wind image directly. Solid integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Unshaken marvels appears once, late (penultimate paragraph: "full of unshaken marvels—truths that had survived the wreck intact"). It articulates the thematic claim but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. The concept resonates with the mapping work (finding structure in thermal patterns, grief as chord not tone, capsizing as sustained note), but those particulars would function without the explicit phrase. Lyric reprise: the phrase charges the conservatory's silence retrospectively, reweighting it as fullness. Setup is absent; middle and closure participation are thematic rather than causal. Scoring ~5.8 for resonance without beat-level work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Silently expressive is the engine: "her body still responded to the memory of music even when actual sound was forbidden" (setup). Middle beats show it constraining method (cello suite warms throat, timpani roll blooms sternum; grief is chord, mother's laugh is melody). Closure: she receives wind as warmth without needing to map it, silently expressive having become integrated rather than compensatory. The attribute enables the thermal sensor method, drives the mapping sequence, and is reweighted at closure (body knowledge supersedes technology). Visible cost: years of composition lost, hyperacusis permanent. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rectify appears once in the mapping beat: "She would need to rectify the intervals, adjust where memory had blurred the edges." It describes a necessary step (correcting thermal data into accurate notation) but does not drive a turn or create friction. The action is task-level rather than stake-level—she could "refine," "correct," or "calibrate" with similar effect. Setup and middle participation are present (she does the work); closure does not hinge on it (the final wind moment bypasses notation entirely). Functional but replaceable, scoring mid-band for one-beat causal role without escalation or closure link.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is signaled early ("method she had devised during recovery"), anchors the middle sequence (sensors on collarbone/wrists/mastoid, thermal contours into notation), and is present at closure in its absence (she no longer needs to map, she already knows). The method enables every mapping beat (sail phrase, grief chord, mother's laugh, capsizing drone) and is reweighted at the end (body knowledge supersedes prosthetic). Mechanics matter: thermal sensors, laptop color spread, temperature-to-pitch assignment. Irreplaceable: remove it and the entire arc collapses. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory is established immediately (built to house sound, now holds none; dampening film swallows vibration) and frames the entire piece. It enables the work (Lindholm Foundation residency, perfect silence required for hyperacusis), supplies the long table and glass walls that catch spectrum light ("like Braille"), and anchors the departure beat (conservatory doors, wind touching her face). The setting constrains choice (she must work there to avoid noise pain) and charges the final image (leaving the silence-space to receive wind as music). Setup, middle pressure, and closure participation all solid. Essential to premise and arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>After noise becomes impossible is the condition that generates the entire plot—hyperacusis forces silence, silence requires new method. It is established early ("After noise becomes impossible, they told her, you must learn to live in its absence") and underlies every beat (why conservatory, why sensors, why mapping). The timeframe does not tighten tactics within the piece (no live clock during the mapping weeks) but forecloses the old path (composition via sound) with permanent cost. Closure does not pivot on time pressure. Scoring for strong setup and sustained constraint without escalation or clock mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>To translate silence into music is the application premise ("her proposal was unlike anything they had seen"), drives the sensor method and mapping weeks, and is tested at closure when she receives wind as a known note without translation technology. Desire is dramatized through concrete acts (pressing sensors, transcribing thermal maps, sealing the score) and conflicted (embarrassment vs. beauty of mother's melody, chaos expectation vs. sustained capsizing drone). The final beat reweights the goal: translation was preparation, integration is the true endpoint. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost (years of lost composition, hyperacusis permanent).</comment>
