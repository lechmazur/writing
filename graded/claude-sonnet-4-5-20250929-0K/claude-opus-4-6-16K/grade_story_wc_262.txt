<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's spatial-imaginative gift is embodied through her psychometry practice, not just declared. Her final choice—to withhold the truth about Luce—arises from the reading and carries visible cost (executor's goal vs. preservation of Eldon's stored devotion). Eldon's characterization via backstory is rich but relies heavily on reflection; the forty-seven letters and his devotion are told rather than dramatized in present action. Internal contradiction is minimal; Maren's stance crystallizes but without competing impulses acting simultaneously on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words (Maren, projection booth, estate hire). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren decides not to deliver Luce's identity, forecloses the executor's search with visible cost (withheld truth), and the final image reweights Eldon's love as "meant to stay exactly where it was stored." One meaningful deepening occurs when Maren realizes the letters were never for Luce but a transfer into objects. However, the cost is conceptual and relational rather than felt with bodily urgency; the ending reweights but does not tighten options under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly rendered: acetate scent, carbon-arc projectors, rewinding table, blue projection light. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Maren notices "celluloid slowly remembering its own flammability"). The film strip and booth constrain Maren's reading and charge the final image when she "set[s] the strip down gently, as though placing a child in a crib." Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting functions as micro-setting that enables the psychometry and holds Eldon's stored love, directly shaping the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding where unused love is stored, signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maren realizes the letters were self-transfer, not messages to Luce, and then discovers Luce had been looking at Eldon. The final choice—withholding the truth—narrows options (executor's search ends) and forecloses delivery with conceptual cost. However, pressure is atmospheric and accumulative rather than escalating through protagonist agency under duress. The turn ("She had been looking at him") reweights prior material but arrives via perception, not a choice that narrows tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: love that cannot be expressed seeks physical repositories, incubating in objects and spaces. The final image—projectors "holding everything Eldon Sharpe had ever meant to say"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Maren's decision to leave the love stored rather than delivered integrates her gift with the thematic question. "Hushed thunder" recurs purposefully, shifting from Eldon's silence to the booth's charge. Minor slip: "Some love was meant to stay exactly where it was stored" edges toward explicit statement, though it's filtered through Maren's professional judgment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight during the reading, wider for framing). Perceptual signature is distinct: spatial-imaginative, attuned to emotional architecture. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("hushed thunder, that was the only name for it"). Free indirect style is clean. However, two slips: "forty-seven goodbye letters he never sent" is told exposition rather than discovered on the page, and "the sound of a storm that never breaks" verges on purple without grounding in Maren's professional lexicon. No dialogue present to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the psychometry sequence. Figurative language is purposeful ("white lake," "iron bones," "dense as scripture") but clusters heavily in the middle third, risking overwriting. Minor paraphrase loop: "She wanted to find where unused love is stored" echoes "where unused love is stored" from the prior paragraph. The final image ("holding everything Eldon Sharpe had ever meant to say") is strong but "incubating it in iron and dust and celluloid until someone else might climb those stairs" extends one beat past closure. No major line-level artifacts; grammar and sequencing are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry, projection-booth setting, and the stored-love premise feels specific and non-obvious. The turn—Luce looking at Eldon—is earned in hindsight by the film strip's presence. Maren's professional frame (crystal gazer/psychometrist) avoids carnival cliché through specificity. However, the unrequited-love-in-a-movie-theater premise echoes familiar romantic melancholy; transformation arises from the psychometry angle and the choice to leave love undelivered. Risk-taking is moderate: the reflective mode and quiet ending are executed well but do not push structural boundaries.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (crystal gazer) is present throughout, frames the opening, performs the psychometry reading (middle beat), and makes the closure choice to withhold Luce's identity. Her decision alters tactics (executor's search ends) and forecloses delivery with visible cost. Early signal, middle involvement, closure linkage, and causal pressure all present. High irreplaceability: remove her psychometry gift and the story's mechanism collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The film strip appears early (on the rewinding table), is handled during the psychometry reading (middle beat: "held the film strip between her fingers," "lifted the film strip to the bare bulb"), and is reweighted at closure ("set the strip down gently, as though placing a child in a crib"). It carries the image of Luce looking at Eldon, which transforms Maren's understanding. Three beats, causal pressure (enables the reading), closure linkage, high specificity (eight frames, cut from uncatalogued reel).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The goodbye letters are present early (forty-seven letters, estate context) and shape the hire/stake (find Luce). They reappear in the psychometry vision (Eldon writing "year after year") and inform Maren's realization that they were self-transfer, not messages. They do not constrain a middle choice but do participate in closure reasoning (Maren decides "some things were not meant to be delivered"). Two gates (setup, closure reasoning); moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is established early ("capable of sensing the architecture of feeling the way others sense the dimensions of a room") and enables the psychometry reading (she perceives "where grief had pooled," "where joy had once pressed"). It constrains on-page action: her ability to read residue drives the entire projection-booth sequence. However, it does not impose a visible tradeoff or cost; the trait is competence without friction. Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, but cost connection is weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Incubate" appears in the premise ("where unused love is stored… incubate in the walls") and recurs in the psychometry vision ("pouring himself into objects") and the final image ("incubating it in iron and dust and celluloid"). It shapes the thematic understanding and charges the closure, but it does not drive a plot turn or constrain a middle choice. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting qualifies for mid-band. Two gates (setup, closure image); strong thematic role, weak causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is signaled early ("the real kind… Touch a thing, and the thing touches back"), performed on-page in the middle beat ("held the film strip… closed her eyes… low vibration in her palms, then a cascading series of images"), and delivers the key discovery (Luce looking at Eldon). The method's mechanics matter: touch → vibration → images → realization. Three beats, high causal pressure (enables all middle action), closure participation (realization shapes final choice), high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The projection booth is established early (narrow staircase, acetate scent, carbon-arc projectors, rewinding table) and functions as micro-setting throughout. It constrains the psychometry (Maren must be present, handle the film strip) and charges the final image ("the projectors stood in their silence, holding everything"). Sensory details (blue projection light, warm dust) are integrated into action. Three beats, causal pressure (location enables reading), closure linkage (Maren leaves, booth remains charged), high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe phrase ("forgotten lyrics search for their tune across decades of silence") appears once, mid-story, as lyric metaphor. It does not impose a ticking clock or tighten decisions. The story spans one visit to the booth; elapsed time is not tracked or used to create urgency. Setup is weak (metaphor only), no middle development, no closure participation. Ornamental use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation ("to find where unused love is stored") is stated early, dramatized through the psychometry reading (she seeks and discovers love in the booth's walls and film), and resolved at closure (she finds it and chooses to leave it there). The desire drives all middle action and shapes the final choice. However, friction between want and cost is conceptual rather than visceral; Maren faces no competing impulse or tradeoff on the page. Three gates, high causal pressure, closure linkage, moderate cost visibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" is introduced early ("the great thunderous silence… Hushed thunder, that was the only name for it. The sound of a storm that never breaks"), recurs in the final paragraph ("the hushed thunder of a love that never found its words"), and charges the ending image. Tone is coherent: quiet intensity, atmospheric pressure, restrained emotion throughout. The phrase reweights prior material and supports the Earned Stasis closure. Lyric reprise with strong closure linkage; moderate causal pressure (tone supports but does not constrain choice).</comment>
