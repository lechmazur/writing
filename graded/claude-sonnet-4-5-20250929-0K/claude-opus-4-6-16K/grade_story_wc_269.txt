<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is specific and embodied through the tapping habit, which reflects both character-particular coping and professional method. Her arc from witness-stance to active documentation feels earned by the subsidence discovery. The reflection on coral bleaching and witness inadequacy creates genuine internal contradiction. Minor deduction: the mentor's aphorism ("Something erases them") reads slightly generic, and the final typing moment, while rhythmically consistent, edges toward symbolic convenience rather than a hard choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): Lena stops the tapping, grasps the permanence of the voids, then resumes typing to document the truth—a renunciation of passive witness with clear conceptual cost (the inadequacy of the ban, the irreversibility of collapse). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the tapping rhythm, subsidence data, atlas imagery, and coral memory accumulate density until the final typing beat reweights all prior material. Cost is felt in "so that someone, somewhere, might finally hear what the silence had been saying"—the acknowledgment that her witness may still be insufficient. Orientation is clear by the second paragraph (Station 7, eleven months, sea-level monitoring). One micro turn when she stops tapping and the silence feels "enormous" sets up the final resumption. The lens holds cleanly through closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Station 7, the gray Atlantic window, and the console are integrated through the tapping practice, which uses surfaces as thinking tools. The torn atlas page constrains her conceptual frame and charges the final image when she holds it to light, making vanished atolls "luminous and almost visible." Spatial choreography is clear (desk, wall, windowsill, window). Minor deduction: the station itself remains somewhat generic; we lack specificity about tools, data screens, or occupational routines that would ground the monitoring work beyond "numbers crawl across screens." The setting does not directly constrain a middle choice, though the isolation supports the reflective mode.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: discover why coastlines sink faster than models predict. The revelation—subsidence from fossil-fuel extraction voids—arrives as meaningful deepening that reweights the ban's inadequacy. One clear tightening: assembling subsidence data and cross-referencing extraction records narrows her understanding and forecloses the simpler thermal-expansion explanation. Cost is conceptual and felt: the voids "would go on collapsing for decades, maybe centuries," and the tourniquet metaphor conveys irreversibility. Agency is present in the decision to type what she found, moving from passive witness to documentation. Minor deduction: the stakes remain largely intellectual; no on-page pressure from external actors or immediate consequences tests her commitment, and the final typing moment, while thematically resonant, lacks a visible tradeoff or renunciation that would elevate it into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the subsidence revelation, the atlas page, and the witness inadequacy: naming a loss does not preserve it; action taken after irreversible harm is necessary but insufficient. The final image—ghost islands "luminous and almost visible, the way all disappeared things persist just beneath the surface of what we allow ourselves to see"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The atlas's dotted lines shift meaning from paths across water to "threads holding the islands to each other, to meaning, to existence," a quiet but powerful reweighting. The tapping motif earns its recurrence by constraining her thought process and charging the closure when she resumes typing. Minor deduction: "what the silence had been saying all along" in the final sentence edges toward overt thematic statement, slightly diluting the image's resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization; perceptual signature is clear in the tapping rhythm, the way she reads the atlas lines, and the sonar-assembly metaphor for thought. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with purposeful compression in phrases like "periodically eternal" and "hollow places where fuel had once been." The prose reflects Lena's scientific mind without clinical distance. Minor deduction: the phrase "the way all disappeared things persist just beneath the surface of what we allow ourselves to see" shifts into slightly elevated register at closure, and "so that someone, somewhere, might finally hear" introduces a faint note of hope that sits at the edge of her established pessimism without full dramatization of that tonal shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines doing double duty (e.g., "The fossil fuel ban had passed six years ago, and the world had exhaled with premature relief" conveys both timeline and thematic irony). Opening and closing images are strong. Minor deductions: "Index, middle, ring, pinky" appears three times with slight variation, creating a minor loop that, while thematically motivated, borders on template cadence. "She thought about the coral. How she'd floated..." introduces two sentences that paraphrase the witness inadequacy already established, costing momentum. The phrase "the way sonar assembles a seafloor from echoes" is vivid but the simile structure recurs frequently ("the way she counted," "the way all disappeared things persist"), creating a subtle syntactic uniformity that becomes noticeable under close read.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The subsidence-from-extraction-voids premise offers a fresh angle on climate fiction, synthesizing geological consequence with policy inadequacy in a non-obvious way. The tapping-as-thought practice and the atlas page as conceptual anchor feel specific to this character and world. The final image of ghost islands made translucent by light is memorable and non-generic. Minor deduction: the witness-inadequacy theme, while well-executed, is familiar in contemporary climate writing, and the solitary-researcher-at-remote-station frame is a recognizable template. The piece transforms these elements through specificity but does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that would elevate originality into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's identity as coral bleaching witness seeds her witness inadequacy in the first third, drives the middle reflection on "witnessing were enough," and shapes the closure decision to document rather than merely observe. The character trait constrains her stance and enables the final shift. Present in all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage. Moderate irreplaceability: another scientific loss (e.g., species extinction) could substitute with minor edits, but the bleaching image carries specific color-drain resonance that charges the "ghost islands" finale.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The atlas page is handled in three beats: pinned above the workstation (setup), read as paths between vanished atolls (middle reweighting), and held to the window to reveal ghost islands (closure image). It constrains her conceptual frame ("paths don't just disappear") and charges the final image with translucency and loss. High specificity: the Caroline Islands, 2019 edition, dotted navigation routes—all irreplaceable details. Strong closure participation. Minor cap: it does not directly narrow a tactical choice in the middle, functioning more as thematic anchor than plot lever.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The delayed revelation (subsidence from extraction voids) is the story's structural spine, signaled by "anomalies" early, assembled through data cross-referencing mid-story, and delivered as "whisper she'd been refusing to hear." It changes Lena's understanding and drives the closure decision to document. Present in all three gates with clear causal pressure. Moderate deduction: the revelation itself is told rather than dramatized—"she had been assembling the subsidence data for weeks"—and the moment of discovery lacks embodied immediacy or visible cost, reading more as intellectual epiphany than pressured choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears twice: opening line (the tides) and penultimate paragraph ("The tides continued outside, periodically eternal, unconcerned"). It establishes tone and thematic contrast (indifferent nature vs. human urgency) but does not constrain an on-page action or choice. The attribute colors the atmosphere and charges the final image of persistence, but its function remains largely tonal and lyric rather than causal. Setup and closure gates met; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Assemble" is the story's central verb: assembling fragmented ideas via tapping (early), assembling subsidence data for weeks (middle), assembling the truth "one small percussion at a time" in the final typing beat. It drives the revelation and shapes the closure action. Present in all three gates with strong specificity (the sonar metaphor, the data cross-referencing, the typing rhythm). High irreplaceability: the percussive, additive method is baked into character and structure. Minor deduction: the middle data-assembly is summarized rather than shown in a discrete scene beat, slightly weakening its pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tapping practice is introduced in paragraph two, explained as coping mechanism and thinking tool, used actively in paragraph four ("tapped a slow waltz"), stopped in the climactic silence moment ("pressed her palm flat… stopping the tapping for the first time in hours"), and resumed in the final beat ("tapping the keys with the same four-beat rhythm"). It shapes her cognitive tactics, constrains her thought process, and charges the closure with rhythmic continuity. Present in all three gates with high causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability. The mechanics (index, middle, ring, pinky; different surfaces return different resonances) are specific and matter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Station 7 is named early, anchors who/where/when, and provides the console, windowsill, and Atlantic view used in the tapping practice. It supplies isolation that supports the reflective mode and the data that drives the discovery. Present in setup and closure; middle development is implicit (the station's data is assembled off-page). Moderate deduction: the setting remains somewhat generic—"sea level monitoring station" could be anywhere—and does not directly constrain a middle choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The gray Atlantic and the torn atlas do more thematic work than the station infrastructure itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe (six years post-ban, eleven months at Station 7) is signaled early and establishes the inadequacy theme: legislation cannot reverse thermodynamics already in motion. It shapes the conceptual stakes (the voids predate the ban and will collapse for centuries) and charges the closure insight. Setup and closure gates met. Middle development is weak: time does not tighten a mid-story decision or create urgency; the eleven months are static background. The ban functions more as thematic premise than temporal constraint. Moderate specificity (six years, eleven months) but high swappability (other post-policy timeframes would work).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation to discover why paths (coastlines, navigation routes) disappear faster than predicted is stated early, drives the data assembly, and is satisfied by the subsidence revelation. It shapes the closure decision to document the truth. Present in all three gates with clear causal linkage. Moderate deduction: the motivation is professional-intellectual rather than personal-conflicted; Lena faces no competing desire or cost that would dramatize friction between want and obstacle. The discovery feels inevitable rather than hard-won, and the final typing choice lacks a visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone of "drifting moored" is established in the waltz-rhythm tapping ("going nowhere and everywhere at once"), sustained through reflective accumulation, and charged in the final image of ghost islands that "persist just beneath the surface." The tone modulates appropriately: contemplative early, tightening with the revelation, pausing in the enormous silence, resuming with purpose in the typing beat. Present in all three gates with coherent modulation and closure charge. Minor deduction: the tone remains largely static in register (melancholic, elegiac) without sharp contrast or dissonance that would test its coherence under pressure.</comment>
