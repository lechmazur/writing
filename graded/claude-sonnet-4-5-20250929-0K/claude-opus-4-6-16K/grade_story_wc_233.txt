<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The queen's interiority is vivid and concrete—her seven years of disenchantment, the physical climb, the "whisper the world leaned in to hear" quality—anchored in embodied perception rather than labels. The girl's arrival introduces a second character with shared experience, creating a clean moment of recognition. Minor slip: the queen's decision to remove the crown and climb higher feels slightly under-motivated; we see renunciation but the cost of leaving the kingdom isn't dramatized on the page, only gestured at through "weight she had resented."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: disenchanted queen, mountain climb, post-warning timeframe. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): removing the crown and choosing to "climb higher" with the girl reweights the queen's seven-year struggle, crystallizing a new threshold with the cost of abandoning sovereignty made visible in the discarded crown. The causal chain holds—dreams lead to climb, grotto reveals vision, girl's presence completes the mystery's answer—and the inferred lens (Causal with Accumulative texture) remains coherent through the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: veined stone "pulsed faintly," bleeding starlight pooling with ember-light, fireflies breaching impossible altitude. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"lace that could cut," "condensation," "breath visible"—filtered through the queen's perception. The environment constrains the revelation (she must kneel at the pool) and the fireflies' arrival supplies the recognition beat. Spatial choreography remains clear across the ascent and dual-chamber grotto.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: the mystery of recurring dreams and the pull toward the ridge after the final warning. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pool finally speaks and the girl's presence reveals the answer—"You were meant to rule the threshold." The queen's agency is crystallized in removing the crown and choosing to climb higher, a renunciation that forecloses her sovereignty with visible cost. Pressure accumulates through the climb, the grotto's revelation, and the shared exhale, though the girl's coincidental arrival at this exact moment leans toward situational complication rather than earned reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—threshold between dreaming and waking, sovereignty as burden versus calling—emerges through concrete particulars: bleeding starlight, the fractured-light crown in the vision, the discarded real crown, fireflies breaching altitude. The pool's answer ("rule the threshold") reweights the queen's seven-year disenchantment without stating a moral. The final image—two dreamers ascending into bleeding sky—offers resonant closure rooted in prior material. Minor drag: "something ancient and electric passed between them" edges toward abstraction where the shared exhale already carried the recognition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited queen throughout; no head-hopping. The prose carries distinct perceptual signature: "bombast of kings" versus "whisper the world leaned in to hear," "hemorrhage of light," "lace that could cut." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from intimate interiority ("she had always moved that way") to sensory immediacy in the grotto. The girl's brief dialogue ("Every night. The bleeding sky. The crown that cuts.") mirrors the queen's compressed syntax under pressure. Elision is purposeful—we don't see the kingdom left behind because the story's lens points forward.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high: "stars splitting open, their luminous blood dripping" and "a cathedral of blue stone veined with something that pulsed faintly" deliver texture without stalling. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor overwriting in peak beats: "ancient and electric" is abstract where the shared exhale already embodied the moment, and "hemorrhage of light" + "bleeding starlight" + "luminous blood" in the opening paragraph stacks metaphor without causal variance. Propulsion remains strong; the final line ("into the bleeding sky above") charges closure without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—disenchanted queen, bleeding starlight, threshold sovereignty, dual dreamers—feels specific and earned rather than template-derived. The transformation of "queen who doesn't believe in her crown" through the grotto revelation to "rule the threshold" offers a non-obvious answer rooted in prior particulars. The fireflies breaching altitude and the shared exhale are fresh sensory inflections. Risk-taking in the lyric-laced prose and the open ending (ascending into bleeding sky) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight proximity echo: the "lace that could cut" and bleeding-sky imagery evoke familiar gothic-celestial registers without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present early; her disenchantment frames the climb. Her choice to kneel at the pool advances the vision beat, and her decision to remove the crown and invite the girl to climb higher drives closure. Two distinct on-page choices with visible cost (sovereignty renounced). Eligible for mid-6s; causal pressure and closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Signaled at climb's end; functions in two beats (revelation pool, final shared moment). The ember grotto's pooled light enables the vision, and the location frames the girl's arrival. Constrains the queen's posture (kneeling) and charges the ending as the launch point for ascent. Strong causal role and closure participation; irreplaceability high (the dual-chamber structure matters).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Seeded in opening paragraph ("bleeding starlight"); recurs in mother's letter, three-night auroras, grotto ceiling ("wounded" stars, "rose" light, "lace that could cut"), pool vision, and final image ("bleeding sky above"). Shapes stakes (the boundary worn thin) and the queen's compulsion to climb. Alters options by defining the threshold she's meant to rule. Drives at least three beats and articulates closure; essential across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Introduced early ("softly commanding"); shown in her climbing presence ("commanding even the mountain") and final invitation to the girl. Constrains her mode of action—whisper over bombast—enabling connection with the girl. One causal beat (final command) where the quality matters; lyric reprise reweights the trait but middle development is thin. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The climb is the spine: decision to begin at dawn, physical ascent past treeline and clouds, arrival at grotto, kneeling, and the final choice to "climb higher." Every major turn traces to this action. Drives setup, middle revelation, and closure; irreplaceable (the vertical journey is the threshold metaphor made literal). Strong causal pressure and indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Appears only at closure: "shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" signals recognition between queen and girl. The fireflies are seeded as impossible (breaching altitude), and the shared breath is embodied. Lyric reprise without mid-scene use; reweights the mystery's answer and enables the dual-ascent choice. Closure linkage strong; late appearance and single-beat use limit band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Established early (end of first third); functions in revelation and closure beats. The grotto's dual chambers (cobalt + ember), pooled light, and open sky constrain the queen's movements (kneeling, seeing) and supply the resources for vision and recognition. Spatial particulars (veins, basin, narrow passage) alter tactics. Environment charges the final image and drives two key beats; essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Signaled in opening: "final warning had come and gone," three nights of auroras now silent. The post-warning timeframe pressures the queen's departure against astrologers' pleas and compresses urgency. Shapes the climb's stakes (she moves "before dawn") and the closure choice (no return to the palace). Tracks across beats and tightens decisions; strong development and closure tie.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stated early and dramatized: dreams "torment" for years, compel the climb despite warnings, and drive her to the grotto. The pool finally reveals the dream's content, and the girl's shared experience completes the mystery's answer. Friction between wanting sovereignty and needing the threshold is embodied in the discarded crown. Two beats (climb decision, revelation) with visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Established in opening beats: "hemorrhage of light," "lace that could cut," auroras as "ancient signal," mountain "slick with condensation." Tone modulates through climb (deliberate, commanding) to grotto (wonder, menace: "finest menace, beautiful and sharp") to closure (resonant, charged: ascending into bleeding sky). Coherent through turns and charges the final image without flattening into single mood. Strong tonal control under pressure.</comment>
