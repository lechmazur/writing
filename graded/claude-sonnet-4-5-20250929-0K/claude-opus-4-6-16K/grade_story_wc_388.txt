<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's professional skepticism and methodical approach are well-established through the letter reconstruction. Her interiority is concrete ("she carried the object that had convinced her"), and the weeping moment embodies contradictory impulses without therapy-speak. However, the final choice to make the call feels slightly undercooked—the pause and resumption lack a visible tradeoff or forecloses path that would elevate the emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (wasteland orchard, dosimeter, Maren's arrival). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the shredded-letter backstory, the diamond's silence effect, and the intuited stillpoint, culminating in the phone-call moment that reweights Maren's original stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—she presses the button, consequences loom, cost is felt in the knowledge that "it would change what people believed was possible"—though the cost remains largely anticipatory rather than paid on the page, which keeps it from the highest band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard's radioactive dust, glowing fruit, and Mother tree anchor the setting vividly and filter through Maren's professional lens (dosimeter clicks, "should not have existed"). The diamond's interaction with the earth—dosimeter going silent—constrains her investigative choice and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography (kneeling at roots, dust storm rolling in) remains clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—excavating Orsk's truth from the official lie—is signaled early and tightens when Maren encounters the stillpoint's physical proof. The diamond-at-roots moment deepens understanding and narrows options: she must either call or suppress. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the final act (dialing) carries more felt potential than on-page cost, limiting entry into the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between the "comfortable lie" and the stillpoint's "fundamental correction." The flawed diamond and Mother tree recur purposefully, shifting meaning at closure. The weeping beat avoids moralizing ("not from sorrow but from…relief of encountering something…simply, stubbornly true"), and the final image—apple trees holding firm amid the howling storm—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maren; perceptual signature is sharp ("fiber grain, pressure ghosts of Orsk's handwriting"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("the world remembered how to be unbroken"). No dialogue appears, so those bullets are inapplicable. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she felt something she could only describe as stillness") slightly dulls immediacy in one peak beat but does not materially harm distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high ("Radioactive dust storms had scoured this land for eleven years…yet here the trees thrived"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. The phrase "something beneath entropy, beneath decay, beneath every lie" edges toward stacked abstraction in a high-pressure moment, applying a small overwriting penalty. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—shredded-letter reconstruction leading to a hidden zero-radiation zone—offers a fresh synthesis of conspiracy debunking and speculative geology. The stillpoint concept is specific enough to avoid generic mystery-box tropes. However, the arc (professional investigator discovers suppressed truth, makes fateful call) follows a recognizable template, and the final choice does not take a bold risk that might elevate originality further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's debunker role frames her arrival and her methodical letter reconstruction. Her choice to dial at the end is causally motivated by that identity, and the pause-and-press sequence shows decision under pressure. She appears in setup, middle (intuiting the stillpoint), and closure (making the call), meeting all three gates. The cost is felt but largely anticipatory, and her debunker trait constrains tactics (she "had contacts at three international agencies") without a second distinct on-page turn, placing her in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The diamond is introduced early ("the object that had convinced her"), used twice on the page (mentioned as carried, then pressed against roots to silence the dosimeter), and shapes a key beat (the intuition moment). It appears in setup and middle, and its effect informs the closure decision, but it does not return in the final image itself—the trees and phone are foregrounded. Two-beat involvement with causal pressure and specificity (its flaw and curse rumor) justify low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stillpoint is seeded via backstory (Orsk's letters), tested on the page (diamond silences dosimeter), and Maren intuits its nature in the pivotal beat. It directly shapes her understanding and the stakes of the phone call. Present in setup (letters), middle (intuition), and closure context (what she will reveal), with causal pressure on her choice, it earns mid-6s; it does not physically constrain a second distinct tactic or appear in the final image, capping higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is shown through the letter reconstruction (matching ink, fiber grain, pressure ghosts) and the noticing that "the orchard should not have existed." It enables her to intuit the stillpoint's significance. Present in setup and middle, it shapes one major beat but does not constrain a second distinct choice or carry visible cost at closure, landing in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Intuit" drives the central revelation beat: "She began to intuit the shape of what Orsk had found." That realization reweights her understanding and leads directly to the phone-call choice. It appears in middle and informs closure, but is a single-beat turn rather than a mechanism that constrains multiple tactics; swapping "realize" or "understand" would require only minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The method (reassembling shredded letters) is detailed in backstory ("six weeks reassembling…by hand, matching ink color, fiber grain") and establishes Maren's credibility. It sets up the stillpoint discovery but does not recur or constrain an on-page action after the opening. Present in setup, absent from middle choices and closure, it remains functional but replaceable—other discovery methods would serve similar narrative work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is foregrounded from the first line ("should not have existed"), supplies the Mother tree and glowing fruit as concrete anchors, and provides the dust storm in the final image. It pressures Maren's investigation (dosimeter clicks, poisoned soil) and charges the closure ("the apple trees held firm"). Setup, middle constraint (diamond pressed to roots), and closure participation with specificity earn low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the liquidation…eleven years…six weeks ago") anchors the backstory and frames Maren's present investigation. It does not create an on-page ticking clock or tighten a decision during the scene itself. Present in setup and informing the stakes, but without middle or closure pressure, it lands in mid-5s as contextually functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to "excavate truth from comfortable lies" is stated early, dramatized through the letter work, tested when she encounters the stillpoint, and drives the climactic phone call. It creates friction (the pause before dialing suggests she weighs the cost of revealing the truth), appears in setup, middle, and closure, and the final choice embodies it with felt consequence, justifying mid-7s.</comment>
