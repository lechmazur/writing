<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is rich with contradiction—trained to perform devastation, then denied her real suffering—and the embodied detail ("screaming with a voice she'd only ever lent to fiction") charges her motivation. The "benevolently ruthless" trait surfaces in action ("refuse to leave until the person gave her the one detail") with visible cost. Minor slips: the vow moment six months prior feels slightly tell-heavy, and the metaphor of the chessboard could constrain a present choice more directly. Internal conflict between performed and authentic pain drives the arc convincingly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: Maren's walking ritual, the interregnum absence, and the chessboard coalesce into a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure when she writes "STAY" and the final image reweights her nomadic stance with undeniable cost—she chooses to document erasure in an ungoverned space. Orientation anchors cleanly (whispering gallery, eleven-day gap, single POV). The closure image ("S-T-A-Y … luminous and absent and entirely her own") crystallizes options and forecloses wandering with felt cost. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery's acoustic architecture constrains choice: Maren places the chessboard at the focal point where whispers return, turning the space into a witness and collaborator. The gallery's interregnum emptiness charges the final image ("belonged to no one, which meant it belonged to her"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (curved perimeter, stone bench, spiraling sound). The micro-setting (her body tracing letters on stone) functions as tactile world-building that charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to document "small gestures that catastrophe leaves behind" and prove her suffering by preserving others'. The tightening occurs when she moves from nomadic collecting to the vow "STAY," foreclosing perpetual movement with visible cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: the interregnum absence, the missing pawns, and Mrs. Callahan's gesture accumulate into a pattern that forces stance crystallization. Agency is endurance and attention—Earned Stasis—with cost legible in the final word spelled on stone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the chessboard's missing pawns as "a census of the unnamed," the nurse's collar adjustment, the mother's folded blanket. The final image offers a non-literal answer—"STAY" becomes both archive and vow, charged by "luminous absence." No thematic statements; the crisis-actor paradox (performing pain, then being disbelieved) reweights authenticity without moralizing. The interregnum setting and nomadic penumbra cohere into a meditation on presence during ungoverned pause. Subtext operates in every gesture without explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices gaps (missing pawns, scattered staff, "afterimage burning in the dark") and processes the world through performance metaphor ("the label could unbind her from her actual suffering, peel it away like a costume"). Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout. One minor slip: "nomadic penumbra" in paragraph 7 tilts slightly elevated for the established idiom, though it recovers immediately. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, compressing at the notebook entry and opening at the closing image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies cleanly; the opening ("eleven days") and closing ("S-T-A-Y") anchor with image rather than summary. Information density is high—nearly every line advances character, world, or theme. Minor deductions: "luminous absence" recurs three times, risking slight over-reliance on the phrase; "benevolently ruthless" and "Tenderness wielded like a scalpel" sit close together in register, creating brief figurative density in paragraph 5. No loops or scaffold. The chessboard metaphor ("dignitaries at a summit where all the common people had vanished") clarifies rather than muddles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The crisis-actor premise is specific and transformed through lived consequence (the Ridgeline collapse, conspiracy-forum disbelief). The whispering gallery as archive during interregnum offers a fresh spatial metaphor. The chessboard missing pawns charges the theme without symbolic convenience. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the word-spelling ritual heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis of performed versus authentic suffering, erasure, and presence feels inevitable in hindsight. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present early (paragraph 4: "crisis actor … became a genuine survivor"), shapes the central conflict (disbelief after real trauma), and informs her historian vow. The dual identity drives two beats: the conspiracy-forum rejection and her counter-move to collect others' gestures. Appears in closure via the notebook entry (documenting Mrs. Callahan). Cost is conceptual—her professional training now haunts authenticity. Swappable with "trauma counselor" or similar role with moderate edits, capping higher range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 3 (setup gate met), used in two distinct beats: placement at the focal point and the rook-to-center move that exposes absurdity. Returns in the closing image ("chessboard sat in the silence, its missing pawns a census"). The missing-pawns specificity is irreplaceable and causally tied to her vow to document the unnamed. Drives theme and charges closure. No on-page cost tied directly to handling it; elevates slightly above mid-7s on closure linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Defined explicitly in paragraph 7 ("nomadic penumbra … always moving, always half in shadow") and frames her no-fixed-address stance. Shapes one key turn: the decision to spell "STAY" forecloses nomadic movement with cost. Present in the opening (returning after eleven days) and ending (the vow to stay). Lyric reprise reweights the stake. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is thematic rather than causal. Specificity ("penumbra") is high, but the concept could be replaced with "wandering" or "rootlessness" with moderate rewording.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled paragraph 5 ("benevolently ruthless"), immediately demonstrated in action: "knock on doors … refuse to leave until the person gave her the one detail." Constrains her method with visible tradeoff ("Tenderness wielded like a scalpel"). Present in one key beat (her vow and practice). Does not return at closure. Two gates (setup, development) met; payoff gate missed. Swappable with "gently relentless" or similar without major structural loss, capping mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Implied throughout (she "stopped trying to prove her pain was real") but not dramatized as a distinct on-page action. The "unbind" language appears once in paragraph 4 as metaphor ("the label could unbind her from her actual suffering"). Does not drive a turn or constrain a choice. Mentioned but not enacted. One gate (setup as metaphor) met; development and payoff gates missed. Easily swappable with "deny" or "erase" without affecting structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Signaled in opening paragraph (spelling H-E-R-E, then L-O-S-S, then S-T-A-Y) and used in three beats across the arc. Mechanics matter: "each footfall a letter pressed into the stone floor" and the gallery's acoustics confirm her presence. Shapes the ending image where "STAY" becomes both archive and vow. All three gates met (setup, development, payoff). Causal pressure is oblique—the ritual externalizes her stance rather than narrowing tactics. Specificity is high; removal would flatten the closing resonance but not break plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced immediately (paragraph 1), used across five beats: acoustic confirmation of presence, the focal-point bench placement, the vow made six months prior that "returned to her like a promise," and the closure where the walls carry "STAY" back "like an echo from the future." The gallery's acoustic architecture constrains choice (placement at the focal point matters) and charges the final image. All three gates met with strong causal and closure linkage. Irreplaceability high—no generic "empty museum" could replicate the whisper-return mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Signaled paragraph 2 ("interregnum … strange, ungovened pause between the old director's death and the appointment of the new one") and frames the entire action window. Shapes one key choice: the gallery "belonged to no one, which meant it belonged to her," enabling her presence. Returns at closure ("during a time when no one was in charge"). Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is atmospheric rather than causal. Swappable with "closure period" or "between administrations" with moderate edits, capping upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vow stated paragraph 5 ("to become the historian of small gestures"), demonstrated in paragraph 6 (door-knocking practice), and enacted on-page in the notebook entry (Mrs. Callahan's hand on the wall). Drives two beats and shapes closure—the chessboard's "census of the unnamed" ties directly to this motivation. All three gates met. Visible cost: "benevolently ruthless" tactics and the nomadic life required. High specificity; "archivist of trauma" or similar could substitute with moderate loss, capping just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Phrase introduced paragraph 2 ("luminous absence settled over everything, the way light persists after a bulb dies"), recurs paragraph 7 ("nomadic penumbra … a darkness that traveled with her but never fully consumed the light at its edges"), and charges the closing image ("luminous and absent and entirely her own"). Tone modulates with pressure—quiet at opening, compressed at the notebook entry, resonant at closure. Coherent through all turns. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is textural. Reprise reweights the dominant stake with cost legible in the final paradox.</comment>
