<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear—cardiac implant as physical timer—and her collection-building demonstrates embodied agency. The arrival of Sable and the boy adds dimensionality, though these secondary characters function more as thematic echoes than distinct pressures. Internal contradiction is present (clinging to measurement while seeking texture beyond counting) but could deepen; the final stance crystallizes without a visible cost that forecloses a live option on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren moves from counting-down dread to present-tense listening, foregrounding duration over measurement. The felt cost—her four months, "maybe fewer"—is acknowledged but not dramatically tested in a choice that narrows options. Orientation is swift (emerald silo, post-Revision world, cardiac timer). The accumulative lens coheres: each beat (capsule discovery, message method, gatherings, fragment placement) deepens the texture-over-number thesis and converges at the final image of ticking disagreement and timeless presence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The emerald silo is vivid and purposeful: its jewel-glazed walls frame the collection, green light falls through the high window for the sundial, and the structure itself becomes a message board. The urn fragment is handled across beats (discovery, display, final mantle placement) and charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's project-focused perception. The silo constrains the gathering and supplies the spatial logic for the final tableau, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding time's texture before her implant fails—is signaled early and tightens through the message campaign and gathering. One meaningful deepening occurs when the urn fragment crystallizes the group's purpose (sequence as proof of existence). Agency is present (Maren devises the garage-sale method, gathers people, places the fragment) but the escalation is more accumulative than decision-based; no reversal forces a trade-off with visible cost. The four-month countdown is felt but not dramatized in a moment that narrows her options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—time's irrepeatable texture versus fluid numerics—emerges through concrete particulars (clocks ticking at divergent rates, the urn fragment's incomplete name, garage-sale barter). The final image answers the central question non-literally: Maren stops counting and listens, held rather than frozen. Subtext operates in the fragment's partial name and the silo's emerald glow. No overt moralizing; the clocks' beautiful disagreement and the "present tense that refused to end" resonate without stating a thesis. Minor slip: "anticipated mysteries" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward abstract philosophizing but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Maren's timekeeper lens. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "grain, its weight against the skin," "duration crystallize around her like resin around an insect." Perceptual signature is consistent (noticing texture, sequence, presence). Distance modulates appropriately at emotional peaks. Minor register drift: "anticipated mysteries that hummed behind every clock face" slightly elevates beyond the established voice's grounding in physical detail. No dialogue is present; focus remains on interior reflection and action description.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or theme. Clarity is strong, though a few constructions edge toward overwriting: "anticipated mysteries" and "duration crystallize around her like resin around an insect" both appear in the penultimate paragraph, creating slight figurative density. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The final line "timeless at last, finally home in a present tense that refused to end" stacks three closure gestures where one might suffice, but remains legible and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-Revision fluid numerics, cardiac countdown, and garage-sale message embedding is specific and non-obvious. The urn fragment as proof of sequence is a fresh angle on time-capsule material. Emotional truth (clinging to measure while seeking unmeasured texture) avoids template solutions. Trope transformation: the dying-protagonist countdown becomes a lens for collective rediscovery rather than individual pathos. The story commits fully to its premise without hedging. Minor proximity note: "resin around an insect" is a recognizable amber metaphor, though its application here is apt.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (borrowed-time timekeeper) is present throughout, drives the message campaign, gathers others, and places the urn fragment. Her cardiac countdown shapes stakes early and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("four months left, maybe fewer"). Her choices create key turns: devising the garage-sale method, showing the fragment, positioning it on the mantle. The final stance (listening over counting) is earned by her prior agency. Strong causal involvement and closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The urn fragment appears in three distinct beats: discovery beneath the foundation (setup), shown to Sable and the boy mid-story (development), and placed on the mantle in the penultimate paragraph (closure participation). Each use reweights its meaning: from corroded remnant to proof of sequence to "timeless at last, finally home." Specific properties (ceramic, bone-white, partial name "Elid/Elidar") matter. It constrains the group's purpose and charges the final image. Strong integration with visible cost (incompleteness as thematic anchor).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule is discovered early (beneath the silo's foundation) and yields the urn fragment, which becomes the story's central object. The capsule itself does not recur or constrain later choices; the fragment does that work. The concept shapes the inciting moment but does not directly pressure tactics after the discovery beat. Swappable: another buried relic could serve similar thematic functions. Scores in the mid-band for providing the seed but not participating in escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" is attributed to Maren's experience when holding the fragment ("felt something suddenly timeless pass through her") and returns thematically in the final line ("timeless at last"). The trait is more felt-state than actionable constraint. It does not enable or foreclose a specific choice with visible cost. The final reprise reweights the fragment's status, which elevates slightly, but the attribute itself remains ornamental rather than causal. Mid-band for thematic echo without direct pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Rediscover" appears explicitly when the group begins "to rediscover what clocks had originally meant" and implicitly structures the entire arc (Maren re-finding time's texture, gathering others to join). It shapes the middle turn (communal purpose crystallizes) and the final stance (listening replaces counting). The action is not a single event but a process that defines the story's movement. Causally essential and irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the narrative logic. Strong integration across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage-sale item descriptions is signaled early ("verbose, poetic listings") and motivates the arrivals of Sable and the boy, creating the middle gathering beat. The mechanics matter: barter immunity to the Revision enables the method. However, the method does not recur after the arrivals; no further listings or responses pressure the ending. One key causal beat (gathering the group) but absent from closure participation. Functional but does not charge the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo is established immediately, recurs as message board, houses the collection, provides the green-light shaft for the sundial, and frames the final tableau. Specific properties (jewel-glazed walls, high window, mantle shelf, concrete foundation) enable actions and constrain spatial logic. The silo's presence in the first and final paragraphs charges the closure: "inside the emerald silo... the clocks disagreed with each other beautifully." Essential across setup, development, and payoff; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The post-Revision timeframe (numbers changed meaning, fluid numerics) is established early, shapes the entire premise, and explains why Maren's project matters. The "fourteen months dissolved" and "four months left" countdown tightens urgency. The timeframe does not function as a ticking clock that alters tactics beat-by-beat, but it underpins every choice and charges the final irony (unmeasured present versus the implant's countdown). Strong thematic and causal presence; would score higher if the countdown forced a specific trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren's desire "to understand the texture of time passing—not its measurement, but its grain, its weight against the skin" is stated early and dramatized through every action: starting the collection, embedding messages, showing the fragment, listening to ticking. The motivation conflicts with her own countdown (measurement she cannot escape) and resolves in the final stance (listening over counting). Embodied and conflicted across beats; drives the closure image. Irreplaceable and causally central.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone of "anticipated mysteries" is coherent: the story opens with jewel-like imagery and ends with "anticipated mysteries that hummed behind every clock face." The mood modulates subtly—wonder at the fragment, urgency in the message campaign, quiet communion at the gathering, poised suspension in the final image. The phrase "anticipated mysteries" appears late (penultimate paragraph) but recharges earlier images (clocks as artifacts, fragment's incomplete name). Tone charges the ending and remains consistent under pressure; no jarring shifts.</comment>
