<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is specific and embodied—her wariness in body-flow contrasts against hard scanning eyes, and the scrimshaw functions as tactile anchor for layered memory. The motivational through-line from guarded competence to "done performing" reads cleanly, and her final choice to swim carries visible forfeiture of dock identity. Callum's patience is shown through repeated presence rather than stated, and his splash at the end functions as proof of stake rather than convenience. Minor: the mother's backstory arrives early but remains largely told rather than integrated into a present micro-choice that alters Maren's stance before the whale call.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered gestures (scrimshaw handling, Callum's approach, whale call) that reweight Maren's guarded stance until she detaches with visible cost. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the island surfaces, she swims, Callum follows, and the final "island held" crystallizes her renunciation with undeniable cost (abandoning dock role, risking witness). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the whale call externalizes her caged self, narrowing options to swim or remain armored. Cost is legible in "detached—from the dock, from the role, from the armor."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting: Maren's boots in shallows, kelp "like funeral bunting," and rising water constrain her final choice to wade deeper, making the setting active rather than decorative. The scrimshaw's warmth and the sea buckling upward provide sensory specificity that charges the closure image. Spatial choreography (rocks, harbor mouth, water at knees then deeper) tracks cleanly. Minor: "Feldspar Bay" proper receives minimal textural detail beyond docks and tide line; the setting works primarily through the sublittoral margin rather than the broader harbor world.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to stop performing and unlock what she's caged. The whale call serves as the single meaningful tightening that narrows options to swim or stay armored. Maren's agency drives the turn—she chooses to wade despite years of guarding, and the cost is immediate forfeiture of dock identity and Callum's witness. The invitation "Come with me. Or don't" crystallizes her stance with visible price. No contrivance; the island's appearance complicates rather than solves, and her choice to swim precedes Callum's splash, preserving protagonist causality at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the scrimshaw as key to guarded hearts, the sublittoral fringe as liminal space, and "detach" as both physical and metaphorical action. The final image—whale song, swim, island holding—offers a resonant answer to the central question (can one stop performing after violence ends?) without stating a moral. "The whale hadn't called to her. It had called to whatever she'd locked inside" reweights prior material cleanly. Minor: "The end of violence did not mean the end of pain" borders on thesis statement but is quickly grounded in Maren's armor metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with psychic distance controlled—Maren's perceptual signature (hard eyes, "armor like a second skeleton") remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue serves goals: Callum's "fairy tale" and Maren's "promise" exchange advances her commitment. The final beat compresses diction appropriately ("Behind her, she heard a second splash") without head-hopping. Minor: "the maddening patience of a man who had decided to care" and "everything he'd never forced her to acknowledge" drift slightly toward editorial summary rather than filtered through Maren's specific idiom, though the effect remains largely voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well ("That border between tide-covered and exposed rock, where kelp draped…"), and information density is high in the opening moves. The scrimshaw description and whale-call beat propel without scaffold. Minor artifacts: "She'd snap; he'd stay. She'd retreat into silence; he'd sit beside it" reads as paraphrase loop with parallel template cadence across two sentences. "The words cost her something. She felt them leave like splinters pulled from under skin" stacks filter verbs ("felt") and then re-states the cost metaphorically in the next clause, creating slight redundancy. No loops touch the closure image, so penalties remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The post-violence premise (the Silencing) is transformed by focusing on armor that persists rather than the violence itself, and the sublittoral fringe as psychological margin feels specific. The scrimshaw as key rather than map offers a non-obvious twist on the quest-object trope. The final move—swimming toward the island with witness—avoids solo epiphany cliché. Risk is present in the open ending (island holds, but resolution is not guaranteed) without obscuring clarity. Proximity check: "armor like a second skeleton" and "detach" feel fresh enough, though the disappearing-island motif itself leans on familiar fantasy beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren is introduced early (opening sentence), drives the middle choice ("I'm done performing"), and the final act (swim toward island) depends on her agency. Her dock-work grace contrasts with wariness, and her decision to wade deeper forecloses the guarded life with visible cost. Present in closure (swim, detach). Causal pressure is strong, and the cost (abandoning role, risking Callum's witness) is tied to her choice. Slight swappability: "dock worker" functions primarily as baseline competence; another working role could serve similar thematic purpose with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The scrimshaw appears in the opening paragraph (early signal), is handled in at least three beats (break on rocks, thumb across whale, grows warm at the call), and its reweighted meaning ("never a map… a key") directly enables the closure choice to swim. It constrains Maren's understanding and charges the final image when she acts on its promise. Irreplaceable: the carved whale and island are specific to the world logic. Cost connection: holding it "like it owes you money" embodies prior debt, and releasing that grip (implicit in the swim) forfeits the mother's talisman role. Minor: the scrimshaw is not visibly present in the final paragraph, so closure linkage is one beat prior rather than in the terminal image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The disappearing island is seeded early (mother's stories, scrimshaw carving), shapes Maren's stake throughout (the promise she holds onto), and surfaces on the page at the climax, altering her options from guarded to swim-or-stay. It appears in the closure beat ("the island held") and drives the final action. Causal pressure: the island's appearance narrows her choice and makes the detachment literal. Cost: swimming toward an island that "disappears" carries risk of loss. Specificity: the whale-call mechanism and the "by the call of a whale from the deep" method tie it to world logic, reducing swappability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unlocks guarded hearts" is thematized early (scrimshaw as key) and shapes Maren's final choice to stop guarding. The attribute constrains her middle stance (years of performing) and enables the swim (unlocking herself). Present in closure framing ("detach… from the armor"). Cost: unlocking forecloses the guarded life. Friction: the attribute is more metaphorical than physical; it does not create a distinct on-page action beat separate from the swim itself. The label "unlocks guarded hearts" is directly stated ("what it unlocked were guarded hearts"), reducing subtlety and making it feel slightly ornamental rather than discovered through action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Detach" is seeded in the opening (sublittoral as liminal space), recurs in the mother's island promise, and becomes the decisive action in the final paragraph: "She detached—from the dock, from the role, from the armor." The swim enacts it physically and metaphorically. Causal: the choice to detach resolves the dominant stake (stop performing) with visible cost (loss of dock identity, exposure to Callum's witness). Specificity: "detach" carries both tidal (sublittoral) and emotional freight, making it irreplaceable. Present in closure sentence. All three gates met with strong pressure and cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The whale call is seeded early (scrimshaw carving, "by the call of a whale from the deep"), and its arrival at the climax triggers Maren's choice. The method is described on the page ("a sound so low it bypassed her ears and entered through her sternum") and shapes the final turn. Causal: the call externalizes her caged self, making the swim possible. Present in closure ("The whale sang again"). Friction: the method arrives late (final third onset) and is not tested or attempted by Maren before it succeeds; it functions more as inciting coincidence than a means she employs across beats. Specificity and closure linkage lift it into solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is named and described early (opening moves), provides the physical space for all key beats (breaks on rocks, rising water, wade deeper), and constrains the final choice by making depth literal. Maren's boots in shallows and water at knees track her progression toward the swim. The setting's tidal nature (border between covered and exposed) mirrors her psychological state and charges the closure image. Micro-setting test passed: the fringe alters tactics (she must wade to reach the island). Specificity: "funeral bunting" kelp and "clenched fists" anemones are tactile and voice-consistent. All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Silencing is introduced early and frames the world (violence ceased), shaping Maren's armor as anachronism and charging the stakes (why guard when threats can't come?). It constrains her middle stance (performing despite safety) and implicitly enables the swim (the world won't kill her for vulnerability). Present in thematic closure: the island appears in a post-violence world where old defenses no longer serve. Friction: the timeframe does not create a ticking clock or tighten on-page decisions; it functions primarily as premise rather than pressure lever. The attribute is more ambient than causal at the beat level, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren's desire to stop pretending and embrace her "fluid and untamed" true nature is seeded early (body flowing, eyes hard; locked-away self) and drives the dominant stake. The motivation is dramatized in her choice to say "I'm done performing" and wade toward the island despite years of guarding. Conflict: she wants freedom but fears exposure (Callum's witness). Cost: swimming forfeits the dock role and risks vulnerability. Present in closure sentence ("detached… and swam"). The whale-call beat reweights the motivation by framing it as the caged self calling out, adding specificity. Minor: some phrasing ("performing a version of herself") borders on summary rather than fully embodied choice-friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone blends Maren's hard wariness ("eyes stayed hard, scanning for threats") with Callum's patient care and her invitation at the end ("Come with me. Or don't"), creating a charged mix of guardedness and tentative connection. The tone modulates: early beats are defensive, the whale call softens into wonder, and the swim carries both assertion and tenderness (Callum's splash). Present in closure image (the island "held" suggests both threat and promise). Friction: "combative tenderness" is more implicit than foregrounded; Callum's "maddening patience" and Maren's "snap; he'd stay" lean toward tenderness without sustained combativeness in their direct exchanges. The tone charges the final image but does not dominate every beat, trending mid-to-high band.</comment>
