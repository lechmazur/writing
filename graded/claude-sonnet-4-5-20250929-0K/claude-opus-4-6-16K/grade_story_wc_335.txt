<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior is concrete and character-specific—her backward steps, the tea-leaf reading from her grandmother, her choice to vouch for Sable. The renunciation of "rescue" in favor of patient archiving carries visible cost (waiting, silence, the risk that Sable will reject her). Minor: Sable remains off-page, so the relationship crucible is one-sided and some of her fury is told rather than dramatized. The final choice to leave the annotation and unwashed cup earns the endurance stance with embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: density increases through layered images (teacup, shadow-glass, tea leaves, swing) that converge at closure when Maren writes the annotation and places the shadow as paperweight. Orientation anchors (Maren, library, present afternoon) land early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren's decision to remain legible and wait constitutes a renunciation of forceful intervention, with the cost visible in her silence and the knowledge that Sable "would be furious, and tender, and furious about being tender." One meaningful deepening (the reversible tea-leaf pattern) reweights the stake. Cost proof: "That was the work. Not rescue, not repair, but the patient archiving..." makes the trade-off undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten library is vivid ("ribs protecting a heart that had stopped beating") and constrains action: Maren can only wait, brew tea, annotate. The teacup and glass shard function as micro-setting anchors that recur and charge the final image. The playground swing outside mirrors the library's stillness and participates in the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's archival lens. No occupational excess; the shard-mirror mechanics are integrated without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Sable will accept Maren's quiet mentorship and return. Escalation operates through accumulation: the abandoned teacup and shadow-gift raise the question; the reversible tea-leaf geometry deepens it; Maren's annotation and decision to leave the unwashed cup tighten the stakes by foreclosing the option to chase or explain. Agency is clear: Maren chooses restraint over confrontation, a renunciation with cost ("say nothing combative and mean every word of her silence"). The tightening is modest but sufficient for this length and the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the geometry metaphor, the shadow-as-memory conceit, and the final annotation: "Resilience is not the refusal to break. It is the decision to remain legible after breaking." The piece resists moralizing by keeping the question open—Sable's return is anticipated but not guaranteed, and her fury/tenderness paradox remains unresolved. The reversible exile concept charges the tea-leaf symmetry and the swing's hush-moment without being stated. The final image (unwashed cup, shadow paperweight, swing drifting) reweights prior material with quiet resonance. Borderline: the annotation risks stating theme, but it reads as Maren's voice and is framed as an offering, not authorial verdict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the backward steps, wider during the world-building about reversible exile). Perceptual signature is strong: Maren notices geometry, annotations, the angles of longing in tea leaves. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("hush-moment," "anxious architecture," "patient archiving"). The prose occasionally edges toward elevated register ("combative," "cartographers," "contrition") but remains within an archivist's lexicon. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("knew," "recognized") are voice-motivated and sparse. One slip: "She knew who had left it" could anchor more concretely before the Sable paragraph begins.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are distinct. Information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., the backward steps establish both habit and present anxiety). Minor loops: "furious, and tender, and furious about being tender" is intentional but risks echo. The tea-leaf geometry and shadow descriptions are vivid without overwriting. One template-cadence run: "She wrote... She wrote about... She wrote..." in the annotation paragraph; the parallelism reads purposeful but flirts with mechanical repetition. The final two paragraphs compress exposition ("Tomorrow Sable would return...") in a way that tells peak closure material rather than trusting the prior image. No major artifacts, but the summary ending dilutes propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The shard-mirror library and reversible exile premise offer a fresh synthesis; the shadow-caught-in-glass image is specific and non-obvious. The tea-leaf geometry motif and the backward-walking tic are personalized details that avoid template. Risk: the annotation beat edges toward stating theme, but the piece commits fully to its archival metaphor and the ending's ambiguity (Sable's return is anticipated but not guaranteed) resists neat resolution. The "combative tenderness" tone is earned through contradiction (silence that means, fury that yields to tenderness). Transformation test: the emotional arc depends on these exact particulars (shadow, tea leaves, reversible exile).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout. Her decision to vouch for Sable (backstory) primes the present stake; her choice to annotate rather than confront creates the key turn; her decision to leave the cup unwashed and the shadow as paperweight shapes the closure. Setup, development, and payoff are all met. Causal pressure is clear: her restraint forecloses the option to chase or explain, with visible cost in her waiting and anticipated silence tomorrow.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass-caught shadow appears when Maren discovers it on the table (setup), is studied and described (development), and becomes the paperweight anchoring her annotation at closure (payoff). Three beats. Its properties (the swing's chain angle, the hush-moment) are irreplaceable and charge the final image of memory and waiting. Strong integration; the shadow embodies the reversible exile theme and participates directly in closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Reversible exile is explained in backstory (Maren vouched, the decree allowed return) and shapes the present stake (Sable's hollowed parents, her fury). The tea-leaf geometry reveals a "reversible pattern," linking the concept to method. It reappears in the closure via the annotation's focus on legibility after breaking. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is thematic rather than tactical. The concept alters Maren's stance (patient waiting vs. forceful advocacy) but does not create a mid-scene choice that narrows options. Solid integration, but one step shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Maren walks backwards twice: once near the opening ("three steps without meaning to"), then again before writing the final annotation ("two steps this time, then caught herself and moved forward"). Setup and payoff are present. The trait embodies her anxiety and the piece's reversible motif. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it accompanies decisions rather than enabling them. The cost is implied (her discomfort) but not leveraged on the page. Lyric reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Maren annotates the blank shard-mirror page Sable left, writing in spiraling margins and then at the center. This action is the story's pivot: it answers Sable's challenge, embodies Maren's mentorship philosophy, and delivers the thematic statement ("remain legible after breaking"). Setup (Maren's role as annotator), development (the decision to annotate this specific page), and payoff (the completed annotation shapes closure) are all met. The action could not be swapped; removing it collapses the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tea-leaf reading is seeded via Maren's grandmother (setup), used on the page when Maren studies Sable's cup and discovers the reversible pattern (development), and the geometry informs her annotation and final stance (payoff). The mechanics matter: the angles of longing vs. homecoming, the symmetry that reads forward or backward. Causal: the pattern gives Maren evidence that Sable can "walk in either direction... and remain, stubbornly, herself," licensing her decision to wait rather than intervene. Specificity is high; the method is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library is established early and provides resources (shard-mirrors, space for Sable to search, tea-making). It pressures Maren's choices by offering only waiting and silence—no phones, no pursuit. The reading table and the teacup anchor micro-setting beats. The library's "combative" silence mirrors the tone. Setup, development (Maren brews tea, annotates), and payoff (the unwashed cup and shadow left on the table) are met. The setting enables rather than transforms; removing it would require substitution but the tactics (waiting, annotating) could occur elsewhere. Solid but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The hush-moment when the swing drifts appears in the shadow description, the annotation's phrasing ("stillness is not emptiness but a form of waiting"), and the final image outside. The timeframe is more motif than constraint—it does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Setup and thematic payoff are clear, but middle development is absent; the hush does not alter Maren's tactics or narrow her window. Lyric resonance without causal pressure. The image charges the ending but does not drive escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren's desire to "mentor resilience quietly" rather than "shout about justice" is stated early and dramatized through her choices: vouching for Sable's family, brewing tea, waiting in silence, annotating rather than confronting. The motivation faces friction—Sable's fury and the risk of rejection create doubt—and the cost (patience, possible failure, enduring Sable's anger) is visible. Setup, development (the annotation is an act of quiet mentorship), and payoff (the decision to wait tomorrow and "mean every word of her silence") are all met. Strong causal integration; the motive drives every key choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Combative tenderness operates in the library's "combative" silence, Maren's acknowledgment that Sable will be "furious, and tender, and furious about being tender," and the paradox of leaving the annotation (tender) while knowing it will provoke fury (combative). The tone modulates: warmer during the tea-leaf reading, sharper during the reversible-exile exposition, layered at closure when Maren commits to "say nothing combative and mean every word of her silence." The oxymoron charges the final image. Setup, development across beats, and payoff are present. Strong coherence; the tone is indispensable to the story's emotional logic.</comment>
