<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sable's interiority is concrete and distinct—the borrowed heart as longing, the dye-master's attention to structural vs. pigmented color. The cartographer backstory anchors effectively without stalling momentum. Her final micro-choice (the letter) feels earned by the accumulated understanding of the morpho wing. Minor: the epiphany about "structures that catch and refract" edges toward thesis-statement clarity but remains grounded in the wing experiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a clear Conceptual Repricing at closure. The story deepens through layered observation (heart rhythm, color mechanics, light passage) until the final realization reweights the premise: her transplanted heart as "entrusted light" performing its color. Cost is conceptual but legible—she shifts from envy to stewardship. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating tea house, the basalt slab's rotation, and the morpho wing function as micro-setting that constrains her experiment and charges the closure. The wing's structural-color properties directly enable the realization. Sensory selection (mist, osmanthus tea, the "parallelogram of sunlight") is purposeful and POV-filtered through a dye-master's vocabulary. The rotating platform's mechanics matter to the wing observation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why some lives magnetize stories—is signaled early and tightens through the wing experiment. The light-angle observation is a meaningful deepening that narrows her question to a conceptual answer. Agency is attention and the letter decision, which forecloses her prior envy. Cost is felt in the shift from "borrowed life" to "entrusted light." No explicit antagonist, but the accumulative lens holds pressure through purposeful observation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the morpho wing's structural blue as metaphor for refracted meaning, the donor heart as architectural inheritance. The closing image—"still performed its color"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists easy binaries (pigment vs. structure, hoard vs. refract) and the final wisdom arises from the wing experiment, not assertion. The letter decision ties internal arc to thematic question cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is unmistakable: a dye-master's idiom ("indigo clings to linen," "microscopic scales bent light," "quietly explosive"). Distance is stable first-person close; no head-hopping. Diction under pressure (the heart "knocked hard") stays embodied and character-specific. Purposeful compression in the opening (the floating tea house mechanics) pays off in the rotation observation. Rhythm modulates gracefully—unhurried catalogue, then the eruption beat, then quiet resolve.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances observation or thematic weight. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and metaphors are coherent (color as performance, architecture vs. pigment). Minor loop: "still" is repeated four times in the final two sentences, creating a hymnal cadence that may be intentional but borders on echo. No scaffold or template cadence elsewhere. Propulsion is steady through accumulative beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The transplanted-heart premise is familiar, but the transformation through color mechanics and the floating tea house's rotation adds specificity. The morpho wing as structural-color object is fresh inflection; the realization (refract vs. contain) feels earned rather than imported. Risk: the piece leans heavily on metaphor-as-argument, which succeeds here through the dye-master's expertise. The final letter decision is a quieter closure than many would choose, which fits the tone.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Present early; her dye-master observation skills enable the wing experiment. Her decision to write the letter is the closure choice, altering her stance from envy to offering. Two beats: the wing observation and the letter composition. Causal pressure moderate; she could observe without deciding, but the decision reweights her relationship to the donor.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The morpho wing appears in paragraph four, drives the central experiment (light-angle observation), and charges the final image ("still performed its color"). Three functional beats: withdrawal, light eruption, tilting/understanding. The wing's structural-color property is irreplaceable; pigmented color would not support the thematic turn. Closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Iridescent caution" appears in the opening line and colors her crossing of the bridge, her palm-pressing habit, and her approach to the wing experiment. It shapes her watchful stance but does not create a key turn or cost on its own. The concept is present and consistent but functions more as tone than as a tactic-altering constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is applied to the wing's blue (paragraph four) and returns in the final line ("quietly explosive with blue"). The trait describes both the wing and the donor heart's ongoing effect. Two beats; the second recurrence reweights the entire story. The adjective pair is specific enough to be irreplaceable and charges the closure image directly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is the stated purpose (paragraph four: "the wing could illuminate something") and the sun's illumination of the wing is the story's physical and conceptual climax. The light-angle experiment would not work without this action. Two beats: setup and execution. The action is causally necessary; swapping it would require rewriting the entire wing sequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tracking sun trails is introduced in paragraph four and executed in paragraphs five and six ("the parallelogram of sunlight slide," "when the light finally touched"). The method shapes her choice of location and timing. Without the rotating basalt and the tracked light, the wing observation fails. The mechanics are signaled early and matter at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The floating tea house on basalt appears in the opening and its rotation is the enabling constraint for the sun-trail experiment. The setting is introduced early, its unique property (rotation) matters causally, and it charges the final image (the mist, the stone). Three beats: arrival, waiting, resolution. The setting is irreplaceable; a static location would not permit the light-angle work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Three months after receiving the donor heart" anchors the timeframe in paragraph two and the "after" state pressures her entire quest. The timeframe does not tighten as a live clock but functions as ongoing condition that motivates the tea-house visit and the letter decision. Two beats: setup and closure. Cost is the enduring foreignness she must integrate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The desire "to learn why some people magnetize stories" is stated in paragraph two, dramatized through the wing experiment, and answered in paragraph seven. The motivation drives her journey to the tea house and her final realization. Friction between envy and understanding creates internal pressure. The letter decision at closure flows directly from this motivation being satisfied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Valley-mist wonder" pervades the opening (mist curling, the floating stone) and modulates through the quiet waiting, the eruption of blue, and the final mist-breath image. Tone remains coherent through turns and charges the closure: "the mist rose around the floating stone like a valley remembering its own breath." The tone shapes every descriptive choice and anchors the ending's resonance.</comment>
