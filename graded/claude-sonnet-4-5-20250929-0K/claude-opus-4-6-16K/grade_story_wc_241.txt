<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is well-developed with concrete embodied contradictions: "hated it" about her advisor's assessment, the monitor conversion to probabilities, the hand twitching detail for the father. The internal conflict between caution and admiration for her father's vitality is consistently dramatized through her actions (mapping scrawls, bringing the notebook to his bedside). The final choice to write "something looser" with "annotated maps" represents earned movement from pure rigor toward measured risk, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt. Minor deduction for the slightly over-articulated "caution was just cowardice with better citations" which edges toward diagnostic self-awareness.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear escalation through the scrawl-mapping sequence. Orientation anchors arrive early (rain, library, father's study/hospital). The closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elena moves from pure statistical rigor to "uncertainty be the point" with the visible cost of remaining only "halfway" committed, acknowledged on the page. The midpoint pivot (showing her father the notebook, his "you're gambling" line) reweights her trajectory. One structural concern: the timeframe compresses three weeks of research into summary rather than dramatized beats, slightly weakening causal texture in the middle third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rainwashed library, hospital monitors, and Green Line subway are vivid and purposeful. The candle lantern's mica pane is handled concretely and charges the final image ("by that partial light she wrote"). Sensory detail is selective: "wet stone and old paper," "rain-streaked glass," "amber uncertainty." The Cambodian grocery, rooftop garden, and barbershop provide texture but remain somewhat catalog-like without micro-choices anchored in those spaces. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The rain and clover recur with thematic purpose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elena can risk uncertainty without her father's recklessness—is signaled early and tightens through the scrawl investigation. The hospital-bed scene where the father says "you're gambling" is a meaningful reversal that reframes her project and forces a stance. The ending shows visible agency: she writes "something looser" with acknowledged margins of error, a measured choice that forecloses pure rigor. The escalation works under the Accumulative lens, though the cost at closure is more conceptual than visceral; "enough" softens the final price slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the lantern's "illumination was partial" image, the contrast between her father's leaps and her caution, and the scrawls as curriculum. "Lucid contradictions" threads through without becoming a thesis statement. The final image—writing by amber uncertainty, going "halfway" with "annotated maps"—answers the thematic question through image rather than statement. The "clover melancholy, sweet and common and close to the ground" risks preciousness but is earned by the low-stakes tenderness of her transformation. No overt moralizing; complexity is preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "theoretically rebellious," "dissent that lived in margins and footnotes," "caution was just cowardice with better citations." POV remains stable throughout with Elena's academic-inflected interiority. The dialogue is sparse and effective: the father's "you're gambling" and Elena's "responsibly" carry subtext and conflict. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer at the hospital bed, more reflective in the library passages). One minor slip: "clover melancholy, sweet and common and close to the ground" feels slightly authorial rather than character-specific, though it's defended by the lyric mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong rhythm variation and vivid specificity ("wet stone and old paper," "invisible cards," "rain kept falling"). Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs. Minor issues: "lucid contradiction" repeats twice in identical phrasing; "widening perspectives" and "wider...dark" create a small echo loop. The opening sentence is strong; the final paragraph achieves resonance. "Clover melancholy, sweet and common and close to the ground" is a lovely line but risks slight overwriting in its explicative tail. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of gambling/probability and academic caution through scrawl-interpretation is specific and non-obvious. The candle lantern as "the most honest object" and the mica pane's "partial illumination" provide fresh thematic anchors. The transformation feels earned rather than sudden. Risk element: the reflective, essayistic mode could feel static, but here it's justified by Elena's character and the conceptual stakes. Minor deduction for the "cryptic scrawls leading to diverse neighborhoods" setup, which echoes familiar epiphany-through-exploration templates; the execution personalizes it enough to avoid pure derivation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout; her choices (mapping scrawls, visiting neighborhoods, showing the notebook to her father, taking the lantern home, writing the guide) create all key turns. The "compulsive gambler's probability professor daughter" identity shapes every beat and constrains her final stance toward measured risk. The cost is visible: she goes "halfway" rather than all in, acknowledging her limits while moving beyond pure rigor.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The candle lantern appears first as static observation ("most honest object"), then is borrowed and taken home, and charges the final image ("by that partial light she wrote"). It appears in three beats with reweighted meaning. The mica pane's translucency/opacity becomes the story's central metaphor for partial illumination. Strong integration, though the middle handling (librarian lending it) is more functional than pressure-laden.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" is the story's engine: her father "understood ruin mathematically and still sprint[ed] toward it," the monitor spike when he laughs registers joy as danger, Elena herself embodies the contradiction between admiration and caution. The concept shapes stakes (can she honor both impulses?) and alters her tactics (annotated maps, going halfway). It's woven into every major beat and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is introduced early with her advisor's assessment, drives her self-recognition ("hated it"), and constrains her final choice to remain partly cautious ("annotated maps," "margins of error"). The trait enables the scrawl-following but prevents full abandon. Visible cost: she remains "careful" even in her loosening. Strong integration, though the attribute could be slightly more dramatized in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Traverse" appears as a repeated scrawl word and becomes the action that structures the middle section. Elena traverses the Green Line route, the neighborhoods, and "the limits of her own understanding." The action redefines her options from pure academic rigor to embodied exploration. The final image shows her "kept riding the Green Line," making traverse an ongoing stance. Indispensable to the plot and thematic arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Interpreting cryptic scrawls is signaled early, detailed in the mapping/cross-referencing beat, and shapes the entire investigation sequence. The method reveals character (she "could not resist a dataset") and enables the transformation from abstraction to embodied particulars. The mechanics matter: seat numbers, stations, translations. The notebook becomes a key object. The method is intrinsic to the escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rainwashed library at midsummer provides the frame and returns at the end ("clover kept growing in the cracks outside the library"). It supplies the candle lantern and serves as the "not the hospital" refuge. Midsummer and rain create atmospheric pressure and anchor the timeframe. The library enables the final writing scene. Solid integration, though the library itself doesn't constrain choices as strongly as the subway or candle lantern; more atmospheric anchor than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the heart attack" frames all action and supplies urgency. The timeframe tightens decisions: Elena returns "every afternoon," the three weeks of scrawl-mapping accelerate her trajectory, the hospital vigil creates the pressure that drives her to act. The father's diminished state and monitor rhythms make the stakes tangible. Time shapes the "now" of her transformation. The ending's present-continuous tense ("kept falling," "kept riding") suggests ongoing resolution within this post-crisis window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To widen perspectives responsibly" is Elena's explicit motivation in dialogue, but it's dramatized earlier through her scrawl-mapping and the visit to unfamiliar neighborhoods. The friction between "widening" (father's reckless openness) and "responsibly" (her caution) generates the central conflict. The final choice—writing with "annotated maps" and "margins of error"—enacts the motivation with visible compromise. The desire is tested, conflicted, and resolved with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" is named explicitly and defined ("sweet and common and close to the ground"), then embodied in the low-stakes tenderness of Elena's transformation. The tone is coherent: reflective, elegiac, gently sad without bitterness. It modulates under pressure (sharper at the hospital, softer in the library) and charges the final image of rain, clover, and riding the Green Line. The explicit naming risks over-instruction, but the tone itself is well-sustained and integrated.</comment>
