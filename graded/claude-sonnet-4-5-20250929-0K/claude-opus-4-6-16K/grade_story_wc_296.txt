<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's guardedness is embodied through posture and micro-choices ("held her staff across her body like a barrier"), and the final choice to hold her staff "loosely at her side" emerges from earned interiority. The mother's voice confession lands with concrete particulars ("I found your father's cruelty") that shift present stance. Internal contradiction is visible when she seeks her mother's confession while knowing mirrors can't show her what's missing, and the unbending/"long-clenched thing" metaphor tracks through the body. Minor: the druid-finder gift feels more told than tested under pressure in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren gains "permission to stop searching," forecloses her compulsive finding, and the vortex stills in response—cost is visible in the renunciation of her defining trait. Causal lens holds: failed unbinding accelerates curse → flesh-eating seed anchors path → innermost circle reveals mother's voice → unbending within her body slows vortex. One meaningful tightening (three failed attempts → vortex acceleration → final confrontation) is sufficient for this length. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by the second paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The vortex functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: Maren must use the carnivorous vine to navigate expanding circles, and spatial choreography (outer rim → innermost circle → wooden wall) tracks cleanly. Sensory specificity is high ("sounds like snapping tendons," "frost that refused to melt") and filtered through druid perception. The vine bridge calcifying into "bone-white wood" charges the final crossing. The cursed lake setting drives the entire stake and enables the retrieval of frozen confessions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding her mother's confession to discover what she's lost) is signaled early and drives all moves. One meaningful tightening: three failed unbinding attempts accelerate the curse, forcing the high-risk seed tactic and inner-circle navigation. Agency is clear: Maren throws the seed, traverses the vine, and the internal unbending slows the vortex. Cost is legible on the page: she renounces her defining gift ("permission to stop searching") and the guarded posture dissolves. The confessional voices provide escalating pressure as she nears the center.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the druid who finds lost things seeks what's unfindable in mirrors, and the resolution is not the mother's confession but permission to stop. The "unbend" motif recurs with shifting weight (failed spell → father's cruelty bending the mother → Maren's clenched spine). The final image (staff held loosely, stilled lake reflection, no longer needing the mirror) offers a resonant answer without thesis statement. The frozen-confession premise integrates cleanly with the finding-lost-things affliction to charge the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited, filtering all perception through Maren's druid lens ("the capacity to stand beside another person without flinching"). Diction remains consistent and elevated without register breaks ("gravitational throat," "warlike serenity"). The mother's disembodied voice shifts to second-person address ("Forgive me") with purpose, maintaining clarity. Perceptual signature is specific: she notices the curse mechanics, the seed's pulse, the vine's growth. No head-hopping. Minor: "each discovery peeled something away" leans slightly abstract, but the closing embodiment recovers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, world, or pressure ("dragging the orchard of dead apple trees into its gravitational throat" does three jobs). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the vortex sequence and slowing at the mother's confession. Figurative language is controlled and voice-consistent ("insects in amber," "fist she had mistaken for her spine"). Minor deduction: "the long-clenched thing, a fist she had mistaken for her spine" stacks two metaphors in apposition where one would suffice, creating slight muddle in a peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of druid-as-finder, frozen confessions in cursed water, and flesh-eating navigation is specific and non-obvious. The "finds lost things" affliction ("each discovery peeled something away") transforms the found-object trope through cost. The mother's confession subverts expectation: the answer isn't the confession itself but permission to stop searching. Risk-taking (carnivorous vine as bridge, disembodied voice) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight deduction: the guarded-druid and cursed-lake frame are familiar fantasy elements; transformation is strong but not fully inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's guardedness shapes early posture (staff as barrier) and the final renunciation (staff held loosely). Her decision to throw the seed and traverse the vortex drives the middle, and the internal unbending choice slows the vortex at closure. Early signal, two distinct beats (seed throw, inner unbending), closure participation, and visible cost (renouncing her finding compulsion).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The seed is handled twice on-page: thrown into vortex (enables navigation) and grows into vine bridge that calcifies at closure. It solves a problem (anchoring path through magical current) tied to established curse mechanics. Early signal (satchel removal), causal pressure (only organism that can root against entropy), and closure linkage (bone-white bridge she walks back across). High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Frozen confessions frame the entire stake: townspeople whispered sins into the lake for a century, creating the curse archive Maren navigates. The confessions thaw as rings cross (man, girl, weeping), escalating pressure. Her mother's confession is the target object, and "confessions, finally heard, dissolved" directly causes vortex resolution. Setup, development (voices louder each ring), and payoff with causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Finds lost things" is established as gift/affliction with cost ("each discovery peeled something away"), motivates the quest (finding mother's voice), and the closure explicitly renounces it ("permission to stop searching"). Early signal, causal pressure (drives the stake), closure linkage. Slight reduction: the finding itself happens mostly off-page in backstory; on-page she navigates rather than "finds" in the active sense until the voice moment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Unbend" appears three times with escalating meaning: failed unbinding spell, mother's confession ("could not unbend what he had bent in me"), and Maren's internal shift ("something unbend there—a long-clenched thing"). The internal unbending directly slows the vortex, redefining the curse resolution from external spell to internal release. Setup (spell), development (mother's use), payoff (Maren's shift causes vortex to slow). High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through expanding circles" is signaled ("working from the vortex's rim toward its center") and its mechanics matter: each ring crossed brings louder voices, escalating confessional pressure. The method structures the entire navigation sequence and determines pacing of revelation. Setup (outer edge), development (each ring louder), payoff (innermost circle where mother's voice waits). Causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The vortex is present throughout, shaping all tactics: Maren must use the vine to navigate it, the spinning trees form obstacles, and its acceleration (from failed spells) raises stakes. The "eye of the vortex" is the confrontation site, and its slowing is the physical closure event tied to internal unbending. Setup (opening image), development (navigation pressure), payoff (slows and settles). Indispensable; story logic fails without it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the magic trick fails" anchors the opening ("failed at sundown") and establishes urgency: three prior attempts accelerated the curse, forcing immediate action. The sundown timing and "within moments" vine growth create forward pressure. However, no ticking clock tightens decisions during the navigation itself; elapsed time during circle-crossing is vague. Setup clear, modest development, present at payoff but not pressing choices there.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation ("to discover what mirrors don't show") is dramatized in opening reflection, tested through the dangerous vortex crossing, and resolved at closure when she "no longer needed it to tell her what she carried." Concrete friction: she seeks her mother's secret but finds permission to stop seeking. Setup (paragraph 3), development (drive into vortex), payoff (discovers she sought the wrong thing). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Warlike serenity" is established in the opening ("vortex churned with warlike serenity, violent in its motion yet eerily calm in its sound") and coheres through the entire navigation: measured choices under high danger, the mother's calm disembodied voice, and Maren's quiet unbending that stills chaos. Tone charges the final image (staff held loosely, stilled lake). Strong modulation without contradiction; the oxymoron proves functional and indispensable.</comment>
