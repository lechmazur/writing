<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is richly textured through embodied perception—the yellow glass filtering stars to amber, her breath fogging the eyepiece—and her spiritual curiosity shapes concrete actions (leaving water offerings, tracking meteors nightly). The choice to withhold data from Dr. Luo demonstrates her hierarchy of values with visible cost: she protects intimacy over recognition. Minor slip: the "flourishing stillness" concept sometimes edges toward label-speak rather than fully dramatized contradiction, but her enacted vulnerability (pressing glass to chest, offering "fragile attention") grounds the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early—Maren's nightly ritual accretes meaning through repeated observation—and delivers closure via Resonant Reconfiguration when she chooses devotion over data. Orientation anchors (tracking station, eleven years, night rotation) land promptly. The meteor's impossible deceleration functions as a decisive pressure point that narrows her choice between reporting and reverence; her response ("The stars were generous") forecloses the path of scientific ambition with felt cost. One micro-turn (the pause in the sky) deepens rather than deflects.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The basalt ridge, iron staircase, observation deck, and control room are woven through action (mopping, climbing, pressing eye to scope) and constrain Maren's nightly ritual. The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting, filtering perception and charging the closure image when she presses it to her chest. Sensory detail—condensation on lenses, fogging eyepiece, trembling amber circle—is filtered through her devotional attention. Minor: occupational systems (telescope mechanisms) remain vague, but at this length the station's atmosphere of abandonment suffices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—intimacy with vastness versus cataloging data—signals early and tightens when the meteor pauses, forcing Maren to choose between camera/logbook and empathetic stillness. Her renunciation (withholding the anomaly from Dr. Luo) forecloses recognition and professional validation with visible cost: "The stars were generous" dismisses his inquiry. The escalation reads clearly under the Accumulative lens: each night's tracking deepens her devotion until the meteor's recognition demands a final stance. One meaningful pressure point suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability as strength, devotion versus data—emerges through concrete particulars: the yellow glass, tap water offerings, matching the meteor's stillness. The closure image (pressing glass to chest, breathing as the station hums with "primal elegance") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether cosmic intimacy requires surrender of proof. No moralizing; the piece trusts the reader to hold the tension between Maren's subjective encounter and Dr. Luo's unanswered anomaly. "Flourishing stillness" is defined through enacted paradox rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering all detail through Maren's devotional attention. Perceptual signature is distinct: stars "filtered through amber," silence "alive the way silence is alive when someone truly listens." Dialogue with Dr. Luo is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext (her pause with mop in hand signals the gap between their worlds). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("primal elegance," "the hush of an overlooked era") that risks detachment from a custodial worker's idiom, though the lyric mode mostly earns it. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift naturally. Information density is high—most lines advance Maren's ritual, the station's abandonment, or the meteor anomaly. Minor scaffold detected: "She called it flourishing stillness" directly labels the concept rather than letting the image do the work, and "carrying her willingness" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward abstract summary. The phrase "as though the universe were lit by firelight" is evocative but borders on stock poetic phrasing. No loops or paraphrase chains; clarity remains strong through the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cosmic-janitor frame avoids the obvious astronomer protagonist, and the yellow lantern glass as personal lens-within-lens offers a fresh inflection on observation. Emotional specificity—empathy as active stillness rather than declaration—transforms the scientist-versus-mystic trope. The meteor's pause and Maren's renunciation feel earned rather than convenient. Risk: the lyric mode and devotional vocabulary ("prayer bowls," "scripture," "firelight cosmos") court sentimentality but mostly land through embodied action. The piece commits fully to its quiet, contemplative premise without hedging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's identity as cosmic janitor frames every beat: mopping, wiping lenses, emptying wastebaskets anchor her routine, and her custodial invisibility enables her nightly tracking without oversight. The role creates the conditions for her private devotion and makes her choice to withhold data from Dr. Luo both possible and costly—she risks nothing professionally because she has no professional standing to lose, yet she forfeits the chance to be seen. Present in setup (paragraph one), shapes middle choices (tracking the anomaly alone), and charges closure (mop in hand when questioned). Specific cost: her labor remains unrecognized, her discovery uncredited.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass appears in beat one (sitting beside her chair), is used actively when she holds it up to filter the meteor's residual light (creating the amber circle and moving shadows), and returns in the closure paragraph pressed to her chest as she breathes, embodying her choice to hold private wonder over public proof. The glass functions as her "lens within the lens," transforming cold cosmos to warm intimacy—an irreplaceable property tied to her devotional method. Setup, middle transformation, closure presence all met; causal role in the peak choice (she uses it to commune rather than record).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Flourishing stillness"—the paradox where emptiness becomes richness—is named explicitly and demonstrated through Maren's practice of matching the meteor's pause with her own fragile attention. It shapes her tactic (offering stillness rather than data capture) and the final image ("the flourishing stillness was there again, waiting in the dark between signals"). Present in setup (paragraph four), drives the peak choice (she "matched its stillness"), and reappears at closure. However, the concept risks remaining more thematic echo than on-page constraint; it describes her experience rather than forcing a trade-off. Mid-band: lyric reprise with cost-adjacent framing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's spiritual curiosity—reading Sufi poetry, leaving water offerings, seeking intimacy over knowledge—enables her nightly tracking and her choice to empathize with the meteor rather than document it. The trait constrains her response: she cannot reach for a camera because her curiosity is devotional, not empirical. Present in setup (paragraph five), visible in the peak beat (choosing to "empathize" and "match its stillness"), and implicit in closure (carrying her "willingness to be small and astonished"). One on-page cost: she forgoes Dr. Luo's validation. Trait-driven choice legible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The verb "empathize" anchors the climactic choice: "She simply sat, allowing the moment its full weight, choosing to empathize with whatever intelligence or accident had produced that pause in the sky." This action—offering attention instead of recording—is irreplaceable; substituting "observe" or "witness" would not carry the same devotional reciprocity. Setup primes it (her desire for intimacy), middle delivers it (matching the meteor's stillness), and closure echoes it (breathing with the station's hum). The act redefines her relationship to the cosmos from cataloger to participant. Swapping it would require substantial rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tracing meteor paths is Maren's nightly method, signaled early ("She tracked falling stars the way a monk traces scripture") and enacted in the peak beat ("followed each trajectory, murmuring coordinates"). The mechanics matter: her practiced attention allows her to notice the anomaly (the meteor that slowed), and her long training in tracing paths teaches her the "particular silence" that validates her choice to empathize rather than report. Present in setup, drives middle recognition, implicit in closure (stars "tracing paths only the vulnerable could read"). Causally active across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tracking station supplies the iron staircase Maren climbs nightly, the observation deck where the choice unfolds, and the instruments that record the anomaly Dr. Luo later questions. Its abandonment (no funding, dust-gathering telescopes, one remaining astronomer) creates the solitude necessary for Maren's private ritual and makes her withholding of data feasible—no oversight, no audit. The station's hum and "primal elegance" charge the closure image. Setup, middle constraint (she is alone to make the choice), closure participation all met. Setting pressures rather than decorates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"The hush of an overlooked era when governments had stopped funding star-watching" frames the entire narrative, establishing the station's abandonment and Maren's invisibility. The timeframe enables her autonomy (no oversight to report the anomaly to) and underscores the stakes: in a neglected age, devotion becomes rebellion. Present in setup (paragraph one), implicit in every beat (Dr. Luo's sparse visits, crumbling infrastructure), and resonant at closure (the station hums despite disuse). However, the era functions more as atmosphere than live clock—no ticking deadline tightens her choice. Mid-band: coherent pressure without tactical urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Maren's desire "to find strength in vulnerability"—to stand exposed beneath immensity and not flinch—is dramatized when the meteor pauses and she chooses fragile attention over protective documentation. The motivation is stated (paragraph five) but enacted in the peak beat: "She offered her own fragile attention as an answer to its fragile light." Friction emerges between her want (cosmic intimacy) and the cost (professional invisibility, Dr. Luo's dismissal). Setup, middle choice driven by this desire, closure affirmation (carrying "willingness to be small and astonished"). The desire forecloses the path of recognition.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Primal elegance" is sustained through diction (basalt ridge, iron staircase, prayer bowls, firelight cosmos) and the interplay of raw immensity with precise ritual. Tone modulates appropriately: reverent during tracking, neutral during Dr. Luo's inquiry, luminous at closure ("the station hummed around her with a primal elegance that had nothing to do with machinery and everything to do with presence"). The phrase appears explicitly only at the end, but the texture—ancient forces met with careful devotion—remains coherent throughout. Tone charges the final image without static monotony.</comment>
