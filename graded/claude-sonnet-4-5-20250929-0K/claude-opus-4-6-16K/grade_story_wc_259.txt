<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lien's motivation to study forbidden memory-fragments is established early and her "steadily unpredictable" nature is shown through action (descending despite Order rules). The interiority during the ampule sequence is concrete and embodied ("chest ache," weeping), but the final transformation—"she would never again be the historian the Order had trained her to be"—feels asserted rather than dramatized through a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path. The internal arc lands as summary of change rather than a decision or renunciation with on-page cost, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates emotional density through repeated ampule openings, and the final image ("tiny sun of anguished joy burning beneath her ribs") reweights the premise with conceptual cost—she becomes the archive, carrying what the Order forbade. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly by the second paragraph. The closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the "forbidden knowledge" is repriced as "love, residual and radiant," and the cost is felt in her irreversible transformation. One meaningful deepening occurs (moving from catalog duty to experiential communion), sufficient for this length, but the cost remains more asserted than viscerally dramatized in a single pivotal beat, preventing entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda frames the story at opening and closure, its light-splitting function echoing the story's thematic work. The archive's tiered descent and the Residuum chamber provide spatial structure that guides Lien's choices (she must go down, handle ampules). The micro-setting of granite table, lantern, and glass ampules constrains her method and charges the closure image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Lien's reverent attention ("ache," "ghost reaching"), and the pagoda's final appearance at dawn subtly mirrors her transformation without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Lien's drive to experience forbidden memory versus the Order's surveillance wards. Her tactic—randomness to evade detection—provides one meaningful tightening that narrows her method and raises tension. The accumulation of ampules (forty-seven) deepens pressure incrementally under the Accumulative lens. However, no on-page reversal or moment of live risk tests her commitment; the wards never activate, and she completes her study unchallenged. The cost ("never again be the historian") is told at the end rather than paid in a dramatized choice, keeping the score in the 7.0–7.5 range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—memory as love that outlasts civilizations—emerges through the particulars of the ampules and Lien's embodied response, not through abstract statement until the final lines. The progression from "atoms of nostalgia" (scientific framing) to "love, residual and radiant" constitutes a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise without overt moralizing. The saffron veil, bronze pagoda, and light-as-color motifs accumulate and shift meaning at closure. The final image ("colors that had no names in any living language") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "she would never again be" edges toward summary rather than leaving the answer fully implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; focalization through Lien is clean with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—scholarly, reverent diction ("compressed joy and sorrow," "irreducible particles"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains credulity for real-time perception under emotional duress: "atoms of nostalgia: irreducible particles of longing encoded in light and mineral salt" reads more like retrospective essay than immediate thought. Psychic distance is controlled, but some filter verbs ("came to think of") and explanatory asides slow immediacy. No dialogue present; single-POV voice is distinct and purposeful but not fully embodied under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings show variety. Information density is high in the archive-descent and ampule sequences. However, multiple prose artifacts accumulate: "steadily unpredictable, a phrase her mentor once used" interrupts flow with a self-conscious aside; "atoms of nostalgia: irreducible particles of longing encoded in light and mineral salt" stacks abstract descriptors in a single breath; the final two paragraphs loop conceptually (transformation asserted twice, colors-without-names echoed). Figurative language is dense but occasionally strained ("gold thread" vapor, "tiny sun...burning beneath her ribs"). Template cadence in the ampule catalog ("She tasted...She felt...Each atom") and minor paraphrase loops ("never again be the historian" / "would carry those atoms") trigger cumulative deductions of approximately −0.8, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—crystallized emotional memories from extinct civilizations—is fresh and integrated with the archive setting and Lien's method. The turn from "forbidden knowledge" to "love" is a purposeful synthesis, not a gimmick. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative design and follows through at closure. Minor derivative note: the scholar-defying-sacred-rules frame and the "what-if-emotions-were-物质" conceit echo familiar SFF templates, though the execution through "randomness as evasion" and the saffron-veil Order adds specificity. Risk-taking in sustained metaphorical density and reflection-heavy design is present, though some choices (extended exposition on the Order's wards, repeated assertions of transformation) hedge toward safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lien is present throughout and her decision to descend drives the story's movement. However, her key choice—to study the ampules despite the Order's prohibition—occurs off-page ("three years figuring out how to study them anyway"). On-page, she enacts a pre-formed plan (opening ampules randomly) without a dramatized turn or moment where she must choose between competing costs. She is the experiencer, not the decider, in the beats that matter most.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda appears in the opening beat (twilight light-splitting) and returns at closure (dawn, "colors that had no names"), providing a lyric frame. However, it is never handled, used, or causally involved in Lien's choices; it remains a static symbolic backdrop. The light-splitting function metaphorically mirrors the story's theme but does not constrain action or alter tactics. Two touches (opening and closing) with thematic resonance but no causal work place it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Atoms of nostalgia" is named, explained, and enacted: the ampules contain "irreducible particles of longing," and Lien's method (avoiding patterns to evade wards) directly engages their nature. The concept shapes her tactics (randomness) and the story's stakes (transformation vs. detection). It is repriced at closure as "love, residual and radiant," reweighting the premise. Present in setup, middle action, and closure; causal pressure and specificity are high. However, the ampules themselves could be re-skinned (e.g., "memory crystals") with minor edits, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" is named early and glossed ("followed rules long enough to learn their shape, then stepped precisely where they were not"), framing Lien's defiance. However, it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost; it remains a label for her general stance rather than a trait that creates friction in a key beat. No moment dramatizes unpredictability forcing a trade-off. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Purify" appears as Lien's "method of analysis...purified the emotional data by avoiding patterns" and again in the summary: "purified memory itself by refusing order." The action is explained and enacted (random sampling to evade wards), and it shapes her middle tactics. However, "purify" is interchangeable with "process" or "analyze" without altering story logic; the randomness mechanic, not the purification framing, does the causal work. Two beats (method description, thematic reprise) but moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By avoiding patterns" is signaled early as the evasion tactic: "Randomness was her discipline. If she approached them systematically, the Order's detection wards would activate." This mechanic directly enables her study and shapes the middle action (chaotic ampule selection). It returns at closure: "purified memory itself by refusing order." Present in setup, constrains middle choices, and charged at the end. However, the wards never activate on-page, so the cost/friction remains hypothetical rather than dramatized, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is named, described in tiered descent, and houses the Residuum chamber where all action occurs. It provides the Residuum ampules that are the story's central objects and pressures Lien's method (depth = danger, wards). The setting is integral to premise and action. However, its specific properties (bronze panels, etched languages, spiraling tiers) are largely ornamental; the story could function in any forbidden vault. Causal role is present but setting details are partly swappable, placing it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the end of innocence" is named as a threshold ("the moment when a historian stopped merely recording the past and began to feel it") and the timeframe is implicit in Lien's single-night descent and forty-seven ampule openings. Twilight-to-dawn bracketing provides temporal structure. However, the phrase functions as thematic label more than active constraint; no ticking clock pressures her choices, and the "end of innocence" is asserted rather than dramatized as a before/after pivot. Present in setup and thematic closure but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lien's desire "to pursue forbidden knowledge" is established early ("her sanctioned duty was to catalog and preserve...But Lien had always been steadily unpredictable") and drives the descent. The motivation is tested through the ampule sequence, where the emotional toll (weeping, carrying "compressed joy and sorrow") represents cost. However, the pursuit itself is frictionless—no on-page obstacle forces her to weigh the cost of continuing versus stopping. The forbidden nature is told more than dramatized through conflict. Setup, middle presence, thematic reprise, but limited friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Anguished joy" is dramatized on-page: "Joy so pure it was anguished, because it belonged to someone who was gone"; "anguished joy burning beneath her ribs"; "love, residual and radiant." The tone is coherent, modulates through the ampule sequence (wonder → grief → transformation), and charges the final image ("colors that had no names"). Not merely asserted but enacted through Lien's embodied responses (weeping, chest ache). The oxymoron is specific to the concept and irreplaceable, present across beats and closure, with strong causal and thematic linkage.</comment>
