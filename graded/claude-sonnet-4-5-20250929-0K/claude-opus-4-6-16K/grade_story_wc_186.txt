<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and embodied—her silence, her retrocognitive touch, her nightly rituals—grounded in sensory particulars (teeth aching, chest hollowed). The final choice to refit the broken prism is earned by cumulative observation and frames a visible foreclosure: she commits fully to her vision despite no external validation. Minor slip: the lens-maker's presence is more atmospheric than a genuine internal contradiction that acts simultaneously in scene. The renunciation of practicality (lighting a beacon no one seeks) carries visible cost and specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Maren's rekindling doesn't summon a ship but proves the intentional pattern she sought, and the trader's child's question crystallizes the cost—meaning made without confirmation, a gamble on hope. Orientation anchors quickly (beacon-tower custodian, Glass Humming Pavilion, post-collapse). The accumulative/textural lens holds: calculations, star-tracking, and pavilion mapping deepen until the final spectrum reweights all prior fragments. One tightening suffices at this length: the prism's fracture becomes advantage. Cost is legible in the line "Not for ships. Not for aircraft. For the argument itself."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Glass Humming Pavilion constrains and charges: its tuned panes mirror constellations, shaping Maren's nightly observations and final choice to align Vega and Arcturus through the prism's crack. The broken prism functions as micro-setting (object-as-constraint) across multiple beats: workbench examination, retrocognitive vision, and beacon assembly. The pavilion's "chord she had never heard" in the climax directly charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is consistent—resonance frequencies, fractured rainbows, oil flame—and filtered through her custodian's expertise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving coincidences have meaning) is signaled early and tightens through star-path tracking to the climactic alignment calculation. Maren's agency is decision and endurance: she climbs the tower "each dusk," maps correlations "too precise to be accident," and fits the broken prism knowing it won't focus cleanly. The final act—lighting the beacon—reweights her isolation into argument, and the trader's course-change provides on-page consequence. One meaningful deepening (the fracture as advantage, not ruin) narrows options under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt: "stubborn, finding root in gravel."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (order within apparent chaos, meaning-making after collapse) emerges from concrete particulars: the lens-maker's two-century-old calculations, the pavilion's sky-tuned panes, the prism's new spectrum. The ending offers a non-literal answer—"the universe stitches its accidents together with intention"—through image (twin beams, singing glass) rather than assertion. The "shard of hush" recurs with escalating pressure, from observation tool to charged metaphor at closure. Subtext operates in silence itself (eleven days, the custodian's solitude) and in the child's question, which validates without explaining. No moralizing; the piece invites ambiguity (is the pattern real or imposed?) without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-limited POV remains stable and apt; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during prism-touch, zooms to child's question at end without head-hopping). Perceptual signature is distinct: Maren notices star paths, pane frequencies, "fractured rainbows...incomplete arcs"—a custodian's calibrated attention. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("thistle-blown, stubborn, finding root in gravel"). Brief figurative density in the opening paragraph ("electrical fevers," "seeds looking for soil") feels pattern-taught and pays off in the closing "seed against her chest." No filter-verb stacks or hedging in peak beats. The trader's child's brief dialogue at the end serves plot without requiring full voice distinction at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, world, or thematic pressure. Rhythm varies naturally with longer meditative sentences (star-path exposition) alternating with short declaratives at the climax ("She struck the match"). Minor pattern slip: "Still, she climbed...Still, she lit" is purposeful parallelism but borders on template cadence; countered by varied syntax elsewhere. One paraphrase loop: "It would not focus cleanly, she knew that" immediately follows the implicit knowledge in "fitted the broken prism back." No metaphor muddle; "thistle-blown, stubborn" is vivid and specific. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge effectively. Clarity remains high throughout; no scaffolding or churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-collapse solitude, retrocognition, architectural acoustics, and celestial navigation feels specific and non-obvious; removing any element breaks the logic. The broken-as-advantage turn (prism's crack enables the alignment) transforms a familiar trope. The custodian-without-ships frame is fresh, and the Glass Humming Pavilion's tuned architecture grounds the metaphysical stake in physical detail. Minor proximity note: "beacon keeper in a dead world" echoes genre conventions, but the star-tracking mechanics and the prism's dual beams offer enough particularity to justify the premise. Risk-taking (extended retrocognitive reflection, minimal dialogue) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Maren's choices drive all key turns: nightly beacon-lighting (establishes routine), mapping the pavilion's star correlations (middle escalation), and refitting the broken prism despite its flaw (climax). Her decision to light the beacon "for the argument itself" crystallizes her stance and alters the trader's path, demonstrating visible consequence. Present across setup, development, and payoff with clear causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost is on-page: she commits to proving meaning without external validation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The broken prism appears in three distinct beats: workbench examination with retrocognitive flood, the realization that its crack can split light differently, and the climactic beacon assembly where it creates twin beams. Its fracture is the story's hinge—what seems ruined becomes advantage when aligned with Vega and Arcturus. The final image (gold and violet beams, singing glass) depends entirely on this object's specific properties. Removing it collapses the plot and theme. High irreplaceability and causal pressure; closure participation is total.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" frames Maren's method ("the fragment of deep quiet where understanding lived before language caught up") and recurs in the closing image ("holding the shard of hush like a seed"). It shapes her approach—silent observation and star-tracking—and charges the final stance. Present in setup and payoff with thematic resonance, but middle development relies more on star paths and the prism than on silence itself. The concept reweights meaning at closure but doesn't constrain a middle choice with visible cost. Solid lyric reprise; eligible for mid-6s under the two-gate allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Retrocognition enables a key on-page action: touching the prism floods Maren with the lens-maker's calculations, which she then applies to align the stars. The trait is demonstrated in scene (not merely labeled) and carries implicit cost—she feels "the pressure of prior moments leaning against her skull." It constrains her method (she must handle old objects) and validates her belief in intentional patterns. Present in setup (definition), middle (prism-touch scene), and payoff (the alignment she calculates depends on retrocognitive knowledge). One clear beat involvement with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Rekindling the beacon is the climactic action that resolves the dominant stake: Maren proves her thesis by creating a new spectrum that sings the pavilion and draws the trader's eye. The entire narrative builds to this moment—star-path tracking, prism examination, alignment calculation. Removing "rekindle" and substituting another action (e.g., "observe," "map") would collapse the proof and the closure. The action is specific (oil, match, lens assembly) and irreplaceable. Present across all three gates with maximum causal pressure and closure centrality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Star-path tracking is signaled early ("mapped which panes hummed at which hour...mirrored the rise of certain constellations"), shapes middle escalation ("correlations too precise to be accident"), and determines the climactic alignment ("Vega and Arcturus would align through the crack"). The method is demonstrated on-page—she charts, calculates, and times the beacon lighting accordingly. Mechanics matter: without the star paths, the prism's fracture has no advantage. Present in setup, development, and payoff. Strong causal pressure and specificity; the exact angle calculation is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Glass Humming Pavilion supplies the essential constraint: its panes are tuned to constellations, enabling Maren's discovery and validating her thesis. It appears in setup (custodian location), development (nightly mapping of pane frequencies), and payoff (the pavilion sings "a chord she had never heard" when the twin beams activate all panes). The setting is not mere backdrop—its acoustic properties are the proof mechanism. Removing it leaves no way to demonstrate that "the universe stitches its accidents together." High irreplaceability and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Post-collapse context is signaled immediately ("cities had burned...billions had thinned") and justifies Maren's solitude and the beacon's obsolescence, sharpening the irony of her fidelity. It recurs in the trader reference and the "dead highway." The timeframe provides thematic weight (hope after ruin) but doesn't tighten a specific decision in the middle—Maren's nightly routine would function similarly in other low-population settings. Present in setup and closure (trader's child as new-world sign) but development involvement is atmospheric rather than constraining. Solid two-gate integration with thematic charge at the end.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is dramatized in scene: "she wanted to prove that coincidences have meaning" drives her nightly climbs, star-chart work, and the prism calculation. Friction appears in the acknowledgment that she works "not to the traders...but to herself"—she pays the cost of isolation to sustain belief. The final beacon-lighting enacts the motivation with visible stakes: she creates proof that alters a stranger's path. Present in setup (thesis statement), development (correlation mapping), and payoff (the argument made in light). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; cost is legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: early melancholy ("silence was the only honest language"), tentative discovery ("fractured rainbows...incomplete arcs"), and culminating hope ("bright and shivering and full of the kind of hope that grows in rough soil, thistle-blown, stubborn"). The "thistle-blown" image recurs in the final paragraph, charging the closure. Tone supports the conceptual arc (despair to stubborn optimism) without flattening into single-note sentiment. The prose maintains this texture across beats, and the pavilion's final chord amplifies it. High coherence and closure charge; unmistakable perceptual signature.</comment>
