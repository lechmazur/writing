<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-specific ("astonished recluse, perpetually startled by the weight of human attention"), with embodied perception filtering the environment. Her choice to stay and repair the oasis emerges from prior causality—the act of witnessing the ghosts' unspoken covenant—and forecloses her flight with felt cost. Minor deduction: the final epiphany ("some silences are meant to be carried") edges toward articulation that could remain more implicit, though it's grounded in the box's weight against her ribs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through contextual clues, recurring imagery (bees, silence, glass-filtered light), and Maren's deepening witness. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she commits to staying and waiting for the bees, forecloses her prior pattern of flight, and the cost is visible in her decision to carry the box's burden. Orientation is clean by ~80 words (who/where/when anchored). One meaningful deepening occurs when she opens the box and the ghosts fade, reweighting her solitude from escape to sanctuary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The stained glass box constrains the closure choice—Maren must open it to release the ghosts—and charges the final image (light pooling "like something living," the box pressed to her ribs). The oasis setting supplies micro-constraints (the seep, the hive frames, the stone shed) that pressure her perception and prime her decision to rebuild. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("mineral seep that left white crusts on the rocks like salt tears"), avoiding catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to witness/receive the unspoken words and thereby accept the covenant's burden. The opening of the box is the single meaningful tightening that narrows options—once she reads, the ghosts fade and she owns their silence. Agency is visible: her choice to sit, open, read, and stay forecloses flight with felt cost (carrying the weight). Coincidence does not resolve; the ghosts' expectation complicates but Maren's witness alone enables closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (the necessity of carrying certain silences rather than fleeing them) emerges from the concrete particulars of the box, the letters, and Maren's shift from "noise of being seen" to "mute eloquence of the moment." The final image—box pressed to ribs, waiting for wild bees—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the ghosts' silent mouthing and the pooled colored light. Minor slip: "some silences are meant to be carried" is slightly more explicit than the image alone would require, though it follows from embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: Maren reads the world through "contextual clues" and "tranquil perception," filtering ruins and light with the precision of someone who has "learned to gaze at broken things." Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Diction remains stable and voice-particular ("she had nearly forgotten the shape of conversation" but "remembered the shape of listening"). Filter verbs ("she could tell," "she realized") appear but feel voice-motivated rather than dulling, fitting her deliberate, interpretive stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at key beats: "She would stay at the oasis. She would repair what she could."). Minor loop: "silence where humming should have been" and later "mute eloquence" circle similar territory without adding pressure. One mild scaffold phrase: "she had learned, since the ghosts became visible, to gaze first and act second" tells what the next beat shows. Overall propulsion is strong, and the closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, visible ghosts, and a solitary witness bound by unspoken covenant feels fresh and earned in hindsight. The stained glass box as reliquary for calcified words is a specific, non-obvious choice. Transformation test: the emotional arc would lose coherence if setting and object changed. Minor deduction: the "ghosts become visible" premise is increasingly common in contemporary SFF markets, and the story does not radically subvert the trope—it executes it well but within familiar guardrails.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren ("astonished recluse") is present throughout and her choice to open the box and then stay at the oasis are key turns. Her reclusive trait constrains her initial stance (fleeing "the noise of other people's eyes") and enables the final decision (accepting the ghosts' silent witness). Setup clear, middle choice (opening the box), and closure (staying) all hinge on this character. Cost is visible: she forecloses flight and accepts burden.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears early ("largest remaining structure"), is handled in two distinct beats (discovery/examination, then opening), and its specific properties (amber/violet glass, lead came, the figure in supplication) constrain Maren's choice—she must open it to release the ghosts. The box charges the closure image (pressed to her chest, "weight of all those words pressing against her ribs"). Irreplaceable: no generic container would carry the same layered resonance of light, covenant, and preserved silence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Tangled covenant" is signaled early (carvings, "a covenant…woven through promises made between the living and the dead") and shapes the stakes: Maren must receive the unspoken words to honor the covenant and free the ghosts. It alters her options—once she understands the covenant, leaving without opening the box becomes untenable. Present in setup, middle choice (opening the box fulfills the covenant), and closure (staying to continue the covenant with the bees/water/earth). Cost is conceptual but legible: she inherits the burden.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is demonstrated on-page: Maren reads contextual clues (husks, silence, carvings) and interprets the ghosts' silent mouthing to infer the covenant. This trait enables the middle choice (she understands what the box demands) and shapes her final stance (waiting "with the patience of someone who had learned to gaze at broken things"). Mild penalty: the trait is slightly more told ("tranquilly perceptive") than shown in a moment of visible tradeoff, though her perceptual method does constrain her approach throughout.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Gaze" is the method by which Maren apprehends the world and drives the major turns: she "learned…to gaze first and act second," gazes at the box before opening it, and her final stance is to "gaze at broken things until their meaning surfaced." The action is irreplaceable—substituting "look" or "observe" would lose the specific, contemplative patience that defines her and shapes the closure. Present in setup, middle (gazing precedes the box-opening choice), and ending image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is the method Maren uses to discover the bees' death, the community's history, and the covenant's terms. It shapes her attempts: she reads carvings, interprets the ghosts' mouthing, and pieces together the letters' meaning. The method is signaled early ("Maren discovered this through contextual clues") and recurs across beats, constraining her to patient interpretation rather than direct knowledge. It charges the ending: her decision to wait for wild bees extends the same observational patience.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "abandoned beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland" pressures Maren's choice by offering a place to rebuild (the seep still flows) while embodying loss (desiccated husks, warped frames). The setting supplies the covenant's physical traces (carvings, hive boxes, the stone shed) that enable her discovery. It charges the closure: staying to repair and wait for wild bees is only possible because the oasis, though damaged, retains minimal resources. Swappability test: a generic ruin would not carry the bee/covenant/water resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"After ghosts become visible" (seven months post-phenomenon) anchors the premise and explains Maren's walking and the ghosts' presence. The timeframe does not impose a live countdown but does tighten her stakes: the ghosts near her home carried "faces she recognized" with unbearable silence, forcing her outward. The timeframe is present in setup and enables the middle choice (ghosts are why she encounters the covenant). Mild penalty: no clock pressure at closure; time functions as backstory enabler more than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of unspoken words" motivates the ghosts' vigil and, by extension, Maren's final choice to carry that weight forward. The motivation is dramatized: the ghosts lean close with "concentrated expectation," and Maren's reading fulfills their need. Friction emerges between her prior want (escape from being seen) and the cost of witness (accepting the burden of others' silences). Present in setup (ghosts' motivation inferred), middle (her choice to read enacts it), and closure (she accepts the ongoing preservation by staying).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" is coherent throughout: the ghosts never speak, yet their silent mouthing and fading "loosening from urgency into…peace" carries meaning; Maren's witness requires "no sound, only witness." Tone modulates with pressure—quiet at discovery, intimate at the box-opening, resolute at closure—and charges the final image (her waiting "with the patience of someone who had learned to gaze"). The tone is irreplaceable: substituting explicit dialogue or loud catharsis would break the story's logic.</comment>
