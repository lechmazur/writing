<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's profession and obsession are established, but her interiority remains largely decorative rather than contradictory. The piece shows her observing and translating emotions rather than wrestling with conflicting impulses under pressure. The final act of "harvesting" memories feels procedurally observed rather than earned through a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in gestures like "smiled the way she always smiled—like someone attending a funeral for a season she'd loved," but peak moments lean toward poetic description rather than dramatized internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when clearly within the opening. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Maren follows seeds, discovers the geode's function, transliterates vanishing paths, and carries them home. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where she walks "a path that existed because she remembered it," reweighting the premise with felt cost—"everything she saved would someday need saving again." One tightening occurs when the crater glass blooms missing roads and she understands paths fade when unspoken. Causality is clean but the cost at closure, while present, relies on lyric assertion more than dramatized forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The geode interior is vividly rendered with amethyst, citrine, and smoky quartz throwing phantom light. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "air tasted faintly of ozone and old honey." The seeds function as micro-setting, guiding Maren's path and dissolving as she works, constraining her time and charging the urgency. The geode's iridescent walls participate in the transliteration process, making environment integral to the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover why some paths disappear"—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren realizes the seeds are sinking and she must work quickly. The protagonist's agency is present in her choice to harvest and carry the memories home, but the escalation operates more through accumulation of discovery than through a trade-off that narrows live options. The cost is felt ("everything she saved would someday need saving again") but arrives as reflection rather than a renunciation that forecloses a prior path. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres and the cadence shift at the end reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: paths exist only as long as someone remembers the feeling of walking them. The crater glass and geode function as memory organs without overt symbolism. The final image—"walking toward the shore, following a path that existed because she remembered it, carrying the missing pieces home"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The piece avoids thematic echo; Maren's realization ("the paths disappeared because the emotions that sustained them had gone unspoken too long") arises from her work with the glass and is embodied in the urgency to transcribe before the seeds dissolve. Subtext operates in silence and image: "cheerful resignation," "laughter shaped like a circle with its center removed."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Maren's perceptual signature: "ash-colored tenderness, the pitch of a door closing for the last time." Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the transliteration and breathing in transit. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated; "sea-foam recollectionist" and "transliteration" anchor the register without anachronism. No head-hopping. The prose reflects Maren's observational lens throughout, and the closing line's rhythm—"relief shaped like a horizon, sorrow bright as nacre, and joy threaded through with the knowledge"—elevates without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual texture. Information density is high: most lines advance setting, character, or concept. Minor overwriting appears in figurative clusters ("phantom light," "rainbows," "iridescence") that occasionally stack without incremental pressure, but they remain legible and voice-consistent. One paraphrase loop near the middle: "roads appeared and then dissolved, each one a route that had once connected two places now separated by amnesia" restates the premise without adding pressure. No filter-verb stacks or scaffold loops touch the closure beat. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of emotional archaeology, memory as physical substrate, and the agency of attention feels fresh and specific. "Sea-foam recollectionist" and "transliterates emotions" avoid stock occupations. The hinge—paths vanish when their feelings go unspoken—offers a non-obvious moral calculus. The migrating bird's seeds as coordinates and the geode as memory organ are imaginative anchors. Risk-taking is present in the lyric density and the quiet ending, which trusts image over declaration. The piece transforms the "memory quest" template through specificity of method and voice, avoiding the explain-everything ending.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout. Setup: she is named and profession established in paragraph one. Development: her choice to follow seeds, press the glass to crystals, and transliterate urgently under time pressure. Closure: she walks home carrying the missing pieces, embodying the concept. Two beats (discovery, harvesting) show her agency. Causal pressure is moderate; her decisions enable the work but do not face a trade-off that alters tactics. Cost is lyric rather than dramatized forfeiture. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, cost oblique −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Crater glass appears early (paragraph four), is pressed to crystal faces repeatedly in the transliteration scene, and anchors the mechanism by which missing roads bloom. Setup clear, development shows evolving use (absorbs light, converts to images, warms in her hands), closure participates (she uses it to harvest every vanished road). Three beats: discovery, first press, repeated harvesting. Causal pressure: the glass enables the transliteration, constraining method. Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.0, specificity +0.5. Not indispensable—another artifact could serve—so cap below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" frames the inciting question (why some memories stop mid-sequence), shapes the stakes (paths erased from the world's record), and anchors the closure action (carrying the missing pieces home). Setup in paragraph two, development when the glass shows roads ending in "nothing," payoff in the final line. The concept alters tactics: Maren must work quickly because the gaps are closing. Three beats, causal pressure narrows options, closure directly named. Early +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal +1.4, closure +1.5, cost +0.4, specificity +0.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Transliterates emotions" is established early (paragraph two: "grief into color, joy into texture, longing into sound") and enacted repeatedly in the geode ("ash-colored tenderness, the pitch of a door closing"). Setup clear, development shows the skill under time pressure, closure implies the wax tablets will preserve what she translated. Two beats (foam work backstory, geode transliteration). The trait enables her work but does not impose a visible cost or constrain a choice beyond method. Early +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal +0.8, closure +0.8, swappable (another method could serve) −0.5, cost generic −0.2. Cap at high 6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Conjecture" is named twice: in the opening ("with the cheerful resignation of someone who finds exactly the answer she feared") and explicitly ("letting conjecture guide her where evidence could not"). Development: she uses educated guesses to fill gaps in the transliteration. The action shapes one turn (understanding paths fade when emotions go unspoken) but is not the sole driver; observation and transliteration do equal work. Setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal +0.6, closure linked (incomplete records) +0.8, swappable −0.6 (interpretation or inference could replace it). Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Seeds appear in paragraph three ("scattered seeds dropped by a migrating bird") and guide Maren from coast to geode. Setup clear, development provides the trail, closure moment when seeds sink into the floor, adding urgency. Two beats (trail, dissolution). The method matters: without the seeds, she does not reach the geode. Early +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal +1.1, closure +0.9, specificity +0.6, but the bird's motivation is conjectured, not dramatized, so swappable −0.4. Late first appearance −0.0 (paragraph three is early enough at this length).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Geode interior is established in paragraph three and anchors the entire middle sequence. Setup vivid, development: the crystal faces enable transliteration by refracting light that the crater glass absorbs, and the quartz echoes her voice into new colors. Closure: "the geode caught the sound and scattered it into violet." Three beats (entry, transliteration mechanics, final echo). Environment constrains method and charges the ending. Early +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal +1.3, closure +1.2, specificity +0.7, micro-setting qualifies. Not fully indispensable (another memory site could serve) so cap shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Before memory fades" titles the urgency and is dramatized when seeds sink and Maren realizes she has "arrived before memory faded entirely, but only just." Setup in opening framing, development when she must work quickly, closure implicit (she exits in time). Two beats. The timeframe tightens tactics and adds felt pressure. Early +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal +1.0, closure +0.9, cost +0.4, but the clock is not tracked with precision (no on-page countdown), so cap mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is established in paragraph two ("her obsession now, the question that tugged her inland") and pursued throughout. Setup clear, development drives her to follow seeds and transliterate, closure delivers the answer and she carries the work home. Three beats (inciting obsession, discovery, completion). The desire is dramatized in action and tested by time pressure. Early +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.1, cost +0.5. Not indispensable (another motive could frame the quest) so cap below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Cheerful gloom" is embodied in the opening smile ("like someone attending a funeral for a season she'd loved") and the closing transliteration ("relief shaped like a horizon, sorrow bright as nacre, and joy threaded through"). Tone modulates coherently across discovery and urgency without flatlining. Setup in first line, closure reprise charges the final image. Two touches, lyric coherence. Early +0.8, closure +1.1, tone shift +0.5, specificity +0.6, but static mid-beats (description without tonal friction) and swappable phrasing −0.6. Mid-6s.</comment>
