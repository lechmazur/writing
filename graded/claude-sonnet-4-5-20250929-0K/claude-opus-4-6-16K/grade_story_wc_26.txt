<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is concrete and rooted in personal loss (Maren's dissolution into collective dream-sharing), creating a consistent throughline. Her micro-choices—pressing the river stone, writing in longhand, refusing to share as a dream—embody her stance against erosion with visible cost. The final sentence "The shadow is unbound, but I am not" crystallizes her renunciation with felt weight. Minor slip: the daughter's arc is told rather than dramatized, slightly weakening the emotional scaffolding for Lira's present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds density through the shadow-migration research, Maren's backstory, and the recurring stone/notebook motifs, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Lira's final act of private observation forecloses collective sharing with visible cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the orphaned shadow in the Berlin footage confirms her thesis, tightening her resolve. The closure image—shadow rising, stone gripped, notebook closed—reweights prior material with undeniable pressure and felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The blooming library at 40,000 feet is vivid and purpose-driven: altitude isolation mirrors Lira's solitary stance, UV-fed flowers charge the atmosphere, and the archive room's cloud-glass wall enables her method. The river stone functions as micro-setting, constraining her final choice (physical anchor vs. shareable dream). Spatial choreography is coherent. The setting participates directly in the closure image when the eastern wall's shadow unbinds, validating her observation and charging her refusal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving autonomous hope against collective dilution. Pressure coheres through the video evidence, Maren's loss, and the real-time shadow unbinding outside. The Berlin footage discovery (orphaned shadow) deepens the tightening by confirming the phenomenon is accelerating. Agency manifests as renunciation: Lira's decision to leave physical notebooks rather than share forecloses the collective path with visible cost (isolation, potential obscurity). One micro turn (the final shadow rising) crystallizes her stance. Cost is legible: she chooses solitude and material permanence over connection and reach.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—autonomy versus collective dissolution—emerges through concrete particulars (video pairings, Maren's metamorphosis, the river stone) without overt statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the shadow unbinds, but Lira does not, reweighting prior material through her bodily refusal. Subtext operates in silence and image (stone pressed, notebook closed softly). The thematic question is inextricable from character goal. Minor point: "luminous regret" in the penultimate paragraph borders on abstract poetic summary, though it recovers through the following action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; perceptual signature (sharp-eyed dusk watcher, archive researcher) is distinct and consistent. Diction is controlled—"softly deliberate," "unbinding," "luminous regret"—with rhythm modulating appropriately. No head-hopping. Minor register drift: phrases like "metamorphosed into public content" and "consensus reality" lean corporate/academic, slightly outside the lyric texture established elsewhere. The final beat's cadence ("softly, deliberately") echoes the library's page-turning, charging closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density; sentence openings vary, rhythm accelerates and breathes with scene needs. Figurative language ("petals of a lotus made from glass," "shadows...drifted like smoke") is coherent and purposeful. Minor loop: "softly, deliberately" (final line) echoes "softly deliberate" (library description), though this reads as intentional closure motif. One template stem run: "She had watched / She had spent / She held / She pressed / She recorded" clusters filter-adjacent interiority in the middle third, slightly dulling immediacy. No causality breaks; clarity remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The premise—shadows migrating as correlate to collective dream-sharing—synthesizes speculative concept with emotional specificity (Maren's loss, Lira's archive devotion) in a non-obvious way. The floating library and silent-video method are fresh, world-grounded inflections. Risk-taking (lyric accumulative structure, high abstraction balanced by concrete stone/notebook) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The final image feels inevitable in hindsight yet avoids predictability. No close echoes of template plots; transformation of "dreams vs. reality" trope is thorough and conceptually integrated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's sharp-eyed observation drives the video research (mid-story beat), the Berlin discovery (tightening), and the final choice to write rather than share (closure). Her noticing is not passive; it structures her tactics and forecloses the collective path with visible cost. Present across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The river stone appears in two beats: mid-story as physical anchor and at closure when Lira grips it tighter while writing the final sentence. It seeds early (Montana footage context) and reprises with reweighted meaning (tactile refusal of dream-sharing). Functional across beats but not indispensable—another physical object could serve similar symbolic work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The unbound shadow is the core concept that shapes stakes (hope detaching from dreamers), drives the research method (video comparisons), and delivers the closure image (shadow rising, Lira refusing to unbind). It appears in setup (phenomenon named), development (Berlin orphaned shadow), and payoff (eastern wall shadow). Removing it would collapse the story's logic and thematic weight. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" describes both the library's page-turning and Lira's final actions (closing the notebook "softly, deliberately"). It shapes the closure cadence and reflects her methodical stance. Setup and payoff present, but middle development is weak—the trait is observed more than it constrains a choice under pressure. Lyric reprise reweights the stake slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" describes Maren's transformation from private ambition to public content, establishing the stakes and motivating Lira's mission. It appears in setup (Maren's arc) and charges the thematic question but does not drive an on-page turn. Swappable with "dissolved" or "diffused" without major structural loss. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Comparing silent video footage is Lira's method, signaled early (archive room, Kyoto/Lagos/Montana pairings) and used in the Berlin discovery that tightens her resolve. It shapes her research tactics and validates the phenomenon at closure (orphaned shadow). Present across setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure. Removing it would require a different proof mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blooming library supplies isolation (altitude), the archive room (video method), and the eastern wall (final shadow unbinding). It pressures Lira's choice by enforcing solitude and providing the physical space for non-shareable work. Present across all three gates and constrains tactics. Strong integration, though a different isolated setting could serve with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The post-dream-sharing timeframe establishes the world rule (collective sleep dilutes individual hope), motivates Lira's resistance, and provides the contrast (physical vs. shared). It appears in setup (Maren at twelve/sixteen, library floating after dreams became public) and shapes the stakes throughout. Removing it would flatten the central conflict. Essential context with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Preserving hope's shape is Lira's explicit motivation, dramatized through her archive work, Maren's loss, and the final refusal to share. It drives the video research, the Berlin discovery, and the closure choice (writing in longhand, holding the stone). Present in setup, development, and payoff with visible cost (isolation). Friction between want (preserve) and cost (solitude) is legible and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Luminous regret permeates the narration—"bright as the altitude, heavy as the stone"—and modulates appropriately (observational calm → discovery urgency → closure resolve). It charges the final image when Lira watches the last light "become something she could not share and did not want to." Coherent through turns; the tone is the lens through which every beat is filtered. Strong integration with closure effect.</comment>
