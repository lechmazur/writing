<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority shows texture through embodied sensory detail (vibrations through bones, peripheral awareness) and her internal conflict between preservation and openness emerges through micro-choices during consecration. The prophet is more thinly sketched but serves his function. The final turn—"it felt wide enough for company"—lands as earned through her stance crystallization, though the emotional shift could be more viscerally contradictory in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lira's "wide enough for company" reweights her solitary line-walker identity with undeniable pressure, forecloses isolation, and the kinetic parapet's hum beneath their feet charges the final image with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when promptly. The causal lens holds: consecration → conjured clearings → prophet's careful speech → Lira's openness, each move narrowing tactical options. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion, sand columns, and kinetic parapet constrain Lira's consecration tactics (spiral patterns, peripheral sensing) and the parapet's vibration charges the closure image. Sensory detail (humming, heat, vibrations) is vivid and filtered through Lira's professional lens. Spatial choreography remains clear across beats. The setting functions more than decoratively, though micro-setting depth (stylus, mask) could press harder on a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve old voices alongside prophecy—is signaled early and tightens when the prophet arrives early, forcing Lira to trust her clearings under live pressure. The prophet's decision to "speak carefully" is the turn, driven by Lira's visible consecration work, narrowing his tactical approach and averting the flood she feared. The cost is conceptual (mutual constraint) and legible in the final parapet hum and shared ground.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—accumulation over erasure, coexistence over dominance—emerges from the kinetic parapet paradox and clearings without thesis statement. The final image ("wide enough for company") offers a non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting Lira's solitary discipline with resonant particulars (two standing, old voices settling curious). Subtext operates in the prophet's "strangely honest" observation and Lira's "I walk the line itself." No moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: "peripheral awareness," "heat from a distant fire," sensory bias toward vibration and murmuring. Dialogue carries subtext ("Most line walkers choose sides") and goal pursuit. Distance modulates purposefully at the prophet's arrival. Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt the old voices," "sensed him studying") slightly dulls immediacy in peak beats but does not obscure focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Information density is high (consecration mechanics, parapet function, clearings). Slight overwriting in figurative density: "startle like birds," "heat from distant fire," "cupped hands holding water" cluster without strict necessity. One synonym loop: "murmuring" recurs decoratively in non-peak beats. No major scaffold or causality obscuring; propulsion holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet—movement above anchoring memory below—is a fresh, specific inversion of the usual preservation-as-stasis trope. "Line walker" and "conjured clearings" synthesize world-building and metaphor without stock fantasy tropes. The prophet's youth and collaborative stance avoid genre cliché. Transformation test passes: swapping names/places would lose the sand-column murmur and peripheral-awareness mechanics. Risk (elliptical ending, conceptual stakes) heightens without obscuring.</comment>
