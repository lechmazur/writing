<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sable's interior world is concrete and contradictory—her eleven-year silence is "not empty but raveling," and her weaving is "stoically sparkling" with "relentless clarity of refusal to stop," embodying both grief and purpose. The closure choice (looking up when Lien appears) feels earned by the sustained weaving work, though the final beat could show more micro-hesitation to dramatize the cost of reversing the silence. Minor: Lien's interiority receives only summary treatment ("thin and travel-worn"), limiting relationship pressure in the reunion.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the story builds pressure through seasonal accretion, the growing tapestry, and amber-bead placement, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis reversing into reunion). Orientation anchors (Sable, orchard, eleven-year gap) land within the opening paragraph. The closure unit—"the raveling silence between them reversed itself, threads gathering inward"—delivers visible cost (eleven years spent, the physical and emotional expenditure) and reconfigures the dominant stake. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lien appears holding the jigsaw scrap, narrowing the question from "will the message reach her?" to "what happens when it does?"</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The orchard and bamboo forest constrain Sable's isolation (three-hour walk to town) and supply materials (wild pears, sap, bamboo frame) that enable the weaving. The amber beads function as micro-setting, charging the final image when Lien reads them by touch. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "moss so thick it swallowed sound," "stream that tasted of iron and patience." The clearing becomes the reunion's spatial anchor, fulfilling the 9+ gate for environment shaping the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—carrying a message across impossible distance—is signaled in paragraph three and sustains pressure through the protagonist's unilateral weaving. One meaningful tightening: Lien's arrival with the jigsaw scrap reverses the one-way effort into mutual recognition, forecloses the path of solitary endurance, and makes the reunion's cost (eleven years, "latent sacrifice") undeniable. Agency is weaving and bead placement; the resolution is earned by Sable's persistence, not coincidence (the trader chain is backstory setup, not solve-button).</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—connection across imposed separation—emerges from the weaving's mechanics (mismatched puzzle pieces as bricolage, amber beads as encoded language) without thesis statements. The final image, Lien reading the beads by touch, offers a non-literal answer: communication persists through transformed materials and "the act itself was the message." Subtext operates in the silent reunion and the reversal of "raveling" to "reweaving." The piece resists the temptation to articulate reunion dialogue, trusting the amber code and bamboo music to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Single-POV third-person limited holds stable throughout; psychic distance tightens during weaving beats ("she assigned meaning to their placement") and opens for seasonal summary without head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Sable notices textile mechanics (heddle eyes, reed slots) and encodes grief into spatial patterns. Diction choices—"raveling," "stoically sparkling," "hush of time's unraveling"—recur with shifting weight, charging the final reversal. No dialogue appears on the page, so those bullets are not applicable; the prose itself carries voice through syntactic control and textile vocabulary.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Information density is high: "She wove for months, stoically sparkling in the way of someone who has chosen purpose over grief" does triple work (time, trait, motivation). Figurative language—"raveling silence," "threads gathering inward"—recurs with escalating pressure and pays off at closure without muddle. Minor loop: "She wove anyway. The act itself was the message" in paragraph eight closely paraphrases the prior line's meaning without added pressure (−0.2). Rhythm varies purposefully, slowing for seasonal summary and tightening for the reunion beat.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>8.5</grade>
<comment>The jigsaw-puzzle weaving is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that transforms the reunion premise: the mismatched edges and fragmented images literalize displacement and bricolage under constraint. The amber-bead code and the trader chain (rather than letter or digital message) avoid the conveniences of modern communication. The ending earns its quiet register through eleven years of on-page weaving and refusal to state reunion dialogue. Risk: the accumulative structure and silent closure could have faltered, but both hold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sable's choices—returning to the orchard, buying the puzzle box, assigning bead meanings, continuing to weave—drive all major beats and the closure. "Wistful" reads as accurate label for her sustained hope against impossibility. She appears in setup, middle weaving, and the final look-up that accepts reunion. Her agency is consistent and causal throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.9</grade>
<comment>The amber beads appear in setup (collected from sap), middle (pressed into weave with assigned meanings: "a bead at the left margin meant I am alive"), and closure (Lien reads them by touch, decoding the message). Their materiality (tree sap hardened) and semiotics (spatial code) are irreplaceable; no other object could encode the message this way. They charge the final reunion image directly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"Raveling silence" is introduced in the opening line, constrains Sable's isolation (she has "not spoken in eleven years"), and reverses at closure: "the raveling silence between them reversed itself, threads gathering inward." It shapes stakes (maintaining versus breaking silence) and the final image. The concept is specific enough (textile metaphor for unraveling) to matter structurally.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>"Stoically sparkling" appears once in paragraph seven: "She wove for months, stoically sparkling in the way of someone who has chosen purpose over grief, whose eyes catch light not from joy but from the relentless clarity of refusal to stop." It characterizes her endurance and recurs implicitly in the amber beads' sparkling at closure, but the phrase itself does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Mostly label, lightly embodied.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>"Recommence" appears in paragraph six: "she began to recommence her work" after the loom broke. The action redefines her grief response and enables all subsequent beats (building the frame, weaving, bead placement). The closure depends on this restart. Swapping "recommence" for "begin again" would dilute the specific return-to-purpose connotation, but the verb's uniqueness is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The jigsaw puzzle edges are introduced in paragraph five (rummage sale), their mechanics explained in six ("fitted the cardboard teeth together into long strips, then wove those strips through a frame"), and they appear in the closure scrap Lien carries. The method is irreplaceable: the interlocking curves enable weaving without a loom, and the fragmented images literalize displacement. Signaled early, used in the weaving middle, and present at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The orchard supplies amber sap (beads) and wild pears (sustenance), the bamboo provides frame material and "hollow music," and the isolation (three hours to town) enforces Sable's solitary work. The clearing is the reunion's spatial anchor. The setting pressures choices and provides resources across all beats, reaching closure when "the bamboo knocked its hollow music around them."</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>"Through the hush of time's unraveling" appears in paragraph eight and frames the passage of seasons; earlier, "She wove for months" and "season folding into season" track duration. The timeframe signals the endurance cost and the latent sacrifice, shaping the weight of the reunion. It does not tighten a decision clock but charges the closure by accumulation, fitting the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The motivation—"carry a message across impossible distance"—is dramatized in paragraph three (failed letters, messengers, radio, bribes) and sustained through weaving, bead placement, and the "latent sacrifice" of daily expenditure. Friction appears in the acknowledgment "the tapestry might never reach Lien," yet she weaves anyway. The reunion pays off the motivation with visible cost (eleven years). Present in setup, middle tactics, and closure payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>"Latent sacrifice" is named in paragraph eight and operationalized throughout: "not the grand gesture of martyrdom but the slow, daily expenditure of life on a task whose success she would likely never witness." The tone remains consistent—quiet, patient, accumulative—and modulates subtly when Lien appears ("Neither spoke"), charging the final image without breaking the established register.</comment>
