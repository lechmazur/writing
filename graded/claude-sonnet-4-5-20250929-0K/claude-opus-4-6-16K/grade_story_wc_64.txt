<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot's interior life is concrete and distinctive—her blitheness toward death reads as lived proximity rather than quirk. The motivation to "discover the shape of intentions" drives coherent micro-choices (bringing items to the silo, cross-referencing threads to chess moves). Her final decision to carry the case toward the eastern wall feels earned by accumulated pressure. Minor: the interiority occasionally edges toward elevated diction ("uncharted echoes," "velveteen gloom") that risks distancing the reader from embodied experience, though it stays within acceptable voice boundaries.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure unit is Charged Poise—Margot's walk toward the eastern wall with the decoded message crystallizes the dead man's forty-year seed and reconfigures the story's temporal stakes without resolving the outcome on the page. Orientation is clear (who, where, when anchored by paragraph two). One meaningful deepening occurs when the tapestry threads spell Clara's name and coordinates, reweighting Edmund's burial as intentional communication. Cost is felt: Margot carries a message she cannot yet verify, embodying the risk of forty years' patience. The lens holds cleanly through the accumulative decoding sequence to the charged final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt silo functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: its decommissioned isolation and starlit opening create a liminal space for the decoding work, and the "blue throat" image recurs to anchor the final look upward. Sensory details are selective and purposeful—stained concrete, moth-eaten velvet, frayed threads—and filtered through Margot's gardener's attention to texture and decay. The cemetery geography (Edmund's grave, Clara's separate plot, the eastern wall utility shed) provides spatial stakes that drive the final move. The silo's "outside of time" quality directly supports the thematic work of seeds blooming after forty years.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: What did Edmund Voss intend with the buried message? Pressure accumulates through the decoding sequence, with each knot-to-square correspondence narrowing possibilities until the name Clara and the coordinates emerge. The tightening is meaningful—discovering the message is aimed at a future solver, not the present—and the cost is legible: Margot must now act on incomplete knowledge three weeks hence. Agency is clear in her decision to climb out and carry the case toward the coordinates. One quibble: the chess game's "expiration" framing at the opening doesn't directly tighten the decoding stakes, functioning more as atmospheric setup than pressure lever.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of intentionality across time emerges organically from the tapestry-chess correspondence and Edmund's forty-year-buried message. The final image—"some seeds take forty years to bloom"—reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to the question of what shapes intentions. Margot's gardener identity braids occupation and theme without forcing the metaphor. The piece resists tidy closure: Clara and Edmund's separate graves, the utility shed coordinates, and the未来date leave ambiguity charged with purpose. Minor: "grief and curiosity had always felt, to her, like the same thing wearing different faces" edges toward explicit thematic statement, though it stays character-bound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Margot with a distinct perceptual signature: gardener's attention to flowering, soil settling, frayed threads. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with occasional elevated constructions ("velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes") that read as narratorial texture rather than Margot's direct thought—acceptable in third-person but creating slight psychic distance at peak moments. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. The prose modulates well under pressure: the decoding sequence tightens syntax, the final paragraph opens into longer rhythm. Filter use is minimal and voice-appropriate. One slip: "constituency" feels slightly elevated for the established register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and auditory momentum. Information density is high—most lines advance decoding, character, or thematic resonance. Clarity is strong with no causality breaks. However, several figurative clusters in mid-pressure beats risk overwriting: "dissolving into silence...like a stone dropped into deep water," "soil settles after rain," "velveteen gloom...soft and heavy as mourning cloth" stack metaphors without distinct causal work. "Uncharted echoes" as a phrase for the chess notation feels abstract and under-dramatized. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess notation, tapestry encoding, and cemetery gardening offers a specific, non-obvious frame. The choice to set the decoding in a decommissioned cobalt silo and link it to a forty-year burial cycle feels fresh and internally coherent. Edmund and Clara's separate graves add a non-generic complication. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. Minor: the "blithe about death...from proximity" framing and the gardener-as-tender metaphor risk familiar territory, though the execution particularizes them. The coordinates-and-future-date structure is solidly executed but not transformative. Risk-taking in structure and tone elevates without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Margot is present throughout and makes the key decision to decode the threads and carry the case to the coordinates. Her blithe quality shapes her ease with the dead and her patience with the forty-year puzzle. However, "blithe" as a trait is asserted more than it constrains on-page choices—her decoding work and final walk would function identically if she were melancholic or obsessive. Setup clear, closure participation clear, but causal necessity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sovereign case appears in the frost-heaved discovery, holds the three elements (coins, notation, tapestry), is opened and examined in the silo, and is closed and carried in the final beat. It functions as the physical container that unifies the puzzle and is handled across at least three distinct beats. Its brass clasp and velvet lining charge the "tenderly organized" trait. Removing it would require restructuring the discovery and portability of the message. Strong setup, middle use, and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" is named once as a descriptor for the chess notation's encoded meanings but does not materially constrain tactics or shape on-page decisions. The concept gestures toward theme (communication across time) but remains abstract—Margot decodes threads and chess moves; "echoes" does not alter her method or the stakes. Functional but replaceable with "hidden meanings" or "encrypted signals" without structural loss. Present but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" appears in the description of the sovereign case's velvet compartments and implicitly colors Edmund's care in encoding the message. It primes the reader's sense of Edmund's intentionality but does not constrain an on-page choice by Margot—she would decode the threads regardless of their organizational care. Setup clear, thematic accent present, but no visible tradeoff or middle beat where tenderness alters tactics. Lyric resonance without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Untangle" governs the central action: Margot untangles Edmund's purpose by decoding the threads. The verb structures her goal and the method (knot-by-knot correspondence). The final revelation of Clara's name and coordinates is the fruit of untangling. However, "decode" or "decipher" could substitute with only minor lexical edits—the specificity of "untangle" adds texture but is not mechanically indispensable. Strong setup, drives two beats (decoding, revelation), shapes closure, but modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method is introduced early (frayed threads, knot sequences, color shifts), demonstrated in the decoding sequence where each knot maps to a square and each shift to a piece, and pays off when the final sequence spells Clara's name and coordinates. The mechanics matter: without the thread-to-chess correspondence, Margot cannot solve the puzzle. The method shapes her tactics (cross-referencing notation to threads) and the story's central pressure. Setup, development, and closure all hinge on this exact method. High causal necessity and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cobalt silo provides the isolation and "outside of time" quality necessary for the night decoding work. Its curved walls, blue stain, and open roof hatch create a distinct spatial signature that charges the final look upward at stars. The silo's decommissioned status mirrors the forty-year dormancy of Edmund's message. Removing the silo would require a substitute setting; the specificity (cobalt, cylindrical, starlit) adds resonance. Setup, middle use, and closure participation all present, though "under stars" does most of the atmospheric work in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The chess clock's expiration at eleven minutes past midnight opens the story and establishes temporal framing, but the decoding work unfolds "by two in the morning" without on-page pressure from elapsed time. The three-weeks-future date in the decoded message provides a forward stake but does not tighten tactics in the present scene. "After the chess clock runs down" functions as an atmospheric marker rather than a live constraint. Setup present, thematic link to time and patience clear, but no middle escalation tied to the clock's pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot's desire "to discover the shape of intentions" is stated explicitly and drives her decoding work across multiple beats. The motivation is dramatized through her patient cross-referencing and her decision to carry the case toward the coordinates despite incomplete knowledge. The friction between curiosity and uncertainty creates cost: she acts on a forty-year-old message without knowing what she'll find. The motivation shapes the closure choice and is character-specific (her ease with the dead and long timescales). Strong setup, middle choices, and closure linkage; explicit statement slightly lowers the score from full dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" is named once and echoed through descriptors like "soft and heavy as mourning cloth" and the silo's dim, enclosed atmosphere. The tone is coherent through the accumulative decoding sequence and modulates subtly in the final paragraph's shift to starlight and future bloom. The gloom charges Margot's patient nocturnal work and her comfort with death's adjacency. However, the tone remains relatively static—no sharp pressure-driven shift. Setup clear, atmosphere sustained, final image reconfigured slightly by the upward look, but the gloom itself does not escalate or constrain a choice. Solid lyric support without causal force.</comment>
