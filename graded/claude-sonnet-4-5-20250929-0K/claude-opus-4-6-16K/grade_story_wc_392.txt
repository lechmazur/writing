<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Nora's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—"held her reactions behind a professional stillness," "felt the word settle into her chest like an anchor finding bottom." Internal conflict operates simultaneously: she maintains professional calm while recognizing four years of complicity. The choice to write "preventable" is motivated by accumulated pressure (fourteen files, the lantern recognition) and forecloses her career path with visible cost. Minor deduction: the phrase "entangled memories came—not supernatural, nothing so simple" momentarily breaks into authorial explanation rather than staying strictly in her perceptual register.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative accents (the lantern serves as charged accumulation; escalation follows because/therefore links). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Nora writes "preventable," accepts the career consequence Bosch will deliver, and climbs toward the surface—options crystallized, path foreclosed, cost felt on the page. The lantern functions as a micro turn that reweights her stance but does not break causality. One meaningful tightening (denied requisitions → corroded wiring → lantern recognition → report) drives the escalation cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The subway tunnel is vividly particular: missing screws, green-powdered copper, standing water smell, recessed shelf in old stone foundation. Sensory detail is filtered through professional urgency (she photographs the conduit housing, pulls maintenance logs). The lantern—a tin object in a stone recess—constrains the final choice by charging Nora's recognition of suppressed truth across time. Spatial choreography is clean: ladder descent, platform, conduit above, deeper into tunnel, return to chalk outline, climb to surface. The tunnel's dual history (Underground Railroad beneath modern infrastructure) pressures the thematic calculus without becoming heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: investigator sent to confirm "accident" versus writing what she actually saw. One meaningful tightening: the corroded wiring and denied requisitions (external proof) converge with the lantern discovery (internal recognition) to narrow Nora's options to complicity or truth-telling. Agency is decision with visible cost: writing "preventable" forecloses career and pension. Bosch's predictable retaliation is anticipated on the page ("He would call within the hour"), making the price concrete. The escalation is driven by protagonist perception and choice under the inferred lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—accountability within systems designed to suppress truth—emerges from concrete particulars: fourteen prior files, denied requisitions, the lantern left by people who trusted someone ahead had done their job. The lantern operates as a charged object without becoming allegorical; its historical function (guiding people through darkness toward freedom) reweights Nora's present choice without overt statement. The final image (leaving the lantern "where someone might need its light again") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she has become the one who does her job, aware the system will continue and others may follow. No thematic echo or moralizing; the concept is inextricable from character goal and closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third limited with tight psychic distance. Perceptual signature is specific: "empirical observation, the only method she trusted when everything above ground was politics." Diction remains controlled and professional under pressure ("the word settle into her chest like an anchor finding bottom" is character-particular without purple excess). The brief meta-commentary "not supernatural, nothing so simple" is a minor register slip but does not obscure focalization. Narrative certainty matches what Nora can know; her inference about the lantern's history is grounded in her public-history background. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives during the inspection ("The conduit housing above the platform hung open, its screws missing—not stripped, missing entirely") stretch into longer accumulative syntax during reflection. Minor scaffold appears in the lantern passage: "It was a lantern—tin, dented, its glass chimney cracked but intact, blackened by a century and a half of soot" reads slightly list-like but remains functional. One paraphrase loop: "She was not fearless. She was finished being used" restates the same stance in adjacent sentences without added pressure (−0.2). No major artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—investigator pressured to falsify reports discovers artifact symbolizing prior truth-tellers—is a recognizable template (whistleblower + charged object). Transformation occurs through specific occupational detail (preventable-death investigation, maintenance logs, corroded wiring) and the precise emotional calculus: Nora is "not fearless" but "finished being used," avoiding both heroic inflation and cynical collapse. The lantern's integration (Underground Railroad in lower Manhattan infrastructure) is historically plausible and thematically earned. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat, but the core premise remains closely adjacent to workshop templates despite solid execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nora (preventable death investigator) drives all key turns: she performs empirical observation, recognizes the pattern of fourteen prior files, connects the lantern to her own role, and decides to write "preventable." Her professional role shapes perception (she reads maintenance logs, photographs evidence) and constrains the stakes (Bosch controls "career, pension, the quiet machinery of consequence"). The choice at closure is specific to her investigative authority. Setup early, middle development through evidence gathering, payoff in the report-writing beat. Causal pressure high; irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lantern appears in one sustained beat (discovery and reflection) and returns implicitly in the final line ("leaving the lantern where it had always been"). It enables Nora's recognition ("her hands and those older hands were performing the same calculus") and charges the closure thematically but does not constrain a physical choice or reappear with evolved use. The object is historically specific (tin, cracked chimney, soot-blackened) and its function (guiding through darkness) directly reweights the thematic question. Setup after the first third (late), development in one beat, closure participation via callback. Strong thematic resonance but limited mechanical involvement; two-gate fulfillment with lyric reprise reaches mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" as stated on the page: "the recognition that her hands and those older hands were performing the same calculus." The concept shapes Nora's thematic realization but does not alter her tactical options—she was already gathering evidence before the lantern appeared. The phrase itself momentarily breaks voice ("entangled memories came—not supernatural") as meta-commentary. Setup implicit in the fourteen-file backstory, development in the lantern beat, closure participation thematic only. Functional bridge between backstory and present choice, but the exact phrasing is ornamental and the concept itself could be rephrased without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Watchfully calm" is demonstrated on the page in the opening ("she had learned to arrive at scenes watchfully calm, holding her reactions behind a professional stillness") and tested under pressure when she writes the report despite anticipating Bosch's retaliation. The attribute enables her empirical method and constrains her to internalize four years of complicity rather than acting earlier. It is embodied in her physical control ("Her hands were steady") and in the cost calculus ("fortified herself not against fear but around it"). Setup early, development across investigation beats, payoff in the closure stance. The trait is action-shaping and specific, though "watchfully calm" vs. "professional composure" is only moderately irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Reverberate" is named explicitly ("This death reverberated") and functions on two levels: literal (sound in the tunnel) and figurative (pattern recognition across fourteen files). It triggers Nora's decision to move deeper into the tunnel, where she finds the lantern; the accumulation of prior deaths plus Marcus Devlin's then "reverberates" into her final choice to write "preventable." Setup in the prompt's conceptual space, development through the echo imagery and pattern recognition, closure participation via accumulated pressure. The specific verb is somewhat swappable (resonate, echo), but the layered meaning—sonic and moral—charges the middle turn and constrains the trajectory. Two strong beats, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Empirical observation" is signaled early ("she began her work through empirical observation, the only method she trusted") and demonstrated in action: she photographs the conduit, checks maintenance logs, notes missing screws vs. stripped screws. The method shapes her tactics (concrete evidence gathering) and underwrites her authority to contradict Bosch. It recurs in the closure beat when she writes "what she actually saw: the denied requisitions, the missing safety equipment, the corroded wiring documented and ignored." Setup early, development across investigation moves, payoff as the grounding for "preventable." The method is profession-specific and causally necessary; without it, her stance lacks credibility. High integration, strong irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The subway maintenance tunnel supplies the crime scene (chalk outline, flooded track bed, corroded wiring), enables the discovery (recessed shelf in old stone foundation), and its dual-layered history (Underground Railroad beneath modern infrastructure) charges the thematic calculus. Spatial details constrain movement: ladder descent, platform, deeper progression, return climb. The tunnel's physical danger (standing water, exposed wiring) and historical resonance both pressure Nora's choice. Setup immediate, development through investigation choreography, payoff when she climbs toward the surface leaving the lantern behind. Micro-setting (tunnel, body, lantern shelf) all shape tactics and charge the final image. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"After the drought ends" is introduced in the opening line ("The rain had returned three days ago") and causally enables Marcus Devlin's death: "weeks of accumulated grime washed loose from conduit housings, exposing corroded wiring." The timeframe creates the conditions Nora investigates and tightens the city's liability (they knew saturation after drought would worsen the danger). Setup early, development as causal trigger for the death, implicit in closure (the report will cite these conditions). The exact timeframe matters more than a generic "during rain" because the drought-to-deluge shift is the precipitating event. Solid causal role, moderate clock pressure (no live ticking deadline), strong specificity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Breaking free from Bosch's control is Nora's dominant motivation, dramatized through internal conflict: "For four years she had written what he told her to write. For four years her name had sealed files that absolved the city of deaths the city had caused." The desire is tested when she writes "preventable" knowing Bosch "would call within the hour" and "remind her of her career, her pension." The cost is visible: "She was not fearless. She was finished being used." Setup in the backstory block (functional, anchored to present evidence), development through the lantern recognition, payoff in the report-writing and climb to surface. Friction between institutional power and personal integrity drives the entire arc with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Fortified vulnerability" is embodied in the closing passage: "She had fortified herself not against fear but around it, letting vulnerability exist inside a structure strong enough to hold. She was not fearless. She was finished being used." The tone is consistent across pressure points—professional control with acknowledged emotional cost—and modulates from clinical observation (corroded wiring, missing screws) to charged reflection (lantern calculus) to resolute closure (sealing the report, climbing out). Setup in the opening's "watchfully calm," development through the investigation's dual registers (empirical + emotional), payoff in the final stance that holds both strength and acknowledged risk. The exact phrase "fortified vulnerability" does not appear, but the tonal synthesis is unmistakable and charges the final image.</comment>
