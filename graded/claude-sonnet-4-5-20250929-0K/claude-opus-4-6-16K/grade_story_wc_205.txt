<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, with embodied emotion ("sorrow had burnished her") and clear motivation driving her archival work. The internal contradiction between her revolutionary past and present scholarly precision creates meaningful texture. Her final choice to read the walls aloud feels earned by the accumulated pressure of professional dismissal and personal obsolescence. Minor deduction: the "Torch of Elysium Station" backstory, while vivid, occupies significant space without altering a present micro-choice until the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through layered imagery (visible time, baroque architecture, poetic fragments) that reweights the dominant stake—professional vindication against erasure. Orientation anchors quickly (Maren Solis, Vasari-7, post-visible-time era). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: the final image of Maren reading aloud crystallizes her refusal of silence with undeniable conceptual cost (a defunct revolutionary giving voice to a defunct civilization). The accumulative pattern holds cleanly, though one causal tightening in the middle third would have elevated escalation further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: covered mirrors during temporal storms show Vasari foresight and provide evidence for Maren's thesis. Visible time as environmental detail (amber currents, storm-light pressing against draped mirrors) charges the closure image and operates throughout as both constraint and conceptual anchor. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered ("time could be seen layered over ruins"). The setting is indispensable to both the archaeological dispute and the final act of translation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reimagining Vasari civilization against academic dismissal) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maren's meticulous translation work—contrasted with her old "incandescent" manifestos—demonstrates the textural shift from revolutionary to scholar. The cost is legible: professional isolation, four years of solitary work, transmission to "every university" with no guarantee of reception. Agency is clear in her choice to compile and transmit despite Leath's dismissal. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a second on-page reversal that would have tightened further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (beauty and impermanence, voice against erasure) emerges organically from the nested structure: Vasari poets wrote about time's consumption, Maren translates their work while facing her own obsolescence, both "still speaking, still luminous, still refusing the comfortable silence of being forgotten." The crystal shard operates as motif with genuine constraint (it shifts meaning under temporal strata) rather than token recurrence. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question through the image of parallel defunctness. No overt thesis statement; subtext operates cleanly in the architectural-as-poetry conceit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: Maren's way of noticing filters through both revolutionary past and scholarly present ("propaganda frequencies," "metrical patterns"). Narrative distance modulates purposefully between intimacy ("sorrow had burnished her") and wider context (Vasari history). Diction stays within POV's lexicon with controlled elevation ("baroque," "cherubim," "patina") that fits an archaeologist-poet. No dialogue present. Psychic distance shifts serve emotional beats cleanly. The prose rhythm reflects Maren's deliberate, burnished quality without monotony.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual propulsion. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "cherubim carved from iron ore watched her with hollow eyes" establishes setting, mood, and Maren's solitude). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor issue: "This changed everything. / This changed nothing" reads as intentional parallelism but borders on scaffold phrasing. Figurative language ("time pooled thick as honey," "burnished") is coherent and enhances rather than obscures. Grammar and sequencing are clean throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of visible time as archaeological tool, baroque architecture as nested poetry, and parallel obsolescence (revolutionary/civilization) feels specific and non-obvious. The story transforms the "lone scholar vindication" trope through textural layering and the mirroring structure. Transformation test: plot and arc would not work with different elements—the Vasari must be poets, time must be visible, Maren must be a defunct revolutionary for the thematic resonance to land. Risk-taking in the dense, concept-forward opening pays off at closure. Slight deduction: the archaeological dispute frame echoes familiar academic-underdog territory despite fresh execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren as defunct revolutionary is present throughout and shapes two key choices: her shift from "incandescent" manifestos to "quiet" precision (middle), and her final decision to read the walls aloud despite transmission uncertainty (closure). The trait enables the thematic parallel with the Vasari and constrains her tactics (isolation, meticulous translation). Cost is visible: professional marginalization and four years alone. Early setup (first paragraph), middle development (translation method), and closure participation (reading aloud) all present. Swappability test: a non-revolutionary scholar would lose the thematic resonance of parallel erasure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard appears in three beats: discovery ("deepest chamber"), evidential role (micro-engravings, "layered verse"), and implicit presence in the compiled monograph. It enables Maren's argument (poetry nested within poetry visible under temporal strata) and is dismissed by Leath, creating the dispute. However, it does not return with reweighted meaning in the final image—the ending focuses on reading the walls, not the shard itself. Causal pressure is clear but closure linkage is indirect. Early setup, middle development present; closure participation is implicit rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute shapes stakes on every page: Leath's dismissal motivates Maren's four-year translation project, her isolation, and her transmission strategy. The dispute alters tactics (cross-referencing engravings with architectural proportions, learning Vasari mirror-covering methods) and charges the closure (transmission "to every university" is a direct challenge to Leath's seven volumes). Early signal (first third), middle development (translation as counter-evidence), and closure participation (monograph transmission, final defiant reading) all strong. The dispute is not merely thematic—it drives on-page choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" appears as both Maren's trait (she "spoke in verse so sharp") and the Vasari's defining characteristic ("poetically inclined in ways that made human literature seem like scratching in dirt"). It enables the thematic connection and Maren's translation method, but the trait itself does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—it's more a shared quality that allows recognition. The trait is present early and threaded through but functions more as thematic glue than causal pressure. Lyric resonance is present but beat involvement is limited.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Devise" governs the middle section's core action: Maren must devise another way after Leath dismisses the shard. This leads directly to the translation work, cross-referencing, and learning Vasari storm methods—multiple beats of causal pressure. The action redefines her options from single-fragment evidence to comprehensive architectural analysis. Early signal (post-dismissal), middle development (working through storms), and closure participation (the devised monograph is transmitted). Swappability test: "attempt" or "pursue" would not carry the same inventive, problem-solving pressure. Cost is legible in the four-year effort.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Covering mirrors during temporal storms appears in one substantial beat (mid-story) where it demonstrates Vasari foresight and serves as evidence that "the Vasari understood time's visible nature before humanity." It shapes Maren's working conditions ("worked through temporal storms") and adds verisimilitude to the world rules. However, it does not constrain a climactic choice or return in the closure. Setup and middle development present; closure participation absent. The method is specific and purposeful but not indispensable—removing it would weaken world-building but not break the core logic of the dispute or the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is indispensable: its architecture-as-poetry is the core evidence for Maren's thesis, visible time pools in its chambers enabling translation, and the "great nave" is the setting for the closure image. It shapes tactics (learning Vasari methods, working through storms, reading architectural proportions as meter) and charges the final image ("sat in the great nave...watching amber time drift past the covered mirrors"). Early setup (first paragraph), middle development (multiple beats of spatial exploration and translation), and closure participation all strong. Swappability test: a non-baroque site would collapse the poetry-architecture synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After time became visible" is the story's foundational conceit, enabling archaeological reading of temporal strata, the Vasari micro-engravings that shift meaning under different time-light, and the storm mechanics. It shapes Maren's entire methodology and provides the mechanism for her evidence ("visible time pooled thick as honey"). The timeframe is present in setup, development (storms, layered readings), and closure (amber time drifting). However, it does not tighten decisions in a clock-pressure sense—it's more an enabling condition than a tactical constraint. Cost is conceptual rather than felt urgency. Still, the element is irreplaceable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to reimagine the Vasari civilization drives every on-page choice: the four-year translation project, working through storms, cross-referencing architecture, compiling the monograph, and transmitting it despite dismissal. It creates friction with Leath's interpretation and acceptance of her own obsolescence ("She was older now, and sorrow had burnished her"). Cost is visible: isolation, professional risk, and the possibility of being ignored again. Early signal (first third), middle development (translation as counter-narrative), and closure participation (transmission and defiant reading) all present. The motivation is dramatized through choices, not merely told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Burnished sorrow as tone is coherent throughout and modulates with pressure: the opening's elegiac register ("grief wore a different texture"), the middle's quiet determination ("quiet where her old speeches had been fierce"), and the closure's defiant melancholy ("still speaking, still luminous, still refusing"). The tone charges the final image by fusing Maren's sorrow with her refusal to be forgotten. It is not static—it deepens from nostalgia (revolutionary past) to resolve (scholarly precision) to charged poise (reading aloud). The tone is embodied in diction, rhythm, and image choices rather than declared, and it supports the Accumulative/Textural lens throughout.</comment>
