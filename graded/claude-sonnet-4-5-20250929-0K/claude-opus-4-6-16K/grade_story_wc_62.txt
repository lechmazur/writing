<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and deeply rooted in familial inheritance, with her meditative stillness embodied through concrete detail ("insects landed on her eyelids"). Internal complexity shows in the tension between individual craft and collective inheritance, though the spectral mentorship sometimes risks convenience—the grandmother's guidance appears when needed without dramatized friction or misfire. The carving work and poem-trading custom create character-particular texture, but peak moments lean toward summary ("she felt the greenhouse hold its breath") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Minor penalty for interiority that occasionally explains rather than dramatizes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (greenhouse, dusk, monarch migration, Elara's trade). The accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds through nightly ritual across the migration window, then tightens with the memorial stone's completion and the monarchs' departure. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara completes the work, the mentorship recedes but persists, and she carries the ribbon roll forward—"the mentorship was not over" crystallizes her endurance with visible cost (the cycle will return, demanding its "precise and tender shape"). Cost is felt in the sediment image and the weight of future names. One meaningful deepening is present as individual grief motifs merge into communal architecture on the stone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: "iron bones greening with verdigris," "feral jasmine and cracked terracotta" create decay and persistence that mirror generational work. The monarchs function as both atmosphere and constraint—their migration frames the work window and their wing-structure inspires the memorial's design. The ribbon roll, chisel, and stone anchor micro-setting through tactile handling. Spatial choreography is clear (greenhouse interior, terracotta, iron ribs). The final light ("fractured beams across the floor") charges the ending image. Minor gap: dusk recurs but does not visibly constrain a tactical choice beyond mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled: discover the shape of collective grief through retracing five generations of carvings to design one communal memorial. Pressure accumulates through nightly study of the ribbon roll and deepens when individual symbols (wave, book) must merge into a single monarch-winged structure sheltering fourteen names. The carving's completion constitutes agency (a creative synthesis under inherited pressure), and the cost is legible in the ongoing obligation ("next year's grief demanding its precise and tender shape"). No antagonist required; the accumulative lens supports this design. One tightening: the monarch motif shifts from decorative to structural, narrowing the design solution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: generational inheritance, grief as architecture, spectral continuity through craft. The monarch-as-structure image ("the way grief is structural, the way it holds a community aloft even as it weighs them down") is earned by the nightly accumulation and avoids overt moralizing. The Szymborska poem—"the way the living and dead share the same air"—reweights prior material without stating a thesis. The ribbon roll and poem-trading custom create thematic resonance through concrete objects and action. The ending offers a non-literal answer to the central question (how to shape collective grief) through the completed stone and the promise of return. Minor note: "fiercely still, thunderously calm" in the final line risks over-articulation but remains image-adjacent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elara's perceptual signature (carver's eye for structure, meditative stillness). Diction is purposeful and elevated but remains character-consistent ("luminous," "topology," "thundering calm" as descriptors for her interior state). No dialogue to evaluate. Narrative distance modulates appropriately (close during carving, slightly elevated during reflection). One friction: occasional filter-stack ("she felt," "she believed," "she suspected") in the middle passage slightly dulls immediacy, though voice remains coherent under pressure. Rhythm varies well; the final paragraph's cadence charges the closure image without template repetition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong imagery ("cataracts over ancient eyes," "sediment settles after a river floods"). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "iron bones greening with verdigris" conveys age, decay, structure). One deduction for minor paraphrase loop: "spectral mentorship: not haunting, but inheritance made luminous" immediately follows the concept's introduction without added pressure. A second loop: the greenhouse "holding its breath" and "thundering calm" recur as near-synonyms for stillness without evolving function. Sentence openings vary well; no template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, though "thundering calm" as a phrase is used three times (early, mid, end) without clear reweighting each time.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and monarch migration is specific and non-obvious, with the butterfly-wing structure as a fresh inflection on memorial design. The ribbon roll as archive is distinctive. However, the spectral-guidance premise risks familiar "ancestor helps artist" territory; transformation occurs through the carving's communal function and the accumulative method, not a late twist. The greenhouse-at-dusk-during-migration setting avoids generic "workshop" but leans into atmospheric convention (verdigris, jasmine, amber light). The poem-trading custom adds texture. Emotional truth in generational inheritance and the weight of collective grief feels earned. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative structure and quiet ending are purposeful but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive the arc: she initiates the nightly ritual, retraces each motif on the ribbon roll, synthesizes them into the monarch structure, and completes the memorial. Her meditative stillness enables spectral contact, shaping the method. The final choice to carry the ribbon roll forward and accept the cycle's return is a renunciation of finality with visible cost. Present in setup, middle study, and ending. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ribbon roll appears in multiple beats: unwound each evening to read names, annotated with design precedents, rewound at the end. It functions as archive and constraint, supplying the 1923 wave and 1967 book motifs that inform the final design. The act of reading names aloud and tucking it into her coat at closure charges the ending. Specific irreplaceable mechanics (inscribed names, five generations, indigo and copper). Strong setup, middle use, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship is signaled early ("the dead began to teach her") and frames the nightly ritual: the grandmother's hands "settle over hers" to guide the chisel. It enables the retracing method and the accumulation of generational wisdom. The concept is causal (no grandmother, no access to prior designs) but the mechanics remain abstract—Elara doesn't misinterpret or struggle against the guidance, so it lacks visible friction. Present in setup, middle, and ending (the presence "recedes" but will return), but functions more as premise than obstacle. Mid-band for necessity with limited on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" is shown early (sitting still enough for insects to land on eyelids) and enables the nightly ritual's depth of silence. It's character-specific and ties to her grandmother's teaching. However, it doesn't visibly constrain a choice or create a tradeoff—meditation is purely enabling, never a cost or obstacle. Present in setup and alluded to at the end ("fiercely still"), but no middle beat where the trait forces a sacrifice or narrows options. Functional but no clear price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Retracing is the method: Elara studies each name on the ribbon roll, reads the annotations of prior carvings (wave for fisherman, book for teacher), and synthesizes them into the new memorial. The action shapes every middle beat and drives the design solution (monarch wing structure with fourteen names). Removing "retrace" would collapse the generational connection and the communal grief architecture. Present in setup (announced as goal), sustained through the work window, and completed at closure. High causal necessity and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The poem-trading custom is described early and given texture (Szymborska, Rumi, lullabies; sliding verses across the table). Elara carries poems into the greenhouse and speaks them to the monarchs, and the Szymborska line about living and dead sharing air reappears at the ending. However, the custom itself doesn't constrain a choice—it enriches atmosphere and theme but is not mechanically necessary to the carving or closure. The final Szymborska moment is a lyric reprise that reweights the air/breath motif, earning mid-band credit. Setup and closure present; middle development is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse is signaled early, detailed with iron bones, verdigris, cracked terracotta, and feral jasmine. It functions as ritual space and houses the monarchs whose wing structure inspires the memorial design. The "fractured beams" of light in the final image charge the closure. The setting enables the nightly work and supplies the visual precedent (monarch wings) that becomes structural on the stone. Present in setup, middle use (every dusk across migration), and ending. Causal role in design solution; irreplaceable for the monarch motif.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The migration timeframe is signaled early ("every dusk during the monarch migration") and tracked: "across the weeks of migration," culminating in "the final evening of the migration" when the butterflies lift and the stone is finished. The deadline tightens the carving work and the mentorship's seasonal availability. The monarchs' departure coincides with the work's completion, creating closure linkage. The timeframe constrains tactics (nightly ritual, limited window) and charges the ending. Setup, middle tracking, and closure present. Visible cost in the cycle's return.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to discover the shape of collective grief is announced early and drives every beat: the nightly ribbon-reading, the study of prior carvings, the synthesis of individual symbols into communal architecture. Friction is present in the challenge of merging fourteen individual griefs into one coherent design. The monarch-wing solution is the dramatized answer, and the cost is the ongoing obligation ("next year's grief demanding its precise and tender shape"). Setup, middle pursuit, and closure all hinge on this desire. High causal necessity and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" is introduced early as the paradoxical state in the greenhouse ("that silence so full it roared") and recurs in the final line ("fiercely still, thunderously calm"). The tone is coherent across beats—meditative intensity, pressure in stillness—and modulates with the monarchs' presence (amber and violet light, the held breath). The oxymoric phrasing charges the closure image by naming the sustained contradiction. Present in setup, sustained through middle ritual, and reprised at ending. The tone shapes perception and supports the accumulative lens. One friction: "thundering calm" as a phrase is used thrice without clear functional evolution each time, though the final reprise reweights it.</comment>
