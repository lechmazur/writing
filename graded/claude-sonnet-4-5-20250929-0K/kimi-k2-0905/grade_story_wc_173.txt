<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lys is assigned contradictory impulses—chaste courtesan, rebel against conformity—but they remain abstract labels rather than acting simultaneously in scene. Her peak choice (stepping into the mirror, surrendering echoes) arrives without prior micro-decisions that dramatize the cost of liberation versus safety. Interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion ("her bodily poetic," "alarming serenity") rather than embodied sensation tied to immediate stakes. The contract-burning moment carries symbolic weight but no on-page hesitation or trade-off that would anchor her agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through recurring images (snow/thaw, echoes, prism facets) toward a final reconfiguration where the city wakes. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lys sings to wake rather than lull, statues fill with light, dawn arrives "raw" rather than compliant. Orientation anchors arrive late—"silver courtyard," "prism sanctuary," Lys's role are named but spatial choreography inside the sanctuary remains vague until the plinth beat. The escalation from arrival to core-opening to collective awakening is legible under the Accumulative lens, but the cost (contract burns away, yet "alarming serenity remained") feels asserted rather than dramatized through a concrete forfeiture or on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The silver courtyard, prism sanctuary, and mosaic tiles supply vivid anchors and constrain Lys's path—she must kneel at the threshold, press palm to veins, work the threads. Snow melting into spring water and night-blooming cereus charge the final image with environmental transformation. However, spatial choreography inside the sanctuary is hazy: the plinth's position, Lys's movements between kneeling and stepping into the mirror, and the distance to the fountain are not tracked. The body as micro-setting (pelvic bones vibrating, barefoot prints of blood and dew) is purposeful and specific, lifting the score despite the interior vagueness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: defy the lullaby or the city falls into eternal obedience by dawn. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lys undoes the last knot and the core opens, releasing the echoes and burning her contract. Agency is present but largely procedural—she executes the weaver's method without on-page friction, doubt, or improvisation. The mad weaver's post-closure offer of passage is declined, but the refusal arrives after the main conflict resolves and carries no visible cost that alters the ending. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation from arrival to unlock to collective awakening is legible, yet the lack of a mid-scene complication or pivot limits pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—freedom as a terrifying lullaby, the collective over the individual, voice versus echo—emerges organically from Lys's choice to remain and sing rather than escape. The final image (dawn as "raw, alarming serenity," citizens tasting their own pulse) reweights the opening's frost-veiled silence without stating a moral. The recurring "between sigh and smile" and "bodily poetic" anchor the theme in embodied language. However, "alarming serenity" is asserted repeatedly without enough varied embodiment to fully earn its paradox, and the phrase "first voice that refused to echo" leans close to thematic statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and elevated ("bruised violet and arterial red," "veins of silver running through alabaster that mapped the human heart in anatomical verse"), consistent with the fantasy-courtly register. The perceptual signature is selective—Lys notices echoes, sanctuary facets, mercury tears—but sensory detail occasionally drifts toward catalogue ("perfume, gunpowder, or breast milk") rather than urgent filtering. Free indirect style is clean. Recurring poetic phrases ("between sigh and smile," "bodily poetic," "alarming serenity") risk template cadence but remain voice-motivated and pattern-taught, so no penalty under the Experimental tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often striking ("sanctuary rose like a frozen teardrop," "mercury tears into tiny stars that orbited her throat"), but many beats stack metaphor without breathing room, risking overwriting in high-pressure moments (core-opening, stepping into the mirror). Template cadence appears in repeated stems: "She had learned," "She worked quickly," "She repeated it until." Paraphrase loops: "the prism sanctuary collapsed into sand that chimed like distant bells, its duty fulfilled once the threads of conformity lay unravelled and harmless" restates the unlocking without new pressure. "Bodily poetic" and "alarming serenity" recur as motifs but also as filler when the line does not advance action. Apply −0.8 for density + template cadence + loops; the figurative muddle does not touch the closure image directly but dulls momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—chaste courtesan harvesting stolen memories to unlock a conformity-prison—synthesizes familiar elements (memory magic, rebellion against mind-control, sanctuary trials) into a specific ritual with the mad weaver and thread-braiding mechanics. The ending choice (remain as the first non-echo voice rather than escape) offers a fresh inflection on the liberation arc. However, the courtyard-to-sanctuary-to-fountain choreography and the echoes-as-crystalline-threads mechanism remain high-concept rather than irreplaceably particular; a similar story could swap in "songs" or "dreams" with minor edits. The lyric register and bodily-poetic motif provide texture but do not fully transform the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lys (chaste courtesan) is the sole POV and her decisions drive all major beats: arrive, kneel, braid threads, step into the mirror, decline escape, sing. She is present throughout and her final choice (remain rather than leave) alters the city's fate. However, her interior is assertion-heavy and her peak choices lack on-page friction or visible cost that would deepen integration. Early signal is strong (first sentence), closure linkage is clear (singing at the fountain), but causality is procedural—she executes the weaver's method without improvisation. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is thin. Base ~5.0 + early signal +0.5 + closure +0.7 − swappability (any rebel could occupy this role) −0.4 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is named in the opening line, described vividly (faceted quartz, bruised violet and arterial red), and its core opens to release the echoes—three distinct beats. Lys presses her palm to the plinth and steps into the mirrored core, so the sanctuary constrains her physical actions and charges the middle turn. However, after the collapse into sand, the sanctuary vanishes; the ending focuses on the fountain and courtyard, not the prism. All three gates met (setup, middle, closure participation via the core-opening). Base ~6.0 + early signal +0.6 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure +0.8 − closure absence (not in final image) −0.6 = 6.2, but cap at 6.2 due to swappability (any magical structure could serve this function with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The harvest of echoes is named in paragraph two, described in detail (crystalline threads, memories of first kiss/last goodbye/pre-duel hush), and Lys braids them to unlock the prism core—three beats. The concept shapes her goal (return echoes to owners to break conformity) and the mechanics (untangling threads) constrain her method. The scattering of echoes at closure wakes the city, directly tying the concept to the ending's stakes. All three gates met. Base ~6.0 + early signal +0.7 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure +1.2 + closure linkage +1.5 + specificity (threads that smell of perfume/gunpowder/breast milk) +0.6 − swappability (similar with "dreams" or "songs") −0.5 = 10.9, cap at 7.4 due to summary-only resolution (echoes scatter off-page, waking is told rather than shown in individuals).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" is named three times (plinth veins, pelvic-bone vibration, throat-orbiting stars) but functions as thematic decoration rather than a trait that constrains or enables action. The phrase recurs in lyric moments without altering Lys's tactics or imposing a visible trade-off. Setup and middle mentions present, but no closure participation (the final singing is direct action, not filtered through "bodily poetic" language). Two gates met (setup, middle); missing payoff cap at 4.6. Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats +0.9 − ornamental use (label-only) −0.6 − swappability (easily cut without changing plot) −0.4 = 3.4, but the lyric reprise lifts to 4.1 within the two-gate cap.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The unlock action (undoing knots, opening the prism core) is signaled early ("if she failed"), executed in the middle third (braiding threads, pressing the plinth, whispering defiance), and directly causes the closure (core opens, echoes scatter, city wakes). All three gates met. The action is specific (untangling threads, final knot released) and irreplaceable—removing it collapses the plot. Base ~6.0 + early signal +0.6 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure +1.5 + closure linkage +1.5 + specificity +0.7 = 11.7, but cap at 7.1 due to summary-only mechanics (the braiding and knot-release are described, not dramatized with micro-choices or obstacles that test Lys).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method (untangling threads) is taught by the mad weaver, named early ("learned the method from the mad weaver"), and executed on-page: Lys plucks threads that smell of perfume/gunpowder/breast milk, braids them, releases each knot while snow retreats. Three beats (learning, execution, final knot), all three gates met. The mechanics constrain her actions (she must work quickly, the threads sense their origin) and the final knot-release triggers the core opening. Base ~6.0 + early signal +0.6 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure +1.2 + closure linkage +1.4 + specificity (threads that smell, threads that hum) +0.6 − summary-only middle (the braiding is told in one line, not shown in micro-steps with friction) −0.6 = 10.6, cap at 6.8 due to swappability (any ritual method—chant, gesture, potion—could replace threading with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The silver courtyard is named in the opening line, its statues and mosaic tiles described, and snow melting at closure transforms it into a garden of glowing silhouettes. Lys walks across it barefoot, leaving blood/dew prints, and sits at the fountain to sing—four beats. The courtyard constrains her path (she must cross it to reach the sanctuary, return to the fountain) and the thawing tiles spell "the first new poem." All three gates met. Base ~6.0 + early signal +0.7 + four beats +1.4 + causal pressure +0.8 + closure linkage +1.5 + specificity (mosaic predecessors, night-blooming cereus) +0.6 − postcard description in places (statues "wearing frost like lace veils" is static) −0.4 = 10.6, cap at 6.9 due to swappability (any symbolic courtyard or plaza could serve with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Between sigh and smile" bookends the story (paragraph four and multiple later beats) and recurs as a motif, but it functions as lyric phrasing rather than a live clock that tightens decisions. The dawn deadline ("if she failed... by dawn") creates urgency, yet no on-page moment tracks elapsed time or forces Lys to choose speed over precision. Setup present (early mention of dawn), middle absent (no time-pressure beat), closure participation via repetition but no causal role. Two gates met (setup, payoff), missing middle cap at 4.6. Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.4 + closure reprise +0.7 − ornamental (no tactics altered by time) −0.6 − swappability (easily cut) −0.3 = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation (defy the lullaby of conformity) is named explicitly in paragraph four, drives Lys's arrival and ritual, and is dramatized at closure when she sings to wake rather than lull. The city's obedience is the threat, her defiance the answer. All three gates met (setup, middle unlock, closure singing). However, the motivation is more premise than internal conflict—Lys never doubts or hesitates, so no friction between desire and cost appears on the page. Base ~6.0 + early signal +0.7 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure +1.0 + closure linkage +1.4 − told-only (asserted rather than tested in micro-choices) −0.7 − no friction (wants align smoothly) −0.5 = 8.3, but cap at 6.4 due to lack of contradictory impulses or visible trade-off that would deepen the motivation's cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Alarming serenity" is named twice (paragraph five, paragraph seventeen) and threads through the piece: the sanctuary's "bruised violet and arterial red" beauty, the "polished" darkness of the core, the "raw, alarming serenity" of the new dawn. The tone modulates from still/frost-veiled opening to vibrating/charged middle to raw/awake ending, supporting pressure. Setup and closure participation present; middle development is implicit (the sanctuary's tone charges the unlock beat). Two gates met, but the lyric reprise at closure lifts the score. Base ~5.0 + early signal +0.6 + closure linkage +1.2 + modulation with pressure +0.8 − repetition of the exact phrase risks mantra rather than tonal shift −0.4 − swappability (another paradox-tone would serve) −0.3 = 6.9, but round down to 6.1 due to assertion-heaviness (the tone is named more than embodied in non-visual senses).</comment>
