<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer remains abstract throughout—her choices feel predetermined by the premise rather than emerging from contradictory impulses. The golden-thread mouth reveal arrives late and functions as decor rather than a constraint that shaped prior choices. Internal experience is largely narrated in elevated, distanced language ("cautious exuberance") that never degrades under the stated crisis pressure. The transformation into the library reads as conceptual fulfillment rather than a choice earned by visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Accumulative (library feeding on unspoken words) but relies on Causal plot furniture (nine-hour countdown, two letters) that never tightens options. Orientation is delayed—who she is, why she's here, and what the library actually threatens remain vague past the first third. The closure unit (becoming the library) is asserted rather than earned through prior causality; the watch stopping and the thread removal occur without visible cost or foreclosed alternatives. The "Thank you" letter feels like authorial summary rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glowing library offers vivid texture (phosphorescent tiles, mist, shelves in temporal phases) but remains a backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes a choice. The mother's rose-silk apology is decorative—touched once, bled, then abandoned. Spatial choreography is vague: movement "through propagation delays" and "between shelves" never grounds the reader in a legible map. The watch as micro-setting object is handled but does not constrain tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reclaim stolen voice) is declared but never tested by a dilemma that forces trade-offs. The nine-hour countdown and cyclically reversed doors vanish as pressure; no ticking clock alters her moves. The watch stopping is not a reversal but a marker of arrival. Removing the golden thread (the sole agency moment) occurs without visible cost—no pain, no foreclosed path, no tactical sacrifice. The transformation reads as destiny rather than a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (unspoken words as living archive, silence as material) emerges through recurring images but the final revelation—"you are here to become it"—is stated rather than earned through particulars. The "thank you" letter and the dissolution into "pure articulation" veer into allegory without grounded human cost. The watch ticking forward is a symbolic convenience introduced at the end. The piece gestures at resonance but substitutes thematic echo ("THE LIBRARY IS THE WORD") for a non-literal final image rooted in prior specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric register and the perceptual signature is selective (phosphorescent tiles, mist, gold thread). However, the prose recycles elevated stems across beats: "Between two fateful letters" opens two paragraphs, "Through propagation delays" recurs without evolving meaning. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood," "she realized") stack in the second half, dulling immediacy. No dialogue. The cipher's all-caps pronouncements break diction and read as authorial rather than world-embedded.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent lines: "Between two fateful letters" repeated, "propagation delays" recycled without added pressure, "unspoken words" and "library" churn through synonym variants. Template cadence in the middle third: "The [noun] [verbed]" runs for five sentences. Stock metaphors ("feeding on words," "breathing") and elevated diction ("cautious exuberance," "pure articulation") in peak beats create register drift. The closure beat is clouded by figurative language ("dissolved into pure articulation," "newest wing") that abstracts rather than concretizes cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (library of unspoken words, protagonist becomes the archive) offers a fresh angle on silence-as-material, but the execution leans on familiar portal-quest furniture: stolen object (watch), ticking clock, magical bargain, transformation-as-destiny. The turn—she's here to become the library—is stated rather than discovered through grounded specifics. The watch, veil, and golden thread function as symbolic tokens rather than irreplaceable particulars. Risk-taking in structure (lyric compression, cipher inserts) does not translate to narrative stakes; the protagonist's path feels pre-scripted.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Veiled dreamer is present throughout but her choices do not create turns. She moves, traces symbols, removes thread—all actions that fulfill the premise rather than narrow options. The thread removal (final third) is the sole decision moment but lacks visible cost. Cap: functional but replaceable; an abstract seeker could perform the same moves.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Confidence man's watch appears in three beats: intro (stolen, hands spin backward), midpoint (projects cipher), closure (stops, then ticks forward). It shapes one middle beat (cipher projection) and appears at closure, but its mechanics (counting lies, propagation delay) remain ornamental. Removing the thread "with" the watch is vague—no specific use is dramatized. Early signal present; two-beat involvement; closure cameo; but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Unfolding cipher is signaled early (watch projects it), delivered mid-story, and named at closure ("completed itself"). It supplies exposition ("I AM THE WORD") but does not constrain tactics or force a choice. The protagonist "documents" it mentally and "realizes" its meaning—summary rather than dramatized discovery. Functional but does not reshape options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Cyclically reversed appears as label: reversed doors, reversed gravity, reversed cycle. Mentioned in four lines but never constrains an action. Doors "seal for another century" and gravity "would soon invert"—both are stakes declared but not tested. No visible tradeoff or tactic shaped by reversal. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Document (action) recurs: she documents symbols in memory palace, marks shelves by lies, documents final choice. It frames her method but does not drive turns. The final "documented her final choice by removing the thread" conflates documentation with transformation—removing thread is the pivot, not the recording. Functional role across beats but swappable with "she noted" or "she recorded."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Through propagation delays is a repeated phrase (five uses) but its mechanics remain vague. "Each tick a propagation delay that stretched truth into fiction" is exposition; "moved between shelves that existed in different temporal phases" does not show how delays alter her path. It labels her method but does not shape a dramatized attempt or cost. Present across beats; mechanics unclear; replaceable with "through shifts" or "across time."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Glowing library in mist is introduced early, sustained across beats (tiles pulse, shelves flicker, library breathes), and central at closure (absorbs her voice, rearranges into her mouth). It supplies vivid texture and houses the transformation. However, it does not constrain a choice—no path blocked, no resource scarce. It functions as stage and metaphor. Strong presence; early signal; closure participation; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Between two fateful letters (timeframe) is stated twice as bracketing phrase but the nine hours are never tracked. No countdown pressure alters tactics; the "second letter" materializes at the end without prior mention of its content or delivery. Time is label-only—declared but not dramatized as constraint. Closure cameo (letter appears) but no middle development where time narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>To find the library of unspoken words is declared early and pursued across beats (moving through shelves, tracing cipher, finding mother's apology). Mid-story the goal shifts: she's here to become the library, not find it. The shift is stated ("she understood the truth") rather than earned through friction. Desire is clear and present but not dramatized as conflicted choice with visible cost at the turn.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Cautious exuberance is named once ("cautious exuberance of someone approaching the edge") and later "transformed into something fiercer." The prose maintains elevated lyricism throughout but does not modulate with stated crisis pressure. No tonal charge at the final image—"smiled as her body dissolved" reads serene rather than exuberant or cautious. Label-only; no sustained embodiment across pressure.</comment>
