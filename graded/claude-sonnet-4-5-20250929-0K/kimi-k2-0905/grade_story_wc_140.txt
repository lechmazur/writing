<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to prove her reality through collected voices is clear and drives her actions, but her interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The death certificate creates a strong initial stake, yet her emotional responses often read as performed metaphor ("felt the texture of memories rise beneath her skin like braille") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to feed the certificate to the tide and stamp the container shows agency, though the progression feels more accumulative than driven by internal conflict forcing incompatible wants into collision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear orientation (Mara, port containers, tidal rhythm) established early. Closure arrives on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara moves from erased to active archivist, feeding her death certificate to the tide and stamping a memorial, with the conceptual cost of remaining "officially no one" made legible in the final paragraph. The escalation proceeds through layered discoveries (archive, dying captain, micro-recorder) that deepen rather than reverse, fitting the chosen lens, though the captain's exposition and the poison's mechanics introduce mild causality softness that doesn't break the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The container labyrinth functions as a constraint throughout: Mara climbs tiers, navigates aisles with different light qualities, and the metal walls become the canvas for her voice fragments, directly enabling her final act of stamping the memorial label. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—sodium halos, brine, groaning metal—and the micro-recorder and poison label operate as tools that charge the closure image. The port's spatial choreography remains clear across moves, and the tidal rhythm filters perception without becoming ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving Mara existed despite erasure—is signaled early and tightens through the archive discovery and the captain's revelation that the poison erases names systematically. Her decision to "invert the poison's purpose" by gluing voice fragments to containers narrows her options (she commits to visibility despite remaining officially dead) and the ending shows a visible trade: she gains memorial presence but remains nameless, a cost that charges the final image. One meaningful deepening (archive to active memorial creation) suffices for this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: erased histories, collected fragments, and the poison as erasure tool converge without explicit moralizing. The final stamped label—"Here remembered those the city tried to forget"—offers a resonant answer to whether memory can survive institutional erasure, though the line verges on thematic statement. The micro-recorder's laughter and whistles charge the ending with sensory proof of reclaimed presence, and the piece resists tidy resolution (Mara remains nameless), but the captain's exposition ("every seventh tide, the shipment expanded, erasing names") leans toward allegory that slightly dilutes the concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Mara with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (she "collect[s] fragments of overheard stories the way dockworkers pocket dropped washers"). Diction fits the port setting and Mara's erasure: nameless, rhythm-defined identity. However, several passages drift into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-specific ("the texture of memories would emerge," "the piece invites reflection")—not head-hopping, but a tonal reach that slightly undermines voice modesty. The captain's dying monologue is compressed and functional, avoiding full dramatization of his speech patterns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors often stacked in single sentences: "death certificate crammed in her pocket, the clerical error that had erased her like a smudge of ink" and "label...fluttering like a dying moth." Some images are vivid and apt (sodium lamps as bleeding moons, containers groaning like whales), but others blur under accumulation without clear propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "erased her" / "her own erasure" / "erased histories" / "erased stevedores" recur without evolving function. No major causality break, but rhythm flatlines in the middle third under metaphor load, and the final paragraph's "texture of memories rise beneath her skin like braille" revisits an earlier conceit without fresh charge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise—bureaucratic death plus poison that erases memory—offers a fresh synthesis of Kafkaesque erasure and toxic historical suppression, grounded in the container-port setting. The turn (inverting the poison label into memorial stamp) feels earned and non-obvious, and the choice to make Mara "officially no one" yet socially present avoids the safety middle. However, the poison mechanics (every seventh tide, erasing names from photos and minds) lean toward allegory-template convenience, and the dying captain as exposition vessel is a familiar structural choice that limits surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's erasure via death certificate error is present from paragraph two, drives her collecting behavior across multiple beats (archive discovery, captain encounter, voice-fragment gluing), and shapes the closure when she feeds the certificate to the tide. Her choices—climbing the tiers, pocketing the label, stamping the container—turn the plot. The element is causally active and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The poison label appears in paragraph seven, is pocketed with tactile detail ("burn cold against her thigh"), connects causally to the archivist's death and the captain's cargo confession, and returns transformed in the final act when Mara stamps it onto a container as memorial. It bridges the poison's erasure function and her counter-archive, appearing in setup, middle revelation, and closure with reweighted meaning and visible cost (she repurposes the instrument of forgetting).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Erased histories frame Mara's stake from the opening (officially dead, barcode invalid) and escalate through the captain's revelation of the poison shipment designed to "dissolve recalcitrant histories." The concept constrains her options (she cannot re-enter official life) and enables her tactic (create unofficial memory via voice fragments). It charges the closure when she stamps the memorial and steps into the crowd still "officially no one," making the cost of remaining erased yet present undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently" appears in paragraph three as a description of the container aisles (sodium light, salt shadow, yesterday's echo) and recurs subtly when Mara's voice fragments "garbled" drone sensors by "filtering reality differently." It enables one tactical beat (evading patrols) and charges the setting's perceptual variability, but the attribute remains more atmospheric than a constraint that forces a visible tradeoff. Present in setup and late payoff, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Layering (smoothing story fragments "like sheets of tin," gluing voice scraps to container walls) is Mara's method from paragraph four and drives the climactic beat when she "glue[s] tiny scraps of the captain's recording to container walls, coating the labyrinth with a new skin of memory." The action defines her counter-archive tactic and culminates in the stamped label. It appears in setup, middle execution, and closure participation, with specificity (fragments → layered skin → stamped memorial) that is difficult to swap.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Collecting overheard stories is introduced in paragraph four and drives every middle beat: Mara gathers an argument, lullaby, joke, then discovers the archive and micro-recorder of stevedore laughter. The method shapes her tactic (layering voices to prove reality) and the closure's mechanics (gluing recordings, stamping the label with a written line). Signaled early, executed across multiple beats, and causally active at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is anchored in paragraph three and constrains Mara's movement throughout: she climbs external stairs to the sixth tier, navigates aisles with varying light, finds the archive hatch, and finally stamps a bare container. The setting provides the canvas for her voice-fragment tactic (metal walls echo sound) and enables her evasion of drones. It pressures choices (verticality, hiding), supplies resources (archive, recorder), and charges the final image (tagged container heard by passing workers). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tidal rhythm is named in the opening line ("tidal hush at dawn") and recurs at key beats: "turn of the tide" when she finds the label, "each corner she glued...tides drumming below like a slow heart," and the closing "rhythm of tides carried on." The timeframe structures the narrative's pulse and Mara's identity ("answered only to the wet slap of waves"), but does not tighten decisions with a live clock that alters tactics under pressure. Present across the arc with atmospheric and thematic charge, yet functionally loose.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to discover the texture of memories" to "prove she had once been real" is dramatized in paragraph five and drives her collecting behavior, archive search, and final memorial act. The friction between wanting proof and remaining officially erased creates the ending's cost: she gains presence through others' memory but cannot reclaim her own name. The motivation is embodied in action (pocketing fragments, climbing, stamping) and tested by the poison's counter-force.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Nameless identity is established early ("no name that authorities recognized," "answered only to the wet slap of waves") and modulates with pressure: Mara moves from passive erasure to active anonymity, feeding her death certificate away and stepping into the crowd "still officially no one." The tone remains coherent—elegiac, rhythm-driven—through turns, and the final image charges the namelessness with paradoxical presence (workers hear phantom voices). The tonal consistency and closure linkage are strong, though the execution leans poetic-declarative rather than emerging strictly from scene pressure.</comment>
