<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kit's motivation is clear (fleeing loneliness through reciprocity), and the moon-rock ritual embodies his need for transaction. The arrival of Lila and his choice to hand over the fragment provide visible agency, though his interior contradictions (believing/not believing rumors) remain largely asserted rather than acted in scene. The ending choice to board the train feels more symbolic than earned by prior causality—he leaves because "the timeframe had arrived," not because a prior choice foreclosed staying.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the station accumulates pilgrims, stories, and sprouting seeds until the clock spins forward. Orientation is present early (Kit at platform three, dawn ritual). The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Kit boards the train, station promises to keep loneliness in lost-property), but the cost is oblique—what exactly does Kit forfeit by leaving? The narrative asserts "when the story changes, the teller must leave" without on-page stakes to make that departure costly or urgent. Felt cost is implied but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ivy-choked station is vivid and purposeful: the backward-crawling clock, rusted platform, turquoise paint flakes. The moon seeds planted between rails and the resulting ivy trellis spelling Latin departure times charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across beats (platform three, ticket booth wall, carriage window). The setting constrains and shapes the closure: Kit must leave the station for it to remain a site of reciprocity for others.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (curing loneliness through reciprocity) is signaled early. The key tightening is Lila's arrival and the seed-doubling, which draws pilgrims and transforms the station. However, escalation is largely elliptical: "word spread," "pilgrims arrived," "one autumn dusk" compress the pressure rather than dramatizing it. Kit's agency at the end (boarding the train) feels dictated by thematic necessity ("the teller must leave") rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The price of leaving is stated, not felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (reciprocity multiplies, loneliness shared becomes cure) emerges from concrete beats: the moon-rock fragment doubles, saplings chime, stories are swapped. The final image—station waving with leaves, loneliness kept in lost-property—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in Kit's jokes (armor against silence) and the clock's backward crawl. Minor slip: "when the story changes, the teller must leave" edges toward meta-commentary, though it remains anchored in Kit's logbook handoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV, Kit's perceptual signature is consistent: "desperately jocular armor," "echo in the iron rafters sounded like passengers clapping." Diction fits his logistician background and off-grid state. Dialogue (Kit and Lila) carries subtext and distinct rhythm ("Would you like to hear the one about the train" vs. "I'm here to collect the moon tax"). Distance is stable. Minor register drift: "polite to the last" and "perfect polite yet anarchic" veer toward narrator rather than Kit's interior lexicon under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening line anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high in most beats. However, several passages loop or paraphrase: "loneliness, he realized, was a station you could leave" closely echoes the later "Loneliness, measured in grams, decreased"; "desperately jocular" appears three times. Template cadence appears in some stems ("He carried… because rumor claimed"; "Kit did not believe… but he believed"). Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled; "ivy braided itself into trellis arches overnight, spelling departure times in Latin" reads vivid and purposeful. Apply cumulative loop/scaffold penalty −0.8 for paraphrase and stem repetition that dull momentum in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise (moon rock absorbs solitude, seeds double through reciprocity, station becomes swap-meet) synthesizes myth and logistics in a specific way. The backward-crawling clock and ivy spelling Latin are fresh inflections. Emotional truth (loneliness as portable burden, stories as currency) avoids sentimentality. The ending choice (Kit boards first train in decades) feels earned in hindsight by the reciprocity rule. Minor proximity concern: "station you could leave" and "trains would resume" echo familiar metaphors without full transformation, but the specificity of the logbook, trellis arches, and "lost-property forever" lift the whole above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kit (elusive disaster-relief logistician, off-grid, on sabbatical) is present throughout and makes two key choices: handing Lila the fragment and boarding the train at the end. His logistician background colors his reciprocity calculus ("every warehouse… demanded something be put back") and the "logbook of jokes." However, his occupation is more thematic accent than tactical constraint—his relief-work past informs motivation but does not shape on-page problem-solving. The character is essential to voice and stakes, but swapping "logistician" for another itinerant helper role would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Moon-rock fragment appears in four beats: Kit's opening ritual (carried in inner pocket), the handoff to Lila, the doubling ("two chalk-white seeds"), and the final window-press as Kit departs. It drives the central turn (seed-doubling) and charges the closure image. Cost linkage: Kit gives it away, enabling the cure but losing his talisman. The rock's Apollo 15 provenance and "absorb solitude" rumor are specific and irreplaceable. Strong integration; only slightly short of indispensable because the story could theoretically pivot to another magical object with moderate rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Reciprocity is the story's engine: Kit's belief that "every warehouse… demanded something be put back," Lila's punchline "Reciprocity starts with multiplication," the swap-meet structure, and Kit's final departure to preserve the station's function. It shapes tactics (planting seeds, trading stories) and the closure cost (Kit must leave so others can arrive). The concept constrains choice across beats and is irreplaceable—remove it and the narrative collapses. High integration, though the word itself is slightly over-stated on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" appears three times and colors Kit's dialogue ("Knight to tin can four," "The 12:05 Regret is delayed"). It functions as armor against silence and loneliness, enabling him to greet Lila and keep pilgrims engaged. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost—Kit never has to choose between jocularity and another tactic, nor does the trait prevent him from a necessary action. The attribute is purposeful but not load-bearing; it could be replaced by another deflection style without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Catalyze" shapes two beats: the opening assertion that silence would "catalyze memories of flooded cities," and implicitly the station's transformation when seeds and stories catalyze the pilgrim influx. The verb is apt for Kit's chemistry of reciprocity, but it is more conceptual than actional—no on-page moment dramatizes Kit actively catalyzing a reaction with visible cost or trade-off. The word enriches theme but is swappable with "trigger" or "spark" without structural loss. Middle functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Improbable rumor chains" drive the station's repopulation: "Word spread… first to the night watchman… then to the postman… finally to the mayor, each retelling adding carriages of impossibility." The method is signaled, its mechanics matter (rumors compound, pilgrims arrive), and it enables the middle turn. However, the rumor spread is summarized rather than dramatized—we do not see Kit or Lila seed the rumor or manage its path. The method is causally important but not irreplaceable; gossip or a posted sign could serve similarly. Solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The disused railway station overgrown with ivy is indispensable: the backward-crawling clock anchors time pressure, platform three hosts all action, rusted rails hold the planted seeds, ivy braids into trellis arches, turquoise paint flakes cover the seeds, and the station's threshold (ivy gateway) frames Kit's departure. The setting constrains tactics (stationary swap-meet, no trains until the end) and charges the closure image (station waves with leaves). Removing this exact setting breaks the story's spatial and symbolic logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"When the story changes" appears explicitly at the climax: "One autumn dusk, the clock shuddered, hands spinning forward, and Kit understood the timeframe had arrived: when the story changes, the teller must leave." The backward-crawling clock (stopping at 11:47, moving one minute back each dawn) provides time pressure and marks the threshold. However, the timeframe is more thematic trigger than tactical constraint—Kit does not race a deadline or alter moves under time scarcity. The element shapes the ending but is somewhat abstract. Mid-high integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kit's motivation (to find the cure for loneliness) drives every choice: carrying the moon rock, greeting Lila, planting seeds, hosting pilgrims, measuring loneliness "in grams," and finally boarding the train to preserve the cure for others. It is dramatized through his rituals and the swap-meet structure, and the closure cost (leaving the station) is directly tied to ensuring the cure persists. The motivation is irreplaceable and charges the final image. Strong integration; slightly short of indispensable only because the exact phrasing ("cure for loneliness") is slightly over-articulated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Polite anarchy" saturates the tone: the clock "politely refusing the future," Kit's courteous jokes amid chaos, Lila's "perfectly polite yet anarchic" punchline, the ivy spelling Latin (learned disorder), and the station's final wave "polite to the last." The tone modulates with pressure (gentle at opening, charged at Lila's arrival, wistful at closure) and charges the final image. It is coherent and purposeful, though the phrase itself is slightly over-stated ("polite" appears six times). High integration, nearly indispensable to the story's emotional texture.</comment>
