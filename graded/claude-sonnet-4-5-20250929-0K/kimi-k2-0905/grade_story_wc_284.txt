<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority shows genuine contradiction—"prudently daring, because there was nothing left to lose"—and his choices (powering the transmitter, crushing the pillbox) constrain future options with visible cost. However, the emotional arc leans heavily on abstract courage metaphors rather than embodied sensation under peak stress; phrases like "silver hush of responsibility" and "gardeners of possible futures" read as writerly distance when the moment calls for immediate pressure. The ending choice is earned by prior causality, but the interior voice sometimes abstracts rather than inhabits the scarred body and burned identity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (burned spy, cliffside path, spring mist) arrive early and hold. The causal chain is clean: pillbox micro-code → slate cipher → listening station → transmission, with each beat motivated by prior knowledge. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): he transmits the confession, crushes the pillbox, and walks into anonymity, forecloses his burned identity with visible cost ("the new scar tissue pulling tight"). One tightening (discovering coordinates, entering the station, sending the signal) is sufficient at this length and the Drive Lens reads Causal with lyric texture. Minor slip: "Where unused courage waits, the snow remembers" functions more as thematic echo than tactical constraint; the phrase does not narrow options as sharply as the coordinates themselves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff is anchored early with mist, cliffside path, frost, and briars; the decommissioned listening station supplies concrete constraints (dead keypad, jump-start trick, wind-turbine trickle, vacuum tubes). The pillbox battery and tarp-strip bandage show micro-setting shaping tactics. The snowdrop blooming through slate charges the final image and ties to the courage motif without forced symbolism. However, the interior station ("mold and salt, consoles draped in ghostly tarps like furniture in an abandoned chapel") leans decorative; no element of the console layout or station geography alters a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: transmit proof of the director's betrayal to fix broken lives. Pressure escalates through layered obstacles (weather-scoured cipher, dead keypad, backup transmitter requiring wind power, vacuum-tube warmup) and the protagonist's agency drives each beat. The confession recording and transmission decision foreclose his safety with visible cost ("destroy him a second time"). The knee injury and bandaging add texture but do not materially narrow tactics. One meaningful tightening (coordinates → station → transmission) is sufficient under the Causal lens, and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of unused courage and fixing what's broken emerges from concrete acts (transmitting the confession, crushing the pillbox, bandaging the knee) and the snowdrop image. The pillbox destruction ("grinding the portrait into the snow so no one could vouchsafe another legend") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, lines like "spies are gardeners of possible futures" and "the meeting itself was enough to begin fixing what was broken" edge toward articulation rather than dramatization. The final image (scar tissue "pulling tight as if smiling") is strong but the thematic charge arrives more through assertion ("and that the meeting itself was enough") than through the pressure of withheld cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a controlled lyric register; perceptual signature (mist, silver, tilt, slate, zephyr) is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction elevates purposefully ("vouchsafed," "zephyr curling," "cipher") and matches the spy-craft world. No dialogue appears, appropriately for a solo mission. Minor register drift: phrases like "quarterly profits" and "the new scar tissue pulling tight as if smiling for the first time in years" briefly shift toward expository clarity rather than the focalizer's immediate perception under stress. Free indirect style is clean throughout; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in tactical beats (pillbox battery jump-start, burst transmission spoofing). However, recurrent phrasing creates template cadence: "silver hush" appears three times, "tilted/tilt" four times, and "prudently daring" is echoed in the bandage line without added pressure. The phrase "Where unused courage waits, the snow remembers" functions as thematic anchor but is paraphrased across multiple beats ("to find where unused courage waits," "He did not know where unused courage waits"). Stock metaphors appear under stress: "dying star flinging its atoms outward," "white flag of a season." Figurative density in the final third (zephyr, snowdrop, silver dust, snow-soft signal) risks overwriting without pattern-teaching. No hard causality breaks, but the loops and stock images dull propulsion at closure. Applying patterned-artifact baseline (−0.6 for recurrence + stock metaphor strings) and template cadence (−0.4) within Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The burnt-spy-seeking-redemption premise is widely templated; the transformation comes through specific details (micro-code under breath-fog, boot-heel cipher in snow, pillbox battery hack, snowdrop through slate). The decision to crush the pillbox and walk into anonymity rather than claim credit offers a non-obvious moral calculus. However, the core arc (lone operative transmits proof of betrayal, accepts the cost, merges with civilians) closely follows genre convention without a structural or perspectival surprise. The lyric texture and spy-craft specificity elevate but do not fully escape the derivative frame. No close echo of famous lines, and emotional complexity (scarred face, dissolved loyalty, Sera's memory) adds depth.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The burned spy's choices drive every major beat: interpreting the pillbox code, uncovering the slate cipher, jump-starting the hatch, recording the confession, transmitting, crushing the pillbox, bandaging, and walking away. Each decision narrows options and the final choice (transmission and pillbox destruction) articulates visible cost. Setup early, beat involvement across at least four distinct moments, causal pressure high, closure linkage strong (final walk with new scar). High irreplaceability: the burnt status and scarred body anchor motivation and stakes throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The engraved pillbox appears in beat one (clicks in pocket), reveals micro-code in beat two (breathed upon), supplies battery for keypad in beat three, is crushed in beat four (grinding the portrait), and its silver dust appears in the final image. Setup early, beat involvement across four distinct uses, causal pressure (enables entry, charged destruction forecloses future vouchsafing), closure linkage (dust in wake), high specificity (Sera's portrait, micro-code). Cost connection clear: crushing it erases his last identity anchor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept "fixing what's broken" is articulated in narration ("the chance to fix what he had broken," "fix the lives broken by his own silence," "begin fixing what was broken") and shapes the dominant stake (transmit proof to repair betrayed teams). It constrains the decision to confess and transmit despite personal cost. However, the concept is more thematic frame than on-page tactical constraint; the transmission choice would function identically if framed as justice or revenge. Setup in first third, closure participation via the bandage and final reflection, but swappable with similar redemption language. Lyric reprise (broken → fixing → stitches) reweights meaning but does not narrow options mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" is introduced early ("he was prudently daring, because there was nothing left to lose") and echoed at the bandage moment ("prudently daring to believe that healing could begin with such small, precise stitches"). The trait justifies the risk of transmission but is label-asserted rather than demonstrated through a visible tradeoff where prudence and daring conflict in a single choice. The attribute appears as characterization rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Setup present, closure echo, but no middle beat where the trait forces a visible either/or decision with cost. Swappable with "reckless resolve" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears twice: Sera "vouchsafed him his last identity" (setup) and he crushes the pillbox "so no one could vouchsafe another legend from its image" (closure). The action frames the protagonist's burned status and the final destruction forecloses future identity construction with visible cost. Setup early, closure linkage strong, cost connection clear. However, the action itself is not the driver of beats; the transmission and confession are the major turns. "Vouchsafe" functions more as thematic bookend than causal engine. Swappable with "granted" or "authorize" with minor edits to diction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Codes in accumulated snow" is described as "an old field trick" and the boot-heel scratches in snow reveal coordinates to the listening station (beat two). The method enables the protagonist to locate the station, a causal link to closure. However, the cipher's mechanics are told ("written by boot-heel scratches that the next thaw would erase") rather than shown; we do not see the protagonist decode the pattern or struggle with partial legibility beyond "weather-scoured." Setup in first third, one causal beat (coordinates unlock the station), closure participation indirect (enables transmission). The method could be swapped for any hidden-message device without altering pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff is anchored early (cliffside path, mist, spring air with teeth, moon above fog, slate beneath snow, briars over hatch, sea below) and supplies concrete constraints: the hidden hatch, wind-turbine power for the transmitter, and the snowdrop blooming through slate in the final image. The bluff's geography matters (cliff isolation, decommissioned station) and the mist provides cover. Setup immediate, beat involvement across at least three moments (path, hatch, station interior, final exterior), causal pressure (bluff hides the station and supplies wind power), closure linkage (snowdrop image). Micro-setting (body, pillbox, slate) also functions as constraint. High integration but the interior station description is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"At the tilt of the earth toward spring" appears in the opening and closing ("tilted light," "first commuters of spring") and the timeframe (night, moon, before dawn) tracks. However, the seasonal frame does not tighten decisions; the mission could occur in any season with identical pressure. The phrase functions as lyric texture and thematic resonance (thaw, snowdrop, healing) rather than a live clock. Setup early, closure echo, but no middle beat where spring timing alters tactics or imposes cost. Swappable with any transitional season.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where unused courage waits" is introduced via the pillbox inscription and repeated across beats ("the need to find whatever scrap of courage he had never used," "He did not know where unused courage waits—only that he had finally gone to meet it"). The desire shapes the dominant stake (transmit proof, reclaim agency) and the final choice (transmission and self-destruction of identity) dramatizes the courage with visible cost. However, the motivation is abstract and told more than enacted through friction between competing wants; the protagonist's drive is consistent rather than conflicted. Setup early, closure participation strong, cost legible, but limited friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Silver hush" recurs three times (mist swallowing footfall, responsibility, bullet expectation) and anchors tone: quiet, cold, liminal, charged with unspoken cost. The tone modulates subtly from wary opening to tense transmission to quiet closure without tonal rupture. The final image (signal "snow-soft and relentless") echoes the hush and charges the ending. Setup immediate, beat involvement across at least three moments, closure linkage strong. However, recurrence of "silver hush" as exact phrase risks becoming a tic rather than tonal shift; the mood is more static than modulating under pressure. High coherence but limited dynamic range.</comment>
