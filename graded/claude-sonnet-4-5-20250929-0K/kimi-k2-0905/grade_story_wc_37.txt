<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation (rekindle a dying realm) is clear and her actions align throughout, but interiority remains abstract—"scattered memories fluttered inside her skull like moths" describes state without embodying contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The climactic moment where she slams mica shards into her ribs to sharpen recollection reads as externalized pain-as-portal rather than an earned choice emerging from prior contradictory wants. Her name-recovery shout feels convenient rather than inevitable, and the final acceptance ("let them keep her name") lacks visible cost since we never see what holding it would foreclose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (memory keeper), where (alchemical orchard greenhouse), and the stakes (rekindle dying realm) clearly within the opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered metaphor (mica window expands, silhouettes solidify, songs weave light) and the closure reconfigures the mirror-world premise when "every mirror refused to reflect another's light" becomes collaborative song. However, the causal chain from her solo lullaby to collective chorus to dawn-weaving feels compressed—silhouettes appear and align without clear agency or cost in that transition, weakening the escalation into closure. The ending image (new trees, restored chorus) lands as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is asserted ("memories knit together, yet she let them keep her name") rather than dramatized as a legible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with concrete, selective detail: trees growing from alembics, roots in quicksilver, pomegranate fruits that chime. Sensory specificity (phosphor smear "like remembered joy," tarry vines, tin foil scales) filters through the keeper's crisis perception. The mica window constrains her choice (she presses it to the pane, it fractures under attack, she drives shards into her ribs) and the final image of glitter falling to sprout new trees charges closure. The micro-setting of body and tool successfully substitutes for broader spatial choreography at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rekindle the dying realm by recovering melody—is signaled early and maintained. One meaningful tightening occurs when tarry vines attack and shatter the mica window, forcing the keeper to drive shards into her chest to sharpen recollection. However, the turn from her solo song to collective chorus involves silhouettes appearing "from the shadows" without clear agency or price; they align with her melody but no dramatized choice earns their participation. The cost at closure (letting them keep her name) is told rather than shown as a trade-off that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely from the premise: isolation (each mirror refusing to reflect another's light) versus collective song. The final insight—"realm learned to breathe in chorus"—arises from the keeper's shift from solo lullaby to canon that "begged every reflection to sing its neighbor's verse," grounded in the on-page action of the greenhouse vibrating like a bell. The recurring motif of woven dawns reweights at closure when self-sustaining tapestry replaces manual braiding. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("mysteries should remain sung rather than spoken," "communities gathered...teaching children") rather than letting the image resonate without gloss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyrical ("rose and copper braided by invisible hands," "echoes stitched from starlight and regret"), voice-consistent across the piece. However, the elevated register occasionally clashes with the immediacy of crisis: "pain sharpened recollection" and "tuning fork struck at the heart" read as writerly metaphors rather than the keeper's lived perception under duress. The final paragraph's shift into collective we ("they walked out...communities gathered") blurs focalization without clear section break, though the dominant lens remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: nearly every sentence carries metaphor (moths against glass, dawn-threads re-spool, night clotted, memories bled as silver dust). While many images are vivid and specific, the accumulation in peak beats—"tarry vines," "audible light," "lantern hung inside the mirror world"—borders on overwriting that slows propulsion. Template cadence appears in the final third: "She felt...yet she let"; "They lifted...chanting"; "Behind them...self-sustaining." The phrase "bound release" (the required tone element) appears only once in the penultimate paragraph ("pain become portal"), feeling retrofitted rather than woven. Paraphrase loop: "woven dawns continued to braid themselves each morning, self-sustaining, a living tapestry" restates the same idea across three phrases without added pressure. Apply −0.6 for density overload in peak beats and −0.4 for template cadence and loop in the final third, totaling −1.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of mirror world, alchemical greenhouse, and song-as-light offers a non-obvious premise. The turn—"every mirror refused to reflect another's light"—reframes the dying-realm problem in a fresh way, and the solution (canon inviting each reflection to sing its neighbor's verse) feels inevitable in hindsight. However, the emotional beats (scattered memories, forgotten songs, villagers as silhouettes) draw heavily on familiar fantasy templates (memory keeper restoring a lost world). The final image of new ordinary trees and children learning songs edges toward genre-standard restoration without a sharp, specific cost that would elevate the premise into high originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The scattered memory keeper is present throughout and her choices (pressing mica to pane, singing, driving shards into ribs, altering the song to a canon) create key turns. She is the sole on-page character making decisions until silhouettes appear to amplify her song. However, the climactic choice—shouting her own name—resolves her scattered state conveniently rather than through a trade-off that forecloses a path. The character is essential but her agency at closure feels asserted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mica window appears in four distinct beats: she carries it (opening), presses it against the pane to see the reverse orchard, it expands into a membrane, and a thorn shatters it. She then drives shards into her chest, creating "a new lens" through which she sees infinite overlapping orchards. The window's fragmentation enables the insight and the final image (crumbled glitter sprouting new trees) charges closure. Strong causal role and closure linkage, though the window's mechanics (how it expands, why shattering it sharpens recollection) remain somewhat opaque.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Woven dawns are introduced in the opening ("each dawn here was not born but woven") and recur at closure ("woven dawns continued to braid themselves each morning, self-sustaining"). The concept shapes the central problem (dawn-threads severed by silence) and the keeper's goal is explicitly to "re-spool" them. However, the mechanics of how recovered melody weaves dawn are told rather than shown in action. The concept frames stakes but does not constrain a middle choice; it functions more as thematic background than a live tactical element until the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Knits communities together" is stated thematically ("songs that knits communities together") and the keeper's solution—turning solo lullaby into a canon that requires each reflection to sing its neighbor's verse—enacts the attribute on the page. The collective singing "swaddled the greenhouse" and "silhouettes solidified," showing the attribute enabling the climax. However, the attribute is introduced as exposition ("songs were the loom") rather than dramatized through a prior choice with cost. Present in two beats (initial explanation, final collective song) and shapes the resolution, but label-reliant at setup.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Swaddle" appears twice: "If she could swaddle the greenhouse in recovered melody" (plan stated) and "Together they swaddled the greenhouse, wrapping trunks and trellises in audible light" (action executed). The action is causally central—swaddling the greenhouse in song triggers dawn-threads to appear and drives the climax. However, the verb could be replaced with "envelop" or "wrap" without structural change; the specific connotation of swaddling (protective, nurturing) is not leveraged in the text. The action is essential but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Forgotten songs are signaled early ("communities once gathered to sing forgotten songs"), the keeper catches a memory (grandmother's lullaby), and she begins to sing it in the middle beat. The method shapes her attempt: she lacks the chorus, so silhouettes appear to feed her forgotten verses, and together they restore the songs. The method constrains her solo effort (she falters alone) and the resolution (collective memory recovery). The mechanics of how songs weave light remain metaphorical but the method is causally active across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night is anchored immediately and supplies vivid, specific details (trees from alembics, quicksilver roots, pomegranate chimes, phosphor smear, tarry vines). The setting pressures choices: the endless night is the problem she must solve, the greenhouse vibrates when she sings, and tarry vines attack her voice. The setting's final transformation (luminous greenhouse as transplanted heart) charges the closure image. The micro-setting (body, mica window, greenhouse structure) constrains tactics and the ending's meaning depends on the setting's shift from dying to radiant.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The mirror world is mentioned in the opening line and the final paragraph ("through the mirrored gate"), and the insight that "every mirror refused to reflect another's light" is pivotal. However, the mirror-world setting functions more as a conceptual frame than a timeframe that tightens decisions. No live clock or urgency tied to the mirror-world's temporal rules appears; the "endless night" is static until resolved. The element is present and thematically important but does not constrain tactics or create time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation—"to rekindle a dying realm whose heartbeats had slowed to a tremble"—is stated early and drives every choice: she presses the mica window, sings, drives shards into her ribs, and alters the song to invitation. The motivation is coherent and on-page cost (pain, memory fragmentation) accompanies her pursuit. However, the motivation is delivered as exposition ("she knew her purpose") rather than dramatized through a conflicted choice at setup. The desire shapes two major beats (solo song, collective turn) and the ending, but lacks visible friction between competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The tone blends lyrical melancholy with urgent restoration, and the phrase "bound release" appears once near the end ("pain become portal"). The tone modulates appropriately: reflective in the opening, intensifying when tarry vines attack, and lifting into communal triumph at closure. However, "bound release" as a specific tonal signature is not woven through turns; it is named retrospectively. The tone is coherent and supports pressure, but the required element feels added rather than structural. The final image's tone (luminous hope, collective breath) charges the ending, but "bound release" itself does not.</comment>
