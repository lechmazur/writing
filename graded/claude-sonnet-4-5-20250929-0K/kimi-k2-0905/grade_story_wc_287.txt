<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through consistent micro-choices—stealing the gauge tooth, working the lock, descending to find the boy—each action grounded in her role as fire escape gardener who knows municipal fines yet coaxes life from paint buckets. Internal contradiction appears in "translation" versus theft, and her final teaching moment reveals hierarchy of values with visible cost (the gauge tooth falls, nasturtium roots). The boy's presence and reaction are underdeveloped; his interiority remains opaque, limiting relationship crucible. Minor penalty for the somewhat abstracted emotional register in peak beats ("quivering hush," "protected vulnerability") that occasionally drifts toward label-speak without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The pattern is taught early—harbor imagery, oar rhythm, fire escape layers—and accumulates through the lock opening, descent, rose petal exchange, rooftop teaching, until the final image (boy descending with lavender, gauge tooth falling to root nasturtium) reweights the opening with conceptual cost. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the boy carries "a small reflected moon" into dark corridors, crystallizing options with undeniable pressure even though the social cost remains oblique. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the watering-can climb. One tightening occurs when the locked door forces the theft and use of the gauge tooth, narrowing her tactical options. Cost is legible in the fallen tool and the boy's transformed stance, though the price to Mara herself could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fire escape, rooftop garden, harbor, and basement stairwell constrain Mara's choices throughout: the bolted door forces theft of the gauge tooth, the moon provides working light, the descent into mildew-scented darkness guides pacing, and the rooftop parapet becomes the teaching platform. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "diesel and starfish," "salt-stained concrete," lavender as homesick memory. The lockmaster's gauge tooth and watering can function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image when the tooth falls into the gutter where nasturtium will root. Minor deduction for occasional postcard framing ("luminous harbor by moonlight") that risks static beauty over pressure, but spatial choreography remains clear and the garden's stolen-inches status shapes every choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reflect light into dark corners by proving the sky exists to the trapped boy. The locked door provides one meaningful tightening that forces theft and escalates risk. Mara's agency drives each beat—steal, pick lock, descend, exchange petal, teach gardening—culminating in the boy's descent with lavender and internalized moon, a renunciation of passivity with visible cost (the gauge tooth lost, the boy now exposed to consequences). Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens through sensory and spatial deepening. Minor penalty: the landlord opposition and municipal fines are declared but never materialize as on-page friction; the boy's trapped state is asserted more than dramatized, reducing felt stakes. The oar-rhythm motif charges the closure but the middle could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: coaxing life in stolen inches, translating theft into gift, reflecting light as resistance. The rose petal's fall as "permission to speak secrets aloud" and its transformation into teaching tool avoid overt statement. The final image—boy carrying internalized moon, nasturtium rooting where the tool fell—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in Mara's "translation" claim, the boy's silence, and the oar rhythm as promise of propulsion. Minor deduction for occasional thematic echo: "corridors could be cages" and "reflect light into dark corners" risk prompt-like articulation, though they remain embedded in action rather than standing as thesis statements. The lavender and petal constrain choices and charge closure effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited through Mara; perceptual signature is strong in gardening idiom ("pinch tomato suckers," "speak to soil") and pragmatic-wistful diction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment ("felt the quivering hush") to wider framing ("the lockmaster's tooth, mission finished"). Dialogue is minimal, functional, and carries subtext: "See? Every oar is a promise" teaches without sermon. Register occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("phosphorescence," "parchment held to fire") that, while beautiful, edges beyond Mara's established voice under peak pressure. The boy's interiority is inaccessible, appropriately, but his silence risks passivity rather than charged withheld speech. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The rhythm control is strong but some metaphoric density in high-pressure beats (lock as midwife, moon as comb) slows immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and several images land with precision: "tiny eviction notice," "pull, lift, glide," "diesel and starfish." Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence—blade against skin, heartbeat slosh, tarpaulin wings, midwife shoulder, scatter of seeds, silver chains, moon combing hair—creating density that occasionally stalls momentum in high-pressure beats (the lock-picking, the descent). The oar-rhythm refrain borders on template cadence across three uses. Minor paraphrase loop: "quivering hush" recurs without added pressure. Pronoun references and spatial choreography remain clear. No major grammatical errors. The final image is strong, but pervasive metaphoric density and some stock poetic constructions ("voice wrapped in protected vulnerability") lower the score. Apply −0.6 for density and pattern in peak beats, per overwriting checks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The fire escape gardener premise transforms the urban-gardening trope through specific detail: paint-bucket tomatoes, smuggled rosebush, lockmaster's gauge tooth as enabling tool. The oar-rhythm motif and moon-as-reflection synthesis feel purposeful rather than ornamental. Emotional specificity avoids templates in Mara's translation claim and the boy's silence. The nasturtium rooting from the fallen tool offers a fresh, earned closure image. Minor deduction for proximity to familiar resistance-through-small-acts narratives and the "light into darkness" metaphor, which, while executed with care, remains a widely used frame. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat, earning solid originality within a recognizable template. Risk-taking in lyric density and the locked-door inciting constraint elevate without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara appears in setup (watering can climb, rosebush), drives the middle (steals tooth, picks lock, descends, finds boy), and shapes closure (teaches gardening, watches him descend with lavender and internalized moon). Her choices create every key turn: theft enables entry, descent enables exchange, teaching enables the boy's transformation. Removing her exact role—fire escape gardener who knows fines yet coaxes life—would break the story's logic and stakes. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement across three acts, and closure linkage. Minor deduction: her internal conflict (theft as translation) could constrain one additional mid-scene choice with visible cost to reach indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The gauge tooth appears in setup (stolen from locksmith), is used in one extended middle beat (picking the rooftop door lock "the way a midwife guides a shoulder"), and reappears at closure (falls into gutter, roots nasturtium). Two-gate participation (setup, payoff) with one functional use. The fall charges the final image with cost (tool lost, life continues). However, the tooth could be swapped for any lock-pick without altering story logic; its specificity (bitting gauge, numbered notches, brass sliver) does not constrain Mara's method or enable a unique tactic. Lyric reprise (first third to last line) reweights meaning but does not demonstrate irreplaceability. Score in mid-6s for purposeful recurrence without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quivering hush" appears three times: after the petal falls ("felt the quivering hush that lives between an ending and what insists on beginning"), between Mara and the boy ("the quivering hush between them was answer enough"), and implicitly in the final teaching dawn. It frames the dominant stake (threshold moments, silence as communication) and the boy's wordless exchange. However, it operates more as thematic echo than tactical constraint; removing the phrase would not alter Mara's choices or the boy's transformation. It shapes atmosphere and tone but does not narrow options or enable moves. One causal touch: the boy's silence (hush) prompts Mara to offer the petal instead of speech. Score in mid-5s for thematic presence with limited tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is declared once in narrator summary ("Mara was a fire escape gardener, wistfully pragmatic, who knew every municipal fine by heart yet still coaxed tomatoes"). The trait is demonstrated through action: she knows fines (pragmatic) yet smuggles plants and picks locks (wistful defiance); she steals the tooth but calls it translation; she teaches the boy to garden on stolen inches while feeling honest. The attribute enables the theft (pragmatism) and the teaching (wistfulness), shaping two beats with visible cost. However, it is stated rather than dramatized at first mention, and the specific tension between wistful and pragmatic does not constrain a single on-page choice in a way that another trait (e.g., "determined" or "gentle") could not. Score in mid-6s for demonstrated fit with limited unique constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Instill" governs the climax and closure: Mara instills courage by showing the petal's glow ("memory can instill courage better than any sword"), then instills gardening knowledge and resilience through the rooftop teaching. The boy's final descent with "a small reflected moon" inside him demonstrates successful instillation. The action is signaled early (motivation "to reflect light") and traced through the petal exchange and dawn lesson, shaping two major beats and the ending consequence. However, "instill" could be rephrased as "teach," "give," or "share" without breaking story logic. The thematic weight is strong but swappability lowers irreplaceability. Score in low-7s for essential thematic role with moderate causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"The rhythm of oars in water—pull, lift, glide" is introduced early (Mara's watering-can climb echoes "the rhythm of oars in water she had never rowed but often dreamed"), returns at the lock opening ("the door opened with the rhythm of oars"), and closes the piece (the boy descends "with the rhythm of oars in water"). The motif charges the final image and ties propulsion to promise. However, it does not shape Mara's method; the lock-picking and descent proceed through gauge-tooth mechanics and spatial navigation, not rowing. The rhythm is metaphoric rather than tactical. Three-beat recurrence (setup, middle, closure) with strong lyric payoff but no causal constraint. Score in mid-5s for purposeful patterning without enabling function.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The harbor provides moonlight (enables lock-picking at night), spatial layers (fire escape, rooftop, basement, parapet), and sensory anchors (tide, diesel, starfish) that guide every choice and constrain access. The bolted rooftop door creates the inciting problem; the basement location traps the boy; the rooftop garden supplies the teaching space and lavender. The lone rower in the harbor at closure provides the visual metaphor that Mara uses to teach. Removing the harbor setting would break spatial logic, light source, and thematic resonance. Strong setup, development (door bolt), and payoff (parapet lesson, rower). Essential across beats and ending. Minor deduction: "luminous harbor by moonlight" is declared in the opening line but could be more causally woven into early action rather than described.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops" triggers the story's start: the petal's fall gives Mara "permission to speak secrets aloud" and prompts the night's action. The timing (night, moonlight) enables covert lock-picking and provides cover. However, the petal-drop is a one-time signal rather than a ticking clock; once the story begins, time does not tighten further. The dawn arrival at closure provides a natural endpoint but does not force Mara's choices. Two-gate participation (setup trigger, closure boundary) with one tactical enabler (night cover). The petal itself does more work than the timeframe. Score in mid-6s for purposeful threshold moment without ongoing pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to reflect light into dark corners" is signaled early (Mara's goal is "steady as phosphorescence"), dramatized through theft and descent, and tested in the petal exchange and teaching scenes. It drives every major choice: steal the tooth to open the door, descend to find the boy, offer the petal and lavender, teach gardening to prove the sky exists. Friction appears between the cost (theft, risk, lost tool) and the goal. The boy's internalized moon at closure demonstrates success with visible consequence. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage. The motivation is somewhat abstract ("reflect light") but gains specificity through the lived-leaf promise and the petal-as-proof. Minor deduction: the motivation could face one additional on-page obstacle (e.g., landlord confrontation) to reach indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is not named but demonstrated: Mara admits fear ("the kind that admits fear but keeps walking"), takes risks (theft, trespass) while maintaining care (gentle lock-picking, teaching patience), and her final lesson balances honesty with exposure. The tone modulates from moonlit stealth to basement intimacy to rooftop openness, reflecting pressure shifts. However, the tone is more consistent than dynamic; it does not sharpen or crack under peak stress. The final image carries the tone forward (boy with lavender, Mara watching) but does not transform it. Two-gate participation (middle vulnerability, closure steadiness) with coherent modulation. Score in mid-to-high 6s for purposeful tone that supports but does not decisively charge the ending.</comment>
