<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mapmaker's interior journey is embodied through concrete sensory apparatus (ring, cane, skin-reading) and the final act of tracing feelings in soil earns his shift. However, the emotional catalog ("vertigo of almost loving," "ache of remembering a dream") reads more as poetic inventory than dramatized contradiction. The backstory paragraph (sight draining, unfinished map) anchors present stakes but the protagonist's agency operates mostly through reception rather than conflicted choice until the kneeling beat. Micro-choices that alter present tactics are sparse; he follows the trail without meaningful resistance or cost until arrival.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of sensory layering (moss, ultrasonic leaves, musical notes) that tightens into the stillpoint clearing where the ring releases hoarded languages into raised lines. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the mapmaker becomes map/reader/parchment, internalizes the cartography, carries it forward), and cost is legible: the ring empties, the clearing seals, but he now bears unmapped feelings as "raised ink of his palms." Orientation is clear by the opening beat. One friction: the middle spiral could narrow options more sharply; pressure accumulates through density rather than a decisive tightening choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vivid and specific (leaves above human hearing tasted as citrus, constellations pausing, dark green walls tightening). The platinum ring and cane function as micro-setting tools that constrain perception and action. The clearing inverts sound and the ground receives the ring's languages, directly enabling the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (ear to moss, cane tapping, kneeling, tracing with fingertips). The forest releases him at dawn, marking the exit and charging the final walk with "inner weather."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to draft unmapped emotions at the stillpoint. The trail of musical notes tightens into a spiral, forcing inhalation and kneeling—a meaningful deepening rather than a causal reversal. The protagonist's agency is present (he walks, inhales, traces) but largely receptive; coincidence does not resolve, yet the forest "guides" and the stillpoint "accepts" without on-page resistance. Cost is visible (ring empties, clearing seals, he memorizes rather than prints), and the final walk composes a new melody. One persistent constraint (blindness and reliance on skin/ring/cane) shapes all tactics and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—becoming the map of one's interior—emerges organically from the platinum ring's absorption, the kneeling act, and the final image of "raised ink of his palms." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: cartography as embodied knowledge rather than artifact. No overt moralizing. Subtext operates through image (ring bloated with extinct vowels, seeds sinking) and the quiet blaze recurs with purpose. One friction: "to navigate uncharted emotional depths one must become the map, parchment and ink and reader all at once" edges toward explicit thesis statement, though it remains tied to the sensory act of tracing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature (citrus taste of frequencies, Braille of sound, warm ink through pores). Diction is consistently elevated and poetic. Two frictions lower the score: filter-verb stacks ("he could taste," "he knew," "he felt," "he carried") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy; and several metaphors stretch coherence ("bloated with consonants," "wet heart of silence"). Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The voice modulates with intensity (spiral tightening, kneeling, dawn release) but the elevated register remains uniform rather than shifting under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is consistent and information density is high, with most lines doing double duty (ultrasonic forest both setting and sensory apparatus). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "musical notes" recurs across adjacent beats without added detail; "raised lines/raised ink" cycles; "quiet blaze" appears three times identically. Template cadence is present in repetitive "He [verb]" openings across the middle third. Several metaphors are strained or contradictory ("wet heart of silence," "platinum compass ring… drank the alphabet"). These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull propulsion. Figurative density is very high without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. No grammar errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of blindness, synesthetic cartography, and emotional terrain is specific and non-obvious. The platinum ring absorbing language through skin and releasing it as raised lines offers fresh mechanics. However, the core premise—interior journey to map one's feelings—is a widely used metaphor, and the transformation relies heavily on poetic register rather than lived friction or surprising calculus. The ultrasonic forest and musical trail add texture but remain ornamental; removing them would not break the logic. The ending's stance (carry the map as embodied knowledge) is earnest but predictable. Mid-band: functional originality with strong craft but no bold risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: present from opening. Development: walks the trail, inhales melody, kneels, traces lines—these are choices but largely receptive. Payoff: stands, fastens ring to cane, turns back with new knowledge. Two beats (kneeling/tracing and standing/turning) involve decision. Causal pressure is moderate; the choices alter tactics (he will not print this map, he composes a new melody by walking) but the stillpoint guides more than he navigates. Cost is present (ring empties, clearing seals). Swappability: moderate; a sighted cartographer could be rewritten with minor edits. Band: shapes two beats and ending, causal pressure moderate, cost visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("wore the platinum compass ring on his little finger"). Development: absorbs languages in multiple beats (tonight it pulses, grows heavier, bloated with consonants/vowels, releases in silver rush). Payoff: empties at stillpoint, then fastened to cane at dawn. Three distinct beats; causal pressure high (hoarded languages enable the closure act of tracing feelings). Closure linkage strong (ring's release creates the raised lines he reads). Irreplaceability high; the ring's absorption/release mechanics are unique. Cost connection clear (ring now weightless/empty). Band: essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: title and early mention ("stillpoint was near"). Development: promised coherence shapes his walk; the spiral tightens toward it. Payoff: clearing where sound inverts and constellations pause; he kneels and the stillpoint accepts his offering. Causal pressure high (destination shapes all tactics). Closure linkage strong (the stillpoint is the site of transformation and remains as "private meridian zero"). Irreplaceability high; removing it breaks the story's spatial and thematic logic. Cost connection present (clearing seals, but he carries it as heartbeat pulse). Band: drives setup, middle goal, and ending; indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("when metal met skin it drank the alphabet… syllables sinking through pores"). Development: skin drinks the melody ("inhaled, skin drinking the melody until it pooled behind his eyes"), enabling the climax. Payoff: the trait allows him to read the raised lines with fingertips and carry the map as "raised ink of his palms." Two beats; causal pressure moderate to high (enables the absorption and transmission). Closure linkage present (palms as transferable map). Cost is implied (constant sensory overload) but not explicit. Swappability moderate; another synesthetic sense could substitute. Band: shapes middle and ending, specific mechanics matter.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: cane introduced early ("cane tapping"). Development: "letting the cane dowse the path like a hazel rod" shapes the walk. Payoff: "laid the cane aside" at stillpoint, then "fastened the empty ring to cane" and "lifted the cane" at dawn. Two beats but the dowsing is briefly mentioned and does not narrow options; the cane functions more as mobility aid. Causal pressure low; easily swappable with "followed the trail" without major edits. Closure participation minimal (fastening the ring is a small detail). Band: functional but replaceable; one purposeful middle mention and minor closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "a trail of musical notes leading to a hidden melody" introduced in paragraph 6. Development: notes manifest as tremor/Braille, tighten into spiral, press against ribs, asking entry; he inhales them. Payoff: notes rearrange into new melody he composes by walking. Two beats (spiral and inhalation; outward walk). Causal pressure moderate (the trail guides and the method of inhalation enables the climax). Closure linkage present (new melody). Late first appearance (second third) applies −0.3. Swappability moderate; "path" could replace with edits. Band: shapes middle choice and ending, method matters but introduced late.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "ultrasonic forest" in opening paragraph. Development: "every leaf vibrated above human hearing," he tastes frequencies, forest tightens walls and guides him, then releases him at edge. Payoff: "ultrasonic forest released him… dawn wind carrying frequencies he no longer needed to taste." Two beats (guiding and releasing). Causal pressure moderate (it guides but does not constrain; he follows without friction). Closure linkage present (release marks transformation). Specificity high but the mechanics (ultrasonic, taste as citrus) remain ornamental. Band: shapes middle and ending, but pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: title phrase "across the pause of shifting constellations." Development: constellations pause mid-drift at stillpoint. Payoff: "constellations resumed their slow slide… constellations completed their pause and continued shifting." Two brief mentions bracketing the stillpoint. Causal pressure minimal; the pause marks the event but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Time is vague (he walks, kneels, remains until dawn) without live urgency. Cost connection absent. Band: lyric reprise that reweights mood but does not drive choices; functional but replaceable timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: stated early ("his own interior stayed blank, a parchment he feared to touch"). Development: conflicted desire drives the walk ("to draft them"), and friction appears ("feared to touch"). Payoff: he traces the topography of his interior, memorizing it, then carries it forward. Two beats (fear/desire and the kneeling act). Causal pressure high (motivation compels all movement). Closure linkage strong (he achieves the stated goal with cost: clearing seals, map lives only in palms). Friction is present but brief (one sentence of fear). Band: essential motivation across beats and ending, with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Setup: "quiet blaze" first appears late (paragraph 23: "Each line glowed faintly, quiet blaze beneath his hands"). Development: recurs in paragraph 30 ("a quiet blaze others could read") and final paragraph ("quiet blaze inside him kept perfect, fearless time"). Payoff: charges the final image as internalized, persistent light. Late first appearance (beyond midpoint) applies −0.5. Coherence high (tone modulates from patient receptivity to internalized glow). Two reprise beats. Closure linkage strong (final sentence anchors on it). Cost connection present (fearless suggests prior fear overcome). Band: charges ending strongly but introduced too late for higher score.</comment>
