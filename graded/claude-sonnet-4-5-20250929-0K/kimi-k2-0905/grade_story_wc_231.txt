<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris is embodied through physical action (climbing stairs, pinning the flower, releasing it) and her lighthouse-keeper expertise grounds her perceptual signature. Her decision to break the cycle by releasing the Edelweiss is earned by the accumulating gaps and the logbook entry she didn't recognize writing. The "borrowed memories" concept creates genuine internal pressure—she must forfeit her own recollections to close the gaps—though the stranger himself remains a cipher whose collapse we never inhabit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: gaps accumulate (no gulls, missing ferry horn, delayed reflection) until Maris's release of the flower triggers a reversal where each gap closes in sequence. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she pays the debt by surrendering her own memories, forecloses the stranger's cycle, and returns to her keeper role with clean isolation. The cost is legible on the page—specific memories named and lost—and the final image of the opal dock "like a closed eye that had finally dreamed the same dream as the light" reconfigures the premise with conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse lamp room are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (mist "like milk stirred with silver," tide slapping pilings with rhythm gaps). The spiral staircase and balcony provide clear spatial choreography. The release of the Edelweiss into the tide directly enables closure—petals become "tiny rafts" that carry away her memories—so the micro-object functions as setting and constraint. Nautical twilight and the rotating lens shape her investigative method and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the stranger's gesture to break the borrowed-memory cycle—is signaled early and tightens through the three gaps Maris catalogs. Her agency peaks in the descent and release: she chooses to pay with her own memories, a visible cost (mother's song, first ship's horn) that forecloses the loop. The gaps closing in sequence (gulls, ferry, reflection) demonstrate consequence. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens and the final act reweights her isolation from haunted to "cleaner."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the lighthouse as arbiter between seen and erased, memory as debt and interest, the cost of witnessing. The Edelweiss shifts from alpine artifact to currency that purchases closure. The final image—"some gestures, once decoded, become keepers themselves"—is non-literal and resonant, reweighting the premise without moralizing. The logbook entry Maris "will write" introduces a quiet time-stutter that deepens the borrowed-memory concept without explaining it away.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and the perceptual signature is distinct: Maris notices absences "as diligently as any signal," her lighthouse-trained attention filtering the world through gaps and rotation. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("borrowed memories," "witnessed isolation"). The prose occasionally reaches for elevated metaphor ("fog hums in a bell," "time itself had stepped ashore") that flirts with overwriting but remains legible. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is cleanly managed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character perception, or the gap catalog. Minor figurative density in some beats: "fog hums in a bell," "borrowed memories of alpine sun," "milk stirred with silver" cluster without muddle but approach saturation. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The phrase "softly persistent" recurs (mist, click of lens) as a taught motif rather than churn. Clarity holds; no grammar breaks or spatial incoherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse keeper decoding borrowed memories through observed gaps, paid off by releasing an alpine flower into the sea—is specific and non-obvious. The "gaps" method and the time-stutter logbook entry are fresh inflections. The story commits fully to its metaphysical premise without retreat or explanation. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, abstract stakes made concrete through sensory cataloging) heightens coherence. The Edelweiss as loan rather than gift is an elegant conceptual turn earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris's choices create all key turns: she investigates the gaps, reads the logbook entry, steps onto the balcony to witness the stranger's loop, descends to release the flower, and logs "Repaid." Her lighthouse expertise enables the gap-observation method. Removing her decision to release the Edelweiss would collapse closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Edelweiss appears in four distinct beats: pressed into her palm, pinned beside the logbook, held in fist on the balcony, released into the tide. Its meaning reweights from gift to loan to currency. The release is the causal pivot that closes the gaps and costs Maris her own memories. The flower's alpine origin contrasts the maritime setting and charges the "borrowed memories" concept.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Borrowed memories shape stakes and tactics on the page: Maris feels the stranger's gesture "humming in her bones," discovers she will write a future logbook entry, and pays the debt by forfeiting her mother's song and first ship memory. The concept constrains her choice—she must surrender specific recollections to break the cycle. It drives the ending image where her isolation becomes "cleaner."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" appears twice: the mist and the lens click. The trait establishes tone and recurs in the final paragraph as a reminder of keeper duty. It does not constrain a specific choice with cost but charges the atmosphere and signals continuity after the cycle breaks. Present in setup and payoff with thematic coherence but no middle development that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Investigate" is signaled in the opening line and structures the entire middle: Maris climbs to the lamp room, catalogs three gaps, opens the logbook, steps onto the balcony. The investigation's method (observing absences) is specific and drives her to the closure act. Major turns trace to this action; swapping it for "solve" or "understand" would lose the gap-observation specificity that enables the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" is signaled early ("chose to read those absences as diligently as any signal") and its mechanics matter: she catalogs no gulls, missing ferry horn, delayed reflection. The method shapes all middle attempts and the balcony scene where she sees the stranger between pulses of light. The release of the flower is framed as filling gaps "with something denser than absence." Mechanics are integral to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The opal dock anchors setup and payoff; Maris stands at its rail opening and walks its planks to release the flower. The mist blurs boundaries and enables the stranger's reappearance "between one pulse and the next." The tide accepts the Edelweiss, carrying memory fragments toward horizon. The dock's spatial clarity supports choreography and its "closed eye" final image charges closure. It does not constrain a middle choice but bookends the arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Nautical twilight is named in the opening and closing, framing the investigative window. The ferry's midnight circuit (2310) provides a temporal gap Maris catalogs. Time does not tighten decisions—no countdown or deadline pressures her release of the flower—but it establishes the liminal atmosphere and marks the transition to "true night" at closure. Present in setup and payoff with one middle beat; moderate pressure contribution.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The desire to decode the stranger's gesture is dramatized in Maris's climb, gap catalog, logbook discovery, and balcony confrontation. Friction emerges when she realizes the flower is a loan requiring memory-interest payment. The cost of decoding (forfeiting her mother's song, first ship memory) is visible on the page. The motivation drives every beat and the final "Repaid" entry closes the loop with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is coherent from the opening ("eccentric lighthouse keeper") through the erased footsteps and "witnessed isolation suspended between iron and cloud" to the ending where her isolation becomes "cleaner, witnessed only by the lamp." The tone modulates with pressure: dread during gap accumulation, resolve during descent, calm at closure. It charges the final image where she shifts from investigating to "only attending."</comment>
