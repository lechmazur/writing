<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "prove that listening heals" is clearly stated but remains largely abstract; her micro-choices (offering tea, sitting in silence) feel emblematic rather than forged under competing internal pressures. The courtyard crowd functions as atmosphere rather than relational crucible—no single character applies immediate interpersonal pressure that would force Mira into contradictory impulses. The final choice (displaying the empty cushion) arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path; she smiles "certain now," which reads as epiphany declared rather than earned through on-page struggle. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("objects return to stories, not places") instead of embodied contradiction in the moment of decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered testimony and sensory witnessing rather than causal because/therefore chains. Orientation is anchored early (courtyard, thrift shop, dawn), waiving the test. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (neighbors gather in shared silence; the mailbox quiets), but on-page cost is elusive: Mira's final smile and certainty feel asserted rather than paid for, and no prior option is visibly foreclosed. The story deepens atmosphere and reweights the stake from mystery-solving to communal witnessing, yet the final image ("the key we already are") substitutes metaphor for dramatized consequence. One meaningful tightening (dawn vigil → collective listening) is present, satisfying length expectations, but cost remains conceptual and oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard is vividly rendered with layered sensory detail (rose-gold mosaics, mint tea, fountain hush) that remains purposeful rather than catalog. The borescope becomes a micro-tool constraining choice (Mira tries mechanical intervention before yielding to presence), and the iron mailbox anchors spatial choreography across beats. The final image integrates setting (courtyard "felt larger") with the conceptual closure, charging the space with the story's thematic shift. Diction is consistently filtered through Mira's curatorial lens ("dust between her ribs," "desert cold teach her"), and the dawn-to-dusk-to-dawn cycle provides rhythmic structure. No major slips in spatial tracking or world consistency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake is present: the rattling mailbox mystery and Mira's desire to prove listening heals. Pressure tightens once—from mechanical investigation (borescope) to renunciation of tools in favor of witnessing—but the turn lacks on-page cost or trade-off. The neighbors' gathering supplies atmosphere rather than oppositional force; no character challenges Mira's approach or introduces complication that she must overcome through agency. The resolution (mailbox quiets, offerings appear) feels granted rather than earned by protagonist decision, and coincidence (the locket's heartbeat merging with ambient sound) resolves rather than complicates. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient at this length, but visible cost is absent, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mailbox-as-witness motif and the shift from solving to listening, avoiding overt thesis statements until the final metaphor ("the key we already are"), which borders on platitude but remains image-anchored. The locket's heartbeat functions as a charged object that reweights prior material (Dr. Samara's disappearance → communal pulse). Subtext operates in gesture (cross-legged silence, offerings left without dialogue) and the courtyard's breathing quietness. The ending offers a non-literal answer to the central question—mystery absorption rather than solution—but the final smile and certainty dilute ambiguity, nudging toward tidy resolution. No heavy-handed moralizing in the final paragraph, and the velvet cushion labeled "For whatever returns" invites reflection without dictating meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout, with perceptual signature rooted in Mira's curatorial idiom ("objects return to stories," "sand waits for wind"). No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Diction occasionally elevates beyond plausible interior lexicon ("lub-dub" clinical notation, "valve none knew was pressurized") but remains voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue appears, sidestepping naturalism and subtext tests. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming to sensory immersion at the mailbox, pulling back for collective witnessing). The prose carries distinct rhythmic control, particularly in the dawn vigil sequence, and no filter-verb stacks or convergence under pressure. Minor register drift in metaphoric flourishes ("living tissue of the courtyard") but not severe enough to break immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings diversify; no mechanical template cadence. Clarity is mostly strong, though some lines border on overwriting ("grief became too loud even for her" abstracts rather than grounds). One paraphrase loop: "the box did not want to be opened; it wanted to be witnessed" followed immediately by "the way Dr. Samara once witnessed" restates the same concept without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative density is high ("dust between her ribs," "breathing darkness," "soft cracks of a waking world") but remains coherent and voice-consistent, avoiding mixed metaphors. No significant scaffold or synonym churn. Information density is good; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure. The final metaphor ("the key we already are") tilts toward abstraction but does not obscure the prior image work. Stock phrase "held its breath" appears once but does not cluster.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise—community healing through collective listening anchored by a mysterious mailbox—offers a fresh angle on grief-processing tropes, and the choice to leave the box unopened subverts mystery-genre expectations. Mira's curatorial lens and the courtyard's sensory particularity (mosaics, sesame bread, marigolds) ground the narrative in specific detail rather than generic mysticism. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar template: outsider investigates mystery → learns lesson about acceptance → shares wisdom with community. The locket as returned-heart-object and the "listening heals" thesis read as prompt-responsive rather than transformed through lived contradiction or non-obvious moral calculus. Transformation test: swapping the mailbox for another unclaimed vessel (e.g., a sealed well, a shuttered kiosk) would not fundamentally alter the arc. No close echoes of famous lines, and the risk of quiet closure is executed cleanly, but the synthesis feels more polished than surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira curates the thrift shop and listens to neighbors, applying her "listening to what others discarded" ethos to the mailbox mystery. She makes two choices: mechanical investigation (borescope) and renunciation (sitting without tools). Her final act—displaying the empty cushion—closes the arc but lacks visible cost or trade-off. Setup is early, development occurs in the borescope beat, and closure participation is present (she unlocks the shop, labels the cushion). Causal pressure is moderate; the trait constrains one attempt but does not force competing goods or a felt sacrifice. Swappable with "empathetic listener" or "patient observer" with minor edits. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but swappability −0.6, no felt cost −0.4, rounding down = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The locket appears in three beats: porter's memory (description), marigold girl's testimony (glimpsed in slot), and Mira's final internalization (click in her chest). It seeds Dr. Samara's presence, reappears with reweighted meaning (from physical object to metaphoric heartbeat), and the final click charges closure. Setup early, development via girl's sighting, payoff in Mira's bodily echo. Causal pressure is modest—it guides Mira's attention but does not narrow options under stress. Lyric reprise (first paragraph mention → last-line echo) qualifies for mid-band. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but lyric-only middle role −0.5, summary-only in two mentions −0.4, cost indirect −0.3, swappable with "ring" or "watch" −0.5, rounding down = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The locked mailbox drives the entire narrative: Mira investigates (borescope), neighbors share lore, the vigil centers on it, and its quieting signals closure. It shapes stakes (mystery-solving vs. witnessing) and alters tactics (from mechanical to meditative). Present in setup, middle investigation, and ending quieting. Specific properties (locked, rattling, no key) constrain mechanical solutions and motivate the shift to listening. Irreplaceable; no near-synonym (e.g., "sealed box" or "shuttered cabinet") carries the postal/message connotation that ties to Dr. Samara's listening practice. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, visible cost (renunciation of solution) +0.4, rounding down = 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Leads through following" manifests in Mira's method: she listens to neighbors' testimony rather than imposing her own interpretation, and her vigil invites communal participation rather than solo action. The trait enables her approach (gathering stories, sitting in silence) but does not create on-page friction or cost—no moment where following fails or forces a trade-off with agency. Setup is implicit early, development occurs in the tea-and-testimony sequence, and closure participation is present (neighbors join her). Swappable with "patient facilitator" or "observant guide." Score: early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but label-only (no dramatized cost) −0.6, swappability −0.7, no felt tradeoff −0.5, rounding down = 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hearing structures every major beat: Mira hears the rumor, listens to testimonies, uses the borescope (fails to see but then hears the pulse), and the communal vigil centers on collective listening until the heartbeat merges with ambient sound. The action defines the method (acoustic rather than visual investigation) and redefines success (absorption rather than solution). Present in setup (rumor "riding the breeze"), middle (borescope → ear-to-metal), and ending (final click in Mira's chest). Irreplaceable; swapping "hear" for "see" or "touch" would break the thematic spine. Score: early signal +0.7, four beats +1.6, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost (renunciation of sight-based tools) +0.5, rounding down = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Neighborhood storytelling is signaled early (gardeners, students, grandmothers arrive with testimony) and shapes Mira's investigation: she gathers accounts, offers tea to elicit detail, and follows "the locket's echo through every tale." The method enables two beats (testimony collection, vigil invitation) and contributes to closure (communal listening). Mechanics are shown (tea as currency, overlapping sentences, spatial gathering) rather than told. Swappable with "oral history" or "gossip network" with modest edits. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5, but swappability −0.6, no felt cost tied to method −0.4, rounding down = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The courtyard anchors every beat: thrift shop unlocking, fountain/mailbox geography, tea service, dawn vigil, and the final spatial expansion ("felt larger"). Dawn light provides atmospheric pressure (rose-gold → plum-to-peach cycle) and temporal rhythm. The setting enables gathering (public space) and constrains action (mailbox is fixed, immovable). Micro-setting (iron gate, mosaics underfoot, parapets) grounds spatial choreography. Present in setup, middle, and ending. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0 (spatial expansion charges final image), but postcard moments (mosaics, fountain) occasionally ornamental −0.5, no unique resource constraint −0.3, rounding down = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "when the outside world intrudes" is vague and never sharpened into a live clock. The dawn-to-dusk-to-dawn cycle provides atmospheric rhythm but does not tighten decisions; Mira has unlimited time to investigate and wait. "The earthquake" and Dr. Samara's vanishing are backstory anchors, not present pressure. No imminent deadline or external interruption forces choice. The vigil's timing (first light) is chosen rather than imposed. Setup is absent (no signal of intrusion), development is weak (time passes without urgency), closure participation is ornamental (sunrise arrives on schedule). Score: weak setup −0.5, ornamental use −0.8, no causal pressure −1.0, swappable with "dawn" alone −0.6, rounding down = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to prove that listening heals" is stated explicitly midway ("her motivation sharpened") and drives her shift from mechanical investigation to meditative witnessing. The desire shapes two beats (borescope attempt, dawn vigil) and the final image (empty cushion as proof of listening's valve-opening power). Friction is modest: no on-page moment where listening fails or costs her another goal; the neighbors cooperate without resistance. Setup is delayed (not present in opening third), development is clear (vigil choice), closure is direct (certainty and smile). Score: late signal −0.3, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, but told-only (no competing want or fear dramatized) −0.7, no felt sacrifice −0.5, swappable with "validate empathy" −0.5, rounding down = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone is consistently quiet, patient, and ceremonial—"sandstorm calm" manifests as slow accumulation (dust, breeze, grit) balanced with stillness (fountain hush, cross-legged silence). Rhythm modulates with pressure: dawn lyricism → midday testimony bustle → dusk/night compression → sunrise resolution. The final image ("sandstorm that has spent itself against mountains") explicitly invokes the tone and charges closure. Coherent through turns; no tonal whiplash. Present in setup (opening breeze and mosaics), middle (courtyard holding breath), and ending (smile as spent calm). Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, modulation under pressure +0.8, but one stock phrase ("held its breath") −0.2, slight abstraction in final metaphor −0.3, rounding down = 7.0.</comment>
