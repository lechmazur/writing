<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation (to capture the runaway dream and restore erased voices) is established early and drives her journey to the easternmost islet. However, her interior life remains abstract—painted in metaphorical sweeps rather than embodied contradictions. The final "airy saturation" and cipher spelling across her skin reads as declared transformation without the micro-choices and embodied cost that would anchor change. Agency at closure is present but feels more cosmic than character-driven, limiting the score despite clear goal pursuit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers imagery (coral shelves, palette, painted light, dream-boat) toward a final conceptual repricing where the library's shelves pulse with "coherent longing" and voices return. Closure occurs on the page with cost (palette cracks, colors rush back through veins), satisfying the DC/RR/CR requirement. However, orientation is delayed—who, where, and archipelago geography remain vague past the 120-word mark—and the causal linkage between photographing dawn and transferring the image to coral shelves reads more as lyric leap than motivated consequence, preventing higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago, coral shelves, and sand ridge shaped like an open book supply vivid micro-settings that charge individual beats. The palette and camera function as setting-scale tools that constrain Mireya's method. However, spatial choreography across islands remains impressionistic—causeway, easternmost islet, and library positions are not anchored clearly enough to track movement—and the "movable horizon" metaphor, while striking, does not materially alter her tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the dream to decode the cipher and restore erased voices—is signaled early and drives all movement. Pressure accumulates through the violet morning journey, painted contrails guiding the sun, and the dream-boat's approach, culminating in the decisive shutter click and palette crack that foreclose prior tactics. One meaningful tightening is present (the instant the boat passes, she snaps the frame), and cost is legible (palette destroyed, colors absorbed into skin). However, the escalation feels more atmospheric than volitional—Mireya's agency in coaxing the dream is gestural rather than trade-off driven—and the resolution hinges on the archipelago's autonomous transfer of the image, reducing protagonist pressure at the peak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—longing, erasure, remembrance—emerges organically from the cipher hunt, painted light, and restored voices without overt moralizing. The final image of the paper boat as a library mobile and patrons remembering "something vital they had never lived, a luminous absence now brimming" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The recurring motif of light, salt, and breath aligning to decode longing threads through without mechanical repetition. Minor wobble: "luminous absence" is asserted more than it is shown to contain cost, and the ending's tidy restoration of every erased voice edges toward symmetric satisfaction, but the conceptual repricing holds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mireya throughout; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"compressed starlight and the salt of tears cried by sailors who never reached harbor"—that suits the magical-realist frame. However, perceptual signature is impressionistic rather than character-specific; Mireya's way of noticing reads as elevated authorial diction rather than her own idiom under pressure. Psychic distance floats between close and distant without clear modulation, and the final paragraph's "she would still coax from the collaboration of light and longing" shifts into summary that dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many images are striking ("horizon here was movable, a shy animal"), but density problems accumulate. Paraphrase loops appear: "each step releasing a hush that sounded like her own pulse trying to pronounce someone's hidden name" restates the whispering motif already established. Template cadence runs through the middle: "she lifted…touched…began painting" / "she clicked…again and again" / "she stepped…raised…painted…coaxing" stack identical structures. Figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or clear payoff (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: "tide tongues licked basalt runes" and "contrails of color…like neon seaweed" layer incompatible vehicles. Several nominalizations ("vitalize," "coherent longing") and passive constructions ("was transferred") slow momentum. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: paraphrase loop −0.2, template cadence −0.5, figurative density −0.5, totaling roughly −1.2 before band adjustment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of librarian, light-painting, and dream-cipher is specific and memorable; the whispering archipelago and coral library are vivid inventions. The emotional core—restoring voices to the erased—transforms a familiar "lost memory" trope through the mechanics of painted light and photographic capture. However, the "runaway dream as paper boat" and "library that returns lost voices" lean on stock magical-realist imagery without full transformation, and the resolution's cosmic convenience (archipelago transfers the image with no cost to Mireya's agency) limits the boldness of risk-taking.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mireya is present throughout, her goal drives all movement, and her final choice to step into the tide and snap the decisive frame shapes closure. However, her agency at the peak is gestural—painting a corridor, coaxing—rather than decision-forged under trade-off. The archipelago's autonomous transfer of the image reduces her causal role at closure. Setup, development (painting at dawn), and payoff (shutter click) are present, but swappability remains moderate (another seeker could execute similar moves). Band: functional across beats but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The palette is handled in at least three beats: folded into pocket at departure, used to paint contrails guiding the sun, and cracks at the moment of capture. Its cracking marks a visible cost and forecloses further painting. It appears in the final paragraph mended with "dawn's own gold," recharging prior use. Setup early, development (painting the corridor), and payoff (crack, later mended) are all present. Causal pressure is moderate—it enables the light-painting method but does not constrain choices sharply. Scores solidly in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cipher of longing is named early as Mireya's target and returns at closure when it spells across her skin and the library shelves pulse with "coherent longing." However, its mechanics remain abstract—what the cipher looks like, how it is read, or how decoding it restores voices is asserted rather than dramatized. It shapes the quest's goal but does not constrain on-page tactics or choices. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is thematic rather than operational. Functional but replaceable with another MacGuffin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mireya paints with light in at least two beats: releasing color into air as contrails and painting a golden corridor on water to coax the dream-boat. The trait enables her method and is visually distinct. However, the mechanics—how brush-to-light works, why it guides the dream—are not grounded in constraint or cost until the palette cracks. The attribute is present and purposeful but does not impose a visible tradeoff or limit tactics sharply. Setup, development, and payoff are present; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Vitalize" appears in the opening third as Mireya's plan to "vitalize the cipher by photographing the exact moment dawn spilled over the horizon" and returns implicitly in the final paragraph "vitalizing runaway dreams." However, the term itself is abstract—what vitalizing means operationally is not dramatized. The action (capturing dawn via photography) drives the peak beat, but "vitalize" as distinct from "capture" or "decode" is not causally necessary. Setup and payoff are present; development is operational (photography) rather than tied to the verb "vitalize" itself. Functional role, moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sunrise photography is signaled early ("photographing the exact moment dawn spilled over the horizon"), its mechanics matter at the peak (shutter clicks as dawn appears, snapping the decisive frame), and it returns in the final paragraph as an ongoing practice. The method constrains Mireya's tactics—she must time the shot to the rim of dawn—and the shutter click marks the decisive beat. Setup, development (raising camera, multiple clicks), and payoff are all present. However, the camera's role is somewhat generic; any capture device might serve similarly. Scores solidly in the essential-across-beats band with moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago is named early, supplies the coral library and movable horizon, and the easternmost islet provides the sand ridge where the decisive action occurs. The setting's atmosphere (whispering causeway, tide tongues, lighthouses reshaping) charges mood and stakes. However, spatial choreography is vague—distances, transitions between islands, and how the causeway connects to the library are not anchored—limiting its tactical pressure. The archipelago's autonomous transfer of the image to the library at closure elevates payoff. Setup, development (journey to islet), and payoff are present; causal constraint is moderate. Scores in the shapes-one-key-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"The hush of improbable beginnings, that hinge between night and day when clocks forget their purpose" is established early and Mireya sets out "before the sun" on a "violet morning," grounding the timeframe. The violet-to-indigo-to-vermilion sky progression and "rim of dawn" supply a narrow window that pressures timing. However, the phrase "odd hour" and "improbable beginnings" remain atmospheric rather than clock-sharp, and no on-page moment shows Mireya racing against time or adjusting tactics due to temporal constraint. Setup and atmosphere are strong; development and payoff are thematic rather than tactical. Functional, moderate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mireya's desire to capture the runaway dream and restore erased voices is declared early, drives her journey, and motivates the peak action (stepping into tide, snapping the frame). The motivation is dramatized through physical movement and risk (trading a memory, stepping into water), though internal friction—competing wants or fears—is implied more than embodied. The payoff (voices restored, dream captured) satisfies the motivation. Setup, development (painting to coax the dream), and payoff are all present. However, the motivation reads more as quest-goal than conflicted interior pressure. Scores in the essential-across-beats band with moderate friction visibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone of "luminous absence"—light suffused with loss—is established early ("silence instead of books," "invisible things the heart had misplaced") and sustained through painted light, the dream's "cold fire," and the final image of "luminous absence now brimming." The tone modulates subtly: quiet longing in the library, urgency at dawn, saturation at the moment of capture, and gentle restoration at closure. However, "luminous absence" as a phrase is asserted more than enacted in micro-choices; the tone sometimes drifts into ornamental lyricism that dilutes pressure. Coherent through turns, charges the final image moderately. Scores in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>
