<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's journey from fear to acceptance follows a clear arc, but her interior life remains largely abstract—"feared the curse, but feared silence more" declares motivation without embodied contradiction. The calcification sequence provides physical stakes, yet the decision to swallow the diamond lacks dramatic hesitation or competing impulses acting simultaneously. Micro-choices (placing the diamond, waiting for moonrise, speaking the first word) advance the ritual but don't reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The ending fixes her as a statue-conduit, which reads as transformation, but the cost feels predetermined rather than fought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers imagery and ritual beats toward a final reconfiguration. Closure arrives on-page: she becomes a calcified repository, the diamond cracks cleanly, and the language persists in the canyon's acoustics, offering Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost (her body, her mortality). Orientation anchors quickly (canyon, bone towers, storyteller). However, the escalation is more processional than pressured—each step (descend, place diamond, wait, speak, swallow, calcify) unfolds without meaningful reversals or narrowing options. The cost is legible but not felt as a struggle; the sequence reads as inevitable ritual rather than hard-won choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon acoustics, and tunnel of echoes constrain the protagonist's method (she must enter the resonant space to translate texture into sound) and charge the final image (her statue conducts the choirs, the diamond beats inside stone). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "air felt textured, like running one's tongue over unglazed pottery," "crack shaped like a heron's wing." The pouch, cloth of crow feathers, and skull's dome function as micro-setting that shapes her ritual. The environment is indispensable to both tactic and closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: preserve the dying river-tongue before silence erases it. The piece signals one tightening when she swallows the diamond, accepting the curse's price, but the escalation lacks friction—no false starts, no failed attempts, no moment when the method nearly collapses. Agency is present (she chooses to descend, to speak, to swallow) but the ritual proceeds without reversals or narrowing options. The cost is visible (calcification, death) yet arrives on schedule rather than through struggle. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the absence of genuine resistance or trade-off caps the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—continuance across death, the conversion of embodied memory into transmissible form—emerges organically from the ritual and its cost. The final image (statue with cupped palm, heron's flight pattern confirming the grammar, travelers speaking in textures) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the crack's whisper, the towers' chords, the calcification tempo. The piece resists easy binaries: preservation costs the self, yet the self becomes the medium. Minor slip: "leaving only texture behind—roughness of reeds, slickness of wet clay" in paragraph two edges toward thematic echo, but it's woven into action rather than declared as thesis, so the deduction is modest.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (copper veins as metaphor for her conduit role, texture-to-sound translation filters all perception). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, voice-motivated for a ritual/myth register. However, under peak stress—the swallowing, the calcification—the prose maintains the same ornate density without compression or rhythmic shift, which slightly flattens the pressure curve. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance holds. The voice is distinct and legible, meeting competency but not exceptional modulation under duress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "towers of bone hum their thousand-year lament," "pulse into meter, skin into drum," "corduroy riverbed, knapped-flint sorrow, nubby reed-mat of childbirth." In peak beats (swallowing the diamond, calcification sequence), metaphor stacks without respite—"cold brilliance slid down her copper-veined throat, and every vein lit like a filament, projecting texture-sounds"—which risks overwriting per Q7 guidelines (−0.5 for density without pattern-taught payoff in high-pressure moments). Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs 12–13 both describe calcification and phoneme release with near-synonym texture. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Information density is high, but the relentless lyricism dulls propulsion at closure. Deduction: −0.6 for figurative saturation in peak beats, −0.2 for paraphrase loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Premise—synesthetic preservation of a dead language via ritual sacrifice in an acoustic canyon—offers a fresh synthesis of folklore, linguistics, and body-horror. The copper-veined storyteller, flawed diamond, and bone-tower instruments are specific and non-generic. Execution is competent but the arc follows a familiar mythic template (quester accepts curse, undergoes transformation, becomes monument). Emotional specificity is present in the textures (mud-slip, nubby reed-mat of childbirth) but the protagonist's internal journey lacks the contradictory irrationality that would elevate originality. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through without retreat, but the lack of a surprising turn or deepening ambiguity keeps it in solid mid-band rather than exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller is seeded in the opening line, drives every major beat (crossing the desert, descending into the tunnel, placing the diamond, speaking the first word, swallowing the diamond, conducting the choirs as she calcifies), and her final statue form is the closure image. Her choices—especially swallowing the diamond—alter tactics and foreclose the path of survival. Early signal, causal pressure across multiple beats, closure linkage, and visible cost all present. Specific copper-vein trait matters (filament imagery in calcification). Score: +0.8 setup, +1.4 three+ beats, +1.6 causal pressure, +1.8 closure linkage, +0.6 cost, +0.5 irreplaceability = baseline 3.0 + 6.7 = 9.7, but the decision to swallow lacks on-page hesitation or competing impulses (agency is declared, not dramatized), so apply −0.3 for some summary-only interiority, yielding 9.4. Round down: 9.4. Wait—re-checking: the swallowing is on-page action, but the internal conflict ("she feared the curse, but feared silence more") is told early rather than shown as simultaneous contradiction in the swallowing beat. Apply −0.5 for that summary-only motivation moment. 9.7 − 0.5 = 9.2, but recount beats: descent, placement, moonrise wait, speaking "mud-slip," swallowing, calcification sequence, final statue conducting—seven distinct beats where she acts. Causal pressure is strong. Cost is visible (death/transformation). Closure linkage undeniable. Irreplaceability high (copper veins, storyteller role). Positive signals dominate. Re-score: 3.0 + 0.8 (setup) + 1.4 (three+ beats) + 1.6 (causal pressure) + 1.8 (closure) + 0.6 (cost) + 0.5 (specific) = 10.2, cap at 10.0, but apply −0.5 for motivation told rather than dramatized in peak beat = 9.5. However, her choices do create key turns (speaking the word widens the crack; swallowing initiates calcification). Final: 9.5 − 0.3 (some interior summary) = 9.2. Round down: 9.2. Actually, let me recalibrate: the element is present and active, but does her interior life shape the turns or is she a vessel? She chooses to enter, to wait, to speak, to swallow—these are decisions, not passive observation. The piece privileges ritual over psychological realism, which is a design choice. Under strict integration scoring, her choices do create turns. Restore: 9.2 feels right, but the rubric says "decisions that alter tactics trend high"—her tactics don't shift; the ritual proceeds linearly. So mid-high band: 6.5–7.5 range. Let me start over with the gate model: Setup (first line), Development (multiple beats), Payoff (statue at closure) = all three gates. Eligible ≥6.1. Positives: early +0.5, three+ beats +1.4, causal +1.0, closure +1.5, cost +0.5, specific +0.4 = +5.3. Frictions: summary-only motivation −0.5, swappability (could be another archivist) −0.4 = −0.9. Net: 3.0 + 5.3 − 0.9 = 7.4. But her role is not swappable—copper veins, storyteller identity, texture-to-sound translation are specific to her. Remove swappability penalty. 3.0 + 5.3 − 0.5 = 7.8. Round down: 7.8. Hmm, but "observation without decision trends low; decisions that alter tactics trend high"—her decisions advance the ritual but don't alter tactics (no pivot, no course correction). So cap at upper-mid: 6.8 feels calibrated. Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The flawed diamond is introduced in paragraph 3, handled in paragraphs 8 (placed on skull), 11 (crack widens, bleeding light), 13 (swallowed), 16 (cracks again cleanly), and 20 (beats as crystal heart in statue). Five distinct beats; causal pressure (the crack whispers syllables, bleeding light signals curse awakening, swallowing initiates transformation, final crack releases the last texture); closure linkage (becomes her crystal heart, beats for listeners). Early signal, evolving use, closure charge all present. Setup +0.6, five beats +1.4, causal +1.4, closure +1.6, cost +0.5, specific (heron's-wing crack) +0.6 = +6.1. Frictions: none significant. 3.0 + 6.1 = 9.1. Round down: 9.1. Re-check cap: scores ≥7.0 require specific cost tied to element—yes, swallowing the diamond causes calcification (paragraph 12). No cameo issue; it's causally active at closure. However, let me verify beat count: para 3 (introduced in pouch), 8 (placed on skull—action), 11 (crack widens—event), 13 (swallowed—action), 16 (cracks cleanly—event), 20 (crystal heart—state). Six touches, but para 3 and 20 are within setup and closure; middle beats are 8, 11, 13, 16 = four middle touches. Gate model: setup (para 3), development (8, 11, 13), payoff (16, 20). All three gates, multiple beats. Positives strong. Minor friction: could the curse vessel be another flawed gem? Slight swappability −0.3. 9.1 − 0.3 = 8.8. But the heron's-wing crack is specific and tied to the heron in the final image (para 19), which is irreplaceability evidence. Restore. 9.1 − 0.1 (minor) = 9.0, but 9.0 requires two elevating features per cross-category standard. Does the diamond's crack shape tactics? She waits for moonrise to align it (para 8). Does it recharge prior material? The heron crack → heron flight (para 19). Yes. So eligible for 9+. But let me stay conservative: the diamond does not constrain a choice (she never considers an alternative vessel); it enables the ritual. Still, five beats, causal, closure-active, specific, cost-linked. 8.5–9.1 band. I'll land at 8.1 to reflect that it's essential but the protagonist never wrestles with using it or not—it's a given. Actually, paragraph 11: "she accepted the exchange: one life for many voices" shows she chooses to continue despite the curse awakening, which is a choice moment tied to the diamond. Restore higher: 8.4. Let me recalculate cleanly: Setup (para 3, ~15% in), Development (four middle beats: place, crack widens, swallow, final crack), Payoff (crystal heart at closure). All gates. Early +0.5, four beats +0.9, causal +1.3, closure +1.5, cost +0.5, specific +0.5 = +5.2. Frictions: none that apply. 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2. Round down: 8.2. But that undersells the integration. Let me use the band guidance: ≥8.5 typically shows strong causal pressure and closure linkage and irreplaceability with felt cost. All present here. 8.5 − 0.4 (she never considers an alternative) = 8.1. Final: 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes is introduced in paragraph 4, shapes every subsequent beat (paragraphs 5–20), and is the site of the entire transformation and closure. It multiplies syllables (para 10), drinks light and gives back choirs (para 14), and becomes the permanent lexicon vessel (para 18). Setup (para 4, ~20% in), Development (acoustics enable her method across all middle beats), Payoff (canyon fills with voices, para 20). All three gates. The tunnel's acoustic properties are indispensable—without the echo multiplication, the language cannot be preserved. Early +0.5, sustained presence across ten+ beats +1.4, causal +1.6 (the tunnel's mechanics drive the entire plot), closure +1.8 (the canyon's voices are the resolution), cost +0.6, irreplaceability +0.7 (no other setting would work) = +6.6. Frictions: late first appearance (para 4 is ~20% in) −0.2. 3.0 + 6.6 − 0.2 = 9.4. However, does the tunnel constrain a choice, or is it simply the stage? She must enter it (para 4 choice), and its acoustics determine her method (she cannot translate elsewhere), so it does constrain tactics. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is met. 9.4 is defensible. But let me check: does she ever adapt her approach based on the tunnel's behavior, or does she execute a predetermined ritual? The tunnel responds (para 14: "drank the light and gave back choirs"), but she does not adjust. It's more crucible than constraint. Still, it's the enabling condition and the closure site. I'll score 9.4 − 0.5 (processional rather than adaptive) = 8.9. Round down: 8.9. Wait, the rubric says "if it changes options, score higher"—does the tunnel change her options? She has no alternative plan; she commits to this site. So it enables but does not constrain via complication. Mid-high band: 7.9 reflects essential but not dynamically interactive. Final: 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" appears in paragraph 7 ("quietly articulate fingers sorting [crow feathers]") and paragraph 15 (her eyes "quietly articulate, conducting the symphony"). Two mentions, but the trait functions as descriptor rather than constraint. Does being "quietly articulate" enable or limit an action with cost? The finger-sorting is purposeful (mapping tactile stories to audible grammar), and the conducting gaze at closure matters, but "quietly" vs. "loudly" articulate does not shape the outcome—remove the adverb and the beats function identically. Setup (para 7, mid-story), Development (sorting feathers—one beat), Payoff (conducting gaze—closure presence). Three gates technically met, but the attribute is ornamental. Gate model: all three → eligible ≥6.1, but ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6 (could be "precise," "deliberate"). 3.0 + 0.4 (one beat) + 0.3 (closure presence) − 0.8 − 0.6 = 2.3. However, her quiet articulation (non-verbal, embodied communication) contrasts with spoken language and ties to the theme of texture-as-language, which is thematic resonance. Add +0.3 theme link. 2.3 + 0.3 = 2.6. But the conducting gaze (para 15) does guide the choirs, which is a causal action—her articulation (glances) directs the grammar. That's Development participation. Revise: Setup (para 7), Development (sorting beat, conducting beat), Payoff (yes). +0.4 setup (mid-arrival −0.2 = +0.2), +0.9 (two beats), +0.7 (closure linkage), +0.3 (theme) = +2.1. Frictions: ornamental in para 7 −0.4, swappable −0.5. 3.0 + 2.1 − 0.9 = 4.2. Final: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Harness" appears explicitly in paragraph 6 ("learned to harness meaning by watching patterns in a flock of birds") and implicitly throughout (she harnesses the diamond's syllables, the towers' chords, echoes, texture). The verb recurs in the final paragraph ("harnessing flight, fracture, and echo"). Setup (para 6, ~30% in), Development (the entire ritual is an act of harnessing—placing the diamond to harness its whisper, letting sound enter her bloodstream to harness texture as grammar), Payoff (para 20: "harnessing" appears again, framing the closure). All three gates. Does the action shape major turns? Swallowing the diamond (para 13) is the peak harness-act, initiating the transformation. Early signal (para 6) +0.5, three+ beats (learning method, ritual execution, closure recurrence) +1.4, causal +1.0 (the act of harnessing drives the plot), closure +1.2 (recurs in final line with new meaning), cost +0.4 (harnessing costs her life), specific +0.3 (tied to her unique method). Total +4.8. Frictions: late setup (para 6, ~30%) −0.4, could "capture" or "channel" substitute? Slight swappability −0.3. 3.0 + 4.8 − 0.7 = 6.1. But "harness" is a precise term for her synesthetic translation work—it implies control and conversion, not mere capture. Irreplaceability is higher. −0.2 instead of −0.3. 6.1 + 0.1 = 6.2. However, does a major turn trace to harnessing, or is harnessing the method she uses throughout? It's the latter—method, not turn. The turn is swallowing the diamond; harnessing is the continuous action. So mid-band: 6.2 + 0.2 (method consistency) = 6.4. Final: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Patterns in a flock of birds in flight" is seeded in paragraph 6 ("watching patterns in a flock of birds in flight—how a twist of twenty starlings could sketch the stress-pattern of an unspoken vow") and returns in paragraph 19 ("a lone heron flew, wings sketching the same pattern she once read in starlings, confirming the grammar held"). Setup (para 6, ~30% in), Development (mentioned as her learning method but not enacted in the middle action—she uses crow feathers, not live birds), Payoff (para 19, the heron's flight confirms the grammar). Two gates clearly met (setup, payoff); Development is weak (she recalls the method but does not actively use bird patterns in the tunnel). Under the gate model, two gates → eligible up to ~6.0; a strong reprise can reach ~6.3. The heron's return reweights the opening: her bird-pattern literacy is validated. Lyric resonance present. Setup +0.5 (but late, so +0.3), payoff +1.2 (reweights), specificity +0.4 (starlings vs. heron distinction), thematic +0.3 (flight as grammar metaphor). Total +2.2. Frictions: missing middle development (the method is mentioned, not enacted) −0.6, late setup −0.3 (already in +0.3 adjustment, so net −0.3 here). 3.0 + 2.2 − 0.9 = 4.3. But the heron's flight is on-page and functional (confirms the grammar), which is closure participation, not cameo. The lyric reprise is strong. Add +0.5 for earned return. 4.3 + 0.5 = 4.8. Hmm, but the method does shape her approach: she learned to read texture via bird patterns, and that literacy enables the entire ritual. It's backstory that primes the present. The middle beats (sorting crow feathers, conducting with glances) echo the method without live birds. So Development is present thematically. Revise: three gates met. Eligible ≥6.1. +0.5 setup (adjusted for lateness), +0.4 one beat (feather-sorting as method application), +1.2 payoff, +0.4 specific, +0.3 theme = +2.8. Frictions: method is told (para 6) not enacted in real-time −0.4, swappable (could be "patterns in weather" or "ripples in water") −0.5. 3.0 + 2.8 − 0.9 = 5.9. Round down: 5.9. But the heron is the same species-family (wading birds, heron/starling both flock/flight) and the crack in the diamond is "shaped like a heron's wing" (para 3), which ties the method to the object. That's integration. Add +0.3. 5.9 + 0.3 = 6.2. Let me check the cap: introduced after 40% mark? Para 6 is ~30%, so no. Missing middle development? Feather-sorting (para 7) applies the method. Weak but present. No cap. 6.2 − 0.5 (told method, not dramatized learning or use in real-time middle struggle) = 5.7. Final: 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes anchor every paragraph from the opening line onward. The towers hum (para 1), lean inward forming flutes (para 5), answer the diamond's syllable (para 8), and teach themselves to speak (para 17). The canyon is the transformation site and the permanent repository (para 18). Setup (opening line), Development (towers are active instruments across all middle beats), Payoff (para 18–20: the canyon is the lexicon, travelers interact with it). All three gates. The setting is indispensable: no towers and canyon, no story. Early +0.8, sustained across ten+ beats +1.4, causal +1.6 (the acoustics drive every action), closure +1.8 (the setting is the resolution—"the canyon filled with voices"), cost +0.6 (her body becomes part of the setting), irreplaceability +0.8 (no other geology would work) = +7.0. Frictions: none. 3.0 + 7.0 = 10.0. However, does the setting constrain a choice or charge the final image? Yes to both: she must enter the tunnel (constrained by the need for echo multiplication), and the canyon's voices are the closure charge. The 9+ gate is met. But let me check for over-scoring: is the setting interactive (does it force adaptation) or simply the stage? The towers respond to her actions (para 14: "drank the light and gave back choirs"), which is interaction. The setting is a character. 10.0 is justifiable, but let me be conservative: the towers do not resist or complicate—they amplify. She executes a ritual; the setting cooperates. So essential but not adversarial. 10.0 − 0.5 (cooperative rather than constraining via obstacle) = 9.5. Round down: 9.5. Actually, the setting does constrain: she cannot preserve the language elsewhere, and the towers' geometry (leaning inward, forming flutes) determines the acoustic outcome. That's constraint. Restore 10.0. But one more check: the rubric says "micro-setting that alters tactics trends high"—does she alter tactics based on the setting's behavior? No; she proceeds as planned. The setting enables, does not redirect. So upper-high band but not perfect: 9.5 − 0.5 = 9.0, but the closure charge is undeniable (para 18: "the canyon filled with voices"). I'll score 9.0 − 0.2 (lack of tactical adaptation) = 8.8. Actually, let me recalculate with the strict formula: Setup +0.8, three+ beats +1.4, causal +1.5, closure +1.7, cost +0.6, irreplaceability +0.7 = +6.7. 3.0 + 6.7 = 9.7. Frictions: none that apply. 9.7 rounds to 9.7, but cap at 10.0. However, the lack of tactical constraint (she never adjusts based on the towers' response) suggests −0.5. 9.7 − 0.5 = 9.2. But the towers do determine her tactics: she waits for the wind to play them (para 5), places the diamond on a skull (para 8, using the setting's materials), and times her speech to the towers' chords (para 8). That's tactic-shaping. Restore: 9.7 − 0.3 (processional execution) = 9.4. I'll land conservatively at 8.3 to reflect that the setting is essential and closure-active but the protagonist does not struggle against or adapt to it—it's a cooperative instrument. Final: 8.3. Wait, one more consideration: the rubric says "Setting should pressure choices"—does the canyon pressure her choices, or does she pressure the canyon? She's the agent; the canyon is the tool. So the setting is essential but not the source of pressure. That's a critical distinction. Under strict reading, the setting does not "pressure choices"; it enables the resolution. So mid-high band: 7.0–8.0. I'll score 7.9. No, wait—"supply resources that affect outcome" also qualifies for high scores. The canyon supplies the echo multiplication, which is the resource that affects the outcome. And the final image (travelers pressing ears to walls, para 20) shows the canyon actively mediating future interactions. That's outcome-shaping. 8.3 is calibrated. Final: 8.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Across the death of a language" appears in paragraph 2 ("when the last speaker of the river-tongue sighed out his final word") and paragraph 18 ("Across the death of a language, she had translated texture into sound"). The timeframe is the story's conceptual bracket. Setup (para 2), Development (implied throughout—the urgency is that the language is dying/dead), Payoff (para 18 recapitulates the frame; para 20 extends beyond her death). All three gates met. Does the timeframe tighten decisions? The dying language motivates her urgency (para 2), but on-page time is not tracked as a live clock—no countdown, no "hours left" pressure. The timeframe is a thematic container rather than a tactical constraint. Setup +0.4, one beat (her death, para 18) +0.4, closure +0.8 (para 18–19 reference the frame), cost +0.4 (her death completes the timeframe), thematic +0.5 (the frame is the story's thesis). Total +2.5. Frictions: no on-page clock or time tracking −0.6, told rather than enacted as ticking pressure −0.5. 3.0 + 2.5 − 1.1 = 4.4. But "across" implies span, not urgency; the timeframe is structural rather than suspenseful. For a ~3700-word piece, a thematic timeframe is valid. Add +0.3 for structural integrity. 4.4 + 0.3 = 4.7. However, the "last speaker" dies in para 2, which sets a before/after hinge, and her transformation (para 12–16) unfolds over describable beats (moonrise, speaking, swallowing, calcification progression), which is temporal tracking. The timeframe is present and causal. Revise: +0.5 setup, +0.9 (two beats: language death, her death), +1.0 closure (the frame is the resolution thesis), +0.5 cost, +0.4 theme = +3.3. Frictions: no live countdown −0.5. 3.0 + 3.3 − 0.5 = 5.8. Round down: 5.8. But the rubric says "vague or untracked time trends low; a live clock that alters moves trends high"—this timeframe is tracked (last speaker dies → she acts → she dies → language persists) but not urgent. Mid-band: 6.1 reflects structural presence without tactical pressure. Final: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To translate texture into sound" is the protagonist's explicit goal (paragraph 2: "roughness of reeds, slickness of wet clay, grit of funeral pots—waiting to be translated into sound"; paragraph 7: "tactile stories she hoped to convert into audible grammar"; paragraph 18: "she had translated texture into sound"). Setup (para 2), Development (every ritual action advances this goal: sorting feathers para 7, speaking "mud-slip" para 11, swallowing the diamond para 13, becoming a phonograph para 12, releasing choirs para 14), Payoff (para 18 declares success; para 20 shows travelers "speaking in textures"). All three gates. The motivation is clear, consistent, and drives every choice. Early +0.7, three+ beats (the entire plot) +1.4, causal +1.5 (the goal determines all tactics), closure +1.6 (para 18–20 confirm the goal achieved), cost +0.6 (her life), specificity +0.6 (texture-to-sound is unique to her method). Total +6.4. Frictions: the motivation is declared and pursued, but is it dramatized as conflicted? Paragraph 11: "She feared the curse, but feared silence more"—told rather than shown via on-page hesitation or competing impulses in the swallowing beat. Summary-only −0.4. Also, does she ever doubt the goal or face a friction between wanting and fearing? The "feared silence more" line suggests conflict, but it's resolved off-page before the action. Apply −0.3 for insufficient on-page friction. 3.0 + 6.4 − 0.7 = 8.7. But re-reading, paragraph 11 does show the moment of acceptance: "the curse was awakening, but so was the language, and she accepted the exchange"—that's an on-page choice, dramatized via the diamond cracking and her speaking. The acceptance is visible. Remove −0.3, keep −0.4 for the earlier summary. 8.7 + 0.3 = 9.0. However, does she weigh alternatives or face temptation to stop? No; once she descends (para 4), she commits. The goal is monolithic. For high scores, "friction between wants and costs trends high"—the friction is present (fear vs. purpose) but resolved early. Mid-high band: 7.6 reflects strong motivation with modest conflict. Final: 7.6.</comment>
