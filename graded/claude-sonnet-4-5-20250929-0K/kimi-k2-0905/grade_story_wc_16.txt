<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority leans heavily on label-speak ("carefully reckless," "cautious exuberance") and her actions follow a straight line without meaningful internal contradiction dramatized in scene. The dialogue with the archive's spirits introduces a genuine exchange, but her central choice—leaving the ink well—arrives without visible struggle over competing impulses. Emotions are asserted through metaphor ("heart exuberant yet measured") rather than embodied through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The piece never forces her to weigh incompatible goods on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows a causal lens: Elara translates, the archive resists, she offers restitution, the symphonies complete. Orientation is present by line ~60 (who, where, when). The closure—leaving the ink well glowing as a future promise—reads as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (her absence becomes the final note), but the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page. One persistent constraint (the archive's possessiveness) shapes tactics in the middle, lifting execution. The "by sunrise" coda tells outcomes rather than showing a decisive on-page reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive exerts genuine pressure: shelves creak, candles snuff, the mural's stitched mouths appear and later unpucker. The glass ink well recurs as both tool and charged object, constraining her work and ultimately left behind to embody the promise. Sensory detail (ash and honey taste, iron and regret dust) is vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the side corridor exit and crowd convergence ground the final move. The environment directly shapes her restitution tactic and the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring trust via the symphonies—is signaled early and persists. The archive's resistance (candles snuffing, mural reveal) tightens pressure in the middle, forcing Elara's restitution offer. That offer narrows options and enables the completion, meeting the causal lens's escalation test. The final act (leaving the ink well) forecloses the path of keeping control, with cost legible in her absence. One meaningful tightening and a visible trade-off justify mid-7 eligibility, but the cost could be more visceral; the "street vendors hear it" epilogue dilutes immediate stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme—trust restored through recognition of shared covenants—emerges from the ink well's prismatic vowels, the archive's consent, and the hum spreading into dreams. The final image (ink well waiting, writing new promises) attempts a non-literal answer but leans on abstraction ("symphonies of truth," "interconnected promises") without rooting it in a single, irreducible particular. The epilogue's "street vendors," "children chanting" tells thematic outcomes rather than letting the image resonate. No overt moralizing, but the theme remains partially ornamental rather than embodied in a charged, specific closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The POV holds single third-person throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and ornate ("prismatic," "micro-note," "spectral letters"), fitting an arcane linguist but occasionally drifting into decorative excess ("miniature galaxies of vowels that twinkled like stars") that slows momentum. Elara's speech to the archive ("I promise to return what was stolen") carries subtext and goal pursuit. Perceptual signature is present but generic for the archetype; the narrator's syntax remains uniform across emotional peaks, lacking the compression or jagged rhythm pressure would impose. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew") appear frequently without voice necessity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("symphonies of truth," "liquid ledger," "choirs converge on the same pitch"), often appearing in consecutive sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops are present: "symphonies of truth" recurs ~8 times, "carefully reckless" twice, with synonym churn around "promise/covenant/oath." Template cadence appears in the opening third: "She had come… because trust… had snapped… and silence had grown." The final paragraph's "letter by letter, until every tongue" reads as scaffold. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but the loops and ornamental metaphor reduce propulsion in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The premise—extinct language archive, prismatic ink, symphonies of truth—combines high-concept elements but risks template fantasy tropes (magical linguist, last-speaker martyrdom, world-healing song). The mural's stitched mouths and Elara's restitution offer add a fresh ethical dimension, and leaving the ink well behind as a living promise is a non-obvious choice. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows its logic. However, the "trust restored via ancient language" frame echoes common SFF templates, and the transformation relies more on ornamental specificity (glass ink well, prismatic hues) than on lived detail or moral calculus that redefines the archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes three key choices: opening the folio, offering restitution aloud, and leaving the ink well. The restitution offer (middle third) narrows options and enables the archive's consent, meeting development. Her final choice to leave the ink well shapes the closure image directly. Early signal is strong. Cost is present but abstract (her absence as "the final note"). The archetype is signaled by role more than by irreplaceable traits, and a generic scholar could execute similar beats with minor edits, capping upper reach.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass ink well appears in beat one (set on lectern), is used to write the score (middle), and is left behind glowing in the closure image, reweighted as the archive's voice. Three distinct beats, early signal, closure linkage, and the reprise shifts meaning from tool to promise-bearer. Cost is tied to it (Elara's choice to leave it forfeits control). Specificity is high (prismatic liquid, spectral letters, miniature aurora). The object could be replaced by another magical writing implement with modest edits, preventing the highest band, but integration is strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "symphonies of truth" concept is named ~8 times and frames Elara's goal (harmonies that restore trust). It appears in setup, middle (the score builds chords), and closure (the archive hums a tonic that spreads into dreams). However, the mechanics remain abstract; the concept does not narrow tactical options on the page. The ink's prismatic hues and the mural's transformation are concrete, but "symphonies" itself stays decorative, a thematic label rather than a force that alters her moves. Closure participation is present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Carefully reckless" is labeled twice (opening paragraph, exit paragraph) but never dramatized through a choice that trades safety for gain with visible cost. The text tells us she "would trace a rune with one finger while holding a match in the other," yet no such moment occurs. Her actual moves (writing faster, offering restitution, leaving the ink well) are methodical and risk-averse. The attribute is ornamental, not causal. Swappable with "bold," "meticulous," or similar without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" is named in the opening (unsnarl suspicion), drives her realization that she must offer restitution (middle: "unsnarling required more than translation"), and echoes in the closure ("unsnarl the silence"). Three beats, clear causal role, and closure linkage. However, the action itself is abstract; the text does not show the tangles being loosened through specific phonetic or grammatical work. The restitution offer does more causal work than the unsnarling mechanic. A near-synonym like "resolve" or "disentangle" could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method "interconnected promises" is signaled in the opening (ink as "liquid ledger of interconnected promises") and returns at closure ("every tongue… could unsnarl the silence and speak"). Elara's restitution is itself a promise exchanged for the archive's consent, showing the method in action. Two beats, closure linkage, and modest causal work (the exchange enables completion). However, the mechanics are told rather than demonstrated; we do not see how one promise binds to another on the page. Specificity is moderate; "mutual oaths" or "shared covenants" could substitute with small edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The extinct language archive is present throughout, exerts genuine resistance (shelves creak, candles snuff, mural appears), and supplies resources (the folio, the signatures of dead speakers). It constrains Elara's tactic, forcing her restitution offer. The archive's transformation (warm wind, unpuckered mouths) and final hum shape the closure directly. Early signal, multiple beats, causal pressure, and closure participation are all strong. Cost is tied to the setting (the archive was possessive, now cooperative). Irreplaceability is high; no generic library could perform these functions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Before paths diverge" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs as a thematic frame, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page. No live clock; Elara works "before the Council's guards arrived," but we never feel the minutes shrinking. The urgency is declared, not dramatized. The phrase could be removed with no tactical loss; her choices proceed at a steady, untimed pace. The reprise adds lyric resonance but no causal pressure. Swappable with "at a crossroads" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to restore trust is stated early ("trust… had snapped") and drives her goal throughout. Her restitution offer ("I promise to return what was stolen") dramatizes the desire in one key choice. The epilogue shows the outcome (trust returns "like dawn"). Setup, development, and closure participation are present. However, the motivation never conflicts with another want on the page; no friction between her desire and a competing cost or fear. The motivation is functional but could be swapped for "heal division" or "bridge silence" with minor edits, capping upper reach.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named once in the final third ("heart exuberant yet measured") and echoed in "carefully reckless," but the tone itself is consistent high-fantasy ornate lyricism throughout, not a modulating blend of caution and exuberance. The prose never shifts cadence to reflect urgency or restraint; sentences remain elaborate and measured even during the archive's resistance. The label is decorative. A tonal shift at the closure (shorter sentences, sharper images) would charge the final image; instead, the epilogue continues the same ornate rhythm, flattening the effect.</comment>
