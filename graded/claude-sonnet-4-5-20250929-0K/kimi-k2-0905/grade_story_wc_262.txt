<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is heavily metaphoric but her goal—to find unused love crystallized in the theater—remains clear and drives the sequence. The grief motivation is established early (mother's vanishing, hummed lyrics, wax-sealed letters). Internal contradiction emerges when she realizes "love unused is not gone; it loops," which shifts her stance from retrieval to release. However, the final turn feels arrived-at rather than wrestled; the discovery of the cigarette case and complete letter reads convenient, and the climactic choice to scratch new lyrics lacks visible cost or foreclosed options on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (film strip, projection, auditorium echo) toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation anchors (Mara, projection booth, present night) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure attempt is a Conceptual Repricing: "Love is never unused, only stored in dark rooms until someone projects it," reweighting the premise of grief as retrieval into grief as circulation. Cost is asserted ("ashes in her pocket") but the felt price is thin; the letter's blank-to-complete transformation and the sudden appearance of the cigarette case both arrive as gifts rather than dramatized struggle. The causal chain from psychometry reading → projector self-threading → screen playback → found object relies on coincidence resolving rather than complicating, which weakens escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly anchored—rusted reel, tiny window framing empty auditorium, ancient mechanisms—and the spatial details (narrow stair, balcony door, velvet seats) guide action. Sensory specificity is strong: "dust floated like slow film frames," "wax that smelled of nitrate film," "hushed thunder outside—storm without rain, like applause trapped behind velvet curtains." The booth's tools (tweezers, crystal sphere, film canister) are handled on the page. The setting charges the final image when "pigeons fluttered like white sprocket holes" and rain drums the marquee, though the metaphoric density occasionally ornamentalizes rather than constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: recover the lost lyrics/message from her mother. One meaningful pressure point occurs when the film strip "suddenly moved of its own accord," threading itself—a reversal that narrows Mara's agency. The ending offers a stance shift (from seeking storage to accepting circulation) but the tightening is conceptual rather than tactical; no live option is visibly foreclosed. The coincidental provision of the complete letter and the cigarette case's discovery resolve the problem without Mara's prior struggle shaping the outcome. Cost is claimed ("envelope ashes") but the price feels decorative rather than dramatized in a high-pressure choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—love as stored potential awaiting projection—emerges organically from the film-strip metaphor and Mara's psychometry attempt. The postscript "Love is never unused, only stored in dark rooms until someone projects it" articulates the concept but does so within the letter's diegetic frame, avoiding naked thesis. The final image (screen brightening, letter threading into Mara's chest, warmth spreading) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The chorus completing and spreading to a passerby in the last line extends the theme beyond Mara without moralizing. Minor slip: "goodbye letter's tune" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, though the image work rescues it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV (Mara) with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: she overlays "remembered brightness" on present gloom, notices wax smells and light as metaphor. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("incubate the leftover feelings," "hushed thunder outside") without register breaks. The metaphoric density is voice-motivated but occasionally stacks ("silent lightning," "white sprocket holes") in ways that risk opacity under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The prose maintains rhythmic control, though the uniformly poetic register flattens urgency in pivotal beats where sharper compression might heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent but verges on overwriting in high-pressure beats: "hushed thunder outside—storm without rain, like applause trapped behind velvet curtains" stacks three vehicles in one clause. Paraphrase loop: "love unused is not gone; it loops" in paragraph 16 is then restated as "Love is never unused, only stored" in paragraph 23. Syntactic variety is present but several lines open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" without modulation. Information density is high; most sentences advance image or action. No grammatical errors or pronoun ambiguity. The opening and closing images are strong, but template cadence ("Mara [verb], [verb], [verb]") appears in three consecutive beats mid-story, dulling momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of psychometry, silent-film projection, and grief-as-stored-love is specific and non-obvious; the projection booth as vault for unutilized emotion transforms a familiar "haunted theater" frame. The mechanics (film strip self-threading, scratching new lyrics onto celluloid, wax-sealed letters as film frames) feel earned by the premise. The turn—unused love loops until projected—grows from prior particulars. The final image (letter threading into chest, passerby humming the chorus) offers fresh emotional specificity. Minor derivative note: the "messages from the dead via old media" premise echoes genre templates, but the transformation through embodied ritual (psychometry, manual projection) and the conceptual move from retrieval to circulation lifts it into fresh territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices create key turns: performs psychometry (paragraph 6), descends to watch the projection (paragraph 13), scratches new lyrics onto the film (paragraph 18), finds the cigarette case (paragraph 21). Present throughout; drives all major beats; shapes the ending when she "left the Orion Palace" with ashes and film strip. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Film strip appears in paragraph 6 (lifted with tweezers), paragraph 11 (moves of its own accord, threads itself), paragraph 17 (removed, scratched with new lyrics), paragraph 18 (threaded again), paragraph 24 (dissolves into light, threads into Mara's chest), and paragraph 26 (coiled in her bag). Used in at least five distinct beats; evolves from inert object to animate force to closure symbol. Indispensable to plot and final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Goodbye letters frame stakes from paragraph 5 (mother's wax-sealed letters) through paragraph 14 (onscreen girl writes a goodbye letter), paragraph 15 (the letter Mara keeps under her pillow), paragraph 22 (envelope now addressed and complete), and paragraph 23 (postscript). The concept shapes her quest and reweights at closure: the letter transforms from blank to complete, and its message reconfigures her understanding of love. Central to theme and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative mind" is named in paragraph 4 when Mara overlays remembered brightness on present gloom. This enables her psychometry visualization and the projection sequence, but the trait is largely label-only after paragraph 4; no on-page moment shows a cost or constraint tied specifically to spatial imagination versus general perception. Mid-band for functional presence without distinct pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Incubate" is introduced in paragraph 2 ("incubate the leftover feelings"), reappears in paragraph 6 ("incubate in the booth's stale air"), and paragraph 10 ("she whispered the half-remembered chorus, letting it incubate"). The action of letting emotions crystallize in the dark drives the method (psychometry) and shapes the ending when "incubated love finally hatch[es]" in paragraph 25. Essential metaphor that defines her approach and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is signaled in paragraph 6, performed in paragraph 8 (fingertips tingle, images flicker across the orb), and its results drive paragraphs 9–13 (vision of mother, projector activation). The method is mechanical and causal: without psychometry, the film strip does not self-thread and the vision does not appear. Shapes two major beats and enables the closure discovery.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Projection booth is established in paragraph 1, supplies tools (rusted reel, tweezers, crystal sphere, ancient projector, canister) across paragraphs 6–11, and the booth's mechanics (narrow stair, balcony door, velvet seats) guide Mara's descent and search in paragraphs 13–21. The setting's physical resources (projector, film, auditorium layout) constrain and enable all major beats. The final paragraph personifies the booth as "a vault ready for the next spatially imaginative heart," charging the closure image. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Forgotten lyrics searching for the tune" is mentioned in paragraph 4, and "the lost stanza" appears in paragraph 13. The timeframe is poetic rather than tactical; no live clock or escalating deadline tightens decisions. The search completes when the chorus is found (paragraph 23), but the progression is coincidental rather than time-driven. Present thematically, replaceable mechanically.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Desire "to find where unused love is stored" is established in paragraph 2 and drives Mara's psychometry attempt (paragraph 6), her descent to the auditorium (paragraph 13), and her realization in paragraph 16 ("love unused is not gone; it loops"). The motivation is dramatized through her handling of objects and narrows at closure when she shifts from seeking storage to accepting circulation. Friction appears when the letter is blank (paragraph 15) versus complete (paragraph 22), showing cost in waiting and incompleteness.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" is introduced in paragraph 7 ("storm without rain, like applause trapped behind velvet curtains"), recurs in paragraph 20 ("auditorium answered with hushed thunder"), and resolves in paragraph 26 ("storm clouds outside broke into real rain, drumming on the marquee, applauding"). Tone modulates from suppressed potential to released energy, charging the final image. Coherent and purposeful throughout; the metaphor tightens at closure when the hushed becomes audible.</comment>
