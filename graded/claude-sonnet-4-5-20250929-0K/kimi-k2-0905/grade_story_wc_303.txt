<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is present and she makes the pivotal choice to play the violin, but her decision process relies heavily on external nudging (the cereus's commands, the coffee-stain vision) rather than internal contradiction acting in scene. The interiority leans toward poetic abstraction ("mulberry ache in her throat—half grief, half ripeness") rather than embodied, character-particular sensation. The choice to condemn the empire's harvests feels insufficiently earned; we see little struggle between her professional ethics and revolutionary impulse before the bow touches the strings.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation by ~120 words and delivers an on-page Decisive Change when Lira plays the violin, triggering empire-wide consequences. However, the causal chain depends on convenient external agents: the cereus pushes her decision, the coffee stain reveals the backstory, and the violin's properties are told rather than discovered through action. The closure unit lands with conceptual cost (toppled empire, failed harvests), but the cost feels abstract and geographically distant rather than viscerally present in Lira's immediate experience at the moment of playing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is vividly described with sensory specificity (crushed lilac, bruised purple dome), and the ice violin's refractive properties are integrated into multiple beats. The cereus's roots anchor Lira physically at the decision point, demonstrating micro-setting constraint. However, much of the setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than shaping tactical choices; the midsummer timeframe and observatory location could be swapped without fundamentally altering Lira's decision logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to play the forbidden adagio and trigger imperial collapse—is signaled early and crystallizes at the climax. The piece presents one meaningful tightening when Lira lifts the bow despite knowing the consequences. However, the escalation lacks intermediate reversals or complications; the path from coffee-stain revelation to playing is nearly linear. The cost (empire-wide harvest failure, throne loss) is declared rather than felt on the page; we see none of the immediate human consequences in Lira's present moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of destiny as "perforated silk" that can be tugged and unraveled emerges through repeated imagery (forged bills, perforations, the coffee stain). However, the piece tends toward overt thematic statement rather than letting meaning arise from particulars: "she was both researcher and archivist, arsonist" and "she had weighed the dream and found it lighter than an empire" tell the theme directly. The final image of orchards blooming out of season offers resonance, but the observatory scene itself lacks enough dramatic friction to fully earn the conceptual weight placed on Lira's choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance and employs a lush, elevated register appropriate to the fantastical premise. Perceptual signature is present in the "mulberry ache" and plant-gossip filtering, though these feel more decorative than character-specific. The prose occasionally slips into unmotivated syntactic complexity ("the violin wanted to return home, and it whispered that home was here, where the constellations were pinned back by velvet curtains instead of gravity") that prioritizes metaphoric density over moment-to-moment clarity of thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose demonstrates high figurative density and rhythmic ambition, but several beats suffer from overwriting that obscures rather than sharpens meaning. "The domed ceiling a bruised purple that made every footstep feel like trespass" stacks metaphors without clear vehicle logic. Multiple adjacent sentences restate the same content with synonym variation: the violin "wanted to return home" / "whispered that home was here" / glaciers "remember" all gesture at the same idea. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph's repeated "she had" constructions. The closure beat itself remains relatively clean, preventing deeper penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination of ice-violin, plant telepathy, and coffee-stain divination creates a distinctive aesthetic, and the premise of weaponized glacial memory offers a fresh angle on empire-toppling narratives. However, the core emotional arc—idealistic researcher becomes revolutionary—follows a familiar template without sufficient transformation through lived particulars. The specificity lies primarily in ornamental world-building (night-blooming cereus, ex-imperial cartographer) rather than in the moral calculus of Lira's choice, which resolves predictably once the coffee stain reveals the child-emperor's crimes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira appears throughout and makes the climactic decision to play the violin, but her agency is heavily mediated by external nudges (cereus commands, coffee-stain prophecy). Her role as provenance researcher shapes the investigation but not the final choice; she acts despite her professional mandate rather than because of character-specific conflict between archival ethics and revolutionary impulse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ice violin is handled in three distinct beats: Lira carries it into the observatory fearing it will melt, places it on the dais where moonlight refracts through it, and finally plays it to trigger the climax. Its physical properties (melting, coldness, refractive ice) constrain her timeline and enable the empire-wide winter propagation. The object's ancestral-cold premise directly shapes the story's central mechanism and closure consequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Perforated destiny appears as metaphor ("each fake signature a perforation," "destiny already resembled perforated silk") and in the coffee-stain vision, but it functions more as thematic coloring than as a rule that alters on-page options. The concept is declared rather than dramatized through choice architecture; Lira's decision to play or not play would exist identically without the perforation imagery.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Plant telepathy appears in two beats: the cereus hums "propagate" and later wraps roots around Lira's ankles, and at the end plants "sang back" in gratitude. The trait enables the propagation mechanism and physically anchors Lira at the decision point, but the cost or constraint is minimal—she receives encouragement rather than conflicting demands. The telepathy could be removed and replaced with Lira's own resolve without fundamentally breaking causality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Propagate appears as the cereus's command, the violin's frost-seed dispersal mechanism, and the empire-wide consequence when blossoms seal into crystal memory. The action structures the middle and ending beats and provides the conceptual through-line from plant gossip to imperial collapse. However, the propagation itself is told in summary ("each subsequent note propagated outward") rather than shown through intermediate tactile or sensory evidence, weakening its presence at the climax.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Coffee-stain reading is set up when Lira pours her thermos onto the archival saucer, and the resulting vision (ice palace, child-emperor, glacial instruments) provides the crucial backstory that justifies her decision to play. The method appears in one extended beat and directly enables the plot's causal hinge. However, the mechanics are convenient rather than constrained—no cost, failure mode, or ambiguity complicates the divination, and it arrives precisely when needed without prior establishment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The velvet observatory at midsummer provides vivid sensory anchoring (crushed lilac, bruised purple dome, potted cereus) and the midsummer timeframe aligns with the "promise loses its glow" deadline. The setting's resources (dais, moonlight refraction, night-blooming cereus) participate in the action. However, the location itself does not constrain Lira's choice; the violin could be played elsewhere with similar consequence. The observatory functions more as atmospheric container than as tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the promise loses its glow" is mentioned alongside the moon slipping toward the horizon, establishing urgency. However, the time pressure is not tracked or tested during Lira's deliberation; she lifts the bow and plays without any intermediate beat showing the promise dimming or the moon's position changing. The deadline functions as declared stakes rather than a live clock that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to weigh a dream (world without conquest) against an empire is stated by the cartographer and reiterated in the coffee-stain vision and Lira's final reflection. The choice is dramatized when she draws the bow, knowing the consequences. However, the motivation is more thematic frame than embodied desire; we see little of Lira's personal stake in empire collapse versus her professional duty, and the "weighing" happens largely in exposition rather than through conflicted micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mulberry ache is invoked once ("the mulberry ache in her throat—half grief, half ripeness") as a descriptor for Lira's emotional state, and the prose maintains a lush, melancholic register throughout. The tone modulates slightly from investigative calm to lyric intensity at the climax. However, "mulberry ache" itself does not recur or charge the final image; the ending shifts to botanical gratitude and tired eyes, losing the specific grief-ripeness texture established earlier.</comment>
