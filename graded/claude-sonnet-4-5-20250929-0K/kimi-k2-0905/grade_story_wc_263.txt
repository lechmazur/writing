<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear—freeing trapped creativity—and interiority is concrete in key moments (the five-year-old self with glitter, teachers' scissors). However, the character moves through much of the story in a passive, oracular mode; she enacts a ritual rather than making high-stakes choices under pressure. The final dissolution reads more as surrender to a predetermined fate than as an earned renunciation that forecloses a live path. Internal contradiction is minimal; she never wavers or second-guesses the design.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early and holds it through to closure: sensory density builds, the aurora descends, the instrument is dismantled and reassembled into a body-map, and the protagonist dissolves into light. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she becomes part of the sky's sentence, her body traded for perpetual creative transmission—with conceptual cost made legible in the final image. Orientation is delayed (who/when anchor by ~180 words) but the disorientation serves the lyric pattern and pays off at closure, so the penalty is waived. One meaningful deepening occurs when she lies inside the instrument-constellation and the aurora threads her outline.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway is signaled in the opening line, pressures the protagonist's timeline ("Tonight the archway's curtains…hung low enough"), and charges the final image when it folds into "a single emerald point above her heart." The astronomical instrument functions as micro-setting: its parts (latitude scale, polar axis, counterweights) are handled across multiple beats and reassembled into a body-constellation that enables the closure. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (breath frosting the scale, cheek against frost, ribbons of liquid light), filtered through the protagonist's perceptual priorities. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity before it calcifies—is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens when the aurora descends and the protagonist must dismantle the instrument, then deepens when she lies inside the design and the past/future fold into the present. The final act (dissolution into light) reweights the cost: her body becomes the medium, a permanent rest that enables ongoing transmission. However, the protagonist's agency is more ritual enactment than decision under conflicting options; she never seriously considers refusing or altering the path, which limits the felt stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—create, or perish, or create again—emerges from the sky's three-syllable sentence and the protagonist's embodied response rather than from authorial statement. The story resists tidy morals: the protagonist's sacrifice is neither glorified nor mourned, and the ending offers an invitation rather than a command. The final image (the dark-glass circle, the ghost meridian) reweights prior material without stating a thesis. However, the middle section risks abstraction ("every canvas left blank by fear, every melody hummed once then forgotten in traffic") that momentarily drifts from the protagonist's specific wound toward generic catalog.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and tightly controlled: "moonstruck dreamer," "unwritten calendar of nights," "migraine of unborn constellations." POV remains stable in close third, and psychic distance modulates purposefully (tightening during the aurora descent, widening slightly for the memory of the five-year-old self). Diction matches the protagonist's perceptual signature—star-struck, metaphor-saturated—without register drift. The prose texture is consistent under pressure, though the density of figurative language occasionally risks slowing momentum in non-peak beats. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of several beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, risking overwriting (−0.5). Examples: "a migraine of unborn constellations," "liquid light," "filament of remembered stardust," "ghost meridian"—each vivid in isolation but stacked without relief. Two instances of paraphrase loops: "Each footfall erased yesterday's date, melting the calendar into white silence, yet the sky kept writing new months" restates erasure/rewriting, and "She understood: the sky was not commanding her; it was warning itself" clarifies what the prior sentence already implied (−0.2). No grammatical errors or pronoun ambiguities. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Propulsion is adequate but occasionally slowed by lush description in transitional beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of aurora-as-archive, instrument-as-body-map, and stardust-memory offers a non-obvious angle on the artist's-sacrifice trope. The story commits fully to its lyric premise and follows the implications without retreat. The ending's invitation ("create, or perish, or create again") feels earned in hindsight and avoids the cliché of either pure martyrdom or triumphant vindication. However, the core emotional arc—creative wound inflicted by institutional authority, followed by transcendent sacrifice—echoes familiar templates; the transformation lies more in execution and imagery than in a structural or thematic surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The moonstruck dreamer is present throughout and drives the narrative arc, but her choices are largely ritualistic rather than high-stakes decisions that alter tactics. She follows the unspoken words, dismantles the instrument, arranges the pieces, and lies inside the design without friction or on-page hesitation. Setup is immediate (opening line), development occurs when she begins dismantling (mid-story), and payoff is clear (she dissolves into the sky's sentence). The character is indispensable to the story's logic, yet her agency reads more as enactment than choice under pressure, which limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The astronomical instrument is introduced in the opening line, handled across multiple beats (she traces the latitude scale, tilts the tube, loosens clamps, dismantles it screw by screw, arranges the pieces into a constellation), and its transformation charges the closure (the parts become a body-map through which the aurora threads her outline). Setup is immediate, development is sustained (at least three distinct beats), and payoff is integral to the ending. The object's specific properties (polar axis, counterweights, cranks, objective mirror) matter; swapping it for a generic telescope would break the body-constellation logic. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Remembered stardust is signaled early ("she needed to remember stardust before it calcified into ordinary bone") and shapes the protagonist's motive throughout. It reappears in the midpoint reflection ("the stardust remembered every similar wound") and charges the closure ("a filament of remembered stardust now part of the sky's ongoing sentence"). The concept alters tactics (she must free the memory to prevent soul-colorblindness) and supplies the story's core metaphor. Setup is clear, development occurs when she accesses the memory inside the design, and payoff is explicit in the final image. The concept is irreplaceable; the story's logic hinges on stardust as both origin and medium.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Hears unspoken words is introduced early ("the hush that only she could hear") and enables the three-syllable sentence ("Create," "or," "perish") that drives the middle beats. The attribute constrains her path (she alone can receive the sky's warning) and shapes her response (she dismantles the instrument to hear more clearly). Setup is immediate, development occurs when the words grow clearer after dismantling, and payoff is implicit in the ending (the unspoken words become an invitation for future travelers). However, the attribute is somewhat swappable (a visionary could see symbols, a sensitive could feel vibrations) without major structural change, which limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rest is the story's pivotal action, signaled early ("the dreamer knew the moment had arrived to rest") and redefined in the next sentence ("Not the kind of rest that closes eyes, but the kind that opens memory"). The act drives the protagonist's choices: she lies inside the instrument-constellation, and that rest becomes permanent when she dissolves into light. Setup is clear, development occurs when she enacts the rest, and payoff is the story's closure (her body becomes part of the sky's sentence). The specific meaning of rest—permanent dissolution as creative transmission—is irreplaceable; swapping it for another action would require a full rewrite. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tracing the path of falling stars is introduced early ("began tracing the path of falling stars with a gloved finger, reading the sky like Braille") and returns in the closure ("her body dissolving into the traced path"). The method enables the three-syllable sentence (each meteor delivers a syllable as she aligns the cross-hairs) and shapes her final rewriting ("She raised her hand…and began rewriting…sketching spirals"). Setup is clear, development occurs in at least two beats (tracing to receive words, rewriting to release creativity), and payoff is explicit. However, the mechanics are somewhat abstract (how tracing translates to rewriting is never concretized), which limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Aurora-lit archway is present in the opening line ("the aurora-lit archway overhead"), tightens the timeline ("Tonight the archway's curtains…hung low enough"), and charges the closure ("the archway folded into a single emerald point above her heart"). The setting supplies the light that threads the protagonist's outline and enables the dissolution. Setup is immediate, development occurs when the aurora descends and ribbons through the instrument skeleton, and payoff is integral to the ending image. The archway's specific properties (aurora curtains, violet and jade, close enough to graze the lens) constrain the protagonist's timeline and tactics. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Unwritten calendar is signaled early ("dragged the half-ton relic…for an unwritten calendar of nights," "Each footfall erased yesterday's date") and establishes durational scope. However, the timeframe remains abstract and does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The phrase "Tonight the archway's curtains…hung low enough" implies urgency, but no clock pressure is felt; the protagonist could have rested the prior night or the next without visible consequence. Setup is present, but development and payoff are minimal. The element is more thematic texture than functional constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>To free trapped creativity is stated early ("she needed to remember stardust before it calcified") and later clarified ("If she failed to free the stardust memory, the aurora would dim to a bruise, and every artist born after her would wake up colorblind in the soul"). The motivation drives her actions (dismantling the instrument, lying inside the design, rewriting with her translucent hand) and shapes the closure (her dissolution releases creativity outward). Setup is clear, development occurs across multiple beats, and payoff is explicit. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted choices; she never hesitates or weighs the cost against an alternative, which limits felt friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Shadowed rapture is established in the opening line's tremor and the "moonstruck dreamer" frame, sustained through "the unspoken words of stars that had died," "migraine of unborn constellations," and "In that shadowed rapture, time surrendered its sequence." The tone modulates with pressure: it is hushed and contemplative during the trek, intensifies when the aurora descends, and peaks in the dissolution beat. The final image ("create, or perish, or create again") maintains the tone's reverent urgency. Coherent throughout and charges the ending, though the density of figurative language occasionally risks ornamentation over pressure.</comment>
