<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ansel's interior life is rich and specific—his peripheral focus and methodical approach feel consistent—but his motivation remains largely asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The line "I will store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" reads as thematic declaration rather than embodied choice under pressure. The final action (locking the cellar) shows renunciation with visible cost, lifting the score, but the journey lacks micro-choices that reveal competing values in real time. Emotional states are filtered through elaborate metaphor rather than embodied sensation, creating distance at peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: Ansel's incremental study of reflections, percussion craters, and delays builds density toward the reversal of the timer and the return of lost hours. Orientation anchors appear promptly (marble cavern, locksmith, broken timer). Closure lands on the page—sealing the timer, releasing hours, locking wonder away—with felt cost (the key he will never duplicate, hours returning as translucent moths that dissolve). One pressure point tightens when he feeds silence backward, triggering the boy-image and the release. The lens holds without contradiction, but causality between studying angles and reversing the mechanism is implied rather than shown step-by-step, keeping this out of the high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The marble cavern functions as both backdrop and constraint: reflections delay by a heartbeat, light angles sketch memories, and the stone veins nest echoes. The timer mechanism is handled in multiple beats (setting it on the plinth, dismantling, reassembling in reverse), and its scalloped metal—percussion craters—directly informs the solution. The cellar at the end charges the closure image (wonder stored, locked away). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting does not pressure a choice in the middle third as strongly as it frames and resolves, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reversing time's theft—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through Ansel's nightly study and the cavern's responses, then tightens when he reassembles the timer in reverse and the boy-image releases the lost hours. The resolution is earned by his methodical reversal, not luck. However, the escalation is incremental rather than sharp; no live option is foreclosed mid-story, and the cost (sealing the timer, locking the cellar) is legible but not viscerally tested against a competing want. The stakes remain abstract (villages' clocks skip) rather than personally urgent for Ansel, limiting the felt pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—wonder versus reason, memory as echo, time's cost—emerges organically from the timer's harvest of voices, the boy-image, and the cellar lock. The final image (sealing the timer, locking the cellar with an unduplicated key) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral: wonder is preserved but inaccessible, a deliberate foreclosure. However, the line "I will store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" risks thematic echo by articulating the premise too directly. Subtext operates well in images (moths dissolving, cherries dropping), but the story occasionally tips into overt philosophizing ("every sound circles back thinner, wearing the clothes of its own absence") rather than letting particulars speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Ansel's perceptual signature—peripherally focused, attuned to reflection and sound—is consistent and voice-particular. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstracted register that strains plausibility for a locksmith under pressure: "crepuscular hours," "stray moments," "archive of stray moments," "erased minutes," "obedient again." Psychic distance is mostly controlled, but filter verbs and metaphoric density ("wounded season," "frost on a dying breath," "bruise") stack heavily in high-pressure beats, flattening immediacy. The prose reads as the author's poetic voice rather than Ansel's mind under stress, creating a tonal gap between role and language.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often striking ("jingling like distant cowbells heard through a fever," "pages closing," "translucent moths") but saturates nearly every sentence, reducing clarity and propulsion in peak beats. Mixed metaphors appear: the season exhales both cold light and a gray breath; reflections are "thin, fractured twins" that also "pool" and "coalesce." Paraphrase loops: "the wounded season" recurs four times without added pressure; "peripherally focused" is stated twice identically. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with participial phrases ("Carrying the silent artifact," "Ansel sat at his workbench"). Information density is high, but momentum drags under the metaphoric load. Applying −0.8 for figurative saturation, −0.3 for loops, −0.3 for template stems = baseline ~5.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—locksmith reverse-engineers time theft via echo-harvesting in a marble cavern—is specific and non-obvious. The timer mechanism fed by village voices, scalloped by percussion craters, is a fresh synthesis. However, the emotional arc (craftsman solves abstract problem, stores wonder away) lacks personal urgency or moral friction; swapping Ansel for another methodical artisan would leave the plot intact. The lyric frame and metaphoric density feel writerly rather than inevitable to this character. Risk-taking in structure and imagery is evident but does not fully cohere with the locksmith's interior life, keeping the piece in the mid-6s for originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ansel (reflective locksmith) is present throughout and drives the central action: he carries the timer, studies angles, dismantles and reverses the mechanism, and seals it in the cellar. His reflective trait is shown on the page (studying, measuring, noting patterns). He makes the key choice to feed silence backward, triggering the release of hours, and the final decision to lock the cellar with an unduplicated key. Early signal (first paragraph), middle involvement (dismantling, reverse assembly), closure participation (sealing, locking). The character's choices create the major turn. However, the reflection is more observational than conflicted; no competing impulse or cost is dramatized in the moment of reversal, limiting causal pressure. Baseline 3.0 + early +0.5 + three beats +1.4 + closure linkage +1.0 + specificity +0.3 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken timer mechanism is introduced in the first paragraph, handled in multiple beats (set on plinth, dismantled, springs and escapements laid out, percussion craters noted, reassembled in reverse), and sealed with silver at the end. Its specific properties (hollow worn by echo, scalloped by sound) enable the solution. The object shapes two key beats (dismantling to discover craters, reversing to release hours) and charges the closure (sealed, locked away). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6 = 8.0; round down to 7.8 for lack of visible cost tied solely to the object (the cost is Ansel's renunciation, not the timer's transformation).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Harvest of echoes is the core concept: the timer converted village voices into torque, and Ansel reverses the process to release the lost hours. The concept is introduced early (villages abandoned clocks, cavern blamed for swallowing hours) and shapes the central action (studying echoes, measuring delays, feeding silence backward). It drives the middle beat (discovering percussion craters prove echo-harvesting) and the closure (hours released as moths, echoes nesting in stone). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5 = 7.2; reduce −0.8 for abstraction (the mechanics of echo-harvesting are asserted, not shown in actionable steps that Ansel must navigate with trade-offs), landing at 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Peripherally focused is stated twice ("peripherally focused on the way each footfall scattered reflections," "peripherally focused, letting the margins teach him") and implied in the method (studying reflection angles, noting delays). However, the trait is label-only; no on-page action shows a cost or trade-off from this focus. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic with visible friction. Present in setup and middle, but ornamental. Baseline 3.0 + setup +0.4 + label mention in middle +0.2 = 3.6; applying −0.3 for label-only use and −0.5 for no cost connection = 2.8, but lifting slightly for thematic coherence with the reflective method to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Reverse-engineer is the explicit goal stated in paragraph four and enacted on the page: Ansel studies the timer's scalloped metal, discovers the echo-to-torque pattern, then "reassembled the device in reverse, feeding it silence instead, pressing each gear backward until it clicked into an earlier state." This action triggers the major turn (boy-image releasing hours). Early signal +0.6, causal pressure (the reversal creates the turn) +1.3, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (gears pressed backward, silence fed in) +0.5 = 6.4; but the mechanics are compressed and somewhat ornamental—no middle beat shows a failed attempt or trade-off in method—so applying −0.3 for summary treatment and +1.0 for indispensability at closure = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Studying reflection angles at different times is stated explicitly ("circled it slowly, studying reflection angles at different times: dawn's rose, noon's white, dusk's bruise") and shown in one beat (paragraph six). Each angle sketches a memory. Later, he measures delays with calipers of shadow and notes that the pattern matches the percussion craters. The method is signaled early, used in the middle, and its findings (matching pattern) inform the solution. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal linkage (pattern proof) +0.8, specificity +0.4 = 5.1; but the method does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off, and the mechanics are told rather than shown in action, so applying −0.3 for summary treatment and +0.9 for linking to the solution = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The marble cavern is introduced in the first sentence and present throughout. Its veins catch light, reflections delay by a heartbeat, and the stone's angles sketch memories. Ansel sets the timer on a natural plinth, studies reflection angles, and the cavern "answered with a hush like pages closing." At closure, echoes choose to stay behind, nesting in the stone. The setting provides the archive of stray moments and the mechanism for echo-harvesting. Early signal +0.7, two beats (studying angles, echoes nesting) +0.9, causal pressure (the cavern's reflections enable discovery) +1.0, closure linkage (echoes nesting) +1.0, specificity (marble veins, heartbeat delays) +0.6 = 7.2; rounding to 7.3 for the cavern's persistent constraint on perception and method.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Across the lull of a wounded season is stated in the opening and repeated in paragraphs four and twelve. The timeframe is atmospheric but vague: "wounded season" does not specify duration, and no clock or deadline tightens decisions. The passage of time is marked by "night after night" and "crepuscular hours," but these do not constrain tactics or force a trade-off. The season's end (giving way to ordinary autumn, clocks striking three, then four) charges the closure by showing time restored. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8 = 4.3; applying −0.5 for vagueness (no live clock or escalating pressure from time) and +0.3 for thematic coherence with the wounded-season motif = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>To store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later is stated explicitly mid-story ("I will store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later") and enacted at closure: Ansel seals the timer, locks the cellar with a key he will never duplicate, satisfied that wonder is stored, not killed. The motivation is present in setup (reverse-engineer the theft), dramatized in the middle (working through the season), and fulfilled at the end (sealing and locking). However, the desire is declared rather than shown through conflicted choices; no on-page moment tests wonder against reason with visible friction. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage (locking the cellar) +1.2, specificity (the unduplicated key, the silver-faced mechanism) +0.5 = 5.2; but the motivation drives the entire arc, so +1.7 for indispensability = 6.9.</comment>
