<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Ms. Penumbra remains a static observer throughout; her "sanely eccentric mind" is label-only, never constraining a choice or creating visible tradeoff. The scarf guides her passively through dimensional shifts, but she makes no consequential decisions—she simply follows its warmth and observes pre-narratives without struggle or cost. The final "smile" and return to her post suggest no meaningful change or renunciation earned by prior causality. Internal contradiction is absent; she processes metaphysical complexity with perfect equanimity and no embodied emotional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—layered images of hyperbolic geometry, pre-narrative spaces, and dimensional mapping. Orientation anchors arrive late: who/where/when coalesce only after ~200 words of abstract setup, triggering a −0.4 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing (stories live in hyperbolic folds, Ms. Penumbra stitches topology), but cost remains assertion-only: "helped awaken" and "already cataloging" describe outcomes without showing a visible price paid or path foreclosed. One meaningful tightening occurs (scarf warms → she steps between shelves → discovers raw narrative material), but the final return to her post resets the situation with no legible before/after in her stance or circumstance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry shelves that "curved away…like the inside of a seashell" and "angled away from each other at 179 degrees, then 181, then beyond what Euclid would allow" vividly anchor the scientific poetry library's surreal architecture. The scarf functions as micro-setting, its warmth guiding navigation and its tattered silk glowing at the center. However, the environment remains largely postcard description; the curved space enables Ms. Penumbra's dimensional passage but does not constrain a choice—she moves through freely without obstacle, loss, or tactical adjustment. The final image reuses "adjusted her tattered silk scarf," charging the object but not the spatial setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the place where stories live before they become words"—is clearly signaled but resolves without struggle: Ms. Penumbra steps between shelves, discovers pre-narratives as "topological pressure," and returns to her post, mission complete. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; the scarf's guidance is frictionless, and patrons pass through her "feeling only the familiar shiver of inspiration" without complicating her quest. Agency is absent—she observes and is led, never deciding under pressure. The resolution ("she had helped awaken") tells outcome without showing a choice, trade-off, or visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme—stories as topological phenomena existing in hyperbolic folds—emerges through images (Möbius strips of cause/effect, narrative gravity, pre-narratives as "absence of places") rather than overt statement. The scarf's "analog memories" and the library's architecture integrate conceptually, and the final image ("stories lived before anyone knew they needed telling") reweights the opening quest with lyric resonance. However, the ending borders on thematic summary ("she understood…finding where stories live meant accepting they lived everywhere and nowhere"), and no character contradiction or moral ambiguity complicates the vision. Patrons' unaware browsing contrasts Ms. Penumbra's dimensional work, but the piece leans toward explaining the conceit rather than dramatizing its human cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds steady, and the prose carries distinct texture: "sanely eccentric," "stellar sonnets," "topological pressure." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from external observation to interior metaphysics. However, diction drifts into academic register ("Riemannian metrics in iambic pentameter," "wave function of possibility," "strange attractor of inspiration") that reads more like conceptual showcase than character-specific perception. The graduate student and young poet remain voiceless, reducing distinctness. Free indirect style blurs at times—"She realized the scarf wasn't mapping places but mapping the absence of places"—where insight is told rather than discovered through sensory anchor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, often stacking metaphors within single sentences: "narratives that refused linear time," "pure topology," "Möbius strips of cause and effect," "narrative gravity," "strange attractor of inspiration." Many phrases loop conceptually without advancing action—"stories existed as pure topology" is restated as "topological fabric" and "hyperbolic folds between experience and expression." Template cadence appears in the mid-section: "She understood…She realized…She saw…She understood" across four paragraphs. Paraphrase loops touch the closure beat: "stories lived everywhere and nowhere" echoes "lived in the relationships between places" without added pressure. The final paragraph recycles "adjusted her tattered silk scarf" from the opening, and "stories that would eventually find their authors" repeats the throughline without new cost. Combined artifacts (density, loops, closure-zone repetition) trigger −1.2 and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry as a literal container for pre-narrative forms offers a fresh synthesis of mathematics, library setting, and metafiction. The scarf as "dimension-hopping cartographer" heirloom and Ms. Penumbra as "observer who collapsed the wave function" apply science concepts to story-generation in non-obvious ways. However, the premise remains conceptual showcase—geometric topology does not generate character friction or moral calculus. The protagonist's frictionless success and thematic explicitness ("finding where stories live meant accepting…") reduce risk and specificity. Transformation test: swap "hyperbolic geometry" for "fractal mirrors" or "quantum entanglement" and the emotional arc (librarian discovers metaphysical story-source, returns to post) remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Ms. Penumbra is present throughout and her quest frames the narrative (setup ✓). She moves between shelves and "worked in the spaces they couldn't perceive, stitching together the topological fabric" (development touch, payoff ✓). However, her role is observer and conduit—the scarf guides, she follows; she discovers but does not decide under pressure. No on-page choice alters tactics or incurs visible cost. Late-stage summary ("she had helped awaken") recounts impact without dramatizing action. Swappable with "archivist" or "curator" with minor edits. Two-gate minimum met (setup, payoff); mid-scene agency absent. Band: functional but replaceable; cap 4.6 (missing middle decision), apply −0.5 for passivity, −0.3 summary-only use = 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The scarf is handled at opening ("adjusted"), pulses with warmth in beat two (hyperbolic section), tightens during dimensional passage (beat three), glows with light (beat four), grows warmer (beat five), "settled into comfortable latency" (beat six), and is adjusted again at close (beat seven). It guides navigation, archives analog memories, and charges the final return to routine. Setup ✓, development (enables passage) ✓, payoff (final adjustment mirrors opening with reweighted meaning) ✓. However, its mechanics remain vague—"analog memories" are asserted, not shown constraining choice; Ms. Penumbra never struggles with or against it. The object enables rather than pressures. Three gates + charged reprise + beat involvement (four touches across scenes) + closure linkage, but low causal pressure and no visible cost tied to the scarf itself. Band guidance: 5.0–6.9 (one key turn), lift for reprise and beat count (+0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage) = ~6.6, reduce for passivity (−0.4) = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Analog memories" appear in the scarf's description (setup ~para 7: "analog memories stored in her scarf…began to surface as tactile sensations"), are mentioned again ("As she moved deeper…analog memories flooded her—not her own, but the scarf's archive"), and provide thematic resonance at closure ("its analog memories settled into comfortable latency"). Setup ✓, development (tactile sensations inform her understanding) ✓, payoff ✓. However, the concept remains abstract metaphor—no on-page scene shows how analog (versus digital) memory changes Ms. Penumbra's options or tactics. It decorates the scarf's function without mechanical consequence. Could be replaced with "archived echoes" or "recorded impressions" with no structural impact. Three gates met (eligible ≥6.1), but ornamental use (−0.8) and swappability (−0.7) and label-only (−0.3) and summary-only (−0.3) cap accumulation at −1.0 per policy = base 5.1 − 1.0 = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" appears twice: opening ("her sanely eccentric mind finding perfect order in the chaos") and closure ("her sanely eccentric mind already cataloging the new stories"). It labels her cognitive style but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. No scene shows her making an unconventional choice others would not, or paying a price for her idiosyncrasy. Setup ✓ (first para), payoff ✓ (final para), but middle development absent—no moment where the trait shapes a tactic or creates friction. Label-only (−0.3), ornamental (−0.8), no cost tie (−0.3) = cumulative −1.0 cap. Two gates (no middle) caps at 4.6; apply −1.0 and −0.7 for resolving without creating (she succeeds because of the label, not despite tradeoff) = 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is the protagonist's stated action at the center: "Here, she could reawaken dormant narratives by folding space-time through the scarf, connecting a child's lost toy to a dying star's final poem." Setup (quest "to find") ✓, development (she performs the action mid-story) ✓, payoff (patrons "suddenly understanding" and "scribbling verses" as result) ✓. Three gates met. However, the action is summary-told, not dramatized—no on-page beat shows her choosing which narratives to connect or what cost the folding exacts. The graduate student and poet's insights occur off-page during her dimensional work. Swappable with "ignite" or "stir" without structural change. Three gates + causal claim (patrons inspired) = eligible ~6.1, but summary-only (−0.4) and swappability (−0.3) = 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is introduced early (beat two: "hyperbolic geometry section, where books curved away"), explained ("the library's architecture followed hyperbolic principles"), and drives the dimensional passage ("stepped between two bookshelves that angled…beyond what Euclid would allow"). Setup ✓, development (the curved space creates narrative gravity and generates pre-narratives) ✓, payoff (final para: "its hyperbolic geometry now hummed with fresh narratives") ✓. Three gates met. The method shapes the library's surreal physics and Ms. Penumbra's navigation. However, mechanics remain assertion-only—how does non-Euclidean angle enable story-awakening? The geometry could be replaced with "fractal resonance" or "quantum superposition" with similar narrative function. Three gates + causal enablement + specificity (181° detail) = ~6.8, reduce for vague mechanics (−0.5) and partial swappability (−0.5) = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is named in the opening line, its hyperbolic shelves provide navigation structure, and its "center, where the curvature became infinite" is the site of story-reawakening. Setup ✓, development (shelves guide and enable dimensional passage) ✓, payoff (library "stood unchanged to casual observation, but…now hummed with fresh narratives") ✓. Three gates met. The setting supplies the metaphysical architecture essential to the plot and charges the final image. Specificity is high ("equations that rhymed and verses that calculated," "quantum lullabies and stellar sonnets"). However, the library does not pressure Ms. Penumbra's choices—she moves freely through it without obstacle, resource scarcity, or spatial constraint altering tactics. Three gates + closure charge + specificity + beat involvement (present throughout) = ~7.5, reduce for lack of tactical pressure (−0.8) = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"While patrons browse" appears in the motivation line and is restated: "While the browsers searched," "While patrons browsed, unaware," "While patrons browsed, she worked," "As dawn approached." Setup ✓ (opening context), development (mid-scene anchor) ✓, payoff (dawn signals end) ✓. Three gates met. However, time remains atmospheric—no ticking clock or deadline pressures Ms. Penumbra's choices. Patrons' browsing provides cover but does not complicate her quest; dawn's approach does not force a trade-off or rush. The timeframe could be "during closing rounds" or "between shifts" without structural change. Three gates met = eligible ~6.1, but no tactical pressure (−0.8), vague tracking (−0.5), swappable (−0.6) = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the place where stories live before they become words" is stated explicitly in the opening ("she pursued her own quest") and resolved at closure ("finding where stories live meant accepting they lived everywhere and nowhere"). Setup ✓, development (her dimensional passage is the quest in action) ✓, payoff ✓. Three gates met. The desire drives the plot structure and is present across all major beats. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted—Ms. Penumbra feels no doubt, fear, or competing want. The scarf's guidance is frictionless, and success arrives without visible sacrifice. The quest is told rather than tested. Three gates + structural spine + beat involvement = ~6.9, reduce for no friction (−0.8) and told-only interiority (−0.5) = 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" coheres throughout: Ms. Penumbra works alone at 3:17 a.m., patrons are unaware of her dimensional work, and she returns to solitary guardianship at close. The tone is contemplative, detached, and suffused with quiet wonder. Setup ✓ (graveyard shift, solo quest), development (she works "in the spaces they couldn't perceive"), payoff ("guarding the threshold" alone) ✓. Three gates met. The tone supports the metaphysical premise and remains stable through turns. However, it does not modulate under pressure—Ms. Penumbra's equanimity is static, and no moment of urgency, fear, or joy breaks the steady solitude. The final image mirrors the opening mood without reweighting it. Three gates + coherence + closure echo = ~6.3, reduce for static mood (−0.6) and lack of pressure modulation (−0.4) = 5.3.</comment>
