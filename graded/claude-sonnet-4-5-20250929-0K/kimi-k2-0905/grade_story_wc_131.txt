<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is characterized through methodical action (mapping joists, caching fragments) and specific interiority (sense memories triggered by fragments). The motivation to become visible through preserved voices shows internal consistency, though the shift from solitary dweller to collaborative curator feels somewhat telescoped. The girl functions less as a full character than as the recipient who validates Elias's three-year project. Embodied emotion is present in key moments ("made him weep," "closed his eyes") but the interior experience relies heavily on poetic assertion rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: fragments are cached, then uncovered in a layered release that builds density and reweights the stake of becoming visible. Orientation anchors early (crawl space dweller, library, dawn, outage). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the girl's whispered "I see you" and their joint reading crystallize the options—Elias moves from isolation to witnessed presence—with felt cost (three years of solitary labor now shared, the ending of his hidden autonomy). The cost is emotional and relational, legible in "would not cache alone anymore." One minor gap: the mechanics of how tape fragments "float up" and are heard without playback equipment is elided, creating a light logic strain that does not break the closure but slightly softens causal grounding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting is integrated: the library's pipe chases and floorboard gaps enable Elias's caching and the final uncovering; the crawl space constrains his visibility and movement. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (biography section, central reading table, knotholes). The "sapphire hush" of emergency lights provides atmospheric texture but does not constrain a choice. The outage timeframe creates urgency but the environment itself—steam pipes, joists, philosophy stacks—directly enables the protagonist's tactics and the girl's discovery, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Elias's desire to become visible to someone who needs the cached voices. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens as he methodically uncovers fragments; the girl's arrival and her tears at Lorca's voice provide the tightening that narrows options (he must reveal himself or remain hidden). The final fragment—his own voice—is the protagonist's decisive choice that forecloses solitary invisibility with visible cost: "would not cache alone anymore" signals the loss of his self-contained existence. Agency is clear; the cost is felt and scales appropriately to this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: stories as lanterns cached in darkness, the human need to be witnessed, and voices as resistance against erasure. The final image—girl reading while resting her hand on the boards "where a man once lived"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: visibility is achieved through shared preservation. The fragments (lullaby, Lorca, recipe) are specific and avoid abstraction. One slip: "Stories are lanterns" borders on thematic echo when Elias's recorded voice states it explicitly in the final third, though the line is diegetically motivated (a recording, not narrator intrusion) and the specificity of "cache them in darkness so others can find their way out" anchors it in concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Elias's perception throughout. Distance is controlled; interiority is filtered through his methodical observation ("sense memory flooded him," "felt himself becoming visible"). The single line of dialogue—"I see you"—is purposeful and advances the closure. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elias notices conduits, oxide surfaces, and the rhythm of footsteps. One mild register issue: "sapphire hush" and "duende" feel slightly elevated for a crawl-space dweller's lexicon, though they could be read as the narrator's voice rather than Elias's thought. The girl's whispered recognition and the shift to her hand "resting on the boards" in the final line are cleanly focalized.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally controlled with varied rhythm and purposeful detail. Information density is high in the opening third (three years, mapping, ferromagnetic tape). One paraphrase loop: "the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" appears verbatim in the first and eighth paragraphs, functioning as a refrain but bordering on scaffold. The line "He had cached them for her, though he hadn't known her face until this moment" tells the thematic link rather than letting the action carry it. Filter verbs ("felt himself becoming visible") are voice-motivated and sparse. Minor metaphor strain: fragments "wanted to be heard" anthropomorphizes without clear embodiment. No major artifact clusters, but the refrain and one summary beat prevent entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of crawl-space archivist, tape fragments as ghosted voices, and the library-as-refuge during grid failure is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the hidden-helper trope through the ferromagnetic medium and Elias's methodical preservation. Risk is present: the story commits to an elliptical, lyric mode where tape fragments "float up" without explicit playback mechanics, trusting the reader to accept the metaphoric logic. The final image—girl reading, hand on boards—feels earned and particular. One point of familiarity: the "invisible caretaker revealed to the one who needs him" arc echoes well-worn templates, though the tape-fragment mechanism and the library setting offer enough specificity to transform it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's choices drive key turns: caching fragments over months (setup), pausing to observe the girl (development), and uncovering fragments culminating in his own recorded voice (closure). His decision to push the final fragment "through a crack near her feet" is the pivot that makes him visible. Present across all three gates with clear causal pressure and closure linkage. The crawl-space location constrains his tactics (elbows worn smooth, pressing cheek to floorboard gaps) and his invisibility is the core tension resolved at the end. High irreplaceability: the story's logic depends on this exact character occupying this exact hidden position.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ferromagnetic tape reel fragment is introduced early (found yesterday, handled in paragraph 3) and triggers sense memory. It reappears in the caching description and is part of the constellation uncovered in the climax. However, it is not individually tracked across beats—multiple fragments are mentioned (Lorca, lullaby, recipe, Elias's voice) but the initial "ferromagnetic tape reel fragment" does not return with a distinct, reweighted presence. The object class (tape fragments) shapes the entire plot, but the specific "ferromagnetic tape reel fragment" described in paragraph 3 does not evolve or recur distinctly. Functional but somewhat diffuse across the ensemble of fragments.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sense memory is dramatized early: holding the fragment floods Elias with "a woman's voice reading poetry, the scratch of needle on vinyl, the smell of his mother's lavender water." This establishes the stake (preserving sensory ghosts) and motivates his caching. The concept reappears when the girl hears the fragments and "tears streaked her cheeks; she knew that voice from a cassette her father played." Sense memory directly alters Elias's and the girl's present emotional state and drives the climax. Present in setup and closure; the middle development is implicit rather than foregrounded in a distinct beat. Causal role is clear but not heavily pressured across multiple turns.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is signaled in the opening line and demonstrated through Elias's three-year mapping, organized caching, and the patient, orderly uncovering ("Methodically, he began to uncover the fragments"). The trait constrains action: his methodical nature shapes his careful, sequenced release of fragments rather than a chaotic reveal. However, the "kindly" component is more label than tested tradeoff—his actions are gentle, but no on-page moment forces a choice between kindness and self-protection or another competing value. The methodical aspect drives tactics; kindly remains asserted rather than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Cache" is introduced in paragraph 6 ("He had been caching these fragments for months") and defines Elias's three-year project. The action shapes setup (hiding fragments in pipe chases), is the subject of reflection mid-story ("cached it deeper than most"), and drives the climax: uncovering the cached fragments is the mechanism of the resolution. The final line of his recorded voice—"We cache them in darkness so others can find their way out"—thematically reprises the action and charges the ending. Removing "cache" as the specific action (substituting "collect" or "store") would lose the connotation of hidden preservation under pressure. High causal involvement and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Uncovering in pipe chases" is signaled early (paragraph 6: "hiding them in pipe chases where steam and time couldn't reach") and the mechanics matter: Elias slides fragments "through knotholes and gaps where steam pipes kissed the underside of the world." The method is used across multiple beats in the climax (lullaby, Lorca, his own voice) and the pipe-chase locations enable the girl's discovery. The method is specific and irreplaceable—floorboards and gaps are the only means for an invisible dweller to transmit sound upward. Present in setup, active across the middle and closure, with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is anchored early and sustained throughout. The setting provides the resources (pipe chases, floorboards, philosophy stacks, biography section) that enable Elias's caching and the girl's discovery. The crawl space beneath the library is the physical constraint that defines Elias's invisibility and tactics. The library's emergency lights and the girl's candle create the visual environment for the final recognition. Spatial choreography is coherent and the setting directly pressures choices: Elias can only act from below; the girl follows voices through the stacks. The setting is indispensable to the story's logic and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" is mentioned in the opening and paragraph 8 as a refrain, and the ending notes "When the lights finally surged bright." The outage creates the emergency-light atmosphere and implies a window of vulnerability or transition, but it does not tighten decisions on the page—no countdown, no threat of discovery when lights return, no tactical constraint. The timeframe is present and atmospheric but does not alter Elias's or the girl's moves. The story would proceed almost identically if set during normal nighttime hours. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to become visible to those who need you" is dramatized: Elias has cached fragments "for her, though he hadn't known her face until this moment," and the climax is his choice to reveal himself by pushing his own recorded voice through the floor. The girl's whispered "I see you" is the fulfillment. The motivation is tested in the decision to uncover (risk of exposure vs. remaining hidden) and carries cost: "would not cache alone anymore" signals the loss of solitary autonomy. Present in setup (implied by caching), developed through the uncovering, and resolved at closure. Some internal friction is implied (three years of invisibility vs. the need for witness) but not heavily dramatized as conflicting impulses in real time.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" appears twice as a descriptor for the emergency lights ("weak sapphire hush across the shelves," "In the sapphire hush") and captures the muted, reverent quality of the library during the outage. Tone is coherent—quiet, lyric, elegiac—and modulates slightly as pressure rises (the girl's tears, Elias's smile). The phrase does not intensify or shift meaning at closure; the final image occurs "When the lights finally surged bright," moving away from the sapphire hush rather than deepening it. The tone is consistent and purposeful but does not charge the final image with additional weight. Present and atmospheric; closure participation is minimal.</comment>
