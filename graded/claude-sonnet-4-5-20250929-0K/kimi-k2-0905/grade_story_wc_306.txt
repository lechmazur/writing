<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's profession is established but her interior contradictions remain largely asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The geologist's final moment shows embodied tension ("stared at the shard's void"), yet the team functions primarily as a collective with minimal individual differentiation. The closure choice feels more thematic declaration than earned struggle; we're told she "never gave before" without prior scene evidence of what she typically does give.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: wind chimes encode doubt, the hollow shard collects grief, dawn light makes particles visible. Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (lighthouse, after campfire, research team). Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration—the researchers stand in "protected vulnerability of not knowing"—but the cost remains atmospheric ("certainty unhooked and flapping") rather than a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift visible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains the overnight vigil and the observation deck stages the wind-chime work. Sensory details are purposeful: salt breeze, fog pressing glass, dawn's pale thread. The hollow mirror shard functions as micro-setting/tool, reappearing to frame the geologist's vision of coral gardens and finally filled with grief at departure, thus charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: absorb moral unease and return it livable. The researchers' certainty "has fissures," the chimes spell out their doubts, and Mira deciphers the brass bell's devastating message. However, the escalation is primarily revelatory rather than forced by protagonist agency—Mira processes information but the geologist's shift happens through witnessing the shard, not through a costly decision Mira makes that narrows her own options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the hollow shard as vessel for unspoken grief, wind chimes as encoded conscience, "protected vulnerability" as the stance that allows honesty. The final image of researchers "learning to stand in the protected vulnerability of not knowing" synthesizes the arc without overt moralizing. Weakness: the phrase "welcome nuance into certainty" echoes prompt language and risks thematic echo, though it's embedded in action rather than standalone declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and a consistent lyric-philosophical register. Diction is dense and metaphor-laden throughout ("conscience-for-hire," "moral radiation," "protective vulnerability"), which fits the allegorical texture but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("sincerely insincere" as visual perception strains credibility). The geologist's brief dialogue carries subtext, and Mira's offer modulates voice under pressure without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high across most sentences: "moral radiation," "coat you've outgrown," "flapping like a loose sail." Mixed-vehicle risk appears in "cloak of doubt...wasn't fabric but atmosphere, a protective vulnerability...felt threadbare," where the garment metaphor blurs. Paraphrase loop: "sincerely insincere" and "mouths forming confident words while their eyes begged" restate the same contradiction within two sentences. Template stem runs in the wind-chime catalog slightly flatten momentum. Information density is strong in setup beats; closure image propels cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The conscience-for-hire premise is fresh and the hollow mirror shard offers a specific symbolic object that evolves through the piece. The emotional territory—professionals needing someone to witness their breaking points—rings true. However, the resolution through "protected vulnerability" and "the larger, more honest world of maybe" leans toward abstraction rather than the harder-edged particulars that would make the transformation indelible. The wind chimes as musical cipher and the shard-as-vessel are inventive details that elevate the frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira (conscience-for-hire) is present throughout and her role frames the entire encounter. She sets up station, deciphers chimes, and offers the geologist a choice she's "never given before." That final offer is a key turn, but the nature of her typical service versus this exception remains asserted rather than dramatized in contrasting beats. Two-gate: setup (opening), payoff (her departure with the shard); middle development is observational.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Hollow mirror shard is unhooked early, held to her eye at dawn to view "sincerely insincere" faces, offered to the geologist so he sees coral gardens, and finally filled with grief as she returns it to the sea. Four distinct beats with evolving meaning; the shard's void-property constrains perception and charges the closure image. High irreplaceability: the hollow/void mechanic is essential to the "reflections dissolve" conceit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Cloak of doubt" appears as metaphor in one paragraph describing Mira's "protective vulnerability," then "certainty is a coat you've outgrown" echoes it in dialogue. The concept informs tone and stakes but isn't handled as a physical object or tactical constraint. Two touches, thematic presence, but swappable phrasing ("armor of certainty") would function similarly. Scores for thematic resonance without on-page causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sincerely insincere" appears once at dawn: "their faces appeared sincerely insincere, mouths forming confident words while their eyes begged for intervention." The attribute encapsulates the researchers' paradox and drives Mira's recognition, enabling her final offer. One beat, strong specificity, but late (past midpoint) and not revisited. Two-gate: development (spurs her decision), payoff (implicit in the ending's honesty). Cap at ~6.0 for single-beat use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unhook" is used twice: Dr. Chen "unhooked" the shard from the bathroom mirror for Mira's visit (setup), and at closure "their certainty unhooked and flapping like a loose sail." The verb frames both the literal tool and the metaphorical release. Two beats, purposeful recurrence that reweights meaning, but the action itself is completed off-page (Chen) or metaphorical (researchers). Lyric reprise with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Wind chimes are described as "encoded with the team's private doubts, a musical cipher she'd spent years learning to read." Mira records each tone, cross-references body language, and deciphers the brass bell's message (one full beat). At closure, she hears "a new arrangement...the raw music of seven humans." Two functional beats: middle work and ending reprise. The mechanics shape her map but don't constrain live choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lighthouse at dawn frames the entire piece: breeze through cracked window (opening), observation deck as workspace, railing confrontation at dawn, and departure as her boat pulls away. The setting supplies the wind for chimes, confines the overnight vigil, and the "lighthouse beam swept across their silence" charges a pivotal moment. Present in setup, middle staging, and closure image; the breezy environment enables the chime method and the dawn timing pressures the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the campfire's last spark dies" and "booked until sunrise" frame the vigil. Dawn arrives on-page ("dawn's first pale thread," "at sunrise"), and the overnight duration gives Mira time to decipher and the researchers time to crack. Two beats: setup contract and closure departure. The timeframe shapes pacing but doesn't tighten tactical choices (no countdown pressure). Functions as scenic boundary more than escalatory clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to welcome nuance into certainty" is the researchers' need (they want moral unease made livable) and becomes Mira's surprising offer: "let the wind have it and stand here naked with the truth." The desire is dramatized in the chime messages and the geologist's gaze into the void. However, the phrase "welcomed them into the larger, more honest world of maybe" in the final paragraph risks prompt echo. Two beats with friction between service and honesty, moderate cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is named explicitly as "the cloak...a protective vulnerability that allowed her to absorb their moral radiation" and returns in her offer: "the protected vulnerability in her voice creating space." At closure, the researchers learn "to stand in the protected vulnerability of not knowing." The tone coheres across beats, modulates from Mira's professional armor to the researchers' raw stance, and charges the final image. Three beats, clear tonal arc, strong thematic integration.</comment>
