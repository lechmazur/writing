<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation—restoring faith through rebuilding—is signaled early and drives her actions (kneeling at the skull, setting the sundial, teaching the hymn). However, interiority remains largely opaque; we see her act but rarely glimpse contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The caretaker boy is functional but his arc (from suspicious to laughing participant) lacks texture. The final choice to stay feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost that forecloses a competing path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the opening paragraphs, creating mild drift before anchoring (~−0.3). The piece reads under an Accumulative lens: pressure builds through discovered objects (mirrors, reliquary, root-road) and ritual acts that reweight the stake. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she never leaves, the faith is rebuilt, the island becomes her endpoint—but the cost is conceptual (exile from broader diaspora life) rather than viscerally dramatized on the page. The final image recharges the sundial motif, yet the before/after legibility depends on summary ("never left") rather than a decisive on-page choice or forfeiture in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vivid and specific: fossilized petals, roots threading through bones, myrrh-scented air, ceiling cracks. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the protagonist's quest. The sundial base and mirrors function as charged objects that constrain her actions (aligning on vertebrae, lifting the reliquary lid). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from tomb to eastern ridge compresses geography without cost. The setting directly enables the climactic reconstruction and charges the final image of the chapel floor, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring faith by rebuilding the prayer house—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through discovery (mirrors, root-road) and ritual (sundial placement, hymn-teaching), but escalation is gradual rather than tightening through forced choices. The climax (gnomon plants, walls reassemble) is magical rather than agentive; the protagonist waits rather than decides under competing costs. One meaningful deepening occurs when the roots move and she follows, yet the final act lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path—convenience (dawn, magic, travelers) resolves the problem without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—faith as a circuit requiring returned blood and shadows to follow—emerges organically from the orchard's bone-and-root logic and the protagonist's ritual acts. The mirrors fracturing her reflection into twelve generations is a strong particular that reweights interrupted journeys. The final image (sundial cemented, planet's spin confirming time and faith can rebuild) offers resonant closure without overt moralizing. However, the ending tilts toward summary wisdom ("every interrupted journey can resume") rather than letting the image stand alone, and the phrase "warmly curious smile" in the penultimate paragraph echoes prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through the protagonist's perceptions and memories. Diction is elevated and lyric ("myrrh-scented air," "cautious enchantment thick as honey"), matching the piece's tone. The caretaker boy's single line of dialogue ("Are you here to rebuild or to rob?") feels purposeful and establishes stakes. However, several phrases read as constructed rather than lived-in: "warmly curious fingers," "warmly curious smile" (template repetition), "purposeful wandering" (adverbial abstraction). Psychic distance remains consistent, but the voice occasionally slips into exposition ("proving time had not forgotten") rather than trusting image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is dense and imagistic, with strong specific detail (canvas satchel, oxidized copper eyes, brass mirrors). Sentence rhythm varies, though severalonstructions repeat: "she + verb" openings across multiple paragraphs create mild template cadence. The phrase "warmly curious" appears twice (roots' fingers, her smile), a synonym loop that dulls specificity (−0.3). "Across excavating a tomb" is syntactically unclear—does she spend days while excavating, or moving across the site? The penultimate paragraph ("when the season turned, travelers began") summarizes rather than dramatizing the rebuilding's completion, flattening momentum. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but cumulative texture issues prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of diaspora return, catacomb orchard, living bone-root architecture, and sundial-as-gnomon is specific and memorable. The image of a rib as gnomon charging the reconstruction is fresh and earned. However, the core arc—exile returns to restore ancestral site through ritual—follows a recognizable template, and the magical resolution (wood remembers, bones rattle approval, colors with no names) relies on enchantment rather than character-driven cost. The piece transforms its tropes through sensory particulars and the orchard's layered logic, lifting it above derivative, but bold structural or perspectival risk is absent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; her choices (kneeling, mapping, uncovering mirrors, planting gnomon, teaching hymn) drive all major beats and the closure unit. Early signal, multiple beats, closure participation all met. The diaspora identity shapes motive and the decision to stay. Cost is conceptual (permanent exile from broader world) rather than a dramatized trade-off on the page, limiting higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sundial base appears in paragraph 1 (grandmother's gift), paragraph 4 (pulse against ribs), paragraph 8 (aligned on vertebrae daily), paragraph 14 (carried to ridge), paragraph 15 (planted with rib-gnomon), and final paragraph (cemented in chapel floor). Used across at least five distinct beats, drives the climactic reconstruction, charges the final image. Early signal, causal pressure (enables ritual and magic), closure linkage all strong. Specificity high—no generic talisman could replace it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys frame the opening (scholarships, marriages, exiles tugged back), reappear when mirrors show twelve departed generations paused between departure and arrival, and close with "every interrupted journey can resume." Concept shapes the protagonist's motive and the ancestors' suspended state. However, tactical pressure is diffuse—interruption as theme rather than a constraint that narrows on-page options. The penultimate paragraph's summary invocation ("every interrupted journey") reads as thematic claim rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" appears twice: as label for roots' fingers (paragraph 2) and her smile (paragraph 18). No on-page action dramatizes this trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. The attribute is ornamental—a mood descriptor—rather than a character engine. Late reprise does not reweight meaning; both uses are adjectival decoration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the protagonist's articulated goal from the caretaker's question (paragraph 5) and her answer by action (kneeling, mapping). The climax (paragraph 15) is the literal rebuilding via gnomon and dawn. The action drives excavation, hymn-teaching, traveler-greeting, and the final state (chapel floor, sundial cemented). Early signal, sustained across beats, closure participation strong. Causal pressure high—every turn orbits this verb. Swappability low; "restore" or "repair" would shift tone and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is named in paragraph 7 as her method during excavation days. The phrase returns implicitly in the final paragraph ("she walked the root-lined paths"). However, mechanics are vague—wandering functions as thematic mood rather than a constraint (e.g., no map, no plan, trial-and-error cost). The method does not shape a middle choice or narrow options; it describes tempo rather than tactic. Lyric reprise (first/final thirds) earns mid-band eligibility, but lack of causal pressure or cost caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is established in paragraph 2 and remains the sole location. Roots, bones, fossilized petals, ceiling cracks, and myrrh air are handled across multiple beats. The setting enables key discoveries (reliquary, root-road) and the climactic ritual. Spatial elements (vertebrae for sundial, tomb as workspace, eastern ridge clearing) alter tactics and charge the final image (chapel floor). Early signal, sustained pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability all strong. The orchard's logic (bone-root circuit) is unique and could not be swapped for generic sacred ground.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Across excavating a tomb" (paragraph 7) signals a multi-day span; "each noon" and "on the fourth dusk" mark progression. The timeframe structures the middle (days of mapping and alignment) and converges at dawn for the climax. However, the clock is loose—no urgency, no tightening deadline. Time organizes beats but does not pressure choices or raise cost. The setting's timelessness (ancestors paused, "time had not forgotten") works thematically but undercuts escalation via temporal constraint. Two gates (setup, closure participation) met; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to restore lost faith is voiced implicitly through her return, kneeling, hymn-whispering, and explicitly in paragraph 11 ("every ancestor... waiting for someone to rebuild the circuit of belief"). It drives excavation, ritual, hymn-teaching, and the ending state ("faith return... filling the spaces her exile had hollowed"). Early signal, sustained across beats, closure participation strong. However, internal friction is thin—no competing desire or cost dramatized on the page. The motivation is declared and pursued without contradiction, limiting deeper bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment thick as honey" (paragraph 10) names the tone explicitly, and the prose sustains it: myrrh air, roots that move, wood that remembers, bones rattling approval. Tone modulates from grief-tinged opening (burned prayer houses, fractured skull) through wonder (mirrors, blossoms with no names) to quiet triumph (bell tower ringing, steady breath). The final image (planet's slow spin, touching sundial) maintains the enchanted register without breaking into sentiment or irony. Coherence across turns is strong, and tone charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for Q10.</comment>
