<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Scraps shows embodied agency in her intuitive tracking and the decisive bark that prompts Kite's action, but much interiority is metaphorically filtered ("the intuitive descriptive tug") rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Kite's brother remains off-page, leaving the relationship crucible underdeveloped. The final renunciation—Scraps setting the leaf on the threshold—reads as earned by prior tracking yet lacks visible internal cost or contradiction in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture building toward a situational closure), which holds through the ending. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise): Scraps retires fully, the leaf is set down, and "closeness had always been the only distance worth traveling" reweights the quest with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph (Scraps, Half-mast, post-war) without penalty. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cylinder reveals coordinates, narrowing the search and forcing the journey; the brother's rescue completes the reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scrapyard and wasteland constrain movement (buried subway car, desert mallow tanks) and supply scent-map resources that alter tactics. Micro-setting (the wax leaf, the corrugated archive hut) charges the closure image when the leaf softens on the threshold. Sensory hierarchy is strong—copper, ozone, lithium—filtered through Scraps's nose, and the "wild hush" acoustic detail recurs with purpose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the brother, translate distance into closeness) is signaled early and tightens when the cylinder riddle forces Scraps and Kite to decode coordinates. One meaningful reversal: the leaf itself solves the riddle, enabling the journey. The brother's rescue carries conceptual cost (the leaf must be relinquished at closure) but the escalation relies on off-page scent-map pressure rather than on-page choices that narrow live options during the journey itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (separation as a groove waiting to be read; closeness as the only distance worth traveling) emerges through particulars—scent, wax, grooves—without thesis statements. The final image (leaf softening, wind smelling of orchard smoke) offers a non-literal, resonant answer. "Tinted revelations" recurs with reweighted meaning but risks symbolic convenience; the phonograph riddle and leaf function more as motifs than as moral crucibles with plausible counter-readings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited through Scraps, with strong perceptual signature (scent-driven syntax, "copper glow," "ghost of a voice"). Diction is lyric and consistent—"wild hush," "tinted revelations"—but edges into elevated register ("intuitive descriptive tug," "courier teaching distance how to kneel") that risks outpacing the bloodhound's plausible interiority. Kite's dialogue is minimal; when present it is goal-driven and carries subtext without false therapy-speak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("distance you crave to collapse," "spilled blood that had decided to become a sunrise," "teaching distance how to kneel"), creating lyric texture but occasionally stacking metaphors in adjacent lines without clear escalation (final two paragraphs). Template cadence appears in the opening's list-structures and some mid-story "they X, Scraps Y" stems. Information density is strong; most lines advance image or pressure. No major loops, but elevated diction in peak beats ("courier teaching distance how to kneel") drifts from the embodied POV established earlier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-war scrapyard, bloodhound tracker, wax-leaf riddle, and phonograph-groove coordinates is specific and non-obvious. The concept of scent as language ("translating distance into closeness") is fresh and consistent. Risk: lyric compression and sensory metaphor throughout heighten stakes without obscuring causality. The riddle mechanism and brother-rescue frame remain familiar template shapes but are personalized through the scent-map particulars and the leaf's charged return.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Scraps is present throughout, drives the scent-tracking in multiple beats (cylinder, wasteland journey, subway car), and her bark prompts Kite's decisive leaf-kiss action. Setup early (paragraph 1), development (archive scene, journey), and payoff (final threshold gesture). However, much of her agency is intuitive/descriptive rather than choice-under-pressure; the "retired from finding bodies" frame is more thematic echo than causal constraint that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wax leaf appears early (paragraph 3), is handled in the archive riddle-solve (Kite presses it to the cylinder), reappears in the journey (hanging from Kite's neck), and charges the closure (softening on the threshold, wind shifts to orchard smoke). Three distinct beats, strong closure linkage, specific irreplaceability (wax preserves fire/orchard memory, solves riddle). Cost is conceptual—relinquishment at threshold—but the element's causal work is clear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" recurs as a phrase (paragraphs 4, 15, 19, 28) and the wax leaf's translucent glow functions as the concept's physical expression, enabling the riddle-solve and final image. Setup early, development in archive scene, payoff in threshold moment. However, the concept mainly operates as thematic resonance rather than directly shaping on-page tactical choices or narrowing options; it charges the closure image but does not itself constrain Scraps's or Kite's decisions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is named twice (paragraphs 9, 15) as a trait Scraps possesses, enabling her to "translate scent into syntax" and see the riddle's answer. Setup in first third, used in archive riddle-solve. However, it functions more as a label for her tracking ability than as a trait with visible trade-off or cost; no on-page moment shows her intuition foreclosing another path or imposing a price. Swappable with "keen nose" or "tracker instinct" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The riddle appears in the archive scene (paragraph 13), prompts the leaf-press solution, and echoes in the brother's first words at rescue (paragraph 25). Two distinct beats, clear causal pressure: decoding the riddle enables the journey and rescue. However, the riddle mechanism is presented as solvable via Scraps's intuition without dramatized trial-and-error, reducing the felt cost of solving it. The brother's echo reweights it thematically but does not create a new turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The phonograph cylinder is introduced early (paragraph 6), its grooves are "read" in the archive scene via scent-translation (paragraph 15), and the needle-skip carves coordinates that enable the rescue journey. Setup, development, and payoff present. However, the mechanics are asserted ("each pop of static smelled of ozone") rather than shown through trial or cost; the method solves a problem it only just introduced (cylinder appears, is immediately decoded). Specificity is high but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Half-mast scrapyard is anchored early (paragraph 3), supplies the archive hut and phonograph resources (middle), and the threshold gate frames the closure image (final paragraph). The wasteland's cracked terrain and scent-markers (iron oxide, lithium, water) constrain and guide the journey. Micro-setting (buried subway car) delivers the brother. Environment shapes tactics and charges the ending, though much of the journey occurs in summary rather than on-page spatial problem-solving.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the last resource war" anchors the timeframe early and the "five seasons ago" marker situates Scraps's history. The wasteland's post-war state (rusted drones, glass soil) pressures scarcity and scavenging context. However, time does not create a ticking clock or tighten decisions during the journey; the rescue unfolds without temporal urgency. The timeframe is consistent and colors atmosphere but does not narrow options or escalate cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To translate distance into closeness" is named early (paragraph 2) and recurs in the final image ("closeness had always been the only distance worth traveling"). The motivation drives Scraps's tracking and the brother-rescue quest. Setup, development (cylinder coordinates narrow the distance), and payoff present. However, the desire is more thematic statement than dramatized internal conflict; no on-page moment shows Scraps torn between closeness and another want, reducing the felt friction and cost of pursuing it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Wild hush" appears four times (paragraphs 2, 11, 23, 26), evoking post-artillery quiet and charged silence. Tone is coherent through turns and modulates subtly (embers, ozone, footfall echoes). The phrase charges the final image ("wind learning how to be quiet again"). Setup early, reprise at closure. However, the tone is more atmospheric texture than a pressure that constrains choices; it colors rather than alters tactics, placing it in the functional-resonant band rather than indispensable.</comment>
