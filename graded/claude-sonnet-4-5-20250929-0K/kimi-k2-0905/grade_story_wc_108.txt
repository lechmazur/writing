<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo's phobia-driven interiority is consistent and embodied throughout ("my knees already knocking," "pulse steadied"), and his final choice to display his vulnerability is earned by the shell's whisper. However, the backstory occupies roughly 30% of the text and competes with present-scene choices; the opening three paragraphs summarize motivation rather than dramatizing it in the library confrontation. The child character appears functional but thin, and the transformation from paralyzed to decisive feels compressed in the final act without intermediate micro-choices showing the shift. Emotion is mostly embodied, yet the climactic turn—placing the shell on the projector—lacks sufficient interior contradiction or hesitation to match Leo's established terror.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the piece follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (DNA test → hunt for shell → decrypt notes → find shell → outwit guards). Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change: Leo commits to leaking the uncut reel, forecloses his old brand identity, and walks toward the final stunt with visible cost (he remains trembling but now owns it). The cost is legible in "heart still quaking but stride firmly adaptive" and the choice to weaponize his vulnerability. One slip: the convenience of the projector and perforated roof appearing exactly when needed borders on situational luck rather than protagonist-driven escalation, slightly undercutting the causal rigor at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is vivid and purposeful: iron shelves, skylight clogged with constellations, drainage alcove with film cans stacked like vertebrae. Micro-setting detail (the projector's feed reel, perforated roof) directly enables the climactic outwitting. Sensory hierarchy reflects Leo's profession (industry speak, stunt-beat counting, "camera-smoke"). The child's cast functions as a constrained object that supplies the decryption clue. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves, and the setting's decay mirrors the tyrant's obsolescence and Leo's fear of being "retired."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving he is more than expendable muscle before the heirs retire his brand—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates causally: DNA test → hunt → decrypt → find → confront guards → outwit. The shell's whisper ("keep the trembling take") provides the key tightening that transforms Leo's tactic from flight to confrontation, narrowing his options and forcing a trade-off (safety vs. self-exposure). One meaningful reversal: Leo's phobia flares when the guards arrive, yet he acts against instinct, placing the shell on the projector instead of running. The cost is visible in his "heart still quaking" and the decision to leak the reel, which forecloses his old identity. Minor caveat: the guards' hesitation while watching the footage feels slightly convenient, reducing the antagonistic pressure at the peak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability as power source rather than weakness—emerges organically from Leo's struggle and the shell's whisper without meta-commentary. The uncut reel motif recurs with reweighted meaning: first a shameful secret, finally proof of survival. The ending offers a resonant answer: "being who I thought I wasn't is exactly who I need to be" is told but earned by the prior action. The shell keeps whispering "but now its voice was mine" crystallizes the transfer of authority from birth-mother to self without moralizing. One slip: "Vulnerability isn't armor; it's the power source" in the penultimate paragraph leans toward thematic statement rather than pure image, edging into explicit articulation where implication would be stronger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person throughout with no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture: industry idiom ("call for places," "color-grade," "betray the frame"), stunt-beat counting, and a rhythm that modulates with stress (short clauses during the decrypt, longer reflection in the denouement). The child's dialogue ("Only to people who listen scared") reads slightly arch for naturalistic speech but fits the fable-like atmosphere. Filter verbs ("I recognized," "I lifted") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Perceptual signature is consistent: Leo notices gels, autographs, projector mechanics. One weakness: diction occasionally elevates beyond Leo's panic in peak moments—"palimpsest," "transformative betrayal," "Charged Poise" feel imported rather than character-bound—creating minor register drift under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or stakes. Opening and closing images are strong. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. However, figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching: "camera-smoke," "iron stacks," "stars spilled like unpaid extras," "dawn bruised the horizon," "rust into galaxies" crowd nearly every paragraph, creating minor overwriting that competes for attention. Mixed metaphor: film cans "stacked like vertebrae" then "the library's metallic creaks folded into a hush" blurs the anatomical image with acoustic softness. Template cadence appears in paired participial openers: "Kneeling, I gently rotated…" / "Hands shaking, I pried…" Signal of craft debt that does not obscure causality but reduces line-level tightness. Deduct −0.6 for density and coherence slips; no artifact touches closure directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—phobia-ridden stunt double discovers he is the tyrant director's son and hunts proof of his worth—synthesizes familiar orphan-reveal and industry-exploitation tropes with specific detail (cast decryption, projector outwitting). The child-as-cipher and the whispering shell edge toward stock magical-helper motifs without full transformation. Emotional specificity (fear embodied as "knees knocking," the trembling take) elevates above generic templates. The turn—weaponizing vulnerability by projecting raw footage—is fresh within the stunt-double frame. However, the core emotional arc (outcast discovers hidden lineage and claims identity) closely matches widely used templates; the industry setting and specific mechanics provide texture but do not radically reweight the arc. Risk-taking in voice and compression is present but does not fully offset derivative scaffolding. Within-band adjustment: +0.2 for the outwitting tactic's specificity, but no further lift due to template proximity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Leo is present throughout; his phobia drives the opening paralysis, middle decrypt choice (kneeling despite fear), and climactic decision to stay and project the footage instead of running. Three distinct beats involve his trait: entering the library ("knees already knocking"), kneeling to read the cast (pulse steadies briefly), and facing the guards ("phobia flared, but… I didn't run"). The final stride "firmly adaptive" shows the trait in transformation. Cost is visible: his trembling persists even as he acts. Early signal, beat involvement across all three acts, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. Swappability is low; removing the phobia would collapse the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shell is mentioned in the opening ("the whispering seashell half my birth-mother pressed to her ear"), found mid-story in the alcove, lifted to Leo's ear (it speaks the pivotal line), placed on the projector reel at the climax, and referenced in the final paragraph ("The shell kept whispering, but now its voice was mine"). Five distinct touches across setup, find, climactic use, and thematic closure. Causal pressure: the shell's whisper changes Leo's tactic from flight to confrontation. Closure linkage strong. Specificity high: "scalloped half-shell… pink lip fractured" and the act of placing it on a projector are irreplaceable. Cost connection: the shell's message requires Leo to expose his vulnerability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal is invoked explicitly ("transformative betrayal was the core concept I'd been living") and shapes the backstory (switched at birth, the tyrant "edited her out"). It appears in the notes' fragment "betray the frame" (industry instruction to subvert the lie). Leo's final act—leaking the uncut reel—betrays the family brand's heroic image and transforms his identity. The concept constrains the ending choice with felt cost (he forecloses his old brand). However, much of the work is thematic echo rather than on-page tactical pressure; the betrayal is more premise than live obstacle. Two gates: setup (mentioned early) and payoff (shapes ending choice); middle development is thin. Causal role modest; resonance clearer in theme than in beat-by-beat pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" is embodied in the final beat: "stride firmly adaptive" after the outwitting, and the decision to leak the reel (adapting his tactic from hiding vulnerability to weaponizing it). The trait is label-only until the ending, where it becomes visible action. Setup is late (final third); middle development absent. Closure participation strong: the adaptation is the engine of the final choice. Cost: he must continue trembling publicly. One beat (the ending stride and leak decision). Swappability moderate; "resilient" or "flexible" could substitute with minor edits. Late arrival and thin beat involvement cap the score, but closure linkage and cost connection lift it within band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Outwit" is the climactic action: Leo places the shell on the projector and uses the perforated roof to display his raw footage, distracting the guards while he escapes. The action is signaled early ("outwit them by keeping the take where your knees shake") and executed at the peak turn. It drives the major reversal (guards hesitate, Leo slips past). Causal pressure high: the outwitting changes options from capture to escape. Closure linkage strong: the act enables the final stride and leak decision. Specificity solid: the mechanics (projector, perforated roof, uncut reel) are particular. One friction: the convenience of finding a working projector and perfect lighting conditions leans toward luck, slightly reducing irreplaceability. Two beats (shell's instruction, climactic execution).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Decryption is signaled early ("decrypting smudged notes on a child's cast had once saved a shoot"), executed mid-story when Leo kneels and rotates the girl's cast under starlight, and yields the key clue ("Shell… west annex… row nine… betray the frame"). The method shapes one major beat (finding the shell's location). Mechanics matter: rotating the cast, tracing letters with a gloved fingertip, reading indented block letters under light. Causal role clear: without the decrypt, no shell. However, the method does not appear again after the clue is obtained; it does not shape the climax or ending. Two gates (setup, middle development); closure participation absent. Swappability moderate: any cipher could substitute (torn map, coded letter). One key beat involvement, early signal, but no closure linkage caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is present throughout: groaning iron shelves, skylight with constellations, drainage alcove, perforated roof. It supplies key resources (the girl, the decrypt clue, the shell, the projector) and constrains movement (Leo creeps between stacks, hides behind guards). Micro-setting elements (the projector, the perforated roof) enable the climactic outwitting. Three beats: entry and fear, decrypt scene, climactic projection. Closure linkage strong: the perforated roof becomes the projection screen that charges the final image. Specificity high: "iron shelves listing," "film cases stacked like vertebrae," "skylight clogged with constellations." Cost connection: the decayed setting mirrors Leo's fear of obsolescence. Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure participation all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe "after discovering you're not who you thought" is signaled in the opening ("Three nights ago a DNA test slid across my trailer's Formica table") and the urgency is clear ("tomorrow the tyrant's legitimate heirs would announce… the family brand… was being retired"). The clock tightens Leo's need to find proof before the announcement. However, once inside the library, time becomes vague; no sense of hours passing or dawn approaching until the final paragraph ("Outside, dawn bruised the horizon"). The timeframe shapes the premise and ending choice (Leo walks toward the studio "ready for the final stunt" and will leak the reel "tomorrow"), but mid-scene it does not actively pressure tactics. Two gates: setup and payoff; middle development thin. Causal role moderate; the ticking clock is premise-level rather than beat-by-beat constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation to prove vulnerability is power is stated in the opening ("I needed that sentence, needed it like a new spine"), dramatized when the shell whispers "keep the take where your knees shake," and enacted in the climax (Leo projects the raw footage and walks out trembling). Three beats: hunt for proof, receive shell's message, execute the outwitting and commit to leaking the reel. Friction between want (safety, hiding fear) and cost (public exposure) is clear and on-page. The final choice—"letting the world watch a coward leap and land alive"—forecloses his old brand identity with visible cost. Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection all present. Minor weakness: the motivation is occasionally told ("Vulnerability isn't armor; it's the power source") rather than purely shown, edging toward thematic statement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Trembling certainty is embodied throughout: "flashlight trembling," "hands shaking," "my phobia flared," yet Leo acts with resolve ("I didn't run," "stride firmly adaptive"). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: short, staccato clauses during the decrypt ("three… two… one—"), longer reflection in the denouement, and a return to trembling certainty in the final image ("guiding every trembling certainty toward lights"). The oxymoron charges the closure: Leo's knees still shake, but his stride is firm. Diction and rhythm support the tone across all beats. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage strong. Specificity high: the tone is irreplaceable and defines Leo's voice. Cost connection: the trembling is the vulnerability he chooses to weaponize.</comment>
