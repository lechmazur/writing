<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices drive the narrative (documenting, following, writing backward), but her interiority is often announced rather than embodied. The patch's presence against her heart and the closing her eyes of T. Holm show contradiction (compassion vs. mission), yet her voice leans toward oracular certainty ("already surveying the next place") without micro-hesitation under stress. The final choice to walk backward is striking but lands as symbolic rather than conflicted, and the "hazy precision of someone describing a dream while still inside it" declares the state without textured perception to prove it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening paragraph (Mara Quell, port, post-silence), satisfying orientation. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: vectors converge, patterns intensify, the plaza reveals a charged center, and the final image (walking backward, printing reverse silhouettes) reweights Mara's surveying into prophetic calibration. However, the closure—writing backward, patch dissolving, spiral emerging—feels more asserted than causally earned; the reader receives the transformation via description ("containers shifted, corridors realigning") rather than witnessing a decisive on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The conceptual repricing is present (survey as rehearsal of future fractures), but the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "canyon of steel," "ribbon of powdered paint," "hexagonal plaza," fused glass circle. Sensory filtering reflects Mara's professional attention (vectors, wind speed, fatigue fractures), and the environment actively constrains her path (dead-ends, leaning stacks). The glass hums, the patch twitches on its surface, and the spiral realignment at closure transforms spatial access—setting charges the final image. Minor register drift (e.g., "fossilized lung exhaling") occasionally pulls away from Mara's technical voice, but the port remains a functional actor throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why the port went silent to prevent future catastrophes—is signaled early and coheres. Mara's survey tightens spatially (vectors converge), and the plaza discovery intensifies the mystery. Yet the escalation is more accretive than agonistic: she adapts rapidly without friction, encounters no on-page obstacle that forces a costly tradeoff, and the final act (writing backward, containers realigning) happens to her as much as through her agency. The "reversing every arrow" beat gestures at reversal but is told as summary; the cost (dissolving patch, printed warnings) is symbolic rather than a visible forfeiture that alters her stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme—foresight as listening to time's rehearsal—emerges organically from the fused glass, the predictive echo, and the final reversal imagery. The closing line ("already surveying the next place that would need to hear itself before it screamed") reweights Mara's mission as iterative prophecy without overt moralizing. However, the patch's dissolution into "blue fiber" and the containers' self-reorganization lean on overt symbolic convenience rather than concrete particulars, and "cultivate foresight in action" echoes prompt language verbatim in paragraph 4, though it's framed as Mara's internalized purpose rather than thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's POV is stable, and the prose carries a distinct texture: clipped technical notes alternating with lyric image ("jellyfish halos," "dark pupil"). Perceptual signature is strong in the forensic filtering (wind vectors, fatigue fractures), and the voice modulates purposefully from flat recorder dictation to dreamlike compression at the plaza. However, phrases like "hazy precision of someone describing a dream while still inside it" tell the voice quality rather than enact it, and occasional elevated diction ("palimpsest of tomorrow's headlines") drifts from the established technical register. Free indirect thought and narrative distance remain clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, with strong sentence variation and purposeful compression. Line-level clarity is mostly high, though several beats lean on decorative metaphor clusters: "fossilized lung," "wind instrument she had to learn by ear," "borrowed time," "jellyfish halos"—each individually fine, but their density in sequential paragraphs creates textural weight without always advancing causality. The opening and closing lines anchor well. Minor scaffold appears in "she understood then" and "she carried its forecast in her mouth like a secret flavor," which assert rather than dramatize the shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—accident investigator decoding a time-inverted disaster site—offers a fresh angle on forensic investigation, and the fused glass, predictive echo, and backward-writing beats are specific and memorable. The port as "fossilized lung" and the patch as twitching witness synthesize vivid images with the foresight concept. However, the core emotional arc (surveyor becomes oracle) follows a familiar template of lone investigator gaining supernatural insight, and the final reversal (writing backward to preempt future breaks) gestures at consequence without fully dramatizing the cost or resistance that would make the transformation feel harder-won.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's investigator role drives every beat: she surveys, documents, follows vectors, interprets the plaza, and writes backward to guide responders. Her choices (kneeling to close T. Holm's eyes, stepping onto the glass, opening a fresh page) shape the arc and closure. The role is signaled in the opening line and active through the final paragraph, with visible cost (patch dissolution, reverse-printed warnings).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The patch appears in paragraph 5 ("torn from a uniform"), recurs in paragraph 16 ("felt the patch pulse against her heart"), is placed on the glass in paragraph 20, twitches and lifts in paragraph 21–24, and dissolves in paragraph 26. Its presence charges the closure (pinning the empty square, marker note), yet the physical object's mechanics (why it twitches, why it dissolves) remain symbolic rather than causal. Strong multi-beat presence and closure linkage, but swappability (any keepsake could serve) and lack of irreplaceable properties hold it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The concept is signaled in the opening stanza ("to learn how tomorrow breaks"), demonstrated on the page (vectors arrowing to a single point, hexagonal plaza convergence), and operationalized at closure (writing backward, containers realigning into a spiral). The fused glass and predictive echo embody the singularity physically. Causally essential: without convergence, Mara's survey remains ordinary forensics. High specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The trait appears in the opening ("cultivate foresight in action"), in paragraph 11 ("treating the maze as a wind instrument... by ear"), and in the final paragraph ("rapidly adapting her stride so that each step arrived just after the ground decided to hold"). It constrains tactics (path shifts when stacks lean, corridors dead-end) and charges the closure image. However, most adaptation is told in summary rather than dramatized with visible tradeoff, and the trait could be replaced with "cautious" or "methodical" without breaking the plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The survey structures the entire narrative: begins at the first canyon (paragraph 7), proceeds through documentation (paragraphs 12–13), reaches the convergence plaza (paragraph 17), culminates in reversed surveying (paragraph 27), and concludes with Mara "already surveying the next place" (final line). Every major turn (finding T. Holm, stepping onto glass, writing backward, walking the spiral) is survey action. Removal would collapse the story. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph 7 ("documenting wind patterns between buildings"), the method is demonstrated on-page (paragraph 8: "every gust left a signature," paragraph 9: arrows converging), enables the key discovery (paragraph 17: "Her vectors arrowed to this spot"), and is reversed at closure (paragraph 27: "feeding the maze her intentions so the wind could correct them"). The method is irreplaceable—without wind-pattern documentation, the convergence discovery and reversal tactic are unmotivated. High causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is present from the gate (paragraph 1), structures Mara's path (paragraph 11: "treating the maze as a wind instrument"), supplies the convergence plaza (paragraph 17), and realigns at closure (paragraph 28: "containers shifted, corridors realigning into a spiral"). The setting constrains choices (dead-ends, leaning stacks) and provides the physical substrate for the time-inversion effect (fused glass, blackened containers). Removal would eliminate both the investigative challenge and the closure mechanism. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is anchored early ("forty-eight hours earlier," "two kilometers inland," "the night before") and shapes the stakes (preventing the next silence). However, the clock does not tighten on-page—Mara moves "rapidly" but faces no time pressure that forces a costly tradeoff. The phrase "after the town goes silent" is only implicit; "the port had been a living organ only forty-eight hours earlier" (paragraph 10) establishes aftermath, but the silence itself is not dramatized as constraint. Present and thematically relevant, but replaceable with "recent disaster" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in paragraph 4 ("to cultivate foresight in action, to learn how tomorrow breaks so she can keep the next city from going silent") and operationalized at closure (writing backward, printing reverse silhouettes, "already surveying the next place"). However, it is largely told rather than tested: Mara encounters no friction or doubt that would force her to weigh the cost of this mission against competing desires. The final line reaffirms the want without visible sacrifice. Functional but not dramatized with conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tone—"hazy precision"—is signaled in paragraph 12 ("the hazy precision of someone describing a dream while still inside it"), sustained through lyric compression alternating with technical diction, and charges the closure image (fused glass hum, dissolved patch, "world sharp and inevitable"). The interplay of forensic flatness ("Container B-14-07, door sheared outward") and dreamlike imagery ("halos that drifted like jellyfish") enacts the tonal duality. Modulates purposefully with pressure: calm surveying yields to sub-audible hum and predictive echo. Coherent, specific, and integral to the final effect.</comment>
