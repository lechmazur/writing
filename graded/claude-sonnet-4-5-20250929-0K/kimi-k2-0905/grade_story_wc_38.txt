<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—encrypting vulnerability as strength—is signaled early and shapes her final act of swallowing the page, a micro-choice with visible cost. However, her interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("lyrical code breaker," "water itself were her metronome") rather than concrete contradiction or embodied emotion under pressure. The scientists' backstory is substantial but remains anchored to present stakes via the dice and the dance cipher. Internal conflict is present but oblique; we see determination more than genuine struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (sunken lab), and the timeframe (spider's web) by the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat—dice roll, current surrender, archive discovery, page-swallowing—densifies the encryption motif and culminates in a Conceptual Repricing when Mara surfaces and the code spreads as song, reweighting vulnerability → strength with conceptual cost (she carries it bodily, no regime can confiscate). One minor causality slip: the emergency buoy trigger and lab's air release feel convenient rather than motivated by prior choice. The closure lands on the page with felt cost (ingestion, bodily risk) and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken lab, spider, and dice constrain Mara's choices concretely: the web sets the clock, the dice direct her to the vortex, the spherical archive's pressure valve creates the dry chamber. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("ghost-thrum of old power," "bioluminescent ink that pulsed slower than breath"), filtered through Mara's dancer's perception. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the service-shaft descent and spherical archive's exact layout remain slightly abstract. The setting charges the final image: Mara rises with the bubble, the lab releases its air, and the moonlit surface becomes the stage for her encoded lullaby.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding and liberating the encrypted seed before the spider finishes—is signaled early and tightens once: the dice roll forces the arabesque into the vortex, opening the archive. Mara's swallowing of the page is a high-agency renunciation (no external copy, bodily risk) with visible cost. The scientists' choice to flood the lab rather than allow weaponization adds a secondary ethical layer. However, the escalation is mostly linear accretion rather than a reversal that narrows options; the buoy trigger and air release feel more like a scheduled exit than a forced trade-off. The cost is legible on the page (ingestion, surfacing vulnerability) and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability encrypted as strength, refusal of weaponization, embodied knowledge—emerges through concrete particulars: the dance cipher, the page-swallowing, the scientists' flooding choice, and the lullaby that spreads across water. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: the child on the boat begins to move, sketching "the first letter of a safer alphabet," reweighting the encrypted seed as generative rather than extractive. Subtext operates in gesture (arabesque, spiral) and the scientists' last diagram. The piece avoids explicit thesis statements. One hairline slip: "calm defiance" is named twice in narration rather than left fully implicit, nudging toward label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (dancer's idiom: "pirouette of numbers," "ankles wrote cursive warnings") and voice is lyrical throughout. However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure beats ("lyrical code breaker," "heartbeat trying to remember its rhythm"), creating register consistency but reducing immediacy under stress. The line "voice braided with bubbles" and "calf muscles spelling out the master key" border on overwrought metaphor that obscures literal action. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance is controlled, though the metaphorical density sometimes abstracts Mara's concrete perception. The voice is distinct but risks becoming a sustained poetic performance rather than modulating with urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often striking ("ghost-thrum," "jellyfish journals," "data seed germinate inside her chest") but appears in nearly every sentence, flattening rhythm and reducing clarity in peak beats. The phrase "ankles wrote cursive warnings as she glided, calf muscles spelling out the last fragment" is a mixed metaphor that strains physical logic. Template cadence is minimal, but synonym churn and poetic restatement ("pirouette of numbers," "choreography," "dance the encryption") loop the core conceit without advancing pressure. The opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high, but the relentless lyricism obscures action choreography (e.g., how the vortex waltz mechanically transports her). No major loops or scaffold, but cumulative overwriting dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—code as dance, vulnerability as encrypted strength, bodily ingestion of data—is specific and non-obvious. The sunken lab, spider-web timer, and hangman's dice combine organically. The scientists' choice to flood rather than allow weaponization adds moral weight. However, the "encrypt human weakness as strength" premise echoes familiar cyberpunk and resistance narratives without fully transforming them through lived detail or an unexpected moral calculus. The child's spontaneous movement at the end is evocative but borders on convenient magic. The piece commits fully to its lyrical mode, which is both a strength (tonal coherence) and a risk (potential abstraction). The vision is singular but not groundbreaking.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and makes two key choices: rolling the dice to trust the vortex (alters her path) and swallowing the page (forecloses external copies, accepts bodily risk). Both choices shape the ending. Setup is immediate, development involves the dice-guided descent, and payoff is the ingestion and surfacing. The "lyrical code breaker" label is ornamental, but her dancer's perception and embodied decryption method (ankles write cursive) are causally active. Swappability is low; her specific skill set drives the plot. Score reflects strong beat involvement and closure linkage, minor penalty for the label-only "lyrical" descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dice are introduced early (setup), used once mid-story to determine the vortex entry (development), and held "in fist" when Mara surfaces (closure cameo). Two touches across beats, with the second directly enabling the archive access. However, the dice do not return with reweighted meaning at closure; the fist-hold is a static image. They constrain one key choice but are not charged in the final image. Specificity is moderate (hangman's dice, executioner backstory). Causal role is clear but limited to one pivot. Mid-band score reflects functional use without lyric resonance or evolving significance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Calm defiance" is explicitly named in the opening ("calm defiance stitched into every pause and turn") and the penultimate line ("calm in the defiance that her vulnerability...would surface as strength"). It shapes Mara's decision to swallow the page rather than risk external capture, her willingness to trust the vortex, and the scientists' choice to flood the lab. The concept is demonstrated through action (surrender to current, ingestion, surfacing) and charges the ending. Setup, development, and payoff are all present. Minor penalty for being named twice in narration rather than left fully implicit, but it clearly alters tactics and reweights the closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dance as decryption method is seeded early ("pirouette of numbers that translated...into choreography"), demonstrated mid-story (arabesque into vortex), and culminates in the swallowed spiral diagram and the child's spontaneous movement at closure. The trait constrains Mara's decryption process and enables the vortex passage. However, much of the "dance" is metaphorical ("ankles wrote cursive") rather than literal physical movement with visible cost or friction. The child's dance at the end is evocative but feels convenient. Two-beat involvement with closure linkage; moderate specificity. Mid-band score reflects causal role tempered by abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Liberate" is the scientists' goal (free the world from fear by encrypting weakness) and Mara's mission (carry the seed to surface). The action shapes the backstory and Mara's swallowing choice but is not a discrete on-page event; it's an ongoing motive. The emergency buoy trigger and surfacing enact liberation, and the spreading lullaby completes it. Setup is present (scientists' confession), development is Mara's embodiment of the seed, payoff is the transmission. However, "liberate" as verb is generic; the story would function similarly with "transmit" or "preserve." Causal role is clear but swappability is moderate. Mid-band reflects functional necessity without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coded journal entries are introduced early ("journal entries etched in copper plates bolted to the walls") and Mara has returned nightly for three weeks to decode them. The method shapes her entire mission: the entries teach the dance cipher, the final diagram in the glass journal is the key she swallows. Setup, development (nightly decoding), and payoff (swallowing the page) are all present. The mechanics matter: the cipher requires dance to unlock, and the final entry is a spiral diagram that must be embodied. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor penalty for the nightly decoding being summarized rather than dramatized. High score reflects indispensability and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sunken lab supplies multiple constraints: the cracked dome, the spider on the weather vane (clock), the flooded console, the service shaft, the spherical archive's pressure valve (creates dry chamber), and the emergency buoy. Each pressures Mara's choices and resources. Setup is immediate, development involves navigating airlocks and the vortex, payoff is the buoy trigger and air release that enable her exit. The lab's flooded state is causally tied to the scientists' choice and forces Mara's embodied decryption. Micro-setting (dice on silt, console, glass journals) alters tactics. Strong irreplaceability and closure linkage. High score reflects pervasive causal role across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The spider's web is introduced in the opening and Mara knows she has "exactly that long—one complete web." The timeframe is checked once at closure: "the spider finished its web, anchoring the last filament just as Mara triggered the emergency buoy." Setup and payoff are present, but the middle does not reference the clock or show Mara adjusting tactics under time pressure. The web functions more as a lyric frame than a live ticking constraint. Specificity is high (spider on weather vane), but causal pressure is limited. Mid-band reflects purposeful early–final reprise without middle urgency or cost tied to running out of time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Encrypting vulnerability as strength is Mara's driving motive, demonstrated through swallowing the page (vulnerability: bodily risk; strength: no regime can confiscate), the scientists' flooding choice (vulnerability: self-sacrifice; strength: denial to weaponizers), and the lullaby transmission (vulnerability as generative code). Setup is immediate, development is the archive discovery and confession reading, payoff is ingestion and surfacing. The motive is dramatized through choices with visible cost. Friction is present: Mara must accept bodily risk and irreversible embodiment. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor penalty for the concept being named in narration. High score reflects pervasive presence across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is not explicitly named but operates as tone: the drowned lab is familiar to Mara (she has returned nightly), yet mysterious (service shaft never dared, archive unseen); the scientists' encryption is both alien cipher and familiar dance. The tone is lyrical and contemplative throughout, modulating slightly at the vortex surrender (heightened lyricism) and surfacing (expansive, generative). Coherence is strong, but the tone is mostly static mood rather than a tool that charges pressure. The final image carries mystery (lullaby as constellation) and familiarity (child's intuitive response). Moderate closure linkage; the tone supports but does not decisively shape the ending. Mid-to-upper band reflects coherent execution without strong causal charge.</comment>
