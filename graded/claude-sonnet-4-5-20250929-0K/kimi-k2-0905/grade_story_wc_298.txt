<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motivation is concretely embodied—"holes that whistled at night"—and the final choice to surrender the mother-humming memory shows genuine cost. Lira's "fiercely gentle" trait operates through gesture and action across beats. The ending's acceptance of permanent gaps ("some holes must remain") earns the shift from repair-seeking to witness stance. Minor: the narrator's agency feels reactive rather than driving turns until the gate bargain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing closure. The orchard barter initiates pressure, the memory exchange deepens it, and the final sprout-and-hum image reweights "patching souls" from sealing to "weaving new cloth, leaving deliberate spaces." Cost is legible: the narrator loses the mother's hum yet hears it echoed externally, and Lira sags hollow. Orientation anchors promptly (catacomb orchard, Lira, narrator's war wounds). One meaningful deepening through the exchange ritual suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard—roots threading skulls, fruit glowing post-ritual—constrains the barter and charges the closure (sprout beneath gatekeeper's skull). Micro-setting details (apple seed in split cranium, bones jutting between roots) recur with evolving significance. Spatial choreography remains clear through corridors, hollow, gate. The orchard's ledger metaphor integrates without becoming static tour.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: patching soul-holes from war trauma. The exchange tightens when Lira demands the peas-and-humming memory instead of sunrises, narrowing options with symmetry logic. The narrator's hesitation and Lira's warning ("backing out now would leave the soul holes wider") raise immediate cost. The reversal—Lira sags, one soul puckers another—forces the gate bargain and redefines "patching" as weaving with gaps. Agency is present but reactive until the final offer.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—"patching souls is not sewing shut but weaving new cloth, leaving deliberate spaces"—emerges through the ritual's mechanics and the sprout's hum-echo, not assertion. The burned Star card's sky/water split and the narrator's shift from client to witness embody the question without moralizing. The final image (star-shaped sprout, mixed-coin purses) reweights "holes" as necessary rather than wounds. Subtext operates in Lira's "some holes must remain for the light to enter" and the orchard's slow ledger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "holes that whistled," "memories leak out like coins through torn cloth," "dusky resolve...like twilight that refused to become night." Psychic distance is stable first-person, filtered through war trauma and urgency. Lira's interiority remains external except via gesture ("fiercely gentle," eyes "soft yet incandescent"). Diction stays character-specific under pressure. Minor: "inlaying meaning everywhere" and "damned inlayed meanings" edge toward meta-commentary, though the narrator's irritation keeps it in-voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density: most lines layer image, character, and world-building. Rhythm modulates purposefully (long accumulative passages, then short crisis beats: "I nodded"). No paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Minor deduction: "fiercely gentle" recurs as descriptor without evolving into embodied contradiction in peak beats, and "dusky resolve" appears three times as label rather than enacted texture. Template stems avoided; read-aloud ear strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard where revolutionaries and nobles rot into apple trees, destinies bartered via memory transfer, and soul-patching as weaving rather than sealing—each element synthesizes into a non-obvious whole. The burned tarot's division into sky/water halves is specific and symbolic without shouting. Risk: the surreal barter premise commits fully and follows through the sprout-as-closure image. The transformation test holds: swapping names would gut the orchard's ledger logic and the war-wound specificity. Fresh inflection in the final realization.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's reckless idealism drives the orchard visit, the memory-selection choice ("destinies required symmetry"), and the final planting that births the sprout. Her decisions create the exchange turn and the gate-scene payoff. Cost visible when she sags hollow. Present early, active in middle barter, shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The burned Star card appears in paragraph 3, is pressed to bark during ritual (paragraph 7), torn along burn line to seal barter (paragraph 17), held in Lira's palm at gate (paragraph 28), and planted to become star-shaped sprout (paragraph 29). Evolves from relic to ritual tool to seed. Causally active across three beats and directly shapes closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Bartered destinies" frames the premise (paragraph 5), structures the memory-exchange negotiation (paragraphs 10–16), and the final gate bargain (paragraph 27). Shapes on-page stakes: symmetry requirement narrows options, the exchange alters both souls. Cost legible. Present early, drives middle turn, echoes in closure's mixed-coin purses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" appears in paragraph 2 (fingers brushing bones), paragraph 8 ("dusky resolve...fiercely gentle"), and inverted in paragraph 19 ("fiercely gentle no longer"). Constrains Lira's approach to the orchard and signals her cost when the trait vanishes. Label-heavy; embodied chiefly in the bone-brushing gesture. Gates: setup early, middle absence marks cost, closure return ("fiercely gentle enough"). Lyric reprise without mid-scene causal work trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Trammel" appears once (paragraph 13: "roots tightening like wires ready to trammel my ankles if I fled") as metaphor for orchard's coercive pressure during the narrator's hesitation. Contributes to the exchange-turn tension but does not reappear or shape later tactics. Single functional beat, swappable with "snare" or "trap." Mid-band: present, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Inlaying meaning everywhere" introduced paragraph 7 as Lira's habit, enacted via tarot-on-bark gesture and whispered phrases. The narrator notes "damned inlayed meanings" at paragraph 23, and the closing line (paragraph 31: "ready to inlay my own meanings") marks the stance shift. Frames Lira's method and the narrator's final transformation. Two gates (setup, closure reprise); middle enactment thin. Lyric payoff trends ~6.3–6.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard (roots through bones, apples glowing post-ritual, skull-crowned trees) anchors every beat: sets the barter logic, supplies the hollow where the exchange occurs, provides the gatekeeper's skull for the sprout, and writes the slow ledger in the closing image. Removes it and the story's spatial, causal, and thematic structure collapses. Early signal, middle constraint (roots tighten), closure charge (sprout, ledger). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Half-lit corridors" and "candles drowned in their own wax" (paragraph 22) create urgency ("time to leave before the dark reclaimed its collateral"). The glow frames entry and exit, tightening the window for the gate bargain. Present early (title echo paragraph 1), pressures departure tactics, fades in closure as they step into night city. Time tracked loosely but sufficiently; shapes two turns.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The narrator's desire to patch soul-holes from war drives the hiring, the memory surrender, and the gate bargain. Paragraph 4 concretizes it ("holes that whistled at night"), paragraph 10 tests willingness to pay, paragraph 27 escalates the offer ("memory of this orchard itself"). Final realization ("My heart still had holes, but they sang now") marks the shift from repair to acceptance. Friction visible: losing the peas-and-humming warmth. Early setup, middle cost, closure transformation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" anchors tone in paragraph 8, recurs in the final paragraph as "the dusky resolve of the city," and modulates through the piece: urgency softened by acceptance, twilight that refuses full night. Coherent through pressure beats (hesitation, Lira's collapse) and charges the mixed-coin ending image. Tone as atmospheric constraint rather than static mood. Present early, stable under turns, enriches closure.</comment>
