<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice is consistent and embodied through specific perceptual filters (salt crust, pitted brass, pooling ink). The archivist's motivation to compile fragments is clear, though the final choice to blow the trumpet feels arrived-at rather than wrestled-with—no contradictory impulse pulls against the mission. The janitor and woman are functionally present but apply pressure through information-delivery more than relational friction. The transformation from exile to herald lacks visible internal cost; the narrator moves smoothly from bitterness to purpose without dramatized hesitation at the pier's end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (harbor, exile ship, archivist role). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the narrator gathers trumpet fragments across locations, and the final note reweights prior silence into resonance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the single tone "folded into every doorway like a page finally turned" reconfigures the harbor's silence with undeniable acoustic and symbolic pressure. Cost is conceptual (the archivist trades an empty satchel's promise for the mouthpiece and commits the echo to a new archive), legible but not viscerally felt. One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman asks what the archivist can give in return, tightening the stakes from fragment-hunt to exchange.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ivory harbor's gleaming cobblestones, storm-drunk bell tower, and ozone-scented conservatory gate ground the journey with sensory specificity. The trumpet fragments function as micro-setting: the valve's "pitted brass" and "absence of sound" constrain the search and charge each assembly step. The cliff cemetery's fog layers ("each layer a year I had missed") filter perception through the narrator's exile. Spatial choreography across pier, kiosk, conservatory, cemetery, and return is clear. The harbor's "fresh margin" written by tide at the end subtly mirrors the blank-page opening, supporting closure without over-signaling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—compile fragments to hearten the city—is signaled early and drives the search. Pressure tightens when the janitor reveals the missing mouthpiece's location and again when the woman demands exchange, narrowing options from hunt to negotiation. The narrator's agency is present (offering the echo-archive entry) but the woman's acquiescence feels cooperative rather than hard-won; no tactic fails or forces a visible trade-off. The final trumpet note is the story's only on-page action that attempts to "hearten," so the stake's test arrives late and resolves without complication. One meaningful deepening (the exchange) is sufficient for this length, but escalation reads smooth rather than costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—what absence sounds like before silence, and how fragments demand their body—emerges through the trumpet assembly and the archivist's journey without overt statement. The recurring motif of "staggered intervals" (bell tower, rain gutters, fog, breath) accumulates pressure and reappears in the final breath, constraining the climactic moment. The ending image (the tone folding into doorways "like a page finally turned") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to compile scattered meaning. The piece resists moralizing, though "hearten" as both verb and mission occasionally tips toward thematic echo. The woman's line "I kept the mouthpiece to remember how exile tastes" is specific and earns the exchange without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (archival metaphors, blank-page harbor, sentences as masts) is consistent and voice-particular. Psychic distance remains controlled. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful: the woman's "metallic and impossible to swallow" and the narrator's archive-entry offer carry subtext and advance the exchange. Register occasionally elevates ("reactively visionary," "folded into every doorway") in a way that fits the archival role but can feel studied rather than urgent. The prose voice modulates appropriately with scene pressure, though the final trumpet-blowing beat compresses quickly without deepening the narrator's interior texture under that peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: nearly every sentence carries metaphor (cobblestones as words, boots as apostrophes, ink pooling like blood under scar tissue). This creates a lyric texture but borders on overwriting in the opening and middle thirds, where stacked vehicles occasionally compete (is the harbor a page, the masts sentences, the boots apostrophes—all at once?). Rhythm varies and no template cadence or paraphrase loops are evident. Information density is strong; most lines advance both search and atmosphere. The final beat's clarity holds despite compression. Penalty for figurative saturation in non-peak beats: −0.5; the closure image itself is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—exile-archivist compiling fragments via trumpet reconstruction—synthesizes quest and resonance in a specific, non-obvious frame. The ivory harbor and conservatory labeled "Possible Music" offer fresh particulars. The exchange (archive-entry for mouthpiece) and the valve as synecdoche avoid stock resolutions. Risk-taking in the sustained metaphor field (every element doubles as textual figure) heightens thematic stakes but occasionally tips toward ornament. The piece transforms the exile-return template through archival idiom and acoustic closure, though the cooperative resolution with the woman and janitor lacks friction. The bold lyric commitment distinguishes it from median work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening line. Development: the archivist's choices (asking for records, showing the valve, offering the archive entry) drive three beats and enable the middle exchange. Payoff: the archivist blows the trumpet at the pier, enacting the hearten-mission directly. The role shapes tactics (compile, assemble, archive) and the final action. Causal pressure is moderate; the archivist's decisions move the search forward but encounter little resistance. Swappability is low—another role would change the idiom and framing significantly. Score reflects solid beat involvement and closure linkage with modest escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced second paragraph ("a single herald's trumpet valve"). Development: shown to the clerk (one beat), matched in the conservatory (second beat), carried to the cemetery (third beat). Payoff: assembled into the complete trumpet and blown at the pier. The valve's "pitted brass" and "absence of sound" are handled and reweighted across four distinct beats. Its specific history (pried from the banishment-announcement instrument) is irreplaceable and charges the final note's meaning. Cost connection: the valve's origin links exile to hearten-mission. Strong integration; −0.2 for late payoff (final fifth), lands 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: implied in the opening (cobblestones as washed-away words, masts as snapped sentences) and explicit in the archivist's title and mission. Development: the concept governs search tactics (asking for records, tracking missing pieces) and the exchange premise (compiling the echo of absence). Payoff: the final note "folded into every doorway" enacts the concept acoustically. The concept shapes the dominant stake and the archivist's lens throughout. It operates more as thematic frame than on-page constraint with visible friction, so escalation tied directly to "navigated absences" is modest. Score reflects consistent presence and closure linkage with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced when the clerk tells the archivist the conservatory requires proof of being "reactively visionary, able to see the shape of what had been removed." Development: the phrase is mentioned but not dramatized as a test; the archivist enters the conservatory without on-page challenge or cost. The trait is echoed when the woman's grip is described as "reactively visionary, already feeling the future resonance," but this is assertion rather than enacted choice. Payoff: absent from the final trumpet-blowing. The attribute is ornamental, a label without tradeoff. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development and closure participation; further penalty for swappability and label-only use brings it to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: the mission is named second paragraph (the council expected the archivist "to hearten the city"). Development: the narrator explains the need to the woman ("the city needed the note again, not to summon ships but to hearten those still afraid of the water"). Payoff: the final trumpet note enacts "hearten" directly, folding into doorways. The action is the story's explicit resolution and drives the ending image. Swappability is low—"console," "inspire," or "rally" would alter tone and thematic charge. The verb is introduced early, governs the dominant stake, and the piece delivers it on the page. Strong integration with visible closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: first appears in the bell tower's "staggered intervals" (fifth paragraph). Development: recurs in rain gutters singing "in staggered intervals" (conservatory gate), fog layers as "staggered intervals" of years, and the final breath "through staggered intervals of fear and forgiveness." Payoff: the method shapes the climactic breath and thus the trumpet note. The phrase accumulates across four beats and charges the ending. Specificity is modest—"staggered" reads as purposeful rhythm but could be swapped for "halting" or "broken" with minor tonal shift. The method is present and supports closure via lyric reprise; causal pressure is light (it describes more than constrains). Lands mid-6s for reprise and closure linkage with modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: anchored opening line ("The ivory harbor after rain gleamed like a blank page"). Development: the harbor supplies the pier (where boots lined, where the narrator returns), the bell tower, the kiosk, the conservatory gate, and the cliff cemetery within the harbor's geography. Payoff: the narrator returns to "the harbor where the tide had written a fresh margin" and blows the trumpet "at the pier's end." The setting provides resources (the conservatory's instrument room) and the spatial sequence for the search. The ivory-after-rain image reappears subtly in the tide's "fresh margin," recharging the opening. Micro-setting (the valve, the trumpet) also functions here. Score reflects early anchor, beat involvement, and closure reprise with moderate constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup: "For seven years they had scrubbed my name" anchors the exile duration; "after the exile ends" is the story's present. Development: time pressure is implicit (the city needs heartening now) but not tracked as a live clock. The fog layers described as "each layer a year I had missed" poeticize elapsed time without tightening decision windows. Payoff: the timeframe contextualizes the mission but does not constrain the final choice. The "after" framing is functional and consistent but replaceable—"during reconstruction" or "on return" would work similarly. The element shapes context more than tactics. Lands mid-5s for functional presence without escalation pressure or closure cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: explicit second paragraph ("to hearten the city by compiling the fragments they themselves had scattered"). Development: the motivation drives the search (asking for records, assembling the trumpet) and the exchange ("I will compile the echo of your note into the first entry of a new archive"). Payoff: blowing the trumpet enacts both "compile" and "hearten," fulfilling the motivation on the page. The desire is dramatized through four choice-beats and faces friction when the woman asks what the archivist can offer in return, forcing negotiation. The motivation is irreplaceable—no other want would generate the archive-entry offer. Score reflects strong beat involvement, closure linkage, and visible cost (the narrator opens an empty satchel, trades future labor).</comment>
