<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inspector's interiority is concrete and purposeful—"curiosity was just another form of mourning" embodies the stance without therapy-speak. Her micro-choices (stealing the grain, burying the smaller half, timing the shots) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The grandmother's camera and the hourglass theft layer contradiction: she preserves what no one else values yet knows her contract expires at sunrise. Internal conflict between witnessing and futility drives the final shutter clicks with embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final shutter fires at the last possible second, the anemones fold into fossil, and the grain flushes crimson—options crystallize with undeniable cost (her timer confirms "no margin"). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the chemical timer, the anemones' bloom cycle, and the metaphor of witnessing as resistance, culminating in a cadence shift when the blossoms seal "like letters never meant to be mailed." Orientation anchors early (moonlit summit, Mount Selene, crater inspector), and the causal spine—steal grain, prepare reaction, photograph, shutter—holds without retroactive patches.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The vitrified regolith, feldspar vein, and basalt shard are tactile and functional: she buries the smaller grain beneath basalt, the anemones cling to feldspar, and Earth's blue glow paints "dawnlit melancholy" that filters all perception. The micro-setting (summit ridge, chemical grain, antique camera) constrains every choice—she dribbles water to start the timer, the terminator wind signals the end, the haptic lining syncs her heartbeat to the blossoms. Spatial choreography is clean (hip flask, pocket, visor, camera tripod) and the moonscape charges the final image: "perfect fossil imprint, a ghost flower pressed into stone."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—photograph the last blooming before UV bleaches them sterile—is signaled early and tightened by the forty-three-minute timer. The chemical grain mechanism creates escalation: larger half darkens on schedule, smaller half warns when the moment has passed, and she "held her breath to stop the tremor" as the blossoms folded. Agency is decision and endurance: she waits past hesitation, fires three times, and the ending confirms she "captured the last possible second." The cost is legible—her contract expires at sunrise, no seed bank exists, and witnessing cannot prevent extinction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the stolen grain is "heavier than regolith, heavier than history" because it measures "the last measurable future these creatures would ever know." The story asks whether witnessing can resist forgetting when "no political will for intervention" exists, and the final image answers non-literally—the film holds "the only color left of them," a form of resistance that cannot prevent loss but refuses erasure. The hourglass at Tycho "measuring nothing because no one remained to read the hours" reweights the inspector's theft: she creates meaning through attention when the Space Age has "moved its gaze outward." No moralizing; the anemones' "bioluminescent regret" and Earth as "distant parent" layer subtext without thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with tight focalization: "She touched the camera's worn focus ring, feeling the tooth-marks of her grandmother's gloves" grounds perception in sensory specificity. The perceptual signature—scientific precision ("Species Anemone selenensis") layered with elegiac metaphor ("mourners agreeing to a eulogy")—is consistent and character-specific. Diction control holds under pressure: "crystalline clicks," "metallic heartbeat," "electrostatic whispers" marry technical observation to emotional charge. Minor wobble: "bioluminescent regret" risks anthropomorphizing the anemones beyond POV bounds, though it can read as her projection. No dialogue present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: "vitrified regolith that glittered like shattered glass under Earthrise" grounds setting and stakes in one beat. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at the shutter moment ("one by one," "fired the shutter once, twice, three") accelerate without template stems. Minor scaffold appears: "purposefully curious" repeats twice, and "dawning hush" appears three times, though the recurrence charges the ending. The final paragraph's "no margin" feels truncated mid-thought—an artifact that doesn't obscure closure but suggests a clipped ending. No paraphrase loops or filter stacks; figurative language ("paper lantern," "diluted blood") remains coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—lunar extinction documentation via timed chemical reactions—feels specific and non-obvious. The grandmother's film camera and stolen hourglass grain transform familiar "last witness" tropes through occupational specificity and the double-grain timer mechanism. The anemones' seven-year cycle, permanent fossilization, and the inspector's expiring contract create urgency without melodrama. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the elegiac register heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation test holds: swapping names and setting would collapse the moon's "cooled palms" metaphor and the Space Age context that makes her solitary vigil credible.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in opening line, drives setup (climbs summit, prepares grain), middle choices (positions camera, starts timer, waits through hesitation), and closure (fires shutter three times at the last second). Her decisions—stealing the grain, grinding it into halves, burying one beneath basalt—create the timed mechanism that shapes all tactics. Removal would erase agency entirely.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced early ("stolen from the nightwatch's hourglass"), prepared mid-story (ground into halves, soaked in reactants), and active at closure (larger grain flushes crimson, confirming the timer). Appears in at least four beats: theft, preparation, buried half warming through basalt, final flush. The grain's dual function (alarm and deadline) constrains her waiting and charges the ending with "no margin." Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The phrase "dawning hush" appears three times and frames the terminator wind's arrival as the story's temporal boundary. It shapes stakes (UV will bleach the anemones) and charges the final image ("drowning the dawning hush"). Functions more as atmospheric pressure than a choice-altering concept; tactics depend on the timer rather than the hush itself. Lyric reprise reweights the opening setup, reaching mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Introduced early ("Purposefully curious, she had ground that grain"), repeated once midpoint ("purposefully curious, she had stolen only one grain"), and paid off at closure through visible cost: her curiosity drives her to outlast hesitation and document extinction no one else will witness. The trait constrains her waiting ("wanting to outlast the hesitation in her own chest") and connects to theme ("wondered if curiosity was just another form of mourning"). Two beats plus thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The action "outlast" structures the middle-to-end sequence: she waits through the chemical timer, outlasts her own hesitation ("Still she waited, letting the camera's shutter stay open, wanting to outlast the hesitation"), and fires at the last second. It redefines her role from passive observer to active witness who "prove[s] that witnessing could be a form of resistance against forgetting." Central to closure; swapping it would flatten the story's emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Signaled early (grain soaked in reactants that "blush pink when the terminator wind arrived"), mechanics detailed mid-story (larger half darkens in forty-three minutes, smaller half slower), and active at closure (grain flushes crimson, timer confirms capture). The dual-grain system shapes every beat: she dribbles water to start the reaction, monitors the buried half's warming, and the final flush confirms "no margin." Indispensable; removal would erase the story's temporal mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The moonlit summit is present in the opening line and supplies resources throughout: vitrified regolith, feldspar vein where anemones cling, basalt shard for burying the grain. The terminator wind and UV threat create urgency; Earth's blue glow filters perception. The summit's exposure and isolation pressure her solitary vigil. Micro-setting (pocket, hip flask, camera tripod) alters tactics. Setting and closure are tightly linked: the fossil imprint in stone is the moon's final gift.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Introduced early ("the Space Age had moved its gaze outward") and threads through: abandoned Tycho station, grandmother's camera from "the first landings," and the inspector's expiring contract at sunrise. The era shapes her isolation—no political will, no seed bank—and charges the theme of obsolete witnessing. Time tightens decisions via the forty-three-minute timer and the seven-year bloom cycle. Present in three beats (setup, middle, closure context) with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Stated early ("she would photograph the last blooming") and dramatized through conflicted choices: voice cracks recording field notes, she thinks of "engineers who once promised terraforming lilies," waits to outlast hesitation, fires three times despite knowing the image can't prevent extinction. Friction between the want (document) and cost (her contract expires, "neural backups were expensive") drives every beat. Closure hinges on capturing "the last possible second."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Established early ("Earth's blue glow painted everything in dawnlit melancholy") and sustained through elegiac register: "bioluminescent regret," "mourners agreeing to a eulogy," "letters never meant to be mailed." Tone modulates appropriately—scientific precision during setup, elegiac weight during the bloom, urgency at the shutter moment—and charges the final image: "the only color left of them." Coherent across all turns; removal would flatten the story's emotional resonance.</comment>
