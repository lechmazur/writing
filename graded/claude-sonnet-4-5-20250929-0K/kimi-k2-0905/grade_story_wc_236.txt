<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is rendered through concrete sensory absence ("hollow nose") and embodied choices (polishing the screw, tracing its thread). Her motivation to "refill with meaning if not molecules" drives the arc credibly. The final pocket-gesture is earned, though the move from loss to midwifery metaphor relies heavily on reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the story deepens through density increase and cadence shift rather than causal reversals. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid)—Mira recognizes that "maps of emotional terrain are drawn as much by loss as by landmark" and pockets the screw as keepsake. Cost is felt (she will not regain smell but has found alternate meaning), and the final image reweights prior material. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. One persistent constraint (anosmia) shapes her stance throughout. The lengthy middle section leans on interpretive reflection rather than on-page micro-choices that alter present options, which slightly softens escalation legibility under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The water clock's gurgle and drip-time, the loupe, and the screw's micro-scratches all constrain Mira's interpretive work and charge the final image ("first drop fell with a sound like a wet newborn gasp"). Spatial choreography is clean (workshop, windows, fog). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through her olfactory absence. The body and tool function as micro-setting that directly enables closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding meaning after sensory loss) is signaled early and tightens through Mira's deepening engagement with the screw. One meaningful turn: her realization that the screw was "offered, a metallic prayer" reconfigures her stance. Agency is renunciation/endurance (she will not smell again) paired with a gained capacity (to midwife stories). Cost is legible (she accepts permanent loss), though the pressure accumulates largely through reflection rather than on-page choice under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (loss as map, presence found in absence) emerges from concrete particulars: the screw, the anosmia, the trembling calm refrain. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via the pocketed screw and the phrase "reading between lines only the heart can translate." Subtext operates in gesture (rotating the screw one quarter turn) and image (tears blurring the loupe into watery lens). No overt moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution while landing a clear emotional charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (metallic textures replacing scent). Diction is controlled and rhythmic, though several passages verge on elevated lyricism that strains against workshop-intimacy ("diaphragm contracting in slow motion," "spindle around which spun every unseen wonder"). The phrase "trembling calm" recurs as motif rather than organic perception. Psychic distance modulates purposefully. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with mixed success: "bottled dawn," "ticking ghosts," "every measured drop would commemorate safe arrival" work, but stacked metaphors in the middle third ("watery lens," "spindle," "deliverance and duration") approach overwriting. Template cadence appears in the reflective beats ("She realized…," "She set…," "She reassembled…"). Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 11–13 restate Mira's interpretive insight without added pressure. No major causality breaks, but line-level density occasionally dulls momentum. Information density is generally high; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes well.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise (aromatherapist who lost smell working in a repair shop, reading emotional history in objects) is fresh and specific. The screw-as-prayer synthesis feels earned in hindsight. Emotional particularity (anosmia's hollow, the micro-scratches as panic) avoids generic template. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative, reflection-heavy) heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity. The "trembling calm" frame and water-clock metaphor are purposeful but border on over-orchestration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's loss of smell frames the story early, constrains her sensory access throughout (she cannot scent but can feel and interpret), and drives the closure choice (pocketing the screw as keepsake for future clients). Her occupation and attribute are causally active in at least three beats: initial framing, screw interpretation, final decision. Specific cost: she accepts permanent sensory loss but gains narrative empathy.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The birthing clamp screw appears early (paragraph 4), is handled and examined under the loupe (paragraph 8), interpreted as "offered, a metallic prayer" (paragraph 12), rotated one quarter turn and nested back (paragraph 15), and pocketed as keepsake (paragraph 20). It drives the interpretive arc and charges the final image. Irreplaceable: its specific obstetric origin matters. Cost tied to it: Mira's tears and decision to carry it forward.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reading between lines" is introduced explicitly (paragraph 5), enacted through Mira's tactile interpretation of the screw's micro-scratches (paragraph 8), and reprised in the final line ("reading between lines only the heart can translate"). It shapes her method and stakes, though the phrase itself functions more as thematic label than constraint that narrows options. Middle development shows her reading the screw's story, but the action is interpretive rather than decisional.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Maps emotional terrain" is seeded early (paragraph 3: "Mira…trusted her fingertips to map emotional terrain"), dramatized in her screw examination (paragraphs 8–13), and reprised at closure (paragraph 19: "maps of emotional terrain are drawn as much by loss as by landmark"). It constrains her approach (she relies on touch, not scent) and enables the final choice. Cost: her method depends on permanent sensory absence. Slightly abstract as trait, but operationalized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Humanize" appears explicitly in paragraph 7 ("if she could humanize this shop of ticking ghosts") and again in the penultimate paragraph (paragraph 20: "a keepsake to humanize every future client"). The action drives Mira's interpretive arc and closure decision. However, it functions more as motivational frame than as distinct physical action with swappable alternatives; removing "humanize" and substituting "understand" or "translate" would leave structure largely intact. Middle beats enact it (reading the screw's story), but the word itself is more thematic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Occluded views" is introduced early (paragraph 6: Horace's claim that timepieces "hide stories in occluded views") and echoed in paragraph 11 ("in that occluded view she recalled…"). The method—interpreting hidden, partial histories—shapes Mira's approach and the screw examination. However, it remains largely metaphorical; no on-page choice hinges on something being literally occluded versus revealed. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but does not narrow tactical options.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The water clock repair shop anchors all action, supplies the screw (found fused in the clock's base), and provides the loupe and workspace. The clock's gurgle and descending float mark time and charge the closure ("first drop fell with a sound like a wet newborn gasp"). Horace's departure enables Mira's solo interpretation. The setting is causally active in at least three beats and indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Hush of morning fog" frames the opening and closing (paragraphs 1, 18, 21) and is described pressing against windows (paragraph 10), contributing to atmosphere. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the story could unfold at any quiet hour. The fog lifts at the end to reveal "ordinary miracles," providing lyric closure resonance but not tactical pressure. Present and coherent, but not constraining.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to unveil ordinary miracles" is stated in paragraph 7, dramatized through her screw examination and tears (paragraphs 8–14), and fulfilled in the closure sequence (paragraphs 18–20: she steps into the breath, pockets the screw). The desire drives her interpretive arc and final choice. Friction exists between her loss (cannot smell) and her goal (find meaning), creating visible cost. Slightly tell-heavy in the framing, but enacted through choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Trembling calm" appears in the opening line, recurs in paragraph 11 (the mother's state), and closes the final paragraph, creating a coherent tonal frame. The tone modulates subtly—intimacy in the screw examination, emotional release in the tears, quiet resolve at the end—without breaking coherence. It charges the final image by uniting Mira's internal state with the world outside. Slightly over-orchestrated (the phrase recurs as motif rather than emergent perception), but effective.</comment>
