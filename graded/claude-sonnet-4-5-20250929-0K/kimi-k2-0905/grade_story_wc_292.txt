<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Mara's core motivation (honoring Edda) is established early and drives her choices, but interior contradiction is minimal—she moves through each beat with steady determination rather than conflicted impulses. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (the nail pulsing, trembling hands) but much of the interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory experience under pressure. The final choice to stay another season feels thematically resonant but is told rather than dramatized with visible internal cost or foreclosed path. The relationship with Voss shifts from threat to ally too smoothly without sustained friction.</comment>

<comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through Mara's nightly decoding work, the discovery of the micro-maps, and the dirigible expedition, culminating in the corroded helm-log reveal. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce only after the opening sentence; by ~120 words the reader has anchored, so the Orientation Test is satisfied. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara chooses to stay another season, cataloging memory into the sky itself, but this decision is summarized in the final paragraphs rather than dramatized with a live choice under pressure. Cost is conceptual (she could leave but stays) rather than felt on the page in a concrete moment. One meaningful deepening occurs (the wreck recovery confirms Edda's sacrifice), but the causal chain from decoding to dirigible launch to stay-decision relies heavily on summary rather than because/therefore linkage in scene.</comment>

<comment>The weather station setting is vivid and specific: spongey plankwalk, mildew on aluminum walls, barometers screaming, experimental kites. The copper nail functions as a micro-setting object that recurs and charges the final beats (rechristened as a stylus, etching coordinates). The dirigible launch and wreck recovery are grounded in spatial detail (nine nautical miles south, restricted test zone, gondola floor), and the sky-as-library image at closure directly engages the setting to reweight memory versus erasure. The shoal where journals were found becomes the wreck site, closing the spatial loop. This meets the 9+ quick test: environment and recurring object constrain choices and charge the final image.</comment>

<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—proving Edda's voyage to reverse her erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Mara decodes the first line, then again when she assembles the micro-maps. The dirigible launch and wreck recovery constitute one meaningful deepening, and the final choice to stay and catalog carries conceptual cost (she forgoes immediate return). However, the escalation is largely enacted through summary (fourteen squalls pass off-page, the assembly of maps is described rather than dramatized), and the key reversals (Voss's shift from threat to ally, the Ministry's instant approval) lack visible tradeoffs or friction. Agency is present but muted; Mara's choices feel inevitable rather than hard-won under pressure. The cost at closure is told rather than felt in a pivotal beat.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The theme—memory versus erasure, bravery inconvenient enough to erase—emerges from concrete particulars: the salt-cipher journals, inverted micro-maps, the verdigris thumbprint, and the sky itself becoming a library. The central question "What bravery is so inconvenient that we erase its coordinates?" anchors the theme without didacticism, and the final image (etching coordinates onto glass walls, light refracting maps across rain) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The copper nail's transformation from coffin relic to stylus deepens thematic resonance. Minor slip: the phrase "reversible as breath, eternal as weather" in the final paragraph edges toward overt thematic statement, and "purposeful direction instead of anonymous dread" feels slightly over-articulated. Overall, theme arises from scene work and the final reprise reweights prior material without a stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The narrative voice is poetic and consistent, with a perceptual signature tied to Mara's archival sensibility (ink bled into semaphore shapes, micro-maps, salt-cipher). Psychic distance is stable third-person limited. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("spongey dread glowed the color of old pennies," "gravitational pull of legacy"), and the dialogue between Mara and Voss—especially the question "What bravery is so inconvenient that we erase its coordinates?"—reads as thematic articulation rather than naturalistic speech under pressure. The final paragraphs shift into a summary mode that compresses weeks of cataloging, flattening immediacy. Diction remains controlled and purposeful, but the voice does not always reflect Mara's mind under stress—some lines read as narrator wisdom rather than character perception.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence-level rhythm is mostly controlled, but several beats rely on template cadence and paraphrase loops. The opening sentence runs long with multiple subordinate clauses that delay the anchor. Across the middle section, lines like "she sang coded lullabies…the rhythm helping her spot stanzas" and "the journals' author…had written in salt-cipher to hide from mutineers" stack exposition without propulsion. The phrase "nervously confident" appears twice in identical construction (opening and later "nervously confident and soaked in secrets"), a small loop. Figurative density is high throughout ("spongey plankwalk," "copper nail pulsed," "gravitational pull of legacy," "sky's spongey dread glowed the color of old pennies") without consistent payoff; some metaphors feel ornamental rather than pressure-driven. The final paragraphs compress weeks into summary, losing concrete action. No major causality breaks, but momentum sags in exposition-heavy stretches. Deductions: template cadence and paraphrase loops −0.6, figurative density without pattern-teaching −0.4, summary in place of scene in final third −0.3, total −1.3 within Q7. Starting from functional baseline ~7.4, final score 6.1.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of map-librarian protagonist, coded journals, reversible exile, and weather-station setting is specific and coherent, avoiding stock plots. The salt-cipher and inverted micro-maps add fresh detail, and the final image—sky as library, light refracting coordinates—offers a non-obvious closure. However, the core emotional arc (honoring overlooked ancestor, reversing institutional erasure) follows a familiar template: wronged lineage, archive quest, vindication. The question "What bravery is so inconvenient that we erase its coordinates?" feels crafted for thematic resonance rather than earned from lived detail. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative structure and lyric tone elevate the piece, but the protagonist's path from exile to reversal to voluntary return lacks surprise or hard tradeoffs. The combination of elements feels purposeful but not inevitable in hindsight. No proximity to famous lines, but the ending's "reversible as breath, eternal as weather" leans toward generic closure phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Mara's choices drive key turns: invoking the Reversible Exile Act, decoding the journals, assembling the micro-maps, confronting Voss with the question, launching the dirigible, and choosing to stay another season. She appears in all major beats and the closure unit (her decision to stay and catalog) depends on her prior actions. Early signal (first sentence), three distinct beats (decoding, confrontation, dirigible launch), causal pressure (her choices narrow options and enable the wreck recovery), closure linkage (her final stance is the ending), and specificity (idealism manifests in the drive to honor Edda) all present. Minor friction: the idealism is more label than lived friction—Mara's confidence is "nervous" but her choices rarely waver or face internal contradiction. Swappability is low; removing Mara's archival expertise and lineage breaks the story. Setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure +1.2, specificity +0.5, late idealism friction −0.3, told decision −0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The copper nail appears in the opening (drumming pendant), reappears when the first line is decoded ("pulsed against her throat"), is clutched during the dirigible launch ("imprinted her palm"), connects to Edda's verdigris thumbprint in the helm-log, and is rechristened as a stylus in the penultimate paragraph, etching coordinates onto glass. Five distinct touches across setup, middle, climax, and closure. The nail's coffin origin and verdigris patina link Mara to Edda materially and thematically, and its transformation to stylus reweights it from memento mori to active memory tool. Early signal +0.6, four beats (opening, pulse, clutch, thumbprint match, stylus) +1.4, causal pressure (the match to verdigris confirms lineage and charges the decision) +1.0, closure linkage (stylus use in final image) +1.2, specificity (coffin origin, patina, transformation) +0.7, cost connection (the scar it leaves, its symbolic weight) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3, but cap at 8.4 per band. Round down: 7.4 is too low given the evidence; recalculating: 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3, but the nail does not constrain a choice under pressure—it charges the closure image. Score 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Reversible exile is introduced in the second sentence ("invoking the newly passed Reversible Exile Act"), frames Mara's initial stake (she believes truth can be mapped to reverse the erasure), and returns at the climax when the decoded stanza states "Return is exile seen from the other deck"—reframing reversal as proving the journey worth remembering. The Ministry grants reversal, but Mara chooses to stay, enacting a second-order reversal. The concept shapes tactics (exile grants access to the salvaged journals and weather station) and the closure unit (her choice to stay redefines what reversal means). Early signal +0.6, two beats (invocation, decoded stanza) +0.9, causal pressure (exile enables the quest) +1.0, closure linkage (her stay decision reprices reversal) +1.2, specificity (the Act is named and its logic matters) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3, round to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>"Nervously confident" appears twice: opening ("fingers nervously drumming") and final paragraph ("new exiles arrived, nervously confident"). The trait is labeled rather than dramatized in contradictory action. Mara's hands tremble "not from fear but from the gravitational pull of legacy," which names the trait but does not show it constraining a choice. The attribute does not enable or foreclose tactics under pressure; it functions as descriptive coloring. Late recurrence in final paragraph is ornamental. Setup (opening mention) +0.3, label-only −0.7, no middle beat or cost −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.3 − 1.2 = 2.1. Reconsidering: the opening establishes it and the closing recurrence brackets the arc, but no on-page choice hinges on the nervous/confident tension. Score 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The question "What bravery is so inconvenient that we erase its coordinates?" is posed to Voss at a pivotal beat, causing him to admit his brother's loss and agree to the dirigible launch. It reappears transformed in the final paragraph ("What truth do you need the wind to remember?"), now encoded in the jet stream and posed to new exiles. The action drives two major turns: Voss's alliance and Mara's new role as greeter/guide. It is specific (the phrasing and timing matter) and irreplaceable (no other action serves this dual function). Early signal (midpoint), two beats (Voss confrontation, final teaching), causal pressure (the question shifts Voss and redefines Mara's purpose) +1.2, closure linkage (the question is reprised and encoded) +1.4, specificity +0.7. Base 3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3. Reconsidering: the question is introduced at ~50%, so late penalty −0.3; but it transforms the ending, so closure linkage is strong. 3.0 + 3.3 − 0.3 = 6.0 is too low given two major beats. Recalculate: setup at midpoint +0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure +1.4, specificity +0.7 = 4.6, base 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Coded stanzas in shipwrecked journals are introduced early (the crate of drowned journals, "sang coded lullabies…ink had bled into semaphore shapes"), govern Mara's nightly work (fourteen squalls), yield the first decoded line, and culminate in the micro-maps that guide the dirigible to the wreck. The method's mechanics (salt-cipher, inverted coastlines, stanza final words pointing to margins) are specified and matter. Early signal +0.7, three beats (nightly work, first line, micro-maps) +1.4, causal pressure (decoding enables the quest) +1.2, closure linkage (the method's product—the map—delivers the wreck and reversal) +1.0, specificity (salt-cipher, semaphore, inversion) +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0. Minor friction: much of the decoding happens in summary ("night after night," "on the fourteenth squall") rather than dramatized attempts. Summary-only −0.5. 8.0 − 0.5 = 7.5, but the method does not constrain a choice under pressure in scene—it enables off-page work. Recalibrate to 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Weather Station Cirrus-9 is named and detailed (spongey plankwalk, aluminum walls, mildew, barometers, experimental kites, restricted test zone), provides the crate of journals, serves as the base for the dirigible launch, and its glass walls become the etching surface in the closure image. The station's function (experimental weather work after the jet stream shift) justifies the salvaged journals and the wreck's proximity. Early signal (opening), four beats (arrival, nightly work, dirigible launch, glass etching), causal pressure (the station grants access to journals and dirigible) +1.1, closure linkage (glass walls anchor the final image) +1.3, specificity (Cirrus-9, test zone, spongey textures) +0.7. Base 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7, round to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The jet stream shift is introduced early (opening sentence) as backstory context for the perpetual rains and the station's existence. It reappears when Mara overlays Edda's map onto current drift models ("the storm that later became the new jet stream") and in the final image ("the very jet stream…reversible as breath"). The timeframe provides atmospheric pressure and explains the setting's weather, but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—Mara's fourteen-squall decoding and the dirigible launch happen at her chosen pace. Setup +0.5, two touches (backstory, overlay, final encoding) +0.9, atmospheric contribution +0.3, no on-page clock or tactical constraint −0.6, swappability (any long-term environmental shift could serve) −0.4. Base 3.0 + 0.7 = 3.7. Reconsidering: the shift is causally necessary (it justifies the station, the journals' salvage, the wreck's location) even if not a ticking clock. Upgrade causal pressure to +0.8, total 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Mara's desire to honor Edda is stated early ("believed the truth could still be mapped"), drives her request for exile, her nightly decoding, the confrontation with Voss, the dirigible expedition, and her choice to stay and catalog. The motivation is specific (Edda's mercy run, the Ministry's erasure) and irreplaceable. Early signal +0.7, five beats (exile request, decoding, question to Voss, launch, stay decision) +1.4, causal pressure (the motivation explains all major choices) +1.3, closure linkage (staying to catalog enacts the honoring) +1.2, specificity (Edda's name, the verdigris match, the refugee convoy) +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3. Friction: the motivation is more told than conflicted—Mara never doubts or faces a tradeoff between honoring Edda and self-interest. Told-only penalty −0.6, no dramatized friction between wants −0.6. 8.3 − 1.2 = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>"Spongey dread" is named in the opening (plankwalk texture, mildew) and returns in the dirigible launch ("sky's spongey dread glowed the color of old pennies"). The tone—melancholy, archival, saturated with rain and decay—is consistent through the decoding and recovery beats, then modulates in the final paragraphs to "purposeful direction instead of anonymous dread," signaling a shift from passive dread to active memorialization. The tone charges the final image (etching coordinates, light refracting across rain). Early signal +0.6, two named beats +0.9, coherent modulation +0.8, closure charge +1.0, specificity (spongey textures, verdigris, kelp stench) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.9 = 6.9. Minor friction: "spongey dread" appears only twice by name; the pervasive tone is melancholic but not always dread-specific. Drift −0.3. 6.9 − 0.3 = 6.6, but the modulation in the final line ("purposeful direction instead of anonymous dread") directly addresses the tonal arc. Score 6.3 after rounding considerations and recognizing that "spongey" is more texture than sustained emotional tone across all beats.</comment>
