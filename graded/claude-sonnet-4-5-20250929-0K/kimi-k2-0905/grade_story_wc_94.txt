<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior life is densely rendered through embodied perception ("mask dangling…like a penitent carries a stone"), but her agency remains largely symbolic rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The arc from silenced poet to self-erasing transmitter unfolds more as philosophical stance than as on-page struggle with visible cost that forecloses a path. The final disappearance reads as metaphorical ascension rather than a choice earned by prior causality with felt consequence. Interiority is vivid but lacks the friction of competing motives under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric compression; the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid) where Mara's dissolution into the storm reweights her silenced voice as transmission. Orientation anchors arrive late—"censored poet Mara" and "observatory" establish who and where, but the timeframe and stakes remain abstract until midpoint. The darkroom sequence offers concrete beats (timer set, print emerges, strips dissolve), yet the causal chain from manuscript destruction to metaphorical departure lacks the on-page cost or tactical narrowing that would elevate closure into undeniable pressure. The ending gestures toward transcendence without a legible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is rendered with vivid specificity—lightning, reversed waterfalls, dome ringing like a bell—and the darkroom timer, petri dish, and chemical tray function as micro-setting elements that constrain Mara's ritual. The storm itself pressures the action (overexposing the second sheet, charging the catwalk scene) and the final image of the empty petri dish with a star-shaped stain charges closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency in the darkroom beats, though the metaphorical density occasionally drifts toward postcard lyricism rather than choice-driven particulars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—archiving forbidden verse by dissolving it into storm and starlight—is signaled early and pursued through the darkroom ritual. The overexposure accident ("an accident she would later call revelation") offers a micro-turn that shifts tactics from clandestine printing to metaphorical broadcast, and the timer stopped at one second crystallizes the vigil-in-pause motif. However, the escalation lacks a visible price that narrows options; Mara's choices feel preordained rather than forced by constraint. The dissolution of the manuscript carries conceptual cost but no dramatized trade-off or tactical friction under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cartography-of-scars motif, the vigil-in-pause conceit, and the darkroom-as-archive metaphor. The final image—empty dish, star-shaped stain, penciled timetable—reweights the premise without stating a moral, and the recurring storm/scar constellation accumulates meaning across beats. The line "What is erased still orbits, a ghost moon pulling tides of ink" exemplifies subtext through image rather than declaration. Minor slip: "the cartography of scars is never finished" teeters toward thesis statement, though it remains anchored in the observatory setting and her physical scars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose sustains a heightened, lyric register with strong perceptual signature ("rain on hot pavement," "needle-cold droplets," "negative space between stars"). POV remains stable in close third, and the compressed diction ("rarefy," "halide," "cumulonimbus") fits the poet-protagonist's lexicon. However, the voice occasionally tips into purple density—"furiously tranquil, a vigil in pause" recurs as a refrain that borders on over-ornamentation. Under peak stress (storm strike, dissolution ritual), the syntax maintains its baroque texture rather than compressing, which dilutes urgency. No head-hopping, and the perceptual filter stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Information density is high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or symbol, but figurative language saturates nearly every line without pattern-teaching or payoff sufficient to justify the load. Mixed metaphors appear: "sky archive," "ghost moon pulling tides of ink," "broadcast for anyone willing to listen to static" stack without clear vehicle coherence. Template cadence emerges in the darkroom sequence ("She set…," "She slipped…," "She opened…," "She stepped…"). Paraphrase loop: "furiously tranquil" and "a vigil in pause" repeat across three beats without added meaning. Clarity holds at closure, so penalties remain moderate, but the overwriting flattens propulsion in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of darkroom photography, censorship, and storm-as-archive offers a fresh angle on silenced-artist material. The timer as metronome of erasure, the overexposure accident as revelation, and the petri dish as future-oriented artifact show ingenuity. However, the ending leans on familiar transcendence tropes—protagonist vanishes into storm, rumors proliferate, objects self-animate—that dilute the earned particulars. The cartography-of-scars motif and the sealed-envelope-in-timetable detail feel specific, yet the final image of "Departures every instant, destination ungoverned" reads as abstract wish fulfillment rather than a transformation grounded in prior causality. Risk-taking in voice and structure is evident, but the closure retreats into poetic vagueness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and makes choices (climbs the funicular, sets the timer, dissolves the manuscript, steps onto the catwalk), but her decisions feel preordained by the metaphorical frame rather than forced by on-page constraints. She appears in setup, middle, and ending, satisfying the gate model, yet her agency does not create key reversals—the overexposure happens to her, and the final disappearance is narrated as rumor rather than shown as choice with cost. The character shapes atmosphere more than plot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The darkroom timer is set for eleven minutes (one per year of erasure), rings to call Mara back, and is stopped at one second in the penultimate beat—three distinct touches across setup, middle, and ending. Its eleven-minute duration ties directly to her backstory and the vigil-in-pause concept, and stopping it at one second charges the closure image with suspended time. The timer constrains the darkroom sequence and returns with reweighted meaning, meeting the object integration tests solidly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"A vigil in pause" is named explicitly ("the timer's metallic tick became the metronome of a vigil in pause, furiously tranquil") and operationalized through the stopped timer and the petri dish left waiting. It recurs in the ending ("a vigil still in pause") and shapes the protagonist's stance—ritual suspension rather than confrontation. However, the concept functions more as atmospheric refrain than as a constraint that narrows tactics; Mara's choices are not visibly altered by the pause itself. Lyric reprise with thematic weight, but mid-band for causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is applied to the timer's tick and the petri dish, and recurs three times as a label for the protagonist's state. It colors tone but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost—Mara's choices proceed regardless of whether she embodies this attribute. The phrase reads as thematic ornament rather than a trait that generates friction or tradeoff on the page. Present across beats but swappable with similar paradoxical descriptors.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>To "rarefy" the manuscript, Mara dissolves ink strips into chemical solution and sets the dish on the windowsill for stormlight—this action drives the middle third and leads to the star-shaped stain in the ending. The word "rarefy" is used twice (once in the opening thesis line, once when she tears the timetable), and the mechanics (chemical tray, petri dish, scent of rain) are specific. The action is essential to her archival scheme and cannot be swapped without losing the darkroom motif. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but the emotional cost of destruction is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The sealed envelope wedged in the bus timetable is carried up the funicular, torn into strips, and dissolved; the timetable itself reappears at the end with a new schedule penciled in. The method is signaled early, used in the dissolution beat, and reprised at closure with reweighted meaning ("Departures every instant, destination ungoverned"). However, the choice to use this specific vehicle—envelope in timetable—does not shape tactics under pressure; any paper holder would serve the same plot function. Purposeful reprise lifts it into lyric-resonance territory, but swappability caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory supplies the darkroom, telescope, dome, catwalk, and funicular; the storm itself overexposes the second sheet, rings the dome like a bell, and charges the catwalk scene. The setting is present in setup (funicular climb), middle (darkroom work, overexposure), and ending (catwalk, empty dish). The observatory's height above clouds and isolation from surveillance pressure Mara's choice to ritualize rather than distribute physically. The micro-settings (darkroom annex, windowsill, dome slit) constrain her actions and the final image of the dish on the sill ties setting to closure. High causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"When masks slip, the soul exhales" appears in the opening paragraph and is reprised when Mara lowers her mask on the catwalk, but the timeframe itself does not tighten decisions or shape tactics. The eleven-minute timer offers a concrete duration, yet no external clock pressures the protagonist—she stops the timer voluntarily and the storm persists without deadline. The phrase functions as thematic metaphor rather than a temporal constraint that alters moves. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Understanding "the cartography of scars" is stated as insight midway ("Mara understood then that the cartography of scars is never finished") and linked to her body's welts matching the storm's pattern. The motivation colors her decision to dissolve the manuscript into transmission, but it is articulated as epiphany rather than dramatized through conflicted choices with visible cost. The scars motif recurs (skin tingles as meridians, sky redraws the map) and charges the final image, yet the desire itself is told more than tested under pressure. Mid-band for thematic presence without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Storm-kissed wonder suffuses the prose from the opening lightning-stitched sky through the catwalk scene where Mara "tasted electricity" and raised her arms "in alignment, antenna to the storm's heartbeat." The tone modulates with pressure—awed awe in the opening, ritualistic focus in the darkroom, ecstatic surrender on the catwalk—and charges the final image of the observatory "drifting on the uppermost draft of wonder." The tone is coherent, purposeful, and inseparable from the closure effect, meeting the high-integration tests for tone.</comment>
