<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's interior is vivid and embodied through concrete sensory detail—"pulse lied often and well," the static pull between coats. Her transformation is earned through the physical experience of the petal, layering grief, rage, and wonder without therapy-speak. The final choice to stay and let it hurt demonstrates contradictory impulses (detachment vs. connection) with visible cost. Minor: the chemist remains functional rather than fully realized, and some clients' emotions are summarized rather than dramatized in Lira's experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Lira's choice to remain, breathing in residue and letting it hurt, forecloses her prior armor with palpable cost ("cracked vial" she doesn't check). The accumulative/textural lens holds—sensory density builds through static, scent layers, and the grotto's transformation until the final grounding gesture. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when by opening lines). One meaningful deepening occurs when the petal releases clients' emotions, reweighting her stake from selling to understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The amber grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: resin smell, fossilized sap pool, copper light tracking time, dust she kneels in, earth's electric hum she presses into at closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lira's professional filter shifting to raw receptivity. The vials in her coat lining and the cracked one at the end tie space to choice. Setting details are woven through action (adjusting coat, sinking to knees) rather than static catalog, and the grotto's darkening to stone mirrors her transformation's completion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding vs. selling) is signaled early and tightens when Lira presses the petal to her wrist, a micro-choice with immediate consequence. The scent's release of clients' emotions—grief, rage, child's wonder—escalates pressure by forcing her to feel what she'd commodified. The transformation completes with visible cost: her detachment "lay folded beside her like a discarded coat," and the cracked vial she won't check. Agency is clear (she chose the petal, chose to stay), though the chemist's departure feels slightly passive in its lack of friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (insight without empathy is surveillance; commodified emotion vs. authentic connection) emerges through concrete particulars: the half-truths she sold, the woman who bought "acceptance," the man's "forgiveness" that tasted like copper. The final image—palm pressed to earth, vial cracking, staying to hurt as proof she's reachable—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "They had fused her" inverts the stated goal (fuse insight with empathy) into embodied consequence. Minor: "a beginning" in the penultimate line edges toward thematic summary, though the final gestures recover specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance; Lira's perceptual signature is consistent (professional assessment, sensory acuity, the "pulse lied" motif). Diction modulates purposefully under pressure—precise and detached early ("counterfeit emotion," "subsume") softening to visceral image ("bruise," "aching affection"). The chemist's sparse dialogue carries subtext and advances plot. Minor: "voice crackling like static" and a few filter phrases ("sensing the tension") slightly dull immediacy, though they remain voice-motivated and the overall texture is distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively (short urgency: "She hesitated. The transformation was already beginning"); information density is high (coat/vials, static/wool/silk all work multiple jobs). Figurative language is controlled and character-specific ("bloomed like a bruise," "cathedral of static"). Minor scaffold appears: "She couldn't answer" is inert filler, and "the grotto now a cathedral" slightly over-reaches. The paraphrase loop "pressed the petal to her wrist" / "The petal clung to her skin" registers as −0.2, and one template stem run ("There was the grief... There was the rage... And beneath them all") merits −0.3 in Q7, totaling −0.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of perfume-as-emotion-commodity, static electricity as intimacy sensor, and the grotto as transformation chamber feels specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms a familiar redemption arc through the concrete mechanics of scent layering and the half-truths embedded in each vial. The final turn—fusion acting on her rather than by her—offers fresh inflection. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and sensory density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor: the "dealer who never samples her own wares" frame and the wise-chemist archetype lean on familiar beats, though execution elevates them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's role as counterfeit emotion dealer frames her motives, drives the key turn (using the petal herself rather than selling), and her prior client transactions supply the emotional layers she experiences. Her choice to stay and "let it hurt" rather than leave or check the cracked vial forecloses her detachment with visible cost. Present in setup, middle pressure (tracking the chemist), and closure (staying in the grotto). High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blotter petal appears in three beats: offered, pressed to wrist (micro-choice with immediate consequence), and clings to release layers. Its oils—"darkened by a hundred unspoken confessions"—give it specificity, and its mechanical function (feeding on heat, releasing emotion) drives the transformation. Returns blank at closure, marking transfer completion. The petal's unique properties (absorptive, layered release) are irreplaceable; no other object could perform this exact function. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Half-truths shape stakes (Lira built her empire on them), constrain tactics (selling diluted emotions), and supply the scent's content ("shaped by the half-truths she'd told herself"). The core concept drives the key realization ("insight without empathy was just surveillance") and the final act (breathing in "every half-truth she'd ever told"). Present in setup, pressures middle beats (clients' stories), and charges closure. High causal integration and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Professionally thorough" is signaled early ("dealer who never sampled her own wares," tracking the chemist for weeks) and enables her choice to seek the scent. The trait constrains her initial detachment and makes the transformation's cost—abandoning that armor—legible. Present in setup and implied at closure (staying to feel rather than analyze). Moderate causal work; the trait could be replaced with "cautious" or "disciplined" without major restructure, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Subsume is the chemist's exact term ("Not erase, not replace—subsume"), defines the petal's unique action (memory submerged, essence surfaced), and drives the transformation's mechanics. The word anchors Lira's expectation and is fulfilled when emotions layer and fuse her rather than vanish. Setup (chemist explains), development (she experiences subsumation), and closure (detachment subsumed, not erased). Irreplaceable: "erase" or "overlay" would alter the story's logic. Exceptional causal and conceptual integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Static electricity appears in four beats: coat friction (early), hand near cheek (spark of recognition), hair crackling at closure, and earth's hum she senses. It functions as intimacy/connection sensor and ties the grotto's properties to Lira's receptivity. The method enables the chemist's near-touch moment and charges the final grounding gesture. Present across setup, middle, and closure. Moderate causal work; it enriches but doesn't strictly constrain choices—recognition and transformation could occur without it, lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The amber grotto supplies the transformation's container: resin smell primes memory/preservation, fossilized sap pool anchors the chemist, dusk's copper light tracks time/urgency, amber dust where she kneels, and earth's hum she presses into at closure. The setting's properties (ancient, static-charged, light-hesitant) mirror and enable the emotional archaeology. Setup, middle (physical anchors), and closure (darkening, cooling, grounding). High causal and atmospheric integration; the grotto's unique properties matter.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Timeframe "as the transformation completes" structures the entire narrative arc from dusk through "last sliver of sun" to full darkness, tightening urgency and marking stages. The transformation's progress (beginning in chest, completing in silence, grotto darkening) tracks causally and pressures Lira's choice to stay rather than leave. Present in setup (dusk), middle (sun's copper light, completion phrase), and closure (grotto darkened). Strong temporal scaffolding with moderate constraint; the clock shapes mood more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Lira's stated goal—fusing insight with empathy—is dramatized through conflicted choices: seeking the petal (risk), hesitating (cost awareness), pressing it to her wrist (commitment), and staying to hurt (acceptance). The goal is inverted at closure ("They had fused her"), making the cost visible. Friction between her detachment (armor) and need (to understand) drives the arc. Setup (stated need), middle (petal application and its consequence), closure (fusion enacted on her). Exceptional integration; the motivation is irreplaceable and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Affectionate detachment coheres through diction ("professionally thorough," "pulse lied often and well") and modulates under pressure: clinical early ("counterfeit emotion," "distilled from half truths"), warming through clients' stories ("permission to stop crying"), and dissolving into "porous, aching affection" at closure. The tone charges the final image—staying, hurting "not as punishment" but as connection. Setup, middle modulation, and closure transformation. Strong coherence and purposeful shift; the tone is integral to the thematic arc.</comment>
