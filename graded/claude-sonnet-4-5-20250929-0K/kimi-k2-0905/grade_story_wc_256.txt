<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The bell ringer's interior life remains abstract—labels like "coaxing music from metal" and "texture of connection" never ground in embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The collectors are functionally interchangeable, with no individual resistance or cost when they "dismantle their equipment." The protagonist's transformation from mourning to creation is asserted rather than earned through visible on-page struggle. "Powerfully gentle" appears as a descriptor but never constrains a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when remain vague through the opening paragraph (−0.4). The closure—"Why do we mourn the silence when we could be learning its music?"—is stated rather than dramatized, lacking visible cost or a decisive change in options. The lens wavers between accumulative (golden shadows, spiral pattern) and causal (the question "propels" change), but neither holds consistently, and the ending reads as thematic summary rather than Resonant Reconfiguration with felt pressure. No single on-page sentence demonstrates cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The laboratory is described in atmospheric generalities ("cathedral of forgotten frequencies") without spatial anchors or micro-setting constraints that shape choice. The carbide lamp lens recurs but functions as symbolic token rather than tool; its "cracked glass" never alters a tactic. Golden shadows appear throughout but remain decorative metaphor, not environment that pressures decision. The spiral pattern at center is staged but does not constrain the song or the collectors' actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering "texture of connection"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. The collectors' shift from preservation to creation occurs in a single paragraph without reversal, narrowing of options, or visible price paid. The bell ringer's question "propels" change via declaration, not agency under pressure. No escalation: the laboratory "seemed to listen," then the collectors "began to dismantle," all summarized rather than dramatized with competing impulses or forfeited paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated explicitly rather than earned: "artificial pilgrimage was not lesser than ancient tradition" and "why do we mourn the silence when we could be learning its music?" are thesis sentences, not emergent particulars. The carbide lamp lens is introduced as thematic token ("not recovery but transformation") without grounding in the bell ringer's prior struggle. The final paragraph moralizes: "beautifully artificial in its authenticity" and "sometimes the most sacred pilgrimages are the ones we invent ourselves" read as summary rather than resonant image. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6) for prompt-like language in the final third.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Voice toggles between lyric ("prism-song bell ringer") and abstract philosophizing ("texture of connection," "artificial pilgrimage") without a stable perceptual signature. The bell ringer's diction is elevated and uniform even under the pressure of confronting the collectors, lacking stress-driven compression or character-specific syntax. The collectors speak once in unison ("their voices rough with disuse") but carry no individual idiom. Register drifts into essay mode in the final paragraphs: "true pilgrimage moves forward, artificial or not, propelled by the courage to question everything we think we know about mourning."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "artificial pilgrimage routes" and "artificial pilgrimage" recur without added pressure; "golden shadows" appears seven times as decoration. Template cadence: "She [verb]… she [verb]…" runs across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors: "cathedral of forgotten frequencies," "voices rough with disuse," "wilted flowers." The final third stacks abstraction: "fluid, ever-changing, and beautifully artificial in its authenticity" and "sometimes the most sacred pilgrimages are the ones we invent ourselves" read as scaffolding rather than image. Artifacts touch closure (−1.7 baseline in Q7); disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—seekers in a "laboratory of lost sounds" learning to embrace new creation—follows a familiar arc of letting-go and transformation without fresh synthesis. The prism-song bell ringer and carbide lamp lens are evocative labels but function as interchangeable tokens; the lens could be any cracked artifact without altering the arc. The ending's insight ("why do we mourn the silence when we could be learning its music?") is stated rather than dramatized through a non-obvious choice. No specificity that would make the story unrecognizable if names and props were swapped.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout but decision-making is abstract: she "began to question their assumptions" and "led them to the center," actions that do not narrow options or face on-page resistance. Her choice to leave the lens behind (final third) arrives as thematic gesture rather than causal turn. Does not constrain middle tactics or force a tradeoff with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Introduced early (coat pocket), handled mid-scene (held up to shadows), and left behind at closure. However, its function is symbolic rather than mechanical—it "fractured light into spectral pathways" and serves as metaphor for transformation without constraining a choice or altering a tactic. Appears in three beats but does not create cost or narrow options; swappable with any "cracked" object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Signaled early ("artificial pilgrimage routes") and returned at closure ("true pilgrimage moves forward, artificial or not"). Shapes the thematic question but does not constrain on-page choices—the collectors' shift from preservation to creation is not driven by pilgrimage mechanics. Present across beats as concept but not as stake that narrows tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Appears as label ("powerfully gentle weight," "powerfully gentle act of creation") without embodied constraint. Does not enable or foreclose an action with visible cost; the attribute is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in a choice moment. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Propel" appears twice: her voice "propelling itself across the room" and later "propelled by the courage to question." The verb is metaphorical rather than literal action that changes tactics. The question itself triggers the collectors' shift, but the propulsion is assertion rather than dramatized force with resistance. Functional in one beat but swappable with "echo," "carry," or "spread."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Signaled mid-scene ("began to question their assumptions") and returned at closure ("the courage to question everything we think we know"). The method drives the thematic turn—her question causes the collectors to dismantle equipment—but the mechanics are summarized rather than shown through a specific on-page friction. Present in two beats; shapes one turn but does not constrain earlier attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Introduced early and recurs throughout, but functions as backdrop. The "main chamber" and "center of the laboratory" stage actions without constraining them—characters move freely without cost imposed by space. The "silent machinery" and "artificial pilgrimage routes" are described but do not supply resources or obstacles that alter outcome. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Mentioned in the opening line ("after the power grid stabilized") and invoked thematically ("world of stable electricity"), but does not create urgency or narrow decisions. No live clock; the timeframe is historical context rather than pressure. Does not shape tactics or recur with reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stated early ("to discover the texture of connection") and returned at closure ("the texture of connection she had discovered"). Drives the quest but is never dramatized as conflicted want versus cost—she seeks and finds without visible friction. The motivation shapes the dominant stake but does not force a tradeoff or foreclosure on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" recurs seven times, establishing a consistent visual mood that frames both arrival and departure. The tone remains static—no modulation with pressure or escalation—but the shadows "holding the shape of a song" at closure attempts to charge the final image. Coherent but decorative; does not shift cadence or intensify under stress.</comment>
