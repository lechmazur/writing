<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The astrologer's interiority is imagistic and consistent, but her micro-choices rarely show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The ghost encounter and ritual completion unfold as orchestrated moments rather than tension points where she must weigh competing goods. The final choice—boarding the submersible—feels inevitable rather than earned by prior struggle, with no visible cost that forecloses another path. Embodied emotion is present but often abstract ("chest ache with shared exile") rather than particularized to this character under this pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece signals an accumulative/textural lens early (constellation charting, ritual completion) and the final image attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the paper-bird gesture. However, orientation debt is moderate: "three hours before midnight" and the facility layout are anchored late, and the stakes—will she surface or stay?—are declared rather than dramatized through constrained choice. The closure image (paper bird, burning feather) reweights prior material but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; we do not see what she forfeits by returning. The drive lens holds but the closure unit lacks the sharp before/after edge required for higher scores.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underwater facility is vividly rendered with specific details (moon-pipes, thermocline power, salt-eaten catwalk) that create strong atmosphere. The environment supplies resources (emergency valve, chalk, porthole) but these are used for ritual rather than constraining a tactical choice. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from "only corridor left unflooded" to the atrium and then "back through the unflooded corridor" suggests layout confusion. The micro-setting (burnt feather, catwalk summit) charges the final image without forcing a difficult decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—complete the ritual before the submersible surfaces at sunrise—is signaled but never tested through meaningful opposition. The astrologer encounters no obstacles that force trade-offs; the ghost awaits her, the tools are available, the valve opens. The ticking clock (until sunrise) is declared but does not narrow her options on the page. The ritual's completion feels preordained rather than earned through agency, and the "cost" of returning to the surface is asserted thematically rather than shown as a forfeited alternative with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of belonging as "reciprocal recognition across impossible depth" emerges through concrete particulars (burnt feathers as signal flares, the city inhaling through her lungs, the rhythm committed to muscle memory). The final image—tearing out the sky-page to become a paper bird—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. However, the epiphany arrives through assertion ("She understood then") rather than through a choice that dramatizes the insight. The feather-pinion inheritance risks symbolic convenience but is grounded enough in prior action to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is distinct, lyric, and sustained across the piece with consistent imagistic diction ("shadowseam wonder," "moon-pipes vented silver bubbles," "luminous respite"). Perceptual signature is strong: the astrologer notices celestial reflections, chalk diagrams, and ritual gestures in character-specific ways. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose compresses purposefully ("softly ingenious echo") and the ghost's fragmented speech ("pulses") distinguishes it from the narrator's fluid observation. Under peak pressure the voice remains coherent without flattening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and most sentences advance atmosphere or ritual action. However, several adjacent lines restate the same content: "the drowned kept their own time" and "the facility's clocks had stopped at 03:17" both convey temporal disruption; "learn the rhythm of belonging among barnacled ghosts" and the later "the way belonging feels…as reciprocal recognition" are paraphrase loops. Figurative language ("inverted rainfall," "horribly beautiful orrery") is dense but mostly coherent. Template cadence is avoided and sentence openings vary. The scaffold around the ritual sequence ("Realizing…," "Determined…," "She understood then…") slightly dulls momentum but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of astrology, ornithology, and underwater ritual is specific and non-obvious; the burnt feathers as "signal flares sent skyward from the seafloor" transforms the telemetry premise into ceremony. The piece commits fully to its lyric logic without retreat, and the ghost-as-hologram detail grounds the fantastical in plausible tech. The final paper-bird immolation feels inevitable in hindsight. However, the broader frame—lone researcher in abandoned facility discovers ghost and completes ritual—follows a recognizable template, and the transformation relies more on atmospheric texture than on a structural or moral surprise that redefines prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The landscape astrologer is present throughout and her actions (descending, pocketing the feather, drawing constellations, climbing the catwalk, exhaling into the moon-pipe, tearing the star atlas page) drive the sequence. However, most choices feel choreographed rather than decisions under competing pressure; she follows the ritual steps without visible cost or trade-off. She is the sole agent but her agency is more observational and participatory than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The burnt feather appears in three distinct beats: found in the vent grille with Vesper's tag (setup), pocketed and felt as residual warmth (middle touch), and ignites when the astrologer strikes the chalk star, releasing cedar and ozone (closure participation). Its properties—warmth, scent, connection to Vesper's birds—are specific and irreplaceable. The feather's meaning evolves from artifact to ritual catalyst, and its final transformation into pinions on her shoulders reweights it as inheritance. It shapes the ritual and charges the ending image with causal presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The phrase "luminous respite" appears once in the middle third as a description of light pooling between the astrologer and the ghost. It names a thematic texture (respite from the green dark, from exile) but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The concept is echoed in the bioluminescent copepods and the light-based ritual, but as atmosphere rather than as a decision point. Present and logically coherent but replaceable with "light" or "glow" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The attribute "softly ingenious" is applied once to the ghost's echo, describing its nature rather than enabling an action. The ghost does hand the astrologer "the memory of a match" and speaks in pulses, but these details arise from "echo" and "hologram" more than from "ingenious." The phrase is label-only and does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost; it flavors the description but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action "captivate" appears twice with distinct uses: Vesper's ghost says "To captivate the sky, first captivate the ground beneath it," and the astrologer ends with a promise "to captivate the surface world with stories of what glows beneath." The verb frames the ritual's purpose—binding attention between sky and seafloor—and the astrologer's closing exhale and breath-spiral enact it. However, the action is more thematic anchor than mechanical turn; the ritual would function with "summon" or "signal" with minor edits. It shapes the closure image but is not indispensable to the plot's bones.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method "a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" is signaled early (the moon-pipes vent bubbles skyward), dramatized at the climax (astrologer and ghost exhale into the rising column, their twin breaths spiral together, and copepods—functioning as fireflies—drift down and settle onto the chalk constellations), and its mechanics matter: the exhale activates the city's response, illuminating the ruins. The method is specific, irreplaceable, and central to the ritual's completion. It drives the key turn and charges the closure with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater city research facility provides essential infrastructure: the porthole for celestial observation, the unflooded corridor as access route, the moon-pipes as ritual apparatus, the emergency valve as the mechanism for the shared exhale, and the surrounding ruins (domes, obelisks, opera house) as the pattern that the constellations map onto. The facility's abandonment and time-stopped state (clocks at 03:17) frame the stakes. The setting constrains the astrologer's movements and supplies the tools for the ritual; it is essential across beats and participates directly in the ending when the city "inhales" and the ruins illuminate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "until sunrise" is signaled early ("three hours before midnight," "only until sunrise before the research submersible automatically surfaced") and frames the ritual's urgency. Dawn's approach is tracked in the penultimate paragraph ("Dawn approached; the first photons brushed the ocean skin") and the astrologer boards "just as the automatic ascent engaged." However, the clock does not force a visible trade-off or alter her tactics mid-ritual; the deadline is met without cost. The timeframe is present and shapes the setup but does not tighten decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn the rhythm of belonging" is declared in the middle third ("leaving her to learn the rhythm of belonging among barnacled ghosts") and later realized ("She recorded nothing…and instead committed the rhythm to muscle memory: the way belonging feels…as reciprocal recognition"). The desire drives her participation in the ritual and her promise to return. However, the motivation is more thematic claim than dramatized friction; we do not see her struggle between competing wants (leave safely vs. stay and complete the ritual). The cost—what she gives up to belong—is asserted rather than enacted through a difficult choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone "shadowseam wonder" (a neologism blending eerie and luminous) is coherent throughout: the humming glass corridors, the green emergency light, the ghost as "softly ingenious echo," the moon-pipes venting silver bubbles, the murals of whales in nebulae, the copepods blinking like tiny hearts. The tone modulates subtly—wariness at the burnt feather, awe at the ghost, reverence during the ritual—without breaking its signature blend of mystery and luminosity. The final image (paper bird igniting, sunrise painting the horizon) charges the tone with closure resonance. The tone is consistent, purposeful, and elevates the ending.</comment>
