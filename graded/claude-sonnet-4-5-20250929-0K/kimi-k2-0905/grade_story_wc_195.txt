<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The knight's transformation exhibits embodied progression through concrete choices (unsnapping the clasp, nodding assent), and the final wooden state carries visible cost. However, the interiority relies heavily on elevated abstractions ("shapes of possibility," "shivering bliss") that distance the reader from immediate sensation. The motivational chain—oath to jester-king driving the exchange—reads as adequately causal but the psychological particulars of why he accepts this prison remain thinly sketched. Internal contradiction is present (shame versus duty) but not enacted in micro-choices that test commitment before the final surrender.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors appear within the opening paragraph (knight, greenhouse, reality-shift moment). The closure—transformation into marionette guardian—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) with visible cost: human form traded for wooden imprisonment. The escalation accumulates through choreographed movements and the puppet's offer, culminating in the irreversible exchange. One meaningful deepening occurs when the knight realizes "the shape of possibility was never a single thing to capture but a continuous folding." Cost is legible in the final image of eternal vigil, though the causal linkage between unsnapping the clasp and the transformation could be sharper—it reads more as ritual completion than motivated choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting constrains movement through the choreography pattern and actively shapes the transformation scene through alchemical properties (silver sap, gravity-reversing apples, mercury sky). Spatial details remain coherent: upside-down trees, miniature stage at center, door threshold. Sensory selection is purposeful (phosphorescence, rosin smell, cinnamon-incense, clockwork ticking) and filtered through the knight's attention. The recurring silver sap coats his limbs at closure, charging the final image. The "endless night" and "reality shifts" timeframe function as both atmosphere and constraint, though the mechanics of when shifts occur remain vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—fulfilling the murmured allegiance to free the jester-king—is signaled early and drives the knight to the greenhouse. The central tightening occurs when the puppet offers the exchange, forcing a binary choice with irreversible consequences. The knight's agency manifests in the nodding assent and armor removal, though the decision feels more passive acceptance than active struggle. One meaningful reversal: understanding that capturing possibility requires becoming its abandoned vessel. Cost is visible (humanity traded for wooden form, eternal guardianship) and forecloses return. The lack of on-page resistance or internal debate before surrender limits tension at the pivotal moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of imprisonment and freedom emerges organically through the knight's exchange: both are freed (jester-king, new knight) yet both remain bound (wooden guardian, borrowed soul). The final image—waiting to unsnap the next traveler—offers a resonant answer about cyclical sacrifice without stating a moral. The "shape of possibility" motif evolves from object-to-capture to continuous process to the knight's new essence as "the crease along which the world bent itself anew." Subtext operates in the puppet's invitation and the whispered "Thank you." No overt philosophizing mars the ending. The piece commits fully to its mystical premise and follows implications without retreat, though some metaphysical abstractions ("futures the knight had denied himself") edge toward convenient symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with close focalization on the knight. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during transformation, slightly wider for setting description). However, the prose frequently slips into elevated register that strains the POV's plausible lexicon: "gravitational tenderness," "factually mystical artifact," "continuous folding." The single line of dialogue ("Your murmured allegiance binds you...") reads archaic-formal but appropriate to the mystical frame. Perceptual signature is present but generic (warrior noticing theatrical elements, feeling shame) rather than character-specific. The narrative voice is consistent and distinctive in its cadence but risks preciosity in peak beats where simpler diction would sharpen pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors appearing in nearly every sentence ("minutes pool like spilled mercury," "armor fell away in petals of rust," "library of shapes that hummed like distant bees"). Several mixed vehicles appear: silver sap "reversing gravity" while also "coating limbs" and "sealing cracks"; the greenhouse "breathes" while also having a "heartbeat." Template cadence emerges in the middle section with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" constructions. Paraphrase loops: the knight's understanding of possibility appears three times in slightly varied form (paragraph 16, 24, 25). Information density is high but rhythm becomes uniform under the ornamental load. The final paragraph avoids these pitfalls and achieves clean propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—alchemical greenhouse where reality-shift moments allow soul-transfer via marionette—synthesizes fairy-tale logic with mystical ritual in a specific frame. The upside-down orchard and choreographed approach offer fresh spatial logic. However, the core exchange (hero trades self for another's freedom) is archetypal and the emotional arc follows a predictable descent into sacrifice. Transformation through particulars: the marionette theater program, clockwork seeds, and star-wood joints ground the fantasy concretely. The risk of ornamental world-building is present but the piece commits fully to its logic. The "withdrawn knight" and "jester-king" remain generic types without idiosyncratic detail that would make them irreplaceable. Proximity check: no obvious echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The withdrawn knight is present throughout and his choices create the key turn: he kneels, unsnaps the clasp, nods assent, and allows transformation. However, many beats are observational (walking through orchard, watching the puppet rise) and the pivotal choice reads more as passive acceptance than decision that alters tactics. Setup clear; middle beats involve following choreography; closure directly shaped by his final surrender. The character's agency is sufficient but not forceful.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The marionette theater program appears in beat one (impaled on root, smells of rosin/applause, holds choreography), is lifted and examined, then gathered by the new knight at closure. Two touches across the arc. However, its function is largely mnemonic (reminds of oath) and instructional (holds dance pattern); it does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning. The program enables the approach but could be replaced with another map/guide device. Mid-band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The murmured allegiance ("I will find the puppet that holds your soul and pull the string that sets you free") is established early, directly motivates the knight's presence in the greenhouse, and is echoed by the puppet ("Your murmured allegiance binds you"). It shapes stakes (fulfill the oath) and drives the exchange decision. The jester-king's freedom at closure confirms payoff. Present in setup, middle pressure, and ending consequence. The concept constrains the knight's choice to proceed despite cost. Strong integration across all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" appears once as a descriptor near the end ("he—now factually mystical artifact—was the crease..."). It functions as thematic label rather than trait that constrains action. No on-page moment shows the knight enabling or losing capability because of this attribute; it reads as a poetic gloss on his transformed state. Label-only mention; late appearance; ornamental use. Swappable with "truly enchanted" or similar. Basement functional range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Unsnap" is the pivotal action: "unsnap the clasp that held the strings" triggers the greenhouse darkening, the puppet's animation, and the exchange offer. The story explicitly states the moment ("The moment the clasp opened, the greenhouse darkened further..."). At closure, the knight is "ready to unsnap the next traveler," making the action both the inciting mechanism and the cyclical closure image. Early signal via the program's reference to pulling strings; middle beat execution; ending reprise with reweighted meaning (now he is the one who will unsnap others). Irreplaceable and causally central. One hairline slip: the physical act is small for the metaphysical weight it carries, risking symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Forgotten patterns" appears in the program's choreography (step, pause, pirouette) that opens "invisible curtains in the air," is practiced by the puppet ("limbs moving through forgotten patterns"), and is rehearsed by the wooden knight at closure. The method shapes the knight's approach tactics and is signaled early. Three distinct beats. The patterns function as both literal choreography and metaphysical key. The mechanics are somewhat vague (how do dance steps open curtains?) but the method is indispensable to the story's ritual logic. Strong integration with minor opacity about exact operation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is the sole setting, present throughout. It supplies resources (silver sap that coats/preserves, upside-down trees, miniature stage, mercury sky) and constrains movement (choreographed path through spectral trees). The endless-night shroud creates the temporal pressure (reality-shift window). The environment actively participates: apples dim to embers when the clasp opens, sap rises to seal the knight's wooden form, the structure pulses with a heartbeat. Setup immediate; middle beats involve navigation; closure image depends on the greenhouse continuing to grow and nurture. The setting is indispensable and multi-functional.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"As reality shifts" is named as the timeframe when the knight arrives ("when the moon forgets its phase and minutes pool like spilled mercury"). The concept recurs at closure ("the day another seeker would arrive as reality shifts again"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the knight proceeds methodically without a ticking clock. The endless-night atmosphere is pervasive but static. Setup present; closure callback; but no middle beat where time pressure alters tactics. Lyric reprise that reweights slightly (cyclical nature of the shifts) but does not drive escalation. Mid-band: functional frame without forcing choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to capture the shape of possibility" is stated in beat three and recurs when the knight realizes it is "never a single thing to capture but a continuous folding." It drives his presence in the greenhouse and frames the exchange. However, the desire is abstract and not dramatized through conflicting wants or micro-choices that test commitment. The knight proceeds without visible internal friction between this goal and competing fears or values. Setup clear; thematic payoff at closure; but middle development lacks on-page struggle. The motivation enables the plot but is told more than enacted through choice. Upper-mid range: functional but not richly conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Shivering bliss" appears twice: as what the velvet curtain exhales and as the knight's "last human sensation...of weightlessness." The tone combines uncanny dread (endless night, darkening greenhouse, inevitable transformation) with transcendent surrender (the puppet's "gravitational tenderness," the universe leaning closer). Modulation is present: foreboding in approach, ritualistic calm during transformation, elegiac patience at closure. The tone charges the final image of eternal vigil. However, the prose's elevated register remains uniform rather than varying with pressure beats. Coherent and purposeful but somewhat static in its lushness. Upper-mid integration: tone supports theme without fully modulating across turns.</comment>
