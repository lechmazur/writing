<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior voice carries a consistent poetic-philosophical register, and the geode provides embodied connection to loss. However, the grief accountant metaphor ("death's accountant") arrives as diagnostic label-speak rather than emerging through embodied action. The final choice—stepping off the railing—feels motivated by the accumulated weight of potential, but the bride's questioning reflection reads as convenient moral interrogation rather than genuine internal contradiction acting simultaneously in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands with a Decisive Change: the protagonist's fall will redirect tomorrow's drone strike, and the final image of "unused potential pooling" reweights the hunt. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture building to a Causal final act), held coherently through the ending. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (observatory, survivor, geode). One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes he's harvesting unlived lives, then accelerates the hunt, narrowing to the final perturbation calculus. Cost is visible: his death becomes the .003-degree telescope shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory is grounded with sensory particulars—helium sacs hissing, transparent floor, circuit breakers cooling—and the setting constrains his actions (he uses the telescope, breaks circuit breakers to alter wind patterns). The geode as micro-setting object charges the closure image when its dust patterns form wedding toasts. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from maintenance shafts to railing, and the desert below supplies the tactical map for his hunt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding and harvesting unused potential—is signaled early and tightens when he realizes he's "turning tragedy into a resource" rather than saving anyone. One clear reversal: the hunt shifts from rescue fantasy to mechanical grief. The final choice is protagonist-driven with visible cost: his death will save a village by altering the telescope .003 degrees. Each fragment crumbled from the geode narrows options, and the escalation culminates in self-sacrifice with tactical precision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the geode's transformations and the repeated pool-of-potential image, avoiding direct statement until the ending reweights it: "unused potential began its slow, inevitable pooling." The story resists tidy resolution; he becomes a perturbation himself rather than a rescuer, and the final image—wedding guests raising silent toasts—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether unlived futures can be redeemed. The bleak exhilaration motif threads through without moralizing, and the closing line delivers earned conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a consistent poetic-philosophical register. Perceptual signature is selective: he notices fractures, energy signatures, unused math problems—details filtered through his post-trauma obsession. However, the prose occasionally slips into elevated diction that strains plausibility for a man with shattered ribs in acute grief ("perturbation theory," "intangibly tangible," "grave robber of possibility"). The bride's reflection reads as authorial interrogation rather than his own contradictory impulse, creating brief psychic distance instability.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and figurative language (geode as second heart, atoms mingling, potential pooling) charges key images. However, overwriting density appears: most sentences in the middle third carry layered metaphor without pattern-teaching, and mixed vehicles strain coherence ("perturbation I'd become," "death's accountant," "grave robber of possibility" cluster within three paragraphs). Template cadence surfaces in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" openings. Two paraphrase loops: paragraphs 12–13 restate that he's collecting potential; paragraphs 18–19 circle the geode's final fragment showing his own unused future. Deduct −0.8 for density and loops; −0.3 for template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic grief with quantum potential and perturbation theory is specific and non-obvious. The observatory-as-tactical-tool and geode-as-map avoid stock symbols, and the final suicide-as-telescope-adjustment turn feels earned in hindsight. The wedding-survivor frame risks template territory, but the transformation—from victim to "perturbation himself"—lifts it. Risk-taking in the dense poetic mode heightens stakes without full obscurity, though the metaphor density occasionally tips toward cleverness over clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in opening, drives the hunt throughout, and his final choice to fall alters the telescope's aim. His survivor status motivates all actions and the closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The geode appears in the opening pressed against ribs, becomes a quantum map at the telescope, fragments across multiple beats as he collects potential, and its dust forms wedding toasts in the final image. Each crumble constrains his options and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "unfiltered awakening" surfaces explicitly in paragraph 6 ("The awakening came unfiltered") and the final line ("unfiltered awakening"). It shapes his realization that he's harvesting lives rather than saving them, but the concept remains more thematic echo than tactical constraint across middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "intangibly tangible" phrase recurs (paragraph 8: "intangible memories becoming tangible weight"; paragraph 19: "intangibly tangible weight"), and the geode's dual nature—both object and map of possibilities—drives his actions. However, the attribute often reads as poetic description rather than a constraint that forces tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hunt structures the entire middle: he tracks energy signatures, finds pools in the schoolhouse and hospital, smashes circuit breakers to create perturbations, and accelerates collection. The final act is still a hunt—he becomes the perturbation to redirect the drone. Removing "hunt" would require full restructure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is introduced in paragraph 7 and shapes his method: he calculates how small actions ripple, breaks the circuit breaker to shift wind patterns, and his final fall becomes a .003-degree perturbation. The mechanics matter—without it, the suicide lacks tactical logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory provides the quantum telescope, its circuit breakers cooling create the time window, and he manipulates its systems (breaking breakers, shifting its list) to alter outcomes. The transparent floor and outer railing supply the final leap. The setting is indispensable to his tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Circuit breakers cooling frames the window and returns at paragraph 14 ("circuit breakers requiring time to reset") and paragraph 20 ("circuit breakers clicked back online"). The timeframe creates urgency—he hunts "faster now"—and the systems coming online triggers his final act. However, elapsed time remains vague; no exact countdown tightens choices beat by beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Finding where potential pools is stated early (title motif) and dramatized through every hunt beat: schoolhouse equations, hospital vaccines, musician's requiem. The motivation conflicts visibly when he realizes he's "harvesting their unlived lives" rather than saving anyone, yet continues. The final discovery—that potential "had never left"—reweights the quest and drives the closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Bleak exhilaration is named in paragraph 12 and again in the final line. The tone coheres through poetic-morbid imagery (wedding cake dust, silent toasts, atoms mingling) and modulates as he accelerates the hunt. The closing image—desert rushing "like a bride's embrace"—fuses grief and exhilaration to charge the ending.</comment>
