<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve erased histories is established early and her resourcefulness drives key beats (using the key, threading the tape, wiring the tower). However, interiority remains largely abstract and label-driven ("carefully resourceful," "underestimated rebel") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice—standing with raised hands—feels more symbolic tableau than a decision that forecloses a path with visible internal cost. Emotional progression is asserted ("knowing that plans unravel so that better ones can knot") rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal chain: Mira receives the key, waits for drones to pivot, enters the booth, activates the reel, and broadcasts the histories. Orientation anchors (Mira, lagoon, dusk, phone booth) appear early. The closure—officers hesitating as erased voices wash over them—registers as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than felt on the page. The line "plans unravel so that better ones can knot" reads as thematic assertion rather than a dramatized shift in stakes or tactics, weakening the closure's bite.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The auric lagoon, starlight reflections, and defunct phone booth create a vivid, purposeful setting. The booth's glass, reel-to-reel beneath the coin box, and "MAINT" slot are specific and tactile. The lagoon's reflections guide Mira to the booth, and the booth's wiring enables the climax, meeting the micro-setting constraint test. However, spatial choreography during the sprint and inside the booth remains somewhat vague, and sensory selection (damp boardwalk, cooling planks, salt-aged tape) occasionally lists rather than filters through urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—broadcasting erased histories to counter systemic revision—is signaled early and drives Mira's actions. The plan unraveling at sunset when drones reappear creates one meaningful complication. However, escalation is thin: the drones pivot away on schedule without Mira adapting tactics under direct pressure, and the final confrontation (officers hesitating) arrives as a passive reception rather than a choice that narrows options. Cost is implied (hands raised, capture imminent) but not viscerally dramatized in a way that alters tactics or forecloses a live path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus manufactured indifference emerges through concrete particulars: magnetic reels, edited conversations, puddle-reflected maps, and the looping whisper "Indifference is a lock; memory is the key." The final image of voices "impossible to silence" and a "new map" offers resonance. However, the closing lines veer toward thematic summary ("starlight braided into copper, coded freedom ringing off the hook") rather than letting the image speak without ornament. The payoff is legible but slightly over-articulated, undercutting the non-literal answer the story otherwise earns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira throughout. Diction is lyric and heightened ("auric," "azimuth," "cadence"), creating a distinct texture but occasionally drifting into elevated register that feels imposed rather than character-specific for a seventeen-year-old street artist. Perceptual signature is present (puddle reflections as waveforms, Orion glints as Morse code) but reads more authorial than Mira's lived idiom. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence structures and vivid images ("shadow stretching behind her like an unapproved footnote," "hollow that could be filled again"). However, figurative density is high and occasionally muddles clarity: "auric cylinder," "azimuth," "displaced voices … holding the line" layer metaphor on metaphor without grounding. Template cadence appears in sequential clauses ("She pressed… and recalled," "She adjusted… aligning… each confession"). Minor paraphrase loops (revised histories described multiple times as "erased," "edited," "replaced") and stock phrases ("tyranny of indifference" repeated) reduce momentum. The closure beat is charged but slightly obscured by ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—archived phone conversations used to manufacture revised histories—offers a fresh angle on memory and surveillance. The puddle-reflection map and reel-to-reel as insurgent tool show specific synthesis. However, the execution leans on familiar rebel-versus-surveillance tropes (street artist, drones, broadcast hack) without transforming them through deeply particular emotional calculus or world logic. The final image of voices "ringing off the hook" and "starlight braided into copper" is evocative but edges toward stock lyricism. The story takes modest risks with structure and voice but does not fully commit to bold, specific choices that would make the synthesis irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's decisions—waiting for drone loops, sprinting to the booth, threading the tape, wiring the tower—drive all major beats and shape the closure. She is present throughout and her choices alter tactics (timing the sprint, adjusting the azimuth) and enable the broadcast. The underestimated-rebel framing is signaled early ("labeled a nuisance") and pays off when officers hesitate. However, her agency is more logistical than internally conflicted; we see resourcefulness in action but little visible cost or trade-off that makes her choices risky on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The phone booth key appears in the third paragraph (received from the switchman), is "clenched like a fuse" during the sprint, inserted into the "MAINT" slot to activate the reel, and turned "one final time" as drones return. It is present in at least three distinct beats and its brass teeth and label ("MAINT") are specified. The key's worn smoothness and decades of archived callers anchor the revised-histories concept. It enables the climax directly and charges the final image ("key still in her fist"). Strong causal role and closure linkage elevate the score; minor deduction for middle-development constraint being more logistical than a live trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Revised histories—conversations edited on magnetic reels where "dissidents vanished mid-sentence"—are introduced early, drive Mira's stake (reclaim true voices), and shape every tactic (find the booth, thread the tape, broadcast the reels). The concept is made concrete through the reel-to-reel, the overwritten grandmother conversation, and the final broadcast that "spills from every public speaker." It is indispensable to the story's logic and charges the closure when officers hear "their own erased lullabies." High causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage justify the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is mentioned in paragraph two and demonstrated through Mira's use of discarded manuals, timing drone loops by Orion's reflection, and adjusting the azimuth. However, the trait is more label-summary than a visible trade-off; we see competence but not a moment where resourcefulness costs her (e.g., time, risk, or a foreclosed safer option). The attribute enables actions but does not constrain or complicate them with felt pressure. Mid-band for functional presence without cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reappear" structures the inciting complication: "Mira's plan had unraveled at sunset when the security drones reappeared over the lagoon." The drones' return forces her to wait, time their loops, and sprint during the pivot. They reappear again at the climax ("The drones returned, their spotlights slicing the booth"), framing the final confrontation. The action is signaled early, shapes two key beats, and is present at closure. Strong causal role; minor deduction because the drones' return does not meaningfully complicate Mira's tactics—they pivot away on schedule and she proceeds as planned.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The puddle-reflection map is introduced in paragraph six: "puddle reflections at dusk showing not streets but currents … pointing toward the abandoned booth." It is described across several lines (waveforms traced with wet finger, starlight bent into frequencies) and guides Mira to the booth's location. The method is specific and purposeful, shaping her approach. However, it appears only in one extended beat (the discovery/approach) and does not return or constrain later choices. Functional setup and mid-story use; no closure reprise or cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The auric lagoon under starlight is introduced in the opening line and recurs throughout: starlight ripples as "secret language," Orion's glints time drone loops, the lagoon's glow brightens into "a single golden path" as the broadcast begins, and the closing image shows "starlight braided into copper." The setting supplies the puddle-map, frames Mira's waiting and sprint, and charges the closure. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; it pressures choices (waiting for the right moment) and provides the symbolic/physical anchor for the ending. High integration with felt presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"When plans unravel" is established early ("Mira's plan had unraveled at sunset") and the story tracks time via dusk, starlight, Orion's position, and the guard-shift change. Mira times her sprint by the drones' loops, creating live urgency. The timeframe shapes her tactics (waiting, sprinting during the pivot) and is present in the title-like phrase that recurs near the end ("plans unravel so that better ones can knot"). However, the clock is more atmospheric than a tight, escalating constraint; the guard shift arrives as expected without complicating her moves. Solid setup and beat use; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To hold the line against the tyranny of indifference" is articulated explicitly in the story's second half and framed through Mira's grandmother's stories, the erased conversations, and the closing chorus of "displaced voices—dockworkers, poets, runaways—all speaking at once, holding the line." The motivation drives her plan and the broadcast. However, it is more told and thematically asserted than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices with visible friction between want and cost. We see resolve but not internal resistance or a moment where indifference tempts her to stop. Mid-band for clear presence and closure linkage without embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Coded freedom" appears in the lagoon glints as "Morse beat spelling coded freedom," recurs in the final image ("coded freedom ringing off the hook"), and is woven through imagery of secret language, waveforms, frequencies, and encrypted communication. Tone is lyric, cryptic, and rebellious, modulating with pressure (quiet waiting, sprint urgency, broadcast triumph). It charges the final image and coheres across beats. However, the tone is somewhat static in register—elevated throughout—without a sharp shift at peak pressure. Strong thematic integration; minor deduction for lack of tonal escalation or modulation that would heighten the ending's impact.</comment>
