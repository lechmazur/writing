<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Cael remains a static vessel for lyric description rather than a character making choices under pressure. His interiority consists entirely of generic mystical statements ("he understood now that to navigate without moving meant to become the echo itself") with no embodied contradiction or micro-choice that would reveal character particularity. The grandmother's arrowhead merging with his sternum and his "becoming the song" are asserted transformations without any on-page struggle, doubt, or visible cost that would earn the change. The prose tells us he is "historically reverent by nature" but never dramatizes what he renounces or what competing desire he must overcome.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes spatial anchors (canyon, bone towers) but offers no discernible plot causality or escalation—Cael arrives, sings, and merges with the landscape in a single uncontested sweep. There is no obstacle, complication, or choice that narrows options; the "pulse left wandering" resolves instantly when he stops moving, with no on-page cost or forfeited path. The ending asserts transformation ("became the song his people had been trying to sing") but provides no before/after difference in knowledge, capability, or stance that the reader can trace. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), closure requires visible cost; here the final image is decorative summary, not a reconfiguration with felt consequences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon, and dust are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail (the towers "hummed," dust "whispered," canyon a "throat of endless echoes"). However, setting remains postcard backdrop—none of these elements constrains a choice or alters Cael's tactics; he simply sings and the environment responds on cue. The micro-setting test (body, tool, or object constraining choice) is unmet: the arrowhead is held and later "merges" but does not shape any on-page decision with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Cael faces no failure, doubt, or competing pressure; the canyon and towers cooperate immediately when he sings. There is no escalation, no tightening, no choice that forecloses an alternative path. The resolution is unearned: he simply realizes "the wandering pulse had never been lost" without any prior on-page struggle or visible price paid. Agency (decision, renunciation, endurance) is absent; events occur to him rather than through him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (belonging, stillness, ancestral memory) is stated rather than embodied in conflict. The ending offers explicit moralizing ("he had become the echo his grandmother had sent him to find") that replaces dramatized resonance. The arrowhead, pulse, and bone towers recur but function as decorative motifs rather than images that accumulate pressure or reweight prior material—each mention repeats the same mystical claim without deepening cost or complication. The piece gestures toward profundity through elevated diction but delivers banality: "the way home was not always forward" could be pulled from a greeting card.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent elevated register, but the narrative voice converges with the mystical subject matter into a single generic "spiritual quest" idiom that lacks character-specific perception. Diction remains uniform regardless of pressure: Cael's interior voice in the opening ("rhythm that beat against his ribs") is indistinguishable from the climactic moment ("became the echo his grandmother had sent him to find"). Filter verbs ("he knew," "he understood") stack heavily in the second half without dramatized realization, dulling immediacy. No dialogue is present to assess naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "the harmonic stone skimmer" appears as a subject in nine sentences, "bone towers" in seven, "flock of birds" in four, creating a drumbeat that flattens rhythm. Synonym churn ("weathered palm," "weathered resolve," "weathered face") and stacked metaphors ("canyon of endless echoes," "throat of endless echoes," "pulse left wandering") recycle the same mystical register without advancing sense. Mixed metaphors abound: the canyon is simultaneously a throat, a vortex, and a singer, while the pulse is both wandering and anchored. The final third consists almost entirely of summary assertions ("he understood," "he knew," "he had become") rather than concrete action or image, violating the show-versus-tell contract at the story's most critical moment. High-band penalties: template cadence and paraphrase loops in closure zone trigger −1.7 adjustment and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—spiritual seeker finds mystical union with ancestral landscape—follows a well-worn template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "navigate without moving" conceit and the merging-with-nature resolution are familiar beats executed with surface mysticism rather than earned particularity. The grandmother, arrowhead, bone towers, and wandering pulse function as interchangeable quest tokens rather than irreplaceable story elements. While the prose reaches for lyric intensity, the emotional and thematic arc could transfer wholesale to any other "ancient sacred site" setting with minor noun swaps, indicating insufficient specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Cael is present throughout but makes no decisions that create turns. He walks, observes, sings, and merges—all passive reception of mystical experience without on-page conflict or agency. Introduced in the opening (setup gate met) but his role as "harmonic stone skimmer" is label-only; we never see him skip stones or use the skill to solve a problem. No middle development or closure participation via choice. Swappable with any mystical protagonist archetype. Multiple frictions: ornamental (−0.8), no causal pressure (baseline remains ≤3.0), label-only trait (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The stone arrowhead appears in paragraph three (setup met), is held throughout, and "merges with his sternum" in paragraph fourteen, then "pulsed" in paragraph eighteen (three beats). However, it never constrains a choice or enables a tactic under stress—Cael does not use it, test it, or sacrifice anything related to it. The merging is asserted transformation without visible cost. Present across beats but functionally ornamental. Two gates (setup, payoff mention) allow eligibility to ~6.0, but lack of causal pressure and swappability (any mystical heirloom could serve the same role) cap lower. Frictions: ornamental use (−0.7), no cost connection (baseline 3.0 + beat involvement +0.9 − ornamental penalty).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Pulse left wandering" is introduced in paragraph two (setup met), recurs in paragraph eleven ("the pulse left wandering finally found its source"), and again in paragraphs fifteen and eighteen. However, it functions as thematic echo rather than stake-shaping concept—it does not constrain Cael's tactics or force a trade-off. The resolution (realizing it was "his own heartbeat") is told summary, not a discovery that alters on-page options. Four mentions across the text but no causal pressure. Frictions: summary-only (−0.6), no cost (baseline 3.0 + minimal beat credit +0.4 − summary penalty).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" is stated once in paragraph six ("He was historically reverent by nature") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. We do not see him choose reverence over expedience, nor does the trait create friction or cost. Label-only mention without dramatized tradeoff. Single ornamental appearance in the middle third (setup missed, no development, no closure tie). Frictions: label-only (−0.3), ornamental (−0.8), swappable (any "respectful of ancestors" phrasing would serve), capped by missing setup at 4.6 and further reduced to floor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Appraise" appears in paragraph nine: "he appraised the canyon walls the same way, reading the strata." The action occurs once, mid-story, and does not create a turn or alter tactics—it is observational description. No causal link to the climax (singing and merging) which could proceed identically without this verb. Easily swappable with "studied," "examined," or "surveyed." Single functional beat, but no setup signal, no closure tie, and no cost. Frictions: swappable (−0.6), one beat only (+0.4), no causal pressure (baseline 3.0).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "flock of birds in flight" appears in paragraph five (teaching navigation), paragraph twelve (arrow formation), paragraph sixteen (roosted among towers), and paragraph nineteen (reading his story in the sky)—four distinct beats spanning setup, middle, and closure. However, the birds never constrain a choice or enable a specific tactic; they function as symbolic flourish rather than method. Cael does not use the birds' pattern to solve a problem or make a decision with cost. Early signal (+0.5), four beats (+1.4), closure mention (+0.3), but ornamental throughout (−0.9), no causal pressure (−0.5). Formula: 3.0 + 1.4 + 0.5 + 0.3 − 0.9 = 4.3, round down to 4.3. Adjusting for lyric-resonance allowance (early seed, final reprise, reweights stake) lifts slightly within band to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon are introduced in the opening line (strong setup, +0.7), recur in nearly every paragraph, and are central to the ending image where the towers "sang with him" (closure linkage, +1.2). The setting is irreplaceable—removing the towers and canyon would destroy the story's coherence. However, they do not constrain Cael's choices or supply resources that affect outcome; he simply arrives, sings, and they respond cooperatively. No friction, scarcity, or obstacle tied to the environment. High specificity (+0.6), but no causal pressure that narrows options. Formula: 3.0 (baseline) + 0.7 (setup) + 1.4 (three+ beats) + 1.2 (closure) + 0.6 (specificity) − 1.0 (no causal pressure applied) = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Through centuries of layered dust" and "centuries" recur throughout (paragraphs one, seven, eleven, fifteen, eighteen, twenty), but function as atmospheric backdrop rather than timeframe that tightens decisions. Cael's present-tense journey is untimed—no clock, deadline, or duration pressure. The "centuries" are thematic scale, not tactical constraint. Multiple mentions (setup met, closure present) but no urgency or cost tied to time. Frictions: ornamental (−0.7), vague/untracked time per the definition (−0.5), no cost. Baseline 3.0 + lyric-resonance early-final reprise (+0.4) − penalties = 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To learn to navigate without moving" is stated in paragraph four (setup met) and recurs implicitly when Cael "understood now that to navigate without moving meant to become the echo itself" (paragraph thirteen) and "who learned to navigate by standing still" (paragraph nineteen). The desire is told rather than dramatized—we do not see Cael attempt movement, fail, and adjust tactics. No friction between this want and a competing cost. The motivation anchors the concept but is never tested under pressure. Setup (+0.6), closure mention (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), but summary-only (−0.7), no friction (−0.5). Formula: 3.0 + 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.9 − 1.2 = 3.8. Lyric-resonance (desire shapes final image with conceptual reweighting, though no concrete cost) lifts within band to 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Weathered resolve" appears explicitly in paragraph fifteen ("In the weathered resolve of his weathered face") and is signaled through "weathered palm" (paragraph three) and the overall tone of patient endurance and ancestral duty. The tone is coherent and consistent throughout, modulating subtly from questing (opening) to realization (middle) to merger (ending), charging the final image with cumulative weight. However, the tone does not shift under pressure because there is no on-page conflict—Cael never wavers, doubts, or struggles, so the "resolve" is static mood rather than dynamic modulation. Early signal (+0.5), coherent through turns (+0.6), charges final image (+0.9), but static rather than pressure-responsive (−0.7), repeated "weathered" phrasing is template artifact (−0.3). Formula: 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.6 + 0.9 − 1.0 = 4.0. Adjusting upward for cumulative tonal weight and closure charge within band: 5.3.</comment>
