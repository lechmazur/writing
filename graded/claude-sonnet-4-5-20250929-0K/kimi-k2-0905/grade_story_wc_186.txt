<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The custodian's interior motivation is established early (proving coincidences have meaning, following her mother's path), and the retrocognitive ability provides texture. However, the protagonist's agency unfolds primarily through a quest structure rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The decision to track the shard and rekindle the lamp feels more like fulfilling a predetermined pattern than wrestling with competing desires. The final stance—becoming "the new prism"—arrives as epiphany rather than a choice forged from internal conflict with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its mosaic pattern early (pavilion → desert → pavilion), transitions are legible, and closure lands with a conceptual repricing: the custodian becomes the living prism, reweighting coincidence as refracted intention. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are present within the first paragraph. The quest structure accumulates symbolic weight through the shard recovery, and the ending image (rose light, voices folding backward) reconfigures prior material. Cost is conceptual and felt—she takes on the tower's burden—but the stakes never narrow options in a way that forecloses a visible alternative path on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion returns as a spatial anchor and sensory signature (single note "between mourning and morning"). The desert, mall husks, and Joshua tree are filtered through the custodian's perception and quest logic. The final image charges the tower setting by making it sing again. The prism itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the rekindling action (must align with Polaris, requires all shards). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, though some metaphoric density ("sky's black fabric," "thistle-blown hope") edges toward decorative in non-peak beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—rekindling the lamp to prove pattern and meaning—is signaled early and sustained. The quest deepens when the shard of hush is found fused to the child's skeleton, and the desert falling mute shows immediate cost. The lamp igniting and voices heard constitute a tightening under the Accumulative lens, reweighting the opening question. However, the protagonist's path feels preordained by coincidence rather than constrained by choices that foreclose alternatives; luck (finding the skeleton, the shard's location) enables rather than complicates resolution. Escalation reads as thematic accumulation more than narrowing agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and event: light as refracted intention, coincidence as pattern, the tower as continuity against darkness. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"patterns exist, that no fall is final"—through the rose glow and backward voices rather than statement. The prism motif evolves meaningfully (broken → reunited → custodian as living prism). Subtext operates in the child's pocketed shard, the mother's prior guidance, and retrocognition as both curse and gift. One minor slip: "no fall is final" and "patterns exist" edge close to thematic echo in the penultimate sentence, though embedded in action enough to avoid hard penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled compression ("hope in the shape of ribs," "hour's ink"). POV remains stable third-limited; the custodian's perceptual signature (retrocognitive flashes, star-path navigation) is consistent. Diction stays elevated throughout, matching the mythic-textural mode. Two slips: "retrocognition now forward-cast" in the final paragraph introduces a concept (forward retrocognition) without prior grounding, reading as convenient expansion. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she heard") cluster in the retrocognitive beats but remain voice-motivated. Psychic distance is intentionally compressed, fitting the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is ambitious with strong individual images ("fracture edges warm as if remembering light," "ringed husks of shopping malls where vines spelled unreadable names"). However, figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence of several beats without clear pattern payoff, triggering the overwriting check (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: "sky's black fabric" paired with "hole" works, but "dawn pressed its cheek to the walls" anthropomorphizes inconsistently with the pavilion's mechanical logic. Sentence openings vary well. No paraphrase loops, but elevated diction ("corroged" likely meant "corroded") and occasional register drift ("coincidence folding into sense") slightly obscure momentum in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognition, post-collapse setting, and light-as-meaning is specific and non-obvious. The prism as both literal object and metaphor for refracted intention feels earned. The child's skeleton and fused shard, the desert falling mute, and the final transformation into "the new prism" offer fresh inflections on reconstruction narratives. Risk-taking in the lyric-mosaic structure and metaphoric density is bold and mostly coherent. However, the quest framework (lost shard → recovery → rekindling) follows a familiar shape; transformation arises more from texture and voice than from a non-obvious moral calculus. The ending's conceptual repricing elevates originality without fully escaping the template's shadow.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening. Development: her retrocognitive vision locates the shard (middle beat), and she tracks it across the desert. Payoff: she fits the final shard and stands as "the new prism" in the ending. The custodian's choices—leaving the pavilion, prying the shard free, aligning the prism—drive three distinct beats. Causal pressure is moderate; the quest structure is linear, and the child's skeleton is found without obstacle. Closure linkage is strong (she becomes the prism). The role is indispensable but not irreplaceable (another seeker could follow the same arc with minor edits). Swappability and quest-template reliance hold the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: carried "in a rag pouch at her heart" in the opening. Development: aligned toward Polaris on the brass console (middle beat); the missing shard is identified as crucial. Payoff: the final shard is fitted, "edges kissed, fractures aligned," igniting the lamp and enabling the ending's voices and light. The prism is handled on the page in at least three beats, with its fractured state and reunion driving the plot. Causal pressure is strong (no lamp without all shards). Closure linkage is direct. Irreplaceability is high; the prism's specific properties (refracting starlight, requiring all shards) are essential. Cost is conceptual (the custodian takes on the prism's role). Scores high for indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: named and described in paragraph 10 as "the shard of hush, a sliver rumored to swallow sound." Development: seen in retrocognitive vision (child's palm), then found fused to the skeleton; when pried free, "the desert fell mute." Payoff: fitted into the prism to complete the lamp's ignition. The concept shapes two on-page actions with immediate sensory cost (muting the desert) and enables closure. Causal pressure is strong. Irreplaceability is high (the lamp requires this specific shard). Closure linkage is direct. The shard's unique property (swallowing sound) is dramatized, not merely labeled. Eligible for ≥7.0 due to causal work and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in paragraph 4 as "retrocognitively blessed, a curse." Development: enables two plot beats—seeing the shard in the child's palm (paragraph 11) and later hearing the tower's saved voices (paragraph 20). Payoff: described as "now forward-cast" in the ending, though this shift is asserted rather than dramatized. The trait is label-heavy ("blessed," "curse," "hot metal") and provides information rather than constraining choices with visible cost. The two visions advance plot but feel convenient (no failed attempts, no cost paid for using the ability). Swappability is moderate (another tracking method could replace it). Causal pressure is present but thin.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: stated as her purpose in paragraph 6 ("come to rekindle the lamp"). Development: the quest structure (finding the missing shard) is entirely in service of this action. Payoff: paragraph 19, "The lamp ignited, not the fierce white of warning but a soft rose," directly delivers the action and triggers the ending's voices, light, and thematic resolution. The rekindling is the story's hinge; without it, no closure. Causal pressure is total. Irreplaceability is absolute. Closure linkage is complete. The action's outcome (rose light, voices) charges the final image and validates the custodian's belief in pattern. Scores very high for indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: her mother "taught her" star paths (paragraph 6); Polaris is mentioned as "pivot of star paths" (paragraph 8). Development: paragraph 13, "tracking star paths the way her mother taught her: Orion's belt pointing west." Payoff: no direct use in the ending; the tower's "absence on the horizon" guides her return (paragraph 17), but star paths are not mentioned. The method is present in two beats and enables the desert crossing, but the mechanics (how Orion's belt works as compass) are asserted, not shown. Causal pressure is moderate (she needs to find the skeleton). Swappability is high (any navigation method could work). Closure linkage is absent. Mid-band for functional but replaceable use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: named in the opening line, "spiral stairs of the glass humming pavilion," with immediate sensory detail (fragments, skylight, humming panes). Development: paragraph 7 describes "hollow ribs vibrated with wind, making glass panes hum the single note… between mourning and morning." Payoff: paragraph 18, "dawn pressed its cheek to the walls, making them sing again, higher now, a chord of cracked crystal," and the custodian stands in "the lantern room" in the ending. The pavilion is the story's spatial anchor, returns in three beats, and its acoustic property (humming/singing) reweights at closure. Causal pressure: the lamp must be rekindled here. Irreplaceability is strong. Eligible for ≥7.0; scores high for closure charge and recurring sensory signature.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 3, "After the collapse of civilization, the coast kept no clocks." Development: the timeframe motivates the quest (tower went dark "during the Fall," no ships remain) but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The seven-night journey is mentioned (paragraph 14) but carries no urgency or tactical cost. Payoff: no temporal pressure at closure. The post-collapse setting is thematic backdrop, not a constraint that narrows options. Functional but replaceable; another historical rupture would work equally well. Swappability and lack of tactical pressure hold the score in the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 6, "to prove that coincidences have meaning, that the same star which guided her mother… now guided her." Development: the quest itself enacts the motivation; the child's walk and her return are framed as refractions of "one intention" (paragraph 21). Payoff: paragraph 22, "patterns exist, that no fall is final," delivers the thematic answer, and the rose glow promises meaning to future viewers. The motivation is declared early, shapes the quest structure, and reaches thematic closure. However, it is never dramatized as internal conflict or tested against a competing desire; no on-page friction between wanting proof and doubting it. Cost is conceptual (taking on the tower's role) but not felt as a trade-off in the moment. Mid-6s for thematic presence without choice-level friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: "thistle-blown hope" appears twice—paragraph 16 (child's ribs) and paragraph 19 (lamp's rose light). Development: tone modulates from mourning ("fragments of skylight," "collapse," "seeds of silence") through muted pilgrimage ("salt wind," "skeleton") to the ending's "soft rose" and "apology." The phrase itself charges the final image by linking the child's remains to the lamp's color. Payoff: the ending sustains fragile, persistent hope without tidy resolution. Tone coherence is strong across turns. The recurring phrase functions as both image and tonal anchor, reweighting at closure. Scores high for modulation and closure linkage, though the phrase's novelty is limited (thistle/hope pairing is not entirely fresh).</comment>
