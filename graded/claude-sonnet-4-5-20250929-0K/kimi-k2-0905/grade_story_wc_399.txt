<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The walker's motivation to preserve wisdom is consistently stated but rarely tested through embodied choice. The scar backstory and half-mask removal function as stated rather than felt constraints. Internal contradiction is minimal—the walker moves through his ritual with professional competence but no genuine struggle or mistake. The final replacement of the mask reads as completion of procedure rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the walker performs a ritual whose steps accumulate density toward a preservation outcome. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the walker completes his task and departs, having preserved the echo. However, the cost remains abstract; no on-page line shows what the walker gave up or what path was foreclosed by this act. The "echo stabilize[d]" moment asserts success without dramatizing friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet and murmuring pavilion are vividly described and recur across beats, grounding the ritual spatially. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (the thrumming synchronized with heartbeat, columns leaning toward center). The parapet's response to the walker's presence constrains his movements and charges the final touch, qualifying as micro-setting that alters tactics. The setting participates in closure when the walker touches the parapet "one final time," anchoring the clearing's integrity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wisdom's echo before it dissipates—is signaled early. Pressure is asserted ("threatening to dissipate") but never dramatized as a live clock or reversible failure. The walker's three-perimeter walk and peripheral-awareness method proceed without complication, obstacle, or mistake. The conjured clearing "manifest[s]" on schedule; no tightening or trade-off narrows options. The ritual completes without visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>A coherent theme—wisdom preserved through respectful distance and silence—emerges from the walker's method and the prophet's words. The peripheral-awareness technique and the scar as reminder of past failure support thematic resonance. However, the final image relies on summary assertion ("wisdom's echo waited") rather than a concrete, non-literal answer. The prophet's quote and the walker's understanding lean toward direct thematic statement rather than earned subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (peripheral awareness, oblique recognition). Diction is elevated and specialized ("kinetic parapet," "whisperfield calm," "consecrate") but consistent within the walker's professional register. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The prose reflects the walker's way of noticing—edges, indirection, ritual steps—creating a voice-motivated filter. Minor register drift into abstraction ("raw substance of understanding") but no disruptive breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates between longer ritual descriptions and shorter summary beats. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "peripheral awareness" recurs in functionally identical constructions across paragraphs 4, 13, 15, without added pressure. The phrase "conjured clearing" and variations loop across paragraphs 3, 7, 10, 11, 15. Template cadence in paragraphs describing the walker's method ("He walked...," "He began...," "He pressed...") creates rhythmic monotony. Figurative language is dense ("trapped moths," "cupped hands," "star by looking slightly away") but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor ("echo...vibrating...like trapped moths" conflates sound and image). Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems in Q7; artifacts touch non-closure beats but not the final image directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—a ritual specialist preserving mystical wisdom through indirect perception—draws on familiar fantasy tropes (masked ritualist, sacred space, departing prophet) without significant transformation. The peripheral-awareness method offers a fresh angle but remains abstract rather than grounded in specific lived detail or surprising cost. The walker's professional competence and the ritual's success feel pre-ordained; no bold risk-taking or non-obvious moral calculus. Emotional arc and plot could transfer to a generic temple/sacred site with minor edits, suggesting limited transformation of the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The half-masked line walker is present throughout and performs all ritual actions. Setup: introduced in opening line. Development: walks perimeter, removes mask (paragraph 12), begins consecration (paragraph 13). Closure: replaces mask and departs (paragraphs 18–21). However, no key turn or tightening traces to a specific choice the walker makes; he follows a predetermined ritual without obstacle or adaptation. The mask removal is described but does not constrain a later decision or carry visible cost. Two gates (setup, closure cameo) met but no causal pressure or middle choice. Late element? No. Swappable? Partly—"ritualist" could replace "line walker." Apply −0.5 for swappability, −0.4 for no causal turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet appears in paragraphs 2, 5, 9, 16, 21—five distinct beats. Setup: paragraph 2. Development: paragraph 5 (walker presses hand, feels paradox), paragraph 9 (responds to presence, synchronizes with heartbeat), paragraph 16 (creates harmonic anchoring the clearing). Closure: paragraph 21 (final touch, maintains integrity). The object is handled and its changing states (shift, hum, thrumming, harmonic) alter the walker's tactics and anchor the clearing. Three gates met. Causal pressure: +0.9 (multiple beats), closure linkage +0.7 (final touch), specificity +0.5 (kinetic mechanism matters). However, the parapet does not narrow options or create a visible cost—it cooperates rather than resists. No swappability penalty (unique kinetic mechanism). Band suggests ~6.3; reduce −0.5 for lack of friction or cost tied to this object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Conjured clearings are mentioned in paragraphs 3, 7, 10, 11, 15, 20. Setup: paragraph 3 (prophet spoke of them). Development: paragraph 7 (walker searches), paragraph 10 (clearing manifests). Closure: paragraph 15 (echo stabilizes within the clearing), paragraph 20 (preserved beneath visitors' feet). Three gates met. The concept shapes the walker's goal and the space where preservation occurs. However, "conjured clearing" functions more as a label for the ritual's outcome than a mechanism that alters tactics or creates friction. The clearing "manifest[s]" without cost or complication; the walker's method (peripheral awareness) does more causal work. Causal pressure: +0.4 (one beat—manifestation), closure linkage +0.5 (clearing mentioned in final summary), early signal +0.3. Swappability: −0.5 ("sacred space" could substitute). Ornamental in middle beats: −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The attribute "strangely honest" appears once in paragraph 6, describing the prophet's words. Setup: paragraph 6. Development: no middle action tied to this trait. Closure: not present. One gate (setup) met. The trait characterizes the prophet's speech but does not constrain or enable any on-page action by the walker or prophet. It is a label that colors the quote but carries no visible cost or trade-off. Missing middle and closure gates: cap 3.4 (missing middle development). Ornamental: −0.3. Late element? No (appears by first third). Swappable: yes—"direct" or "clear" could replace.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The action "consecrate" appears in paragraph 13 ("began to consecrate the space") and is developed through paragraphs 13–17 (walking edges, holding echo in periphery, creating harmonic). Setup: paragraph 13. Development: paragraphs 14–16 (method described, kinetic response, echo stabilizes). Closure: paragraph 17 ("echo stabilize[d]" as result of consecration); the preserved echo is referenced in paragraph 20. Three gates met. The consecration is the walker's primary task and drives the ritual sequence. However, the action proceeds without complication or failure; it is enacted rather than tested. Causal pressure: +0.9 (multiple beats), closure linkage +0.7 (stabilization result), early signal +0.5. Swappability: −0.3 ("preserve" or "anchor" could substitute with minor edits). No friction or cost visible: trend mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method "through peripheral awareness" is signaled in paragraph 4 and recurs in paragraphs 8, 13, 15. Setup: paragraph 4. Development: paragraph 8 (peripheral awareness absorbs pavilion architecture), paragraph 13 (consecration method: "not focusing directly...acknowledging...obliquely"), paragraph 15 (holding echo in periphery). Closure: the method enables the final stabilization (paragraph 17). Three gates met. The method is specific, irreplaceable (the walker's professional technique), and shapes his ritual tactics. Causal pressure: +1.0 (method constrains approach across multiple beats), closure linkage +0.9 (stabilization depends on this method), early signal +0.5, specificity +0.6. However, the method is described more than tested—no moment where direct focus threatens failure. No cost tied to using this method versus another.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion appears in paragraphs 1, 4, 8, 14, 20. Setup: paragraph 1 (arrival). Development: paragraph 4 (whispers growing stronger), paragraph 8 (absorbing architecture), paragraph 14 (whispers dim respectfully), paragraph 20 (daily transformation). Closure: paragraph 20 (pavilion houses the preserved echo beneath visitors' feet). Three gates met. The setting provides sensory texture (whispers, leaning columns, roof angles) and responds to the walker's ritual (whispers dim). It houses the final preserved clearing. Causal pressure: +0.5 (setting enables ritual), closure linkage +0.7 (final image locates echo here), early signal +0.5. However, the pavilion does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome—it cooperates passively. No friction or obstacle tied to this location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the prophet's arrival" appears in paragraph 1 and is referenced in paragraph 19 ("prophet had already departed"). Setup: paragraph 1. Development: dusk and dawn mentioned (paragraphs 7, 17) frame the ritual's duration, but no ticking clock tightens decisions. Closure: departure at dawn (paragraph 21) but no urgency or deadline pressure. Two gates (setup, closure timestamp). Time is tracked but does not alter tactics or create friction. The walker's ritual proceeds on his own schedule; "before wisdom's echo faded forever" (paragraph 3) asserts urgency but no on-page moment shows time running out or forcing adaptation. Missing middle pressure: cap 3.4. Ornamental timestamp: −0.4. Generic night-to-dawn frame: −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve the echo of wisdom" is stated in paragraph 3 and drives the walker's goal throughout. Setup: paragraph 3. Development: paragraphs 7, 11, 17 (search, manifestation, stabilization as steps toward preservation). Closure: paragraph 20 ("preserved through peripheral awareness"). Three gates met. The desire is dramatized through the walker's actions (search, consecration) but not conflicted—no friction between this want and another cost or fear. The scar (paragraph 12) hints at past failure but does not create present tension. Causal pressure: +0.6 (goal drives sequence), closure linkage +0.7 (preservation achieved), early signal +0.5. However, the motivation is stated more than tested; no moment where the walker risks failing or chooses preservation over another want. Told-only in places: −0.4. No visible trade-off: −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The tone "whisperfield calm" appears in paragraph 7 and colors the prose throughout with elevated, meditative diction and unhurried pacing. Setup: paragraph 7 explicitly names the tone. Development: the prose maintains a contemplative register across the ritual (paragraphs 8–16). Closure: the calm persists through departure (paragraphs 18–21). Three gates met. The tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the ritual's reverent atmosphere. However, it remains static—no modulation under pressure or tonal shift that charges the final image. The walker's task proceeds without urgency or emotional variance; calm is asserted rather than earned through tension and release. Coherent single mood: trend mid-band (~5.0). Early signal: +0.3. Closure participation: +0.3 (tone holds through ending). Static without charge: −0.4. Ornamental label ("whisperfield") used once: −0.3.</comment>
