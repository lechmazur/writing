<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lin's embodied connection to the oasis (thumb to leaf, pulse) and her decisive action with the clay hive show agency under pressure. Her motivation to "tend kindness" and restore fractured timelines is consistent, though the interiority leans heavily on abstract perception ("phototropic to kindness," "thrum inside her skull") rather than contradictory impulses. The final choice to project the lantern glass and guide "every gentle thing home" is earned, but her internal conflict remains understated—she moves through the narrative with calm competence rather than struggle. The child's introduction adds a secondary character, but the relationship remains minimal and does not pressure Lin's choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered images (hives, bees, apricot, lantern glass) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the oasis is restored through Lin's act of kindness, and memory becomes portable via the lantern glass. Orientation anchors (Lin, oasis, copper sky) arrive early. The escalation operates via density and pattern rather than causal linkage: the thrum deepens, timelines fracture, the clay hive hardens without fire, bees return. Cost is present but somewhat diffuse—Lin walks away, her footprints erasing, carrying the burden of guiding kindness forward—though the specific forfeit or trade-off remains oblique. The mosaic structure (arrival, fractured vision, clay act, restoration, departure, child's arrival) is legible, but the final third loops through multiple vignettes that restate the central image without tightening further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis is vividly rendered with specific, purposeful detail: cracked white hives, wax ghosts, honey-turned-to-ash air, the single thriving apricot tree. Sensory detail is strong and filtered through Lin's potter's perspective ("clay remembers," kiln logic). The lantern glass functions as micro-setting, its flaked silvering and sun-pattern etchings constraining Lin's method of navigation and alignment. Spatial choreography is clear across beats (stepping over hives, kneeling beneath the apricot, lifting the glass). The scorched wasteland frames the oasis as an island of potential restoration, and the environment directly enables the closure act (shadow, breeze, dew). Minor issue: the "copper sky" and "chimney smoke" recur as atmospheric anchors but remain somewhat generic; the wasteland itself lacks tactile specificity beyond "scorched."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to restore the oasis and understand why places resist change when "no one remembers how to tend their kindness." The stake is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: the thrum deepens, fractured timelines split and overlap, the clay hive is shaped, bees impossibly return, time stitches. Lin's agency (shaping the hive, aligning the glass) drives the resolution. Cost is visible but measured—she walks away, footprints erasing, carrying the lantern as a portable promise of kindness. The piece lacks a sharp reversal or tightening choice that narrows options; instead, pressure accumulates through density and cadence shift. The child's arrival extends the pattern but does not complicate Lin's path—it confirms rather than tests her choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—places and time heal through tended kindness, memory as a portable act—emerges organically from Lin's actions and the oasis's response. The final image (lantern glass projecting overlapping suns, guiding "every gentle thing home") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The apricot tree as compass, the unfired hive murmuring with unborn wings, and the child's empty jar create layered subtext. Minor slip: "Lin understood: places resist change when no one remembers how to tend their kindness" edges toward Thematic Echo, articulating the premise too directly in the character's interiority. The covenant ("memory travels forward only when carried by kindness") in the penultimate section borders on summary statement. Still, the story avoids sermon and earns its emotional aftereffect through image and gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric, contemplative, with a potter's tactile idiom ("clay remembers," "glazes in a slow kiln," "unfired hive"). POV remains third-limited to Lin; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, dipping close for sensory immediacy ("thumb to leaf," "heat of her steady pulse") and pulling back for reflective patterning. The prose carries a meditative rhythm apt for the zen-minded protagonist. Diction is elevated but consistent, avoiding register drift. Minor issue: some metaphoric density ("time stitched itself," "radiant wall between" past and future) flirts with abstraction under pressure, though it remains legible. The child's brief appearance maintains narrative stance without leaking interiority. No dialogue appears; not applicable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is ambitious but uneven. Figurative language is dense and often effective ("honey turned to ash," "leaves angled like cupped palms," "torn silk" timelines), but several sentences stack metaphors without full clarity: "She walked by following sun patterns that now lived inside her eyes, each step a thrum against the wasteland's refusal to heal" compresses three images in quick succession. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She + past-tense verb" across the middle third ("She saw," "She saw," "She knelt," "She set," "She lifted," "She tasted"), creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loop: the oasis exhaling, hives glimmering, and bees returning are restated across two paragraphs without added pressure. No major grammatical errors; syntax is clear. Information density is high, but some lines work harder on texture than propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of zen potter, fractured timelines, phototropism, and portable kindness is fresh and purposeful. The apricot tree as living compass and the unfired hive as "kiln of collective mercy" are specific, earned images. The piece avoids template plotting and commits fully to its lyric, accumulative design. However, the core emotional arc—calm restoration through tended kindness—lacks sharp friction or risk; Lin's competence and the oasis's responsive cooperation feel foreordained. The child's arrival extends the pattern but does not transform it. The story's gentleness is thematic, but the absence of internal contradiction or external resistance limits the sense of stakes. The premise (healer restores broken place through patient craft) is familiar; the execution elevates it through voice and image, but not to the point of inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lin appears immediately and drives all key turns: locating the apricot, shaping the clay hive, aligning the lantern glass, choosing to walk onward and project kindness. Her decisions (kneeling, rolling clay, lifting the glass, departing) alter tactics and enable the oasis's restoration. The "zen-minded" attribute shapes her calm, methodical approach but does not constrain her in a way that generates visible cost—she succeeds without struggle. Present in setup, middle (hive-shaping, glass alignment), and closure (departure, guiding light). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but low friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The faded lantern glass is introduced early ("carried only"), used in the middle (aligned to overlap fractured timelines, funneling light onto the clay hive), and elevated at closure (lifted higher to project overlapping suns, guiding home). Its flaked silvering and etched sun patterns constrain Lin's navigation method. The glass returns with reweighted meaning: from a map of lost continents to a tool for stitching time to a beacon of portable kindness. Three distinct beats, causal involvement, closure linkage. Specificity high (silvering, soot patterns, cracks). Minor deduction: its mechanics (how sun patterns guide navigation, how alignment stitches timelines) remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Fractured timelines" appear mid-story (Lin sees the oasis alive, then dead, "each strand insisting it was the original") and shape her key action: aligning the glass to "overlap like glazes" so "light funneled through the cracks" and "time stitched itself." The concept constrains her tactic (alignment) and charges the resolution (the oasis settles into "one luminous strand"). Present in middle and closure. Causal pressure moderate; the fracture is narrated as vision rather than dramatized as conflicting choices. Cost tied to the element is oblique—Lin must hold the pattern, but no visible forfeit appears. Setup weak (no early signal of timeline fracture); late first appearance (~40% mark). Swappability moderate; "time fracture" could be replaced with spatial or perceptual fracture.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Phototropic to kindness" is named twice: the apricot tree "phototropic to kindness drink[s] the heat of her steady pulse," and the child is "phototropic to the possibility of honey." The trait enables the tree's response (opening to Lin's touch) and frames the child's arrival, but it does not constrain Lin's actions with visible cost. It functions thematically (kindness as light, growth toward mercy) more than tactically. Present in middle and final third; no setup. Ornamental in the child's case (label-only). Moderate specificity (biological metaphor apt for a plant and growth-seeking child), but no on-page tradeoff or price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "thrum" (bee-wing vibration) summons Lin across the wasteland, deepens when she touches the leaf, splits "one moment into many," and softens "into a single clear note" when the sun prints kindness. It structures the escalation: initial call, intensification (skull vibration, fractured vision), resolution (clear note, bees return). The thrum is causally active in three beats and shapes the ending's sensory signature. However, it remains perceptual rather than a physical action Lin performs—she listens and responds, but the thrum itself is external. Present early, middle, and closure. Specificity high (bee-wing, inside skull, rhythm of calm breath). Causal pressure moderate; cost connection weak (no visible forfeit tied to following the thrum).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"By following sun patterns etched into the residual soot on the glass" is the method Lin uses to locate the apricot tree and later to walk "by following sun patterns that now lived inside her eyes." The method is signaled early (first third), used in the middle (location of tree), and internalized at closure (guiding her onward). It constrains her navigation tactic and is causally necessary to find the tree. Specificity moderate (soot etchings, light through cracks). Two beats. Closure linkage present but soft—the internalized patterns guide her departure but do not charge the final image with additional cost. Swappability moderate; any directional method (stars, compass) could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis is established immediately ("arrived at") and drives the entire narrative: cracked hives, wax ghosts, honey-ash air, the single thriving apricot tree, dew-glimmering restoration, bees returning. The setting supplies the problem (abandonment, resistance to change) and the resources (apricot, space for clay hive). It constrains Lin's choices (kneeling beneath the tree, placing the hive) and charges the final image (tree as compass, hive murmuring with unborn wings). Present in setup, middle (tree touch, hive placement), and closure (tree's leaves angled toward Lin's horizon, child's arrival). Causal pressure high; specificity high (beekeeping details, wax, dew). Cost connection moderate (Lin must leave, but the oasis itself does not exact a visible price).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"As chimney smoke flattens against the copper sky" frames the opening and recurs at closure ("As chimney smoke flattened again on a distant settlement"). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or track duration—Lin's work (locating tree, shaping hive, aligning glass, waiting for bees, tasting fruit, walking away) unfolds in unspecified elapsed time. The smoke image provides atmospheric continuity and suggests a transitional dusk, but it does not function as a live clock that alters tactics. Present in setup and closure (charged reprise). No middle development. Static rather than escalating. Swappable with any dusk or atmospheric marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lin's motivation "to understand why some places resist change" is stated directly midway ("Lin understood: places resist change when no one remembers how to tend their kindness") and demonstrated through her actions: seeking the thrum, tending the tree, shaping the hive, aligning timelines. The desire is coherent and drives her choices. However, it is told more than dramatized—no scene shows her wrestling with doubt, cost, or conflicting wants. The motivation appears in middle reflection and shapes the closure (she walks onward to tend kindness elsewhere). Two beats; causal pressure moderate. Cost connection weak (no visible friction between her desire and other needs). Late signal (no setup in first third).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Sharp gentleness" is embodied throughout: the apricot's taste ("sharp gentleness, the flavor of smoke before it flattens"), Lin's calm yet decisive actions (pressing thumb, shaping hive, smiling), the bees' return (impossibly gentle), the child's breathless following. Tone is coherent across turns, modulating between contemplative stillness (kneeling, waiting) and quiet intensity (fractured timelines, light funneling, bees circling). The oxymoron charges the final image: Lin's silhouette lifting the glass higher, projecting overlapping suns, guiding without force. Tone is consistent in setup, middle, and closure. Strong specificity (taste descriptor, gesture choices). The tone does not merely describe mood—it shapes Lin's method (gentle tending with sharp decisiveness) and the story's emotional register.</comment>
