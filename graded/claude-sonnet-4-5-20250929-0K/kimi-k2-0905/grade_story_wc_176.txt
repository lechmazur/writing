<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's shift from guilt to agency is earned through concrete embodied progression: forgiveness arrives "quiet as hoarfrost forming," tears freeze into lenses, and the final repetition of names on the tongue demonstrates embodied stake. Interior states remain specific to the character's past as bell-caster and organ-smasher. Interiority occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("technically gentle wish") but the core arc—preservation as "continuing vibration passed from one medium to the next"—feels motivated and contradictory impulses (smashing vs. preserving) act in scene. The final choice to carry voices forward forecloses the path of silence with visible cost (heavier cargo, lighter guilt).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors quickly (icebound sanctum, aurora, protagonist alone). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the rope-braiding ritual transforms the punched card's pattern into voiced memory, then the protagonist carries those names forward in speech and water. Cost is visible: "heavier by the cargo of voices," the card dissolves, and the protagonist must now repeat the names so rivers learn them. One meaningful deepening occurs when the rope lifts and voices unfold; the accumulative density (wax casting → bell → organ → rope → wind → water) reweights the stake of preservation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, aurora, ceremonial ropes, and punched card scrap constrain the protagonist's ritual and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's professional attention: "coppery ghost of old blood," "fractured lavender," "petrified incense." The rope's physical transformation from frozen to supple enables the action; the skylight and aurora modulate pressure throughout. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling at skylight, spreading card on snow, threading rope through holes). The micro-setting—rope, card, ice—functions as the crucible that makes the closure possible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve forgotten names before glacier erases them. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: entering the sanctum, warming the rope, threading it through the card's holes, and finally repeating names aloud so rivers carry them. The rope-braiding creates a tightening that narrows options (the card will dissolve; voices must now be carried forward by the protagonist). Visible cost: the protagonist is "heavier by the cargo of voices" and must continue the repetition. The escalation is accumulative—each step (forgiveness, entry, rope work, voice release, repetition) deepens the commitment with a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the transformation sequence: preservation as "continuing vibration passed from one medium to the next, never owned, only carried." The punched card → rope → aurora → voices → wind → water → protagonist's tongue progression reweights the initial stake without stating a moral. The ending offers a resonant answer: memory persists through transfer, not static encasement. Minor slip: "understanding that preservation is not a bronze bell but a continuing vibration" edges toward articulation rather than pure dramatization, though it remains anchored in the protagonist's professional past as bell-caster. The final image (repeating names so rivers learn them) carries thematic charge without overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable single first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: professional attention to wax, bronze, rope braids, and pattern. Diction is elevated and lyric ("frost-lensed skylight," "snowmelt ardor, technically gentle") but remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. Under peak stress (rope lifting, voices unfolding) the compression is purposeful and the narrator's texture holds. Minor issue: "technically gentle" appears twice without clear internal justification for the modifier "technically," reading as a prompt artifact rather than earned idiom. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close during the ritual, distant during the walk back).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "aurora pulsed like a slow heartbeat," "hoarfrost forming," "blotting paper drinks ink," "razored clarity." In peak beats (rope lifting, voices unfolding) the metaphoric load remains legible but crowds nearly every sentence without clear pattern-teaching or payoff that differentiates this density from lyric habit. Template stems recur: "I + past action" across multiple paragraphs. "Technically gentle" appears twice without motivation. Information density is strong (each line advances ritual or stake) and no paraphrase loops are present, but the sustained figurative register in a high-pressure closure beat crosses into overwriting without clear payoff for this exact density level.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting + punched-card memory + ceremonial rope braiding + glacier preservation is specific and non-obvious. The emotional truth—guilt transformed through ritual into cargo—feels earned rather than convenient. The core premise (transcribing memory through rope braids that "drink the pattern") is fresh. Minor friction: the "astronomer-priests" legend and "ceremonial rope" edge toward stock mysticism without transformation, and the aurora-as-white-flare moment reads as atmospheric convenience rather than necessary consequence. The ending (repeating names to teach rivers) is a bold, specific image that elevates the piece.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lost wax caster's professional history shapes perception (wax effigies, molten bronze, resonant skin) and the protagonist's final choice to carry voices forward in repetition rather than static preservation. The past action (smashing the master's organ) motivates the present need for forgiveness and the sanctum entry. The caster's knowledge of pattern and transfer drives the rope-threading method. Two distinct beats: forgiveness at dusk and the ritual inside. Closure participation: the final act of repeating names so rivers learn them directly mirrors the caster's prior work (pouring bronze into molds to create resonant forms). Cost: heavier cargo, ongoing repetition required.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The punched card scrap appears in three beats: finding it in ruins (backstory), spreading it on snow and threading rope through its holes (middle action), and dissolving beneath the crust as memory becomes "moving air" (closure). The card's physical properties (scalloped edges, hole pattern as phoneme syntax) enable the ritual and constrain the protagonist's method. The card's transformation from fragile paper to moving air reweights its function at closure. Cost: the card is destroyed in the process; its pattern must now be carried by wind and the protagonist's speech.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Transcribed memory shapes the stake (preserving names) and the method (holes as phonemes, rope drinking the pattern like blotting paper drinks ink). The concept appears in the punched card's function, the rope's "memory," and the final image of names repeated so rivers learn them. It alters tactics: the protagonist must warm the rope, thread it precisely, and then continue the transcription through speech. Closure linkage: memory as transfer rather than static storage. Minor friction: the concept is more thematic echo than on-page constraint; the rope's "remembering" is asserted rather than tested with visible friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" appears twice as a modifier (the protagonist's wish to preserve, and snowmelt ardor's argument with winter) but does not constrain or enable action with visible cost. The phrase reads as label rather than dramatized trait. No on-page moment where gentleness is tested against a harsher alternative or where the "technical" qualifier shapes a choice. Functional presence in tone but replaceable; removing it would not alter the protagonist's decisions or the ritual's outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Illuminate" drives the middle beat: the protagonist raises the rope whose braids were "woven by astronomer-priests to illuminate hidden correspondences" and the sanctum pylons hum, the aurora flares white, and voices unfold. The action is specific to the ritual and cannot be easily swapped. Closure participation: the illumination produces the voices that the protagonist then carries forward. Minor friction: the illumination is mediated by the rope and aurora rather than the protagonist's direct agency, so the action is enabled more than executed. Cost: the flare is temporary; the protagonist must continue the work afterward.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method (reconfiguring the rope's braids) is signaled early ("legend claimed, were first woven by astronomer-priests"), occupies the central beat (warming strands, threading frayed ends through the card's holes, crossing and twisting), and produces the closure effect (the rope lifts, voices unfold). The mechanics matter: the rope must drink the card's pattern, and each cross/twist builds the circuit. The method is irreplaceable; no other action would produce this specific transformation. Cost: the rope slackens afterward, and the protagonist must carry the voices forward through repetition. Three beats: setup, execution, payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum provides the ceremonial ropes, pylons of black ice, and aurora-lit skylight that enable the ritual. The setting's specific properties (frozen rope that must be warmed, black ice that throws fractured lavender, sub-audible hum through ice into the protagonist's ribs) constrain the protagonist's method and charge the final image. The setting is not swappable; the glacier's erasure creates the urgency, and the sanctum's tools are necessary. Closure participation: the glacial wind carries the voices southward "at the speed of melting," and the névé walk frames the final repetition. The micro-setting (rope, card, ice) functions as crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Forgiveness arrives at dusk (the horizon's last ember), the protagonist enters "at dusk," works by aurora, and exits at dawn's "first peach light." The timeframe shapes the protagonist's readiness to enter and frames the ritual as a night-long passage. The phrase "after forgiving yourself" anchors the emotional precondition but does not create a live clock that tightens decisions during the ritual. Functional framing but the time pressure inside the sanctum is not dramatized; the protagonist could have taken longer or shorter without visible cost. Closure linkage: dawn and snowmelt begin as the protagonist walks back, signaling seasonal transition that echoes the thematic arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation (preserve forgotten names before the glacier erases them) drives the protagonist's entry, the rope ritual, and the final act of repeating names aloud. The desire is dramatized through the protagonist's actions: clutching the punched card, warming the rope, threading it through holes, and then speaking the names so rivers learn them. Friction between want and cost: the protagonist becomes "heavier by the cargo of voices" and must continue the work indefinitely. The motivation is tested in the ritual (will the rope accept the pattern? will voices emerge?) and the cost is visible (the protagonist must now carry this burden forward). Three beats: setup, ritual, ongoing repetition.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" appears once in the final third ("snowmelt ardor, technically gentle, began its annual argument with winter") and coheres with the thawing emotional arc (forgiveness, tears freezing then cracking when the protagonist smiles, spring rivers learning names). The tone modulates from cold stasis (icebound, petrified incense) to warm motion (thaw water, rivers singing). Minor friction: the phrase itself is ornamental and arrives late without earlier tonal preparation for "ardor." The closing image (repeating names like thaw water) charges the tone but the label "snowmelt ardor" is not causally necessary. Lyric reprise is present but the exact phrase is replaceable.</comment>
