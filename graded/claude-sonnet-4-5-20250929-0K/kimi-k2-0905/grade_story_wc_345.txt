<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's altruistic motivation is clear and her interiority—guiding the harvest through frost-writing—shows purposeful constraint. The colonists are sketched functionally (Kai's barefoot reading, coffee-brewing) but lack contradictory impulses or embodied struggle; their collective shift from quarrel to cooperation is told rather than dramatized. The final choice (Mara's release) feels earned by her sustained effort, but the cost reads more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. Internal conflict within Mara ("why follow a ghost who might vanish") is asserted then resolved without lingering friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through recurring imagery (frost messages, watering bell, butterfly dust) and a cadence shift at closure when Mara dissolves into the nebula. Orientation anchors (Orchard Planet, twin suns, floating arches, Mara's ghost state) arrive within the first 120 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Mara's release into the nebula after orchestrating the harvest), and the cost is legible: her tether loosens, she becomes "the violet itself," a shift from individual agency to collective reserve. One minor slip: the timeline from "three seasons ago" to "years later" compresses without clear markers, but the accumulative pattern holds and the final image reweights her death as "shared life."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating rock arches, gravity-defying apple trees, and twin suns create a vivid, science-fantasy setting that directly constrains the harvest stakes (arches tilting, anti-grav seeds dying). Micro-setting detail—the watering bell's bronze rim "warm from the last human hand," chalk-dusted path, dew freezing into letters—charges tactile presence and anchors Mara's method. The nebula of respite functions both as atmospheric texture and as a conceptual constraint (slowing time for the grieving, binding Mara's spirit). Spatial choreography of the harvest (human ropes swaying, grandmothers anchoring, toddlers passing fruit) is clear and purposeful. The butterfly garden and sidewalk serve as recurring anchors that tie opening to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: save the orchards via coordinated harvest before the eclipse. The pressure tightens once—Mara's doubt ("why follow a ghost who might vanish?") forces her to prove motives through labor (knocking fruit only when hands are ready), and the final chalk message terrifies and thrills the colonists into forming human chains. The escalation is lean but clear: from messages to guided action to collective risk above cloud. Cost is visible in the image of Mara as counterweight and in her release, though the colonists' internal friction ("arguments before they formed") is suppressed by the nebula rather than dramatized. Agency belongs to Mara's orchestration and the colonists' coordinated response; no luck solves the core problem.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—collective survival as "the crop we keep replanting"—emerges through concrete action (harvest chains, bell ringing, chalk messages) rather than assertion. The watering bell recurs with shifting valence: "brambled hope" (beautiful because it hurts), then "unbrambled" at release, a tonal arc that reweights the motif. The nebula as "reservoir of respite ready to catch the next wave of grief" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how loss transforms into shared life. The final image (children feeling trust through their soles, ringing the bell) seeds ongoing practice without moralizing. One small slip: Kai's closing chalk line ("Ghost or gardener, family is the crop we keep replanting") edges toward thematic summary, but the metaphor stays rooted in orchard particulars and the letters "dried, permanent" ties it to prior action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV anchored to Mara is stable; perceptual signature (condensation at ankles, chilling slate until dew froze) is ghost-specific. Psychic distance shifts purposefully between close (Mara's doubt, her smile) and wide (the colonists' collective action, years-later epilogue). However, diction drifts into elevated register at pressure points—"altruistic pulse travel up his soles like mild electricity," "nebula of respite," "brambled hope"—that reads more authorial than character-particular. Dialogue is absent except for the chalk messages, which serve as voice-distinct action. The epilogue's shift to omniscient observer ("children who never knew her name") is clean but dilutes the intimate lens established earlier. Sentence rhythm is lyric and controlled, though some phrases ("the paradox of brambled hope, the sweetness that stings") over-explain the metaphor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"nebula of respite," "brambled hope," "gravity-defying apple trees," "butterfly-wing dust"—and while many images are vivid, the accumulation occasionally stalls momentum (e.g., "its tone brambled hope, a clang like berries caught in wire—beautiful because it hurt" over-explicates). Paraphrase loops appear: "her altruistic spirit" echoes "altruistic pulse" within two paragraphs; "share breath, share weight, share sky" then "shared anesthesia" then "shared life" cycles synonym variations. Information density is strong in the harvest sequence (human ropes, grandmothers anchoring, toddlers passing fruit), but the opening three paragraphs front-load world detail without immediate pressure. No major grammar or sequencing errors; pronoun references remain clear. The final paragraph's shift to summary voice ("Years later…") compresses time efficiently but loses the embodied texture of earlier beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ghost-as-organizer premise is familiar (benevolent haunting, collective-effort stakes), but the story transforms it through specific world logic: frost-writing as communication method, floating arches as spatial constraint, the nebula slowing time and binding altruism. The "brambled hope" motif and the watering bell's tonal shift (from hurt to unbrambled release) offer fresh inflection. The colonists' backstory (crash-landed, once quarreling) is template; the emotional arc (strangers to family) follows a well-worn path. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative lyric mode, epilogue leap) heightens thematic resonance without obscuring clarity, earning a modest within-band lift. The piece commits fully to its science-fantasy premise and follows implications (ghost as counterweight, butterfly-wing dust as pigment) without retreat, though the core emotional journey—grief channeled into service—is durable rather than surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (altruistic ghost) drives the entire narrative: she initiates the frost messages, guides the harvest by chilling stars into arrows and knocking fruit, becomes the counterweight during the final effort, and chooses release at closure. Her altruism constrains her method (she cannot hold chalk, so she chills dew; she cannot lift, so she balances) and enables the collective success. Present in setup (first paragraph), development (guiding the harvest across multiple beats), and payoff (her release into the nebula). The character's choices create all major turns; cost is visible in her dissolution and transformation into "the violet itself."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The watering bell appears in four distinct beats: left beside the path (setup), ringing itself in the breeze (Kai's response), carried garden to garden to measure rhythm (development), and rung once by Mara's farewell gust (closure). Its bronze rim "warm from the last human hand" and its tone as "brambled hope" then "unbrambled" show evolving use and charged reprise. However, the bell does not constrain a tactical choice or alter the harvest outcome; it functions primarily as atmospheric marker and thematic anchor. Strong lyric integration but mid-band causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The nebula of respite is introduced early (slows time for the grieving, binds Mara's spirit) and returns at closure (Mara becomes "the violet itself, a reservoir of respite"). It shapes one tactic on the page: calming arguments before they form during the harvest. However, its mechanics remain abstract—why does it tether altruistic spirits specifically? how does slowing time aid the harvest?—and it does not force a trade-off or narrow options. Present across all three gates but primarily thematic rather than driving on-page stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is seeded early ("to reexamine the living's trust in her") and demonstrated through Mara's method: frost messages that feel "strangely trustworthy even to her," and Kai feeling "the ghost's altruistic pulse travel up his soles." The attribute enables the colonists' cooperation (they follow her messages, form chains) but the cost—overcoming fear of ghosts—is asserted ("ghosts were feared even when they smiled") rather than dramatized in a specific refusal or hesitation. The trait constrains Mara's approach (she must prove herself through labor) and appears in the epilogue (children feel "unexplainable trust"), hitting all three gates with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reexamine" is named explicitly ("Mara had to reexamine the living's trust in her") and enacted: she tests her trustworthiness by letting the colonists "reexamine her motives through labor," knocking fruit only when hands are ready. The action drives her mid-story pivot from doubt to proof and shapes the harvest's choreography. Present in setup (the question posed), development (the labor proof), and payoff (trust internalized in the epilogue). However, the verb "reexamine" itself is somewhat abstract; the dramatized beats (knocking fruit, circling the canopy) are more memorable than the concept. Strong thematic integration, solid causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method (messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn) is signaled in the first third, used across three distinct beats (North orchard instruction, "Share breath" motto, butterfly-dust pigment finale), and its mechanics matter: Mara cannot hold chalk, so she chills slate until dew freezes into letters. The method constrains her communication (she must work at dawn when dew forms) and enables the children's participation (they add doodles). The final message's shift to butterfly-wing dust marks escalation and charges the ending. Present across all gates with clear causal pressure and visible cost (she must wait for dawn, cannot speak directly).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orchard Planet with floating rock arches is established immediately and drives the central conflict: arches tilting, anti-grav seeds dying, harvest must occur before the eclipse to save the orchards. The arches supply the spatial constraint (human ropes swaying above cloud) and the final payoff (arches sigh, right themselves, roots re-graft). The setting's specific properties (gravity-defying trees, arch wind) shape the harvest method ("one ladder alone tilts the sky"). Present in setup, development (harvest choreography), and closure (arches restored). Strong integration with stakes and tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after strangers become family" is signaled early ("strangers became family: the crash-landed colonists who once quarreled now shared roofs, songs, and surnames") and frames Mara's purpose (orchestrating collective effort among a bonded group). However, the phrase functions more as backstory context than live pressure; the harvest itself is timed to "the next eclipse," but the eclipse deadline is mentioned once without on-page urgency or countdown. The epilogue leap ("Years later") uses time thematically (continuity of practice) but not tactically. The timeframe qualifies setup and thematic payoff but lacks middle development as a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation (to orchestrate collective effort) is stated early and dramatized throughout: she writes frost messages, guides eyes with chilled stars, knocks fruit in sync with ready hands, becomes the counterweight during the harvest. The motivation is conflicted ("why follow a ghost who might vanish?") and tested (she must prove herself through labor). It drives every major turn and culminates in her release when "her altruism had found its own heartbeat in theirs." Visible cost: her individual agency dissolves into collective reserve. The desire is present across all gates with strong causal pressure and felt friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" is named explicitly ("its tone brambled hope, a clang like berries caught in wire—beautiful because it hurt") and enacted through the watering bell's progression: brambled (beautiful but painful) → unbrambled (pure release). The tone—bittersweet, elegiac, purposeful—coheres across the narrative and charges the final image (Mara's dissolution as both loss and gift). The bell's sound modulates with pressure (fear loosens, purpose tightens) and the ending offers tonal resolution without sentimentality. However, the phrase "brambled hope" is somewhat ornamental; the tonal work is carried more by image and rhythm than by the label itself. Strong lyric integration with closure.</comment>
