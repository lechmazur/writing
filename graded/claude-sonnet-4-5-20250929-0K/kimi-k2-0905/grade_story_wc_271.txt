<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong interior contradiction operates throughout: the narrator simultaneously holds grief and seeks daily return, maps pain onto plant names while trying to dissect trauma for mercy. Embodied emotion is concrete—"cold sweat," resin "like incense and iodine," tears that "salt the soil"—and avoids therapy-speak labels in peak moments. The final renunciation (releasing the photograph) is earned by the somatic-mapping ritual and carries visible cost: trading the physical token for a resin-sealed memory. Minor slip: "quietly talented" reads as a label rather than shown constraint until the somatic markers dramatize it late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the narrator enacts a covenant to "live as the trees live, damaged yet upright," releasing the photograph with visible cost and replacing physical token with embodied ritual. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered sensory anchors and the final cadence shift ("air tastes not of metal but of possible mornings") reweights the grief-optimism stake. Orientation is immediate (arboretum, dusk, sole survivor). One meaningful deepening occurs when the photograph is pressed to bark and released, foreclosing the daily unfolding ritual with felt cost. The lens holds without contradiction; causality is woven through repeated visits and the somatic exercise paying off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The arboretum charges every choice: outer path "where soil is thin," iron railing, dragon's-blood pine all serve as physical anchors for the somatic-mapping ritual. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—eucalyptus, resin, salt—recurring to constrain the grief-management method. The final act (pressing photograph to bark, releasing it seaward) depends on the setting's verticality and the tree's resin properties. Micro-setting (body as landscape: collarbone, wrist, temple) also functions as constraint. Spatial choreography is clean throughout; the setting drives the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"anchor optimism in realism"—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the somatic-mapping ritual tested against escalating grief. One meaningful deepening: the narrator moves from carrying the photo as ticket to releasing it, a choice that forecloses the daily unfolding with visible cost. Agency is renunciation with on-page price (the photograph rips away). Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift and final covenant reweight options. No requirement for multiple reversals at this length; the single tightening is sufficient and the cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars—grief as coastline, trees as model for damaged survival, pearl of stillness—without thesis statement. The final image (hand on resin-sealed bark, covenant spoken aloud) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: memory embodied in living matter rather than crumpled paper. Subtext operates in the contrast between "quietly talented" (public perception) and the narrator's private pain-mapping. The somatic markers return with reweighted meaning at closure, constraining the final choice. No moralizing; the piece resists tidy resolution while landing a clear thematic reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: the narrator notices plant names, resin smells, and translates trauma into botanical taxonomy. Psychic distance tightens under pressure ("I think: grief is not a landmine…") without filter-verb clutter. Diction remains voice-consistent—slightly elevated but character-plausible for someone who learned Latin names as coping mechanism. Minor slip: "quietly talented because I can name every plant" reads as self-diagnostic rather than shown contradiction until the somatic exercise demonstrates it. Purposeful compression in final lines ("diligence begins") fits the earned shift. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance both image and internal state. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the freeze-exercise beat and breathing in the final covenant. Minor template cadence in mid-section: three consecutive "I think" / "I [verb]" openers create a drumbeat that slightly flattens momentum before the climax. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent—"blast as red chrysanthemum" works, "drone as distant heron" is apt—though "red chrysanthemum opening" and "gulls quarrelling" in the same beat risk metaphor pile-up. No loops or scaffold; syntax modulates with pressure. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—somatic body-mapping as grief ritual, arboretum as both setting and method—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of trauma imagery (drone to heron, blast to flower) through the freeze exercise offers a fresh angle on PTSD narrative without gimmickry. Risk-taking in the lyric density and the choice to release the photo rather than preserve it heightens stakes. Minor proximity caution: "pearl of stillness" and "damaged yet upright" read as polished coinages that could trend generic, but here they're earned by the plant-mapping conceit. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Survivor status frames the entire piece (setup immediate), drives the daily ritual and somatic-mapping method (development across multiple beats), and the final covenant explicitly references survival ("quietly talented survivor learning the arithmetic of continuation"). The wedding-strike detail seeds the specific trauma that the freeze exercise dissects. Causal pressure: the survivor guilt motivates the return visits and the need to transform memory. Closure linkage: the covenant to "live as the trees live" is the survivor's answer. Irreplaceable: the specific loss (wedding, Nadia, drone) cannot be swapped without losing the weight of the freeze-imagery beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Photograph handled in four distinct beats: carried as "ticket" (setup), Nadia's fractured face described (early middle), pressed against bark to transfer image (penultimate), released to wind (closure). Each use advances stakes: from talisman to archive to renunciation. Causal pressure: the daily unfolding ritual structures the narrator's visits; letting it go forecloses that path with visible cost. Closure linkage: the release is the decisive act that enacts the covenant. Specificity: the crumpled, fracture-creased state matters; a pristine photo would not carry the same erosion-versus-persistence weight. Indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" appears in three moments: Nadia's joy in the photo, the freeze-exercise instruction, and the final covenant. It reweights from passive observation (Nadia's captured moment) to active method (stillness as microscope) to embodied practice (keeping stillness at the core). The concept shapes the freeze tactic—pausing to dissect rather than flee—and charges the ending by naming what the narrator will carry forward. Not just thematic echo; it enables the transformation of trauma imagery. Lyric reprise with cost: the narrator must practice stillness rather than flee or collapse. Eligible for mid-6s on two-gate + strong reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" is named early and explained (plant names as somatic markers), but the trait itself doesn't constrain a choice until the final beat when the narrator uses the mapped names to anchor the covenant. It's more explanatory frame than active force across beats. The talent is dramatized in the narrator's ability to recite Latin names and map them to body parts, but no moment where the talent itself creates friction or cost. Present in closure (somatic markers glow "each a small lighthouse") but the attribute label could be replaced with "grief-mapped" without structural loss. Functional but mid-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Freeze" is introduced as the invented exercise, demonstrated in the long dissection beat (drone to heron, blast to chrysanthemum, screams to gulls), and its logic shapes the entire arc: not fleeing but dissecting for mercy. The freeze method enables the narrator to hold trauma long enough to transfer it (photograph to bark) and release the token. Causal pressure: the exercise is the means by which optimism is anchored in realism. Closure: the covenant to keep stillness at the core restates the freeze as permanent practice. Irreplaceable: no other action (e.g., "remember," "honor") carries the specific stop-and-examine mechanics that justify the transformation imagery. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Somatic markers are seeded early ("mapping them against the hollow places in my body"), used in the freeze beat ("three scents, three seconds, three somatic anchors"), and return charged at closure ("eucalyptus at my collarbone, pine at my wrist, lavender at my temple—each a small lighthouse"). The method constrains the narrator's grief management: pain must be localized and named to be paused. Mechanics matter: pressing thumb to scar, inhaling three scents, mapping plants to body parts. Specificity: "somatic" is clinical but here becomes physical practice. Closure: the markers replace the photograph as the carried system. All three gates; strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Arboretum on cliff is established immediately, supplies the plant collection that the narrator maps to body (development), and the dragon's-blood pine and iron railing anchor the photograph-transfer and release (closure). The setting's verticality (cliff, sea below) enables the final act of releasing the photo seaward. The outer path's thin soil and exposed roots mirror the narrator's fragility. Proximity to the sea provides the sensory anchors (salt, basalt, tide) that structure the somatic exercise. The "after the lighthouse keeper" frame charges the arboretum as self-sustaining witness. Essential: no other setting would provide the convergence of plants, resin, verticality, and tidal rhythm that the closure requires.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper" is setup flavor and recurs in the final metaphor ("each a small lighthouse after the last lighthouse keeper"), but the timeframe doesn't constrain tactics or create urgency. The narrator's visits are habitual ("every dusk") but no clock tightens decisions within this visit. The historical frame (lighthouse outlived, wedding strike in past) is backdrop, not active pressure. The timeframe could be "after the war" or "after the collapse" with similar effect. Present in closure metaphor but ornamental to the choice structure. Functional but highly replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation—"anchor optimism in realism"—is stated early and dramatized through the freeze exercise (facing trauma without denial) and the daily return ritual (insisting tomorrow matters). Internal conflict is visible: the narrator wants to believe in "possible mornings" while honoring "yesterday's shrapnel." Friction: the need to hold both memory and hope creates the somatic-mapping method as compromise. Closure: the covenant to "live as the trees live" enacts the anchored optimism with visible cost (releasing the photograph). The motivation is tested and answered on the page; the price is the daily work of mapping and the forfeiture of the physical token. All three gates; strong causal and cost linkage.</comment>
