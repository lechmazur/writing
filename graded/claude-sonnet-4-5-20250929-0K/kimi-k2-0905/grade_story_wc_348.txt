<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's grief and professional identity are concretely embodied through her polymer-chemist lens and tactile interaction with the chrysalis. The choice to translate absence into resonance is earned by the fusion of guilt ("refusing the final call") and professional expertise. Interiority is mostly specific, though "loosened grief slipping down her cheeks" edges toward stock embodiment. The atonement arc forecloses passivity with visible cost—she builds sculptures and surrenders them—but the final renunciation could press harder against her control.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara releases the sculptures, transforming private grief into public instrument, and walks away with "pockets empty," forecloing ownership with felt cost. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through braided images (river, chrysalis, polymer lattice, laughter) that converge in the ravine installation. Orientation anchors early (chemist, ravine, sister's death). One meaningful deepening occurs when insight surfaces ("the chrysalis was not empty; it was a mold"), narrowing her path from scattering ashes to casting presence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The braided ravine constrains and charges every major choice: it teaches the lattice insight ("where two filaments touched, a third arose"), provides the chrysalis husks, and becomes the installation site that reweights separation into connection. Micro-setting—shale, islands, confluence—guides spatial choreography clearly. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("sun-warmed boulder," "river foam patterns," "glowing shells"). The final image of sculptures pulsing "like a colony of bioluminescent insects" fuses environment and closure without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translate separation into connection, atone for the refused call—is signaled early and tightens when Mara's lab work materializes the ravine insight into tactile sculpture. One meaningful reversal: the insight that "the chrysalis was not empty; it was a mold" narrows options from passive scattering to active creation. The final act (placing sculptures, walking away) is protagonist-driven with visible cost (surrendering control, "pockets empty"). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no second reversal is required at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—grief as material to be rewoven, separation as temporary braid—emerges through concrete particulars (polymer chains, river foam, resin lattice) without thesis statement. The final image answers the central question non-literally: sculptures "pulsed like a colony of bioluminescent insects, each beat a reminder that separation is only a temporary braid, ready to rejoin." Minor slip: the closing line's explicit gloss ("proof that polymers of memory can be rewoven") edges toward overt moralizing, though it remains integrated with the chemist POV. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing chrysalis to ear, pocketing it "luminous with purpose").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Mara's perceptual signature—polymer-chemist idiom ("foam-templated resin," "micro-actuator," "440 hertz, concert pitch")—anchoring voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("half expecting a heartbeat") to wider framing at closure. Minor density issue: some figurative language clusters without tight function ("paper-thin shell catching the light like a translucent fingernail" is vivid but ornamental in the opening). Diction remains within POV lexicon; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the lab and ravine beats. However, figurative language saturates many sentences without pattern-teaching payoff—"grief itself had pupated," "loosened grief slipping down," "fossilized moonlight," "moonlight loosens its grip"—reducing propulsion in peak moments. Template cadence appears in the camper sequence: "a canon that rose," "laughter, a recipe, a bark," "palms pressed to glowing shells, eyes closing." The closing paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("proof that polymers of memory can be rewoven into bridges stronger than the original loss") tells what the image already showed, flattening the final beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—polymer lattice design meets river foam insight meets audio-embedded sculpture—is specific and non-obvious, growing from Mara's dual expertise and the ravine's teaching. The resin that "sang at 440 hertz" and the micro-actuator triggered by human warmth avoid template grief-processing. Risk-taking (public installation, walking away) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Small deduction: the closing line's explicit moral ("proof that polymers of memory can be rewoven") retreats slightly from the boldness of the sculptures themselves, settling for stated wisdom over image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices create all key turns: tracing foam patterns yields the lattice insight, synthesizing resin embodies it, and placing sculptures then walking away enacts atonement with visible cost. Her chemist lens enables the solution and shapes perception throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The chrysalis appears in four distinct beats—opening handling, insight moment ("not empty; it was a mold"), lab casting, and final large sculpture placement—and its meaning evolves from husk to template to resonant vessel. Removing it would collapse the story's causal spine and symbolic closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Divergent path" is signaled early ("she needed a divergent path that could braid separation back into connection") and shapes the central stake, but it functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint. The braiding metaphor drives image and insight but does not directly narrow on-page choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" is illustrated ("the ravine sang around her—water slapping rock, cicadas rising and falling—symphonically minded, the way her sister used to hum") and motivates the 440-hertz tuning, but it does not constrain a high-pressure choice with visible cost. The trait enriches voice but remains closer to characterization than plot driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Atone" is the engine: guilt over the refused call drives synthesis, sculpture-making, and final surrender. The action is irreplaceable—swapping it would erase Mara's internal conflict and the story's moral weight. It shapes two major turns (insight, installation) and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The insight ("where two filaments touched, a third arose") is signaled in the ravine sequence, shapes the lab resin design ("foam-templated resin, stirring until the mixture sang"), and its mechanics (lattice that holds absence) directly enable the sculptures. Removing it would break the causal link from observation to creation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ravine teaches the lattice pattern, provides chrysalis husks, and becomes the installation stage where Mara enacts closure by releasing the sculptures. Its braided structure is indispensable to both the insight and the final image; spatial micro-settings (islands, shallows, confluence) guide all major choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"As the pieces fall into place" frames the insight beat and the closing line, but time does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The phrase is more metaphorical cadence than tracked pressure; removing it would not alter causality or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Translate separation into connection" is the dominant stake, dramatized through scattering failure, lattice insight, audio embedding, and public installation. It drives every major choice and the final renunciation (walking away with "pockets empty"), with visible cost in surrendered control.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Loosened grief" modulates coherently from "knees trembling, loosened grief slipping down her cheeks" through lab focus to the final reflective wonder ("her own loosened grief reflected back as wonder"). The tone charges the closure image—grief as material loosened from private paralysis into public flow—without flattening into single mood.</comment>
