<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as witness is established and her agency drives the descent, but interior contradiction remains thin—her choice to descend reads as compelled by discovery rather than genuinely conflicted desire. The tapping ritual creates character texture, yet the core tension between documenting loss and pursuing hidden invitation never manifests as simultaneous opposing impulses in a single beat. Embodied emotion is present (eel waking in chest) but much interiority leans abstract ("delayed revelation," "assembly of clues"). The final realization about her role shifts understanding but doesn't foreclose a live path with visible cost; she resumes the same tapping practice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by paragraph two (Mira, station, post-ban lagoon). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: clues gather (hollow metal, atlas page, sonar taps, submerged ruins) and the descent deepens mystery through sensory intensification until the hologram reweights her witness role. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—her task was never proof but memory-keeping for regrowth—with the cost felt in the sealed atlas page and her resumed vigil. One meaningful deepening occurs (clues → dive → pillars → hologram), though the protagonist's agency in that sequence is more reactive than decisive. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The station on stilts, lagoon, thermocline, and limestone ridge are rendered through vivid, POV-filtered detail (white mantis, green tunnels, ceremonial stairs). The hydrophone and submersible function as micro-setting tools that enable the descent and constrain choice. The final image of the station as "gate left ajar" charges closure by reweighting the sentinel motif established early. Sensory selection reflects urgency underwater while the opening grants breathing room. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from ladder to sub to seafloor to pillars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering the hidden path) signals early and tightens once through the dive decision. The summons ("assembly of clues") compels rather than forces a trade-off; Mira's agency is more receptive than conflicted. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hologram reframes her role, narrowing understanding from documentation to memory-stewardship. The cost is conceptual (sealing the page, accepting the vigil) and legible but not a visible sacrifice of a live alternative. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is present but modest; no major reversal tests commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—witness as keeper of hidden return-paths, not mere recorder of loss—emerges through concrete images: dead reefs, torn atlas, tapping code, stone pillars. The hologram sequence delivers the thematic insight without overt statement, and the final tapping resumes with reweighted meaning (gate left ajar). Subtext operates in the cyclical ritual and the silent collaboration between vanished mapmaker and current witness. The ending offers a resonant answer (witness keeps time for regrowth) that reweights prior grief particulars. Minor slip: "delayed revelation" and "periodically eternal" read as prompt-label echoes rather than fully dramatized stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable with Mira's perceptual signature (coral through dive mask thick with tears, eel waking in chest). Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, consistent with a lyric-inflected witness voice. Purposeful compression (fossil fuel ban, vanished reef, satellite charts) anchors efficiently. Two register slips weaken peak moments: "assembly of clues" and "periodically eternal" feel imposed rather than voice-native. No dialogue present. Psychic distance modulates appropriately between reflective opening and urgent descent. Free indirect style is clean, though some syntactic patterns repeat (participial openers, em-dash asides).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent (white mantis, broken teeth, gull with broken wing, green tunnels, drifting moored specter) but occasionally stacks without breathing room, risking overwriting in the descent paragraphs. Two paraphrase loops: "practice of tapping rhythms" appears nearly identically in paragraphs three and fifteen; "drifting moored" recurs as both attribute and image without clear progression. Template cadence in the middle third (multiple sentences open with participial phrases or "she [verb]"). Information density is strong; most lines advance discovery or deepen atmosphere. Clarity holds despite lyric compression. No grammar errors or pronoun ambiguity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of reef-loss witness, hidden underwater archive, and sonar-summons creates a specific, non-obvious frame. The tapping code as cross-temporal communication and the atlas-page-as-key are fresh inflections on memory-keeper tropes. Emotional truth in grief-and-invitation tension elevates above template. Two frictions: the hologram-projection mechanism arrives late and resolves the mystery it did not help create; "periodically eternal" and "delayed revelation" feel like imposed prompt labels rather than organic story language. The concept commits fully and the final image (gate left ajar, resumed tapping) feels earned, though the underwater-temple reveal leans toward familiar lost-civilization motifs.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her witness role frames the narrative. She appears in setup (opening paragraphs), makes the dive decision (middle), and resumes vigil (ending). Her choices—lowering the sub, inserting the atlas page—create key turns, though they read more as responses to summons than internally conflicted agency. The final realization about her role reweights prior material but does not foreclose a visible alternative path. Two beats (dive decision, page insertion) plus closure participation with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The atlas page is discovered early (paragraph six), motivates the dive (paragraphs nine and fourteen), functions as physical key (paragraph twenty), and is sealed into the pillars at closure (paragraph twenty-two). It appears in four distinct beats with escalating function: clue → anchor → summons → key. Its cartographic specificity (Path 27, blank blue square) matters, and the final sealing charges the ending by making memory-keeping irreversible. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the object could not be trivially replaced.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Delayed revelation shapes the premise (hidden reef, forgotten map, returning sound) and is named explicitly in paragraph nine. It structures the middle as accumulation of clues and pays off in the hologram's teaching (paragraph twenty-two: "why some paths disappear"). The concept alters Mira's understanding but not her on-page tactics during the dive itself; she follows the summons linearly. Present in setup (missing reef memory), middle (assembly), and ending (hologram explanation), but more thematic than pressure-driving. Moderate specificity; the delay is conceptual rather than a live constraint that narrows choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears twice as label: paragraph four (tapping habit) and paragraph twenty (pillars' cadence). It describes the recurring rhythm but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. The trait is thematic decoration rather than a causal lever; removing it would not alter plot logic or stakes. Late explicit appearance (paragraph twenty) though the tapping itself is seeded early. Ornamental use with no demonstrated tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Assembly occurs in paragraph nine ("assembly of clues—missing reef, missing map, returning sound—was a summons") and again in paragraph twenty-two (hologram assembles the reef from stored data). The first instance triggers the dive decision; the second delivers thematic payoff. Two beats, both functional, but the action is more conceptual realization than physical assembly with visible cost. The dive and page-insertion are the causal hinges; "assemble" as verb matters less than the resulting understanding. Present in setup (implied gathering), middle (explicit summons), and ending (hologram), but swappable with "recognize pattern" or "decode invitation" without major structural change. Moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tapping appears in paragraph three (introduction), paragraph ten (practice again to wake batteries), paragraph eleven (sonar returns the pattern), paragraph twenty (pillars echo the cadence), and paragraph twenty-four (resumed vigil). Five distinct beats across setup, middle escalation, and closure. The method enables station operation, identifies the sonar summons, confirms the pillar site, and charges the ending by resuming the cycle. Mechanics matter: three short, two long is specified and matched by the underwater response. Strong closure linkage; the practice frames and closes the arc with reweighted meaning. Could not be trivially swapped.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The station is anchored early (paragraphs one–three) and provides the ladder, instrument room, radio, hydrophone, and submersible—tools that enable the descent. It returns at closure (paragraph twenty-three) as "gate left ajar," reweighting its sentinel role. The setting constrains choices (single-person sub, limited resources) and its stilted isolation pressures Mira's solo investigation. Three beats: opening anchor, middle resource use, ending image transformation. Environment shapes tactics and charges the final picture. Strong presence but the underwater ridge does more causal work in the middle; the station itself is more frame than active constraint after paragraph ten.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The post-ban timeframe is established in paragraph two and colors the world (sky breathes without smoke, dead reefs, supply boats rare). It provides thematic context—Mira's witness role began "the year the bleaching began"—but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The descent and discovery unfold without time pressure; the clock is not live. Present in setup and woven through memory but passive backdrop rather than active constraint. Functional context, replaceable with minor edits (e.g., "after the collapse," "in the recovery era").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's desire to understand "why some paths disappear" is stated in paragraph nine and answered in the hologram (paragraph twenty-two: "teaching her why some paths disappear: they are not erased but hidden"). The motivation frames the dive but is not visibly conflicted with competing wants or costs. She pursues discovery without friction; no scene tests whether curiosity might endanger her or foreclose another goal. Present in setup (witness role, memory of vanished reef), middle (summons recognition), and ending (answer received), but told more than dramatized through choice-under-pressure. Moderate causal role; the descent is compelled by assembled clues rather than urgent personal need.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" appears in paragraphs fifteen and twenty-three, framing the station as both anchored and floating—captured in the title phrase. Tone throughout balances lyric suspension (white mantis, green tunnels, elliptical time) with concrete sensory grounding (tapping, silt, limestone). The mood modulates subtly: reflective opening, gathering urgency in the dive, wonder at the hologram, quiet resumption at closure. Coherent through turns and the final image ("gate left ajar") charges with the tone's duality. The phrase itself reads somewhat imposed (prompt-label feel) but the tonal effect it names is embodied consistently. Strong thematic fit, moderate causal pressure.</comment>
