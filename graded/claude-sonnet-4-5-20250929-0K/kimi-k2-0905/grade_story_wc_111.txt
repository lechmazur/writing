<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's devotion is embodied through specific gestures (polishing marbles, reading the garden's shifts), and her final understanding that "the garden and the gardener had been dancing together" represents earned acceptance. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract meditation ("she understood," "she knew") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The marbles function as memory tokens but her relationship to them remains contemplative rather than pressured by internal conflict. The ending shift feels thematically announced rather than forced by on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through accretive detail (marbles, garden's responses, the impossible apple) toward a final reconfiguration where Elara recognizes mutual servitude. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (conceptual repricing of who serves whom), with the cost legible in her acceptance of permanent partnership rather than mastery. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The 0.03% luck score and garden's response provide one meaningful tightening that reweights the stakes, though the pressure accumulates through pattern rather than causal escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The garden maze functions as active setting: hedges shift to create new pathways, walls part to reveal the hidden grove, and the maze rearranges itself into a direct path at the end. The impossible apple tree and the ancient glove both constrain and enable Elara's choices, charging the final sequence. Sensory detail (spider silk cloth, morning dew, water lilies in perfect symmetry) is filtered through Elara's professional attention. The environment's responsiveness to her 0.03% day directly shapes the closure by demonstrating the garden's knowledge of her.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is proving the garden knows its gardener, signaled early and sustained throughout. The 0.03% luck score creates one meaningful pressure point: the garden immediately responds by revealing the impossible apple, forcing Elara to confront the reciprocal nature of their relationship. The final recognition—that neither leads, both dance—forecloses her belief in mastery with visible cost (relinquishing control). However, escalation operates through accumulative revelation rather than narrowing tactical choices under rising pressure. The garden's cooperation ensures Elara faces no genuine opposition, only deepening understanding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of symbiotic service emerges through concrete particulars: the marbles commemorating small victories, the garden's autonomous responses, the impossible fruit on the lowest-luck day. "Broken things, properly polished and cherished, become maps to impossible futures" integrates the marble motif with thematic weight without stating a moral. The final image of Elara raising her gloved hand in farewell—while understanding she's not leaving—offers a resonant answer to the central question of mutual recognition. The piece avoids overt philosophizing, letting the garden's gifts and Elara's rituals carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with perceptual signature filtered through Elara's professional attention (noting hedge shifts, soil-borne secrets, bloom states). However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at peak moments: "ancient negotiation between human intention and vegetative will," "understanding of probability transcended human mathematics." The prose texture relies on repeated sentence stems ("She understood," "Elara understood," "she understood then") that flatten voice under pressure. Psychic distance remains consistent but the diction occasionally exceeds what the focalizer would frame mid-crisis. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and scaffold phrases recur: "She understood" appears five times, often opening consecutive beats with similar syntax. Template cadence runs through the middle section with parallel "The [noun] [verb]" constructions. "Commemorating small victories elaborately" repeats verbatim across three paragraphs without variation. Mixed metaphor in "blooming withering cycle of giving and taking" blurs the vehicle. Information density is moderate; several lines restate the mutual-service theme without advancing situation. Figurative language ("forgotten promises," "constellation of broken memories") appears in most sentences of key beats without clear payoff, approaching overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The inversion of gardener-as-servant offers a fresh angle on cultivation narratives, and the measurable-luck premise creates an intriguing frame. However, the emotional arc—decades of devotion rewarded by mutual recognition—follows a familiar template of earned harmony without meaningful subversion. The marbles, rituals, and garden's sentience combine logically but feel assembled to demonstrate the theme rather than organically pressuring Elara. The impossible apple and ancient glove arrive as symbolic gifts rather than complications she must navigate with cost. Specificity (wisteria coaxed by moonlight, tomatoes taught to dream) elevates texture but does not transform the arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara signals early (title character, opening line) and anchors every beat. Her actions—kneeling, polishing, picking the apple, gathering marbles, accepting the glove—drive the sequence. However, her choices do not create reversals or foreclose paths; the garden guides and gifts without opposition. She passively receives revelation rather than deciding under conflicting pressures. Her final understanding reweights meaning but arrives through contemplation, not a choice that alters tactics. Present across all three gates but more observer than active decider.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The marbles appear in beats 3, 7, 13, 16, and 20: early setup, ritual polishing, constellation around the tree, gathering warmer marbles, placement in the glove. Their cracked surfaces carry specific memories (wisteria, tomatoes, the deception) and evolve from commemorative tokens to "maps to impossible futures." They shape the ritual and charge the closure by being placed in the ancient glove, creating a new practice. However, they enable reflection more than constrain choice; Elara could perform the same arc without them with minor edits. Strong reprise but replaceable in causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "mended deception" is named once in beat 6 ("her greatest deception: the garden believed she was its master") and echoed thematically in the ending's mutual-service recognition. It does not create tactical pressure or narrow options on the page; Elara contemplates the concept rather than acting to repair or sustain a lie. The garden's knowledge of her already exists, so no mending occurs in scene. Present as thematic claim but not as a stake that shapes beats or closure participation. Swappable with "long-held illusion" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic" is attributed to the garden in beat 9 as a label: "this place wisely pragmatic, knowing that every pruning cut... was part of an ancient negotiation." The phrase does not constrain or enable a choice with cost; it summarizes Elara's interpretation of the garden's behavior. No on-page tradeoff or tactical consequence flows from this trait. The garden's responsiveness (shifting hedges, revealing the grove) could be described with any number of adjectives without altering the action. Label-only mention, no middle development or closure link.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Polish" is central to Elara's morning ritual (beat 7) and threads through her relationship with the marbles: she polishes each one with spider-silk cloth, they become warmer after contact with the tree, and their "properly polished" state is named in the thematic line about broken things. The action signals early and participates in closure when she places the polished marbles in the glove, establishing a new ritual. However, the polishing itself does not create a turn or narrow options; it expresses devotion rather than forcing a choice. Present in three beats, ritual role, but swappable with "tends" or "honors."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The method is named explicitly in beat 3 ("commemorating small victories elaborately—the marbles, the rituals") and demonstrated through the marble ritual (beats 7, 13, 16, 20). It shapes Elara's daily practice and is reweighted in beat 16: her elaborate commemorations "had been her way of mending the deception." The final placement of marbles in the glove continues the method. Signaled early, referenced in the ending, but the mechanics remain static description; the commemorations do not constrain attempts or force tactical adjustments under pressure. Lyric reprise with thematic charge but no causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The garden maze is present from the opening line and actively pressures choices throughout: hedges shift to create new pathways (beat 8), walls part to reveal the hidden grove and impossible apple (beat 10), the maze rearranges into a direct path to the glove clearing (beat 19), and walls close behind Elara as she walks toward the gate (beat 22). The environment supplies resources (apple, glove) and demonstrates knowledge of Elara on her 0.03% day, directly proving the story's motivating claim. Essential across setup, development, and payoff; removing the maze's autonomy would collapse the proof of mutual recognition.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after luck becomes measurable" is established in beat 2 and provides the 0.03% score that triggers the garden's response. However, the measurable-luck system does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; it functions as conceptual backdrop. Elara's actions (polishing, walking, picking) proceed without clock pressure or deadline. The luck score enables one plot point (the garden's demonstration) but does not constrain her choices or create escalating urgency. Present in setup and linked to one middle beat, but no closure participation and no tactical consequence from the passing of time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that gardens know their gardeners" is dramatized through Elara's rituals and the garden's responses: the impossible apple on her lowest-luck day (beat 10), the ancient glove that fits her hand (beat 19), and her final acknowledgment of mutual recognition (beat 23). However, the desire is not conflicted; Elara seeks confirmation and receives it without friction between wants and costs. The garden cooperates rather than resists, so the proving happens through revelation rather than struggle. Present in setup and payoff, with thematic weight, but no on-page obstacle that forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tone "blooming withering" threads through the piece: "withered vine dresser," "withered hands," "withered rose arbor," "blooming withering cycle of giving and taking." The pairing charges the imagery (yesterday's blooms as forgotten promises, the impossible apple on the dying garden's terms) and modulates with the accumulative pressure—early decay images give way to the perfect apple, then return in the "eternal conversation" frame. The dual tone supports the mutual-service theme and is coherent through turns. It charges the final image of Elara returning with "new marbles to crack and polish," fusing growth and entropy in one gesture.</comment>
