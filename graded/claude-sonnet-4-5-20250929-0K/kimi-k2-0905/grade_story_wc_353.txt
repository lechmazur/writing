<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ilay's motivation is clear and consistent—symphonically minded, driven to restore music—and her embodied actions (ear to wood, breath matching pulse) show empathy in motion. Internal experience differs from external behavior in purposeful ways (she trembles but does not cheer). However, the piece lacks genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; her path is smooth and unopposed, with no meaningful struggle or foreclosed alternative that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through mapped cracks, strumming progression, and grove's answering resonance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the insulator glows and the world becomes "conversation." Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~80 words. The closure reweights the premise with felt cost (trembling knees, spell that mustn't break), and the lens holds. One meaningful deepening—from mapping to sound to grove-wide symphony—is sufficient for this length, though the cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove, porcelain insulator, and dulcimer carved from the same grove constrain Ilay's method and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "needles shiver, sap rises," "moss brightens from dusted gray to living jade." The insulator's weight "no more than a robin's egg" and the crack "shaped exactly like the siskin's wing" are specific and purposeful. Micro-setting (wood, wire, insulator) alters tactics and the ending's resonance, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore music to a silent world—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: mapping cracks → strumming → grove joins. The final image shows a cost (trembling, spell-breaking restraint) and the world reweights from silence to conversation. However, no genuine opposition or foreclosed alternative appears; Ilay's progression is smooth, and the "cost" reads more as exhaustion than a trade-off that narrows options, keeping the score below high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as co-resonance, silence learning to speak—emerges through concrete action (breath matching pulse, strumming cracks) rather than statement. The final image offers a non-literal answer: the insulator glows, storing "the new anthem like a battery," and the world becomes audible conversation. Subtext operates in gesture and sound. The piece resists overt moralizing, though "sorrow learning it can also be comfort" edges toward articulation; still, the ending reweights prior material without a stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "symphonically minded," noticing pitches in fractures, tuning gestures to arboreal time. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated ("hairline cracks," "fungal webs," "almost-audible mercy"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at mapping, wider at grove-wide resonance). The prose texture is singular and purposeful. No head-hopping, elision is pattern-taught, and the compression serves the "intensely quiet" tone throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift, and information density is high ("Each crack records torque of stormwind, weight of snow, final sigh of root"). Clarity and momentum are strong. However, figurative density in nearly every line—"glass nests," "arboreal time," "conversation—tree to bird to soil to her own blood"—risks overwriting without consistent pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphor: "ivy" climbing cracks is spatial, "arpeggio" is sonic; the blend works but borders on decorative. Minimal loops; no scaffold detected. The final third maintains propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—sound sculptor healing a silent grove through empathy and resonance—is specific and non-obvious, with fresh inflections (stress cracks as pitches, insulator as battery). The piece commits fully to its lyric premise. However, the emotional arc (mapping → playing → restoration) follows a predictable template without meaningful obstacle or surprise turn. Risk-taking in voice and method is present, but the lack of a countervailing force or ambiguity limits ingenuity; hindsight inevitability is moderate rather than strong.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ilay the tree-song sculptor is named early, kneels before the statue, maps cracks, strums the insulator, and walks toward the re-strung wire at closure. Her choices—mapping, strumming progression, bowing without celebration—create key turns and the final decision. The character drives at least three beats (mapping, strumming, closure walk) with causal pressure and irreplaceability; removing her would break the story.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator appears early ("three of them, rimmed with copper"), returns hidden inside the statue's hands (crack shaped like siskin's wing), is strummed to generate sound, and glows faintly at closure, "storing the new anthem like a battery." It is handled in at least four beats, constrains Ilay's method, and charges the final image with undeniable specificity and cost. Swapping it would break the story's logic and resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Empathy in motion—that is her craft" is stated directly and demonstrated when Ilay breathes with the statue's pulse, matching tempo to arboreal time. The concept shapes her method (analyzing cracks, playing them as melody) and alters tactics (tuning to the grove's rhythm). It is signaled early and present at closure ("hearing for the first time in years the real world: not noise, but conversation"). However, it reads more as thematic echo than a stake or constraint that narrows options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded: every fracture speaks a pitch, every craze line a rhythm she must teach the world to hear again" is stated early and constrains her method throughout. She numbers cracks as intervals ("minor third; tritone; resolving sixth"), tunes strumming to stress-crack pitches, and plays the fissures as melody. The attribute enables at least three beats and shapes the closure image (the grove becoming symphony). It is specific and irreplaceable, though the cost is implicit rather than foregrounded.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Strumming ("strums the insulator's rim—one clear, glassy ping") is the pivotal action. Ilay strums to test resonance, tunes each strum to a stress-crack pitch, circles the sculpture playing fissures, and the final phrase ("slow arpeggio") coaxes the statue to sing. The action drives at least four beats, redefines options (silence → sound → grove-wide resonance), and is irreplaceable; swapping it would break the story's logic and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Analyzing stress cracks in the sculpture is introduced early ("jeweler's loupe and a pocket light; methodically she begins analyzing stress cracks") and shapes the entire method. Ilay maps cracks as constellations, numbers them as pitches, and tunes strumming to their frequencies. The method is signaled, its mechanics matter across beats, and it drives the closure (playing the cracks stitches them into melody, coaxing the statue to sing). Removing it would break the story's causal chain and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove anchors setting from the first line, provides the fallen statue and dulcimer wood, and at closure the grove itself joins as strings/brass/percussion. The grove constrains Ilay's materials (reclaimed copper, alder wood) and supplies the final resonance. It is present in at least three beats and charges the ending image. However, it functions more as backdrop than active pressure; swapping "alder" for another tree would require minor edits but not break logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the hedgehog uncurls" opens and closes the story, framing a single continuous scene. The timeframe is poetic but does not create urgency or tighten decisions; Ilay's process unfolds at arboreal pace without a clock or deadline. The hedgehog's reprise charges the ending atmosphere ("sniffing the air now trembling with almost-audible mercy") but does not alter tactics. Present and purposeful, yet easily replaceable with a different temporal marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To create music in a silent world before the grove forgets it ever echoed" is stated early and dramatized through every beat: mapping cracks, strumming, coaxing the statue and grove to sing. Desire is conflicted (fear of breaking the spell, trembling knees) and tested on the page. The motivation drives at least three beats and shapes closure (walking toward the re-strung wire, ready to carry tomorrow's song). Friction between want and cost is present, though the cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Intensely quiet" is introduced early ("the hush of needles settling on moss") and sustained through diction ("the only moving thing," "breathes with that pulse," "downbeat of a symphony"). Tone modulates with pressure (single ping → "hairline cracks... widen microscopically" → "breathy alto" → grove-wide resonance) and charges the final image ("almost-audible mercy"). The tone is coherent, purposeful, and indispensable; removing it would flatten the story's atmosphere and thematic resonance.</comment>
