<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ari's goal (preserve seed choreography) drives her choices cleanly, and the harbormaster exchange provides external pressure. The infinitely patient trait appears but mostly as label; it doesn't constrain choices with visible cost—she simply acts patiently without a dramatized tradeoff when patience might fail her. Interiority leans abstract ("time accordion—past and possible pressed so tightly they hummed") rather than embodied, and her embodied stress responses are thin. The final planting and escape feel motivated, but the emotional progression stays flat across the encounter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (fulgurite beads accumulate meaning; final seed-planting and shoot reweight the preservation stake). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Ari escapes with the complete catalog, plants one seed in defiance, and the green shoot threads salt-soaked wood where maps claim nothing can grow—a felt cost (public defiance, lost secrecy) charges the final image without needing the full harvest shown. Orientation anchors who/where/when quickly. The harbormaster's arrival tightens stakes once; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Cost is legible in the planted seed and the dock's transformation, though the escape itself softens consequence slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Golden dock under snow, fog, fulgurite beads, and the harbor create vivid sensory grounding filtered through Ari's professional lens (seed collector, rope translator). The final planting directly uses the dock's grain as medium—micro-setting constrains the defiant act and charges the closure image when roots thread salt-soaked wood. Spatial choreography (pier's lip, skiff below, harbormaster advancing) tracks clearly. Some sensory detail tilts decorative ("harbor moons," "oceanic hush") rather than pressure-serving, and fog's tactical role (erasure during escape) feels convenient rather than earned constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve storm-corn choreography) is signaled early and sustained. Harbormaster's arrival forces one clear tightening: Ari hides the rope, cracks the bead, plants the seed in defiance—narrowing her options and charging the ending image. The planting forecloses secrecy with visible cost (public defiance, official notice). Fog's intervention at the escape beat softens agency slightly; luck assists rather than Ari's tactics alone. One meaningful escalation fits the length; cost is felt in the planted seed and the shoot's challenge to official maps.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (living knowledge vs. institutional custody, "Heritage is a seed, not a glass case") emerges through rope-knots, fulgurite memory, and the final planting without overt moralizing. The green shoot threading "where official maps claimed nothing could grow" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the preservation question. Fulgurite as sky-fire memory and the singing tide anchor theme in particulars. The phrase "data rot" and "Heritage is a seed" flirt with thesis-speak but stay character-voiced and earn their place in the conflict. No heavy-handed summary; the final image reweights prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds Ari's perceptual filter (seed-collector idiom, rope-reader stance). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("time accordion," "midwife to every line"), which reads voice-motivated for a philosophical protagonist but risks register drift under the harbormaster's arrival when urgency might compress syntax and diction—yet it remains unchanged. Psychic distance stays stable. No dialogue beyond the two spoken lines; those lines carry goal and subtext cleanly. Harbormaster's voice ("data rot") is distinct. Some figurative density ("sleeping serpent," "harbor moons") ornaments rather than advances pressure in mid-scene beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates most paragraphs ("whale-bone," "harbor moons," "sky-fire," "accordion," "sleeping serpent"), creating lyric texture but occasionally blurring momentum—fulgurite description and rope-reading span multiple paragraphs without forward pressure. Mixed metaphor: "ocean, midwife to every line she carried, kept tempo...writing its own rope of waves"—midwife/tempo/writing stack without tight vehicle coherence. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Syntax varies purposefully. Clarity remains high; information density is strong in the rope-decoding and planting beats. Overwriting in non-peak beats and one metaphor muddle prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Premise (tide-weavers encoding planting calendars in knots, fulgurite fusing lightning to rope) is specific and original; the synthesis of maritime lore, seed preservation, and vitrified memory feels fresh. The green shoot threading dock-grain where "nothing could grow" transforms the defiance trope through lived occupational detail. Some stock framing: bureaucrat vs. folk-knowledge guardian reads familiar, though the fulgurite mechanism and knotted-stanza method add specificity. Transformation test passes—swap names/places and the arc loses its maritime-seed logic. Risk-taking in lyric density and quiet defiance heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ari (philosophical seed collector) appears throughout, drives all on-page choices (kneel, translate knots, hide rope, crack bead, plant seed, escape), and her profession shapes perception and the preservation stake. Role constrains her method (must decode rope to access choreography) and motivates the final planting. Present in setup, middle rope-work, and ending defiance. The "philosophical" label is asserted more than dramatized in choice-friction, and one key decision (plant now vs. retreat) could be more causally forced. Strong integration across beats and closure, but swappable with "dedicated" or "last" seed collector without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fulgurite glass touched in four beats: initial description (lightning-vitrified fibers), lamp-lit examination (tiny harbor moons, frost date), concealment under coat (warmth coaxing flex), and climactic crack (reveals storm-corn seed inside). Each use is distinct and advances the stanza-decoding goal. The final crack directly enables the planting—without fulgurite casing, no seed is available in that moment. Present early, recurs with pressure, and charges closure. Specificity (sky-fire memory, carbonized filament) matters. Could score higher if the glass itself constrained a choice beyond serving as container; the warmth-flex beat hints at this but doesn't pay off a clear tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Secret weavers present as backstory (order encoding calendars in knots, "final tide-weaver died two nights ago") and thematic anchor ("secret weavers still walked"). Stakes depend on their encoded knowledge—Ari needs the stanza to sow storm-corn correctly. The rope itself is the weavers' artifact, so decoding pressure flows from their method. Not visible as characters; function as cultural-memory force shaping Ari's goal. Present in setup (weavers introduced by paragraph three), middle (decoding their knots), and ending (affirmed in final lines). Causal but indirect—could be "ancient system" without the weavers' named order and story would hold. Solid thematic integration but mechanism-driven rather than choice-altering on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" appears three times: opening (through forty winters), mid-scene (rose slowly, infinitely patient), and implied in the coaxing method. The trait enables the rope-work—impatient hands might shatter fulgurite—but no on-page moment dramatizes a visible tradeoff where patience costs time against the harbormaster's advance or where impatience tempts her and she resists. Label-only in the confrontation beat; no friction. Present early and restated but not constrained or tested under pressure. Functional but replaceable with "careful" or "experienced" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Coax" governs four actions: coaxing rope from tide (opening), coaxing glazed fibers to flex (crown-in-reverse knot), "coax meaning from pattern" (closing song), and verb-root of her method throughout. The action defines her technique and contrasts with the harbormaster's confiscation force. Drives the rope-decoding sequence and the final knowledge-gain. Present early, repeated with variation, and echoed in closure. Not swappable—force or pull would break the patient-tender method. Strong beat involvement and thematic charge. Could reach 8+ if one coaxing attempt failed and cost her a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Knot-decoding method signaled by paragraph three ("Each knot...was a syllable"), demonstrated across multiple beats (three-strand spiral translation, crown-in-reverse that resists untying, fulgurite chime completing the stanza), and directly enables the closure (cracked bead reveals seed, stanza complete). Mechanics matter: tension = phonemes, glass remembers frost date, final syllable arrives via fulgurite-brass chime. Present in setup, drives middle attempts, and pays off at ending. Specificity (knot types, fulgurite integration) is high. Not swappable—without rope-knots, the seed choreography is lost and the stake collapses. Could score higher if a knot resisted and forced a tactical sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Golden dock under snow anchors all action, provides the medium for final planting (seed pressed into dock-grain, roots thread salt-soaked wood), and the dock's groan/hollow note triggers the fulgurite chime that completes the stanza. Dock is present in opening line, used throughout (pier's lip, skiff below, planks), and transforms at closure (green shoot). Setting directly alters outcome—without dock-grain as medium, the defiant planting has no substrate. Micro-setting (body at pier's lip, rope/lamp/skiff choreography) shapes moves. Snow is atmospheric but doesn't constrain. Dock itself is essential; "golden" and "under snow" are vivid but could be varied without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fog rolling across the harbor frames the story (title element, opening hush, final concealment). Fog provides cover during escape ("fog folded thick between them") and creates atmosphere (muffling footsteps, oceanic hush). No live clock—harbormaster arrives but timeline is vague; fog's assistance feels convenient rather than earned by Ari tracking its movement or timing her work to its arrival. Present early, returns at closure, contributes to tone and escape. Could score higher if Ari had to race the fog's clearing or if its density measurably tightened her decoding window. Functional but not indispensable—escape could occur via skiff distance alone.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Preserve ancient methods (storm-corn choreography) stated early, drives every choice (bargaining, stealing back seeds, crossing harbors, decoding rope tonight, defiant planting), and tested by harbormaster's confiscation threat. Motivation shapes the confrontation and the final act. Friction between want (complete the catalog, preserve secrecy) and cost (plant now publicly, risk confiscation) is visible in the hiding/cracking/planting sequence. Desire is dramatized in action across beats. Could score higher if internal conflict over endangering the method by planting openly vs. keeping it secret forced a harder choice on the page. Strong causal involvement and closure link.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Oceanic hush established in opening line (fog muffling footsteps), sustained through wet slap of swell, tide "strained to overhear," rope chime, ocean keeping tempo, and final singing absorbed by waves. Tone is consistent and lyric throughout. Modulates subtly—quiet urgency when harbormaster intrudes, yet diction stays elevated and hushed rather than spiking into panic. Charges the final image (hush between heartbeats and waves). No sharp tonal break under pressure; some readers may find the static lyricism flattens urgency. Coherent and purposeful, contributes to closure resonance, but does not tighten or release dynamically with escalation.</comment>
