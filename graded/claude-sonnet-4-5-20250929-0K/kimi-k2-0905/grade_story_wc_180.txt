<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mender shows embodied emotion (pollen-freckled cheeks, cracked goggles) and her arc from breach to renewal is traced, but interiority remains abstract—phrases like "accidental wisdom" and "deciduous vows" function as thematic labels rather than lived contradictions. The daughter's late arrival and single question feel more like symbolic closure than a dramatized relationship under pressure. Micro-choices exist (grafting, whispering confession, barring elders) but the mender's internal conflict never sharpens into simultaneous competing impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the breach sets a wound, the bag ritual and graft work accumulate density, and the week-long bloom plus daughter's return reconfigure meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ribbon rotting into bark, fragrance as covenant), and the final image reweights prior material with conceptual cost (the mender's vows composting into roots). Orientation is clear early (cathedral, mender, breach). However, the escalation is largely iterative—grafting, waiting, daughter's question—without a single decisive pressure point that narrows options under stress, and the cost remains more metaphorical than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orchard-in-rafters setting is vivid and purposeful: roots coil around corbels, branches weave tracery, the absent rose window pours light. The copper gear and ribbon constrain the graft choice, the scaffold provides spatial choreography for the mender's work, and the setting charges the final image (coconut-and-copper fragrance drifting over the city). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the mender's professional priorities (quartz monocle, pruning hook, cambium thrumming). The setting passes the micro-setting test by shaping the graft action and the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (orchard survival after breach) is signaled early and clear. The mender's agency manifests in grafting and barring the elders, but escalation reads as a montage of accumulation (week of sleep, bees, buds) rather than a tightening choice that forecloses a live option. The breach and the elders' return frame external pressure, yet no on-page reversal tests the mender's commitment under immediate duress—she waits, the orchard blooms, and the elders are turned away in summary. Cost is present conceptually (ribbon rotting, vows composting) but remains oblique rather than viscerally felt in a peak beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (promises, persistence, generational continuity, apology as nourishment) emerges from particulars—scrolls in figs, copper-and-silk graft, ribbon transformed into banner—without overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph's "Promises are leaves" line, which skirts direct statement but stays rooted in the graft image. The final image (coconut-and-copper fragrance as unspoken covenant) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, phrases like "accidental wisdom" and "deciduous vows" are repeated as thematic labels rather than evolving through lived pressure, and the closing reflection ("content that accidental wisdom had outgrown its own apology") tilts toward summary rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated diction ("quartz-eye mender," "tracery finer than any mason's dream," "photosynthesize into hope"). Psychic distance remains consistent, though the register occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism ("time persisting like sap," "deciduous vows meant to brown and blow away") that reads more like external commentary than the mender's interior lexicon. The daughter's single line of dialogue ("if vows could grow back") feels purposeful, but the mender's reply ("Promises are leaves; they must fall so the tree notices its own rings") sounds crafted for thematic resonance rather than natural speech under pressure. No head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (quartz monocle, pollen-freckled) is character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "deciduous vows that had fallen like leaves," "time persisting like sap in winter," "roots coiled around corbels," "photosynthesize into hope." While many images are vivid, the sustained metaphorical register in nearly every sentence creates a textural sameness that dulls propulsion—peak beats (grafting, barring elders, daughter's arrival) receive the same ornamental treatment as transit moments, flattening narrative urgency. Paraphrase loops appear: "the orchard would decide when to forgive" / "even broken contracts can photosynthesize into hope" restate the same thematic claim. Template cadence runs: "She set... and waited," "She cracked... then she lashed," "Word spread... and elders arrived." No clarity breaks, but information density suffers from decorative phrasing where concision would sharpen impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The core premise—cathedral orchard tended by a quartz-eye mender, breach-of-contract wound healed via mother's bag ritual—offers a fresh synthesis of occupational detail, botanical magic, and contractual stakes. The copper-gear graft and ribbon-as-living-banner are specific, non-obvious choices. However, the emotional arc (breach → renewal → generational handoff) follows a familiar template, and the resolution (bloom convinces elders, mender content in old age) lacks the inevitable-in-hindsight surprise or moral ambiguity that would elevate ingenuity. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreating, and the fragrance-as-covenant closure is a purposeful final image, but the transformation of "broken promises into hope" reads as a durable archetype rather than a bold reimagining.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The quartz-eye mender drives all key turns: reading scrolls, grafting with the copper gear, releasing pollen, lashing the ribbon, barring the elders, and lifting the daughter to feel cambium. Present from the opening line, she shapes the middle graft sequence and the closure image (older, content, watching petals). Her choices create the orchard's renewal and the generational handoff. The mender's decisions narrow options (barring elders forecloses negotiation) and her actions enable the bloom with visible cost (ribbon rotting, vows composting). High integration across setup, development, and payoff; no swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The daughter's hair ribbon appears in at least four distinct beats: slipped between goggles (opening), set as pendulum between plum boughs (bag ritual), lashed around the graft wound with pollen (grafting), and transformed into a living banner the daughter sees (week later). Its final state—rotting into bark, releasing coconut-and-copper fragrance—charges the closure image and makes the covenant legible. The ribbon's specificity (coconut oil, playground dust, pink satin) and evolving use (ornament → pendulum → graft binding → absorbed fiber) make it irreplaceable. Early signal, causal pressure (enables graft), and closure linkage all present with visible cost (material consumed into bark).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Deciduous vows are introduced early ("deciduous vows that had fallen like leaves the hour the contract tore") and return in the scrolls-in-figs beat ("deciduous vows meant to brown and blow away, yet here preserved"). The concept shapes the mender's understanding (vows must fall so the tree notices its rings) and charges the thematic closure (vows composting into roots). However, the concept functions more as a recurring metaphor than an on-page constraint that alters tactics—the mender does not choose between preserving or releasing a vow; she simply enacts the graft. Present in setup and payoff with lyric resonance, but middle development is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Endearingly feisty appears twice as a label: "endearingly feisty curses at the memory of their suits" (opening) and "the mender—endearingly feisty as ever—barred the doors with a pruning hook" (elders' return). The trait enables the door-barring action, which carries a cost (forecloses negotiation), but the phrase itself is an external characterization rather than an embodied trait demonstrated through specific speech or gesture. The pruning-hook barrier is a visible choice, yet "endearingly feisty" remains ornamental narration rather than a constraint that shapes multiple beats. Present in setup and one middle beat; modest causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Persist appears explicitly in multiple beats: "she felt time persisting like sap," "I persist, you persist" (whispered during grafting), "to persist in tying what was never meant to stay tied," and "the orchard... would persist long after her own vows returned to leaf litter." The action of persisting (waiting through the week, sleeping beneath the graft, later years as guild mender) drives the bloom and the generational handoff. The verb is signaled early, shapes the graft ritual and the mender's stance against the elders, and charges the final image. Not easily swappable—persistence is the story's spine—and tied to visible cost (time, endurance, eventual absorption into the orchard).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Using forgotten bag contents is introduced at the midpoint ("the mender opened the pouch she had sworn never to consult") and drives the next sequence: three items revealed (gear, ampoule, ribbon), pendulum ritual, graft mechanics. The method is signaled ("her mother... had taught that living wood listens only to those who speak in forgotten bag contents") and its specifics matter (each item used in the graft). However, the bag appears only once as a dramatic beat; it does not recur or shape later choices. Present in setup (mother's teaching) and development (bag opening, graft), but absent from closure. Moderate causal pressure; modest cost (breaking a sworn vow).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lush orchard spanning the rafters of the abandoned cathedral is introduced in the first paragraph and recurs across all major beats: mender climbs stairs into it, scrolls drop from figs, branches provide scaffold for the graft, bees navigate tracery, daughter walks the high rafters, petals snow across the nave in old age. The setting supplies the resources (plum boughs, central beam scar, corbels) that enable the graft and the closure image (fragrance drifting over the city). Spatial choreography is clear (stairs, rafters, scaffold, buttress entry). The orchard's survival is the dominant stake, and its transformation (breach → bloom → generational handoff) is the story's arc. Early signal, sustained presence, closure charge, and irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>After the breach of contract frames the opening and motivates the mender's ritual. The timeframe appears explicitly ("the hour the contract tore," "tonight, after the breach") and structures the week-long bloom sequence ("For a week she slept," "On the seventh morning"). However, time functions more as a backdrop than a live pressure—no clock tightens the mender's decisions, and the breach itself is past-tense setup rather than an unfolding crisis. The week's passage enables the bloom but does not force tactical choices. Present in setup and development; modest escalation role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To bridge generational wisdom is stated explicitly ("she needed generational wisdom to heal what stone and lien had broken") and drives the bag ritual (mother's teaching), the graft sequence (whispering to the tree, tying past and promise), and the closure (daughter becomes guild mender, apprentices taught). The motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between the mender's desire and competing wants. The daughter's question ("if vows could grow back") and the mender's answer reflect the bridging, but the cost of this motivation (time, waiting, eventual absorption) remains conceptual. Present across setup, development, and payoff; thematic pressure rather than urgent conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Accidental wisdom appears as a recurring phrase: "accidental wisdom such childish relics attract" (bag ritual), the mender's answer to her daughter is framed as "accidental wisdom," and "accidental wisdom had outgrown its own apology" (closure). Tone modulates from breach-driven urgency (opening) to patient accumulation (graft week) to reflective contentment (old age). The tone supports the premise (unplanned insight from forgotten objects) and charges the final image, though the repeated labeling of "accidental wisdom" tilts toward thematic assertion rather than emergent effect. Coherent across beats; modest escalation through cadence shift from active to contemplative.</comment>
