<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to "articulate unspoken needs" is stated but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine internal conflict—she paints, the echo objects once, she continues. The echo conversation ("You're encoding us away") gestures at tension but dissolves immediately into cosmic resolution without visible cost or a foreclosed path. Embodied emotion is scarce; most interiority is abstract ("tasting metal," "driftingly alert") without character-particular texture. The final descent carries no legible choice or renunciation that alters her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Lyra is, where exactly this courtyard exists, and what "ghost in code" means remain vague past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure image (open mouth/listening ear glyph, child receiving message) gestures at Conceptual Repricing but the cost is asserted rather than shown—Lyra "shouldered the empty bolt plate, now light as a sigh" reads as relief, not sacrifice. Causality is thin: the echo's touch "completes circuits" and moths appear without prior setup, and the graffiti's transmission mechanism is never explained. Under an Accumulative lens (inferred from lyric density and pattern), the piece needed one decisive tightening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; instead it drifts through metaphor without pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "misty courtyard above clouds" anchors atmosphere and the bolt plate functions as micro-setting (opened, used as palette, emptied). The courtyard stones "remembering every foot" and the mist "leaning closer" are vivid but never constrain a choice. Spatial choreography is loose—cloud ladders "materialize where her footsteps predicted them" implies magic without prior world rules. The final on-page moment (child looking at wall) shifts setting abruptly with no transition, breaking continuity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs before thunder erases them—is signaled early but never tested. Lyra paints faster when the echo objects, but the echo immediately helps rather than opposing, so no tightening occurs. Thunder arrives and deepens colors instead of erasing anything, reversing the stated threat without consequence. The piece declares urgency ("between lightning and thunder") yet no choice is foreclosed and no cost lands on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (the need to articulate suppressed longing and create communal belonging) emerges through image (moths, graffiti) and the final child moment offers a glancing emotional payoff. However, the echo's statement "You're encoding us away" is a direct thematic accusation, and Lyra's realization ("not to imprison them...but to release them") reads as thesis statement rather than earned discovery. The glyph "an open mouth curved into a listening ear" is a visual motif but feels designed to signal rather than resonate. No prior particular is reweighted; the resolution is asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lyra, but psychic distance wavers—"driftingly alert" and "the world had been afraid to pronounce" drift into omniscient register. Diction is lush but uniform; phrases like "a chord unresolved," "ghost in code," "tinkersong wonder" recur as labels without evolving meaning, creating a template cadence. The echo's dialogue ("You're encoding us away") is the only direct speech and feels like thematic placeholder rather than character voice. Perceptual signature is weak; Lyra's noticing (ozone, roses, metal) reads generic rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is extreme and often incoherent: "static that lived between lightning and thunder," "sky's white quill," "lightning-slag stylus," "bruised chromas" pile metaphor on metaphor without clear vehicle logic. Paraphrase loops appear: "ghost in code" is defined three times across paragraphs without adding detail. Template cadence: "She painted faster…She set…She shouldered…She descended…She kept walking" runs through the final third. Mixed metaphor: "driftingly alert" modifies states (vapor, echo, courtyard) that cannot share the same alertness. These artifacts dull the closure image and obscure causality (−1.2 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The premise (graffiti as emotional encoding above clouds) is conceptually fresh, and "flower press bolt plate" as pigment source is inventive. However, "ghost in code" echoes cyberpunk clichés without transformation, and the courtyard-above-clouds reads generic fantasy. The echo-as-past-self and moths-as-messages are familiar symbolic moves. Emotional specificity is weak; loneliness and belonging remain abstract rather than grounded in lived detail. The final child moment gestures at universality but lacks the particular cost or choice that would make the synthesis feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra (seldom-heard balladeer) is present throughout and her painting drives the plot, but her choices are uncontested—she decides to paint, paints, opens the bolt plate fully, and descends. The echo's objection is resolved instantly without forcing a trade-off. Setup clear, middle action present, but no meaningful decision with cost at closure (caps at ~6.0 for missing closure pressure). Her "seldom-heard" trait is mentioned once and never constrains a beat. Score: functional presence across beats but replaceable; no closure turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Flower press bolt plate appears early (strapped to her back), is opened mid-scene (releasing scent, supplying petals as pigment), functions as palette, and is emptied at the climax (petals rise). It returns in the final descent ("now light as a sigh, rattling a rhythm"). Setup ✓, development ✓ (two beats: palette, emptying), payoff ✓ (closure image of lightness and rhythm). Causal role: enables the graffiti and marks completion. Specificity: "bolt plate" and "copper shield" matter to the image. Deductions: could be replaced with another press-like object without breaking logic (−0.6 swappability), and "light as a sigh" is asserted relief rather than felt cost (−0.4). Score: strong integration across all three gates with causal work, minor swappability friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Ghost in code is referenced throughout ("each glyph was a ghost in code," "the ghost in code woke fully," "the ghost in code settled peacefully") and the graffiti's function depends on it. Setup ✓ (first third), development ✓ (moths manifest as coded messages), payoff ✓ (settles into stone). However, the mechanics are never explained—what makes graffiti "code," how do moths encode, why is it "ghost"—so it reads as metaphor rather than stake-shaping concept. It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Lyra's method (painting) would work identically without the "code" frame. Score: present across beats with thematic resonance but swappable metaphor, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Driftingly alert appears three times: opening line (Lyra), describing each glyph's effect, and the final line. It is never defined, never constrains an action, and reads as atmospheric label. Setup ✓ (first line), no middle development (label only), payoff ✓ (returns in last line). Two-gate presence allows ~6.0 ceiling, but label-only use (−0.8) and no causal work (−0.5) and late ornamental return (−0.3) push score low. It does not enable or prevent any choice. Score: ornamental recurrence without integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Encode is the core action: Lyra encodes needs into graffiti, the graffiti encodes unspoken longing, circuits complete, and the broadcast is received. Setup ✓ (signaled in paragraph 5), development ✓ (painting beats, circuits completing), payoff ✓ (city receives broadcast, child reads message). The action drives two major beats (painting, transmission) and shapes the closure image. Deductions: the encoding mechanism is vague—how does paint become code?—which weakens specificity (−0.5), and another communication method (song, writing) could replace it with edits (−0.4 swappability). Score: present across all gates with causal work, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Messages encoded in graffiti art is signaled early ("encode them...through messages encoded in graffiti art"), demonstrated in the painting beats (indigo vines, gold pollen), and delivered at closure (child sees glowing vines). Setup ✓, development ✓ (painting beats), payoff ✓ (graffiti remains, child reads it). The method matters: graffiti is durable ("the code remained") and public ("any future traveler"). Deductions: mechanics are vague—how does paint glow, how do vines spell syllables?—which limits irreplaceability (−0.6), and the "art" component is under-specified (no style, no technique shown). Score: essential method across all gates with closure presence, minor specificity debt.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Misty courtyard above clouds is established early, supplies the marble balustrades and stones that warm, and the mist "leans closer." Setup ✓, micro-development ✓ (courtyard as canvas, mist as witness), payoff ✓ (courtyard keeps humming after Lyra leaves). The setting enables the graffiti and charges the final image (hidden chorus). Deductions: the courtyard does not constrain a choice—Lyra paints unimpeded—and "above clouds" reads as atmospheric rather than functional (−0.7). The cloud ladders at the end appear without setup (−0.3). Score: present across gates, shapes the ending image, but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Between lightning and thunder is stated as the timeframe and recurs ("that razor-thin measure," "Thunder finally arrived"). Setup ✓ (early), no middle pressure (Lyra paints at her own pace with no clock shown), payoff ✓ (thunder arrives and enhances rather than erases). The stated urgency ("before the thunder rolled over them and erased the delicate interval") is contradicted when thunder deepens colors instead. Two gates allow ~6.0 ceiling, but the time does not tighten a decision (−0.8) and the contradiction breaks trust (−0.5). Score: present with thematic resonance but no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>To articulate unspoken needs is stated explicitly as Lyra's motivation and drives the plot (collect petals, encode them, release them). Setup ✓ (stated mid-story), development ✓ (painting and releasing beats), payoff ✓ (child receives message, closure resonates need). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—Lyra never hesitates, sacrifices, or questions. The echo's objection ("You're encoding us away") could create friction but is resolved in one beat without cost. Score: present across gates and shapes closure, but lacks on-page conflict or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Tinkersong wonder appears twice: "tinker-song wonder rolling through the marble" and "a tinkersong wonder that kept time with hearts." Tone is lyric and earnest throughout (misty, static, moths, bioluminescent), consistent but static—no modulation under pressure. Setup: unclear until late second half. Development: ornamental mentions. Payoff ✓ (final "tinkersong wonder" line). Missing setup gate caps at 4.6. The tone does not charge the closure image with new meaning; it decorates. Score: present at end with coherence, but late signal and no pressure modulation.</comment>
