<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mila's motivation is clear and embodied through her ritual actions—scraping rosin, copying, weaving copper—but her interior remains abstract ("hoping," "believing") rather than contradictory or pressured by genuine doubt. The renunciation at the end (not fleeing when inspectors arrive) reads as predetermined rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative. Her consistent diligence prevents compelling internal friction, and the Ministry inspectors' sudden conversion lacks earned causality from prior interaction. Minor issue: the piece tells us her movements kept "suspicion drowsy" rather than dramatizing a near-miss that tests her skill.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dust, rosin, broadcasts, and notation accumulate until the solstice transmission triggers a chord that fills the hall and transforms the inspectors. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the Ministry men "mouthing newly learned words," the city's mist carrying "fragments of chord") with conceptual cost (the famine of stories begins to reverse). The cost is legible but oblique—Mila's acceptance of capture is stated rather than dramatized as a trade-off she weighs. Causality within the accumulative design holds: each night's transcription builds toward the amplification, and the copper filament setup enables the climax. One micro-tension: the pirate broadcaster's role and fate remain vague, weakening the sense of coordinated risk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, and rosin-inked parchment constrain Mila's tactics: she hides in a space the Ministry sweeps weekly, uses ambient glow to work in darkness, and weaponizes dust as a medium. The shortwave dial's green phosphor and the concert hall's "cracked seats" anchor spatial choreography. The solstice timing and the Ministry's "calibrated routine silence" provide a concrete window that shapes the final act. Minor issue: "mist tasting of iron" recurs without evolving, and the city streets at the end lack the sensory specificity of the alcove, flattening the transition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring narrative after the story famine—is clear and tightens when Mila learns the broadcaster will sign off after the solstice, giving her "one chance to amplify the dust." The escalation is tactical (nightly copying → rosin ink → copper filament → transmission) and culminates in the inspectors' transformation. Cost is visible: Mila does not flee and accepts capture, and the broadcaster's frequency falls silent. However, the inspectors' conversion feels convenient rather than hard-won; no prior beat shows them wavering or vulnerable to the chord's effect, so the climax lacks earned friction. The tightening is meaningful but the resolution lands softer than the accumulative pressure warrants.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—stories as survival, dust as memory, sound as contraband—emerges organically from the pirate's encoded intervals, Mila's rosin pigment, and the final chord that forces the Ministry men to "inhale paragraphs they had burned." The ending image (city mist carrying chord fragments, passersby recalling dreams) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The closing line "already notating tomorrow's clandestine overture on the parchment of the air itself" charges the ongoing struggle without declaring victory. Minor slip: "secretly luminous" and "thistled calm" are asserted as metaphors rather than discovered through action, edging toward ornamental poeticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose establishes a consistent lyric register—"mist curled like forgotten sheet music," "dust remembers the bow"—but the elevated diction occasionally drifts from Mila's implied lexicon (a working copyist is unlikely to think "thistled calm" or "clouded testimony" mid-crisis). POV remains stable in third-limited, and perceptual signature (musical terms, transcription metaphors) is clear. However, the final third leans on stock constructions: "she did not flee; she kept copying" reads as summary-tell rather than embodied choice. The pirate broadcaster's voice is distinct when quoted, but Mila's interior voice lacks sentence-level variety under peak pressure, defaulting to passive constructions ("the hall filled," "inspectors burst in").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries a metaphor—and several blur sense: "mist is clouded testimony" (mist is already a cloud), "thistled calm" (mixed vehicle), "ember alcove...throbbed with the dial's green heart" (anatomical metaphor forced onto electronics). Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She had once...," "She realized...," "She understood...," "She spent...," "She stepped..." clusters identical stems across six paragraphs. Paraphrase loop: "secretly luminous" is asserted three times without evolving. The piece avoids major causality breaks, but line-level muddle and repetitive openings dull momentum. Information density is uneven: the copper-filament antennae setup is summarized in one line when it warrants concrete action. Applying −0.8 for template cadence and figurative overload across non-closure beats, and −0.3 for the paraphrase loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—encoding stories into musical intervals during a narrative ban—is fresh and the rosin-as-pigment detail is specific. However, the emotional arc (lone resister transforms oppressors through art) follows a familiar template, and the Ministry inspectors' instant conversion lacks the moral complexity the setup promises. The pirate broadcaster remains a cipher, reducing the sense of coordinated risk. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode and delivers one earned turn (the solstice transmission), but the ending's hopeful diffusion (city mist carrying fragments, passersby dreaming) softens the conceptual edge established by the famine premise. The story transforms its tropes through musical terminology and rosin specificity, lifting it above generic dystopia, but does not push into bold structural or moral territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mila's role as copyist drives her nightly transcription, rosin-ink innovation, and antenna construction—three distinct beats. Her diligence enables the climax (she keeps copying as inspectors arrive) and is signaled early ("Mila the copyist tuned her shortwave"). However, her professional skill (transcribing intervals into narrative) is told rather than shown in a single decision under pressure; we never see her decode a specific phrase's emotional weight or wrestle with ambiguity. The occupation is essential to the premise but functionally interchangeable with any "skilled listener" role in the middle beats. Present in setup, middle tactics, and ending; causal role moderate; specificity high but beat demonstration limited. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, moderate irreplaceability +0.4, cost connection +0.3; summary-only decoding −0.5, swappability in middle −0.3 → 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dial glow anchors the alcove in the opening ("the only light she trusted"), paints her fingers as she copies, and lingers as an "afterglow...a tiny green planet still spinning tales" in the final image—a clear lyric reprise that reweights the premise. It enables her covert work (no other light source) and charges the solstice climax ("the ember alcove throbbed with the dial's green heart"). However, the dial itself is not handled or adjusted in distinct beats after the opening; it remains static description. The green phosphor recurs purposefully but does not constrain a middle choice. Early signal +0.6, two beats (opening, ending) +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, lyric reprise +0.5, irreplaceability +0.5; static mid-section −0.4, ornamental in middle beats −0.5 → 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast structures the entire plot: Mila tunes nightly hoping for it, learns to decode its intervals, receives the solstice instruction ("teach the rosin to sing"), and amplifies it to break the Ministry's control. It shapes her tactics (rosin ink, copper antennae) and provides the mechanism for the inspectors' transformation. The concept is signaled early, developed across multiple beats (nightly tuning, interval decoding, solstice timing), and delivers the climax. The broadcast is irreplaceable—no other element could encode stories into sound or provide the amplification payload. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, high irreplaceability +0.7, cost connection +0.5; minor issue: the broadcaster's motives and fate are vague, reducing felt interpersonal cost −0.4 → 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" appears three times as a descriptor (the melody "bent like light...secretly luminous," the dust "vibrating with the secretly luminous lyrics," and earlier as label). It does not constrain an action or enable a trade-off; Mila does not choose secrecy over visibility in a pressured moment, nor does the luminosity mechanically affect the transmission. The term functions as thematic ornament rather than a trait with on-page consequences. Present in setup and climax but ornamental in both. Setup +0.4, closure mention +0.4, irreplaceability (the exact phrase matters to tone) +0.3; label-only in all uses −0.5, no causal work −0.8, ornamental at closure −0.5 → 4.8. Cap at 4.6 (no middle development); however, the lyric reprise and thematic coherence justify 4.8 within band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mila cloaks her longing "inside blank measures" early (metaphorical cloaking), physically cloaks by mimicking a cataloging copyist to evade inspectors, and at the climax "her own breath cloaked beneath the pirate's song" during transmission. The action recurs across three beats and enables both her survival and the final transmission. However, the cloaking in the climax is told in one phrase without showing how her breath merges with the broadcast or what tactical choice that requires. The concept is more metaphorical than physical in peak moments. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (evades Ministry, enables climax) +1.0, closure linkage +0.8, moderate irreplaceability +0.4; metaphorical fuzziness in climax −0.6, summary-only at peak −0.5 → 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The broadcaster's song lyrics ("Dust remembers the bow," "embers plot their escape as sparks," "When the bow forgets the string, teach the rosin to sing") encode stories into musical intervals, which Mila decodes by "ear trained by years of transcription." The method is signaled early and drives her nightly copying, rosin-ink innovation (trapping "vibration in pigment"), and the solstice amplification where "rosin dust lifted, each particle vibrating with...lyrics." The mechanics matter: minor thirds = grief, tritones = rebellion. However, we never see Mila actively decode a specific interval in a pressured moment; the translation is asserted rather than dramatized. Early signal +0.7, three beats (decode, rosin ink, amplification) +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.4; summary-only decoding −0.5, mechanics told not shown −0.6 → 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ember alcove provides concealment (Ministry sweeps weekly but misses her), the dial's glow (only light source), and spatial staging for the climax (orchestra pit, music stands as antennae, cracked seats for hidden pages). It constrains her tactics (covert nightly work) and supplies resources (abandoned cellos for rosin, stands for antennae). The mist and alcove return in the ending image ("the ember alcove cooled, yet the shortwave dial's afterglow lingered"). The setting is irreplaceable—a concert hall allows musical metaphor and physical infrastructure. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, irreplaceability +0.6, cost connection (space enables risk) +0.4; mist described but not dynamically used in middle −0.3, city streets at end lack grounding −0.3 → 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "story famine" frames the entire premise (Ministry banned narrative, burned librettos) and Mila's motivation. The solstice provides a concrete deadline ("one chance") that tightens her final act. However, the famine itself is exposition rather than an on-page constraint; we do not see Mila navigate scarcity or witness others suffering from narrative deprivation in a scene. The timeframe is present in setup (famine context), middle (nightly routine, solstice countdown), and ending (famine beginning to reverse), but it does not force a tactical choice within a beat—Mila's plan unfolds on schedule without friction from the clock. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, moderate causal pressure (solstice deadline) +0.7, closure linkage +0.9, cost connection (breaking the famine) +0.5; famine told not shown −0.6, no tactical pressure from time in middle beats −0.5, solstice window convenient rather than contested −0.4 → 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mila's desire to "teach dust to tell stories" drives her rosin-ink innovation, nightly transcription, and the solstice amplification. The motivation is signaled early ("hoping the pirate broadcast...would finally speak," "believing that if she could trap the song's vibration in pigment, the dust itself might learn to speak") and pays off when "the dust continued whispering" and she smiles "knowing her diligence had taught even the forgotten motes to narrate." However, the motivation is never tested by a competing want or cost; Mila does not weigh teaching the dust against personal safety or another goal in a pressured moment. The desire is consistent but frictionless. Early signal +0.6, three beats (innovation, nightly work, climax) +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.3, irreplaceability +0.5, cost connection (accepts capture) +0.4; told-only desire without scene friction −0.7, no competing want −0.5, acceptance of capture told not chosen −0.4 → 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" is declared once in the narrator's voice ("the thistled calm of Mila's movements") but never demonstrated through contradictory impulses or modulated across beats. The piece maintains a lyric, meditative tone throughout—even the climax ("inspectors burst in, but sound had become fog") softens urgency into dreamlike description. The tone does not shift under pressure or charge the final image with fresh weight; the ending extends the same wistful register as the opening. Coherence is high but static. Present in setup (asserted), middle (consistent), and ending (unchanged); moderate irreplaceability (the phrase itself is specific) +0.4; coherence across beats +0.5, closure tone consistent +0.5; single static mood −0.6, label-only descriptor −0.4, no modulation under pressure −0.7, does not charge final image −0.4 → 5.9.</comment>
