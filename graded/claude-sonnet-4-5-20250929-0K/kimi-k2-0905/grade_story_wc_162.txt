<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Juniper's interiority leans heavily toward lyric abstraction ("inventing their own way home," "weather in wood") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her motivation to understand thresholds is sustained but remains told more than dramatized through competing desires. The final "discovery" arrives as received wisdom from her father's voice rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in barefoot steps and chest-pressing gestures, but peak beats drift into metaphor rather than grounding her struggle in concrete physical or relational stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes who, where, and when within the opening lines (Juniper on the drifting terrace after the butterfly effect). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers images (logbook, grain, maze coordinates) toward a final resonant reconfiguration where Juniper "walked the invisible corridors" and heard her father's lesson. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"some distances are necessary because they teach us to read the weather in wood"—with the terrace carrying her forward. Cost is felt but oblique: she does not regain her father, yet the maze "dissolved," leaving only forward drift. One meaningful deepening occurs when she steps off the terrace "into air that felt thick with memory." Minor causality slips (how does analyzing grain yield exact coordinates? how does stepping off produce the maze?) slightly weaken the middle linkage but do not break the accumulative pattern or final charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vividly particularized (three inches west per year, house creaking like a ship) and charges the final image when Juniper steps off its western edge. The kitchen table with carved weather symbols functions as micro-setting that constrains her method and delivers coordinates. Sensory detail is purposeful: barefoot steps reading floorboards, grain textures, the fractured hush. No orientation debt; spatial choreography remains clear across the single continuous scene. The terrace qualifies as an object-as-setting that reconfigures meaning at closure, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Juniper finds the carved spiral and steps off the terrace, narrowing her path toward the final realization. Agency reads as attention and endurance rather than decision with visible trade-off; she does not forfeit a competing desire on the page. The butterfly effect and maze-building backstory add texture but remain expository context rather than on-page pressure that forces choice. Cost is conceptual (accepting her father's absence, moving forward alone) but not concretely foreclosed within the scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—necessary distances as teachers of becoming—emerges organically from the interplay of logbook codes, wood grain, and drifting architecture. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "some distances are necessary because they teach us to read the weather in wood, to find our way by the grain of our own becoming." Subtext operates effectively in the choice to step off the terrace and in the father's voice teaching rather than calling home. Minor weakness: the phrase "invents their own way home" in the penultimate paragraph approaches moralizing but remains anchored in image. No explicit theme statement mars the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited focused on Juniper; perceptual signature is consistent (barefoot reading of grain, architect's daughter lens on thresholds). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fractured hush," "featherly determined steps," "intuit") that feels slightly imposed rather than character-particular, but remains legible and voice-motivated within the lyric mode. Purposeful compression and patterned imagery are taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance tightens effectively when she closes her eyes and lets her feet read the floorboards, then steps into the between-place.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("light fracture," "pages soft as moth wings," "maze that existed in the space between heartbeats") without always advancing concrete action; several beats restate the same symbolic claim in adjacent lines (e.g., thresholds remembering footsteps, then again as "the place where two stories touched"). Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [past tense]" sentence openings across multiple paragraphs. One paraphrase loop: "moved through its rooms with featherly determined steps" echoes "stepped off its western edge" without added pressure. Clarity remains intact and the closure image is not obscured, but density and recurrence slightly dull momentum in the middle third. Deduction: −0.6 for template cadence and synonym churn in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of architect's maze, pilot logbook weather codes, and drifting prism terrace is specific and non-obvious; the piece commits fully to its lyric premise. The choice to encode weather in corn and decode it from wood grain offers fresh inflection on grief-and-inheritance material. Risk-taking in the metaphysical step-off and invisible maze heightens stakes without obscuring the closure effect. Minor limitation: the butterfly effect as triggering event and the "necessary distances" phrasing approach familiar workshop idiom. Transformation test: the emotional arc (lost child seeking父's lesson) could translate to another setting, but the weather-code/grain mechanics and drifting-terrace particulars feel integral.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Juniper (corn maze architect's lost child) is present throughout and her actions—pressing the logbook, tracing the table, stepping off the terrace—create the narrative's key turns. Setup, development (finding coordinates), and closure participation (stepping into the maze) are all present. However, her choices read more as symbolic gestures than decisions with visible trade-offs; she does not forfeit a competing path or pay an immediate cost. Two distinct beats (table analysis, terrace step-off) and closure linkage elevate the score, but lack of concrete cost and modest causal pressure cap mid-band. +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage, −0.5 ornamental interiority in peak beats, −0.6 cost connection weak = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The pilot logbook weather code is handled in two beats (pressed against chest in opening, translated via table carvings midpoint) and its meaning is reweighted at closure when her father's voice teaches "to read the weather in wood." Setup by paragraph one, development when she matches symbols to pages, and closure participation via the lesson. Specificity is strong (atmospheric conditions → cornstalks → growth rings). Slight weakness: the mechanics of how pages become keys to "necessary distances" remain abstract rather than action-driving. +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage, +0.5 specificity, −0.4 swappability (another heirloom code could serve similarly), −0.3 summary-only use in middle = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is signaled early ("learned to read necessary distances in the way wood remembered storms") and returned in the father's voice at closure ("some distances are necessary because they teach us…"). It shapes the dominant stake—understanding thresholds—and the final image of the terrace carrying her forward into that distance. However, it functions more as thematic echo than on-page constraint that alters tactics; Juniper does not make a choice between proximity and distance with visible cost. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but lacks causal pressure. +0.8 setup, +0.7 closure linkage, +0.3 specificity, −0.5 ornamental (theme claim without action pressure), −0.4 swappability = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears once ("moved through its rooms with featherly determined steps, never quite touching the floorboards") as description of Juniper's movement. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; the trait is label-only without visible trade-off. No setup in first third, no middle beat, no closure participation. Present but ornamental. +0.0 setup (late), +0.4 one mention, −0.5 ornamental, −0.8 swappability, −1.0 late first appearance (second third) = ~3.2. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup gate; actual integration is weaker, so final ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Intuit" is the stated action for why Juniper returned ("to intuit what he'd been trying to tell her") and anchors the narrative method. It appears in setup and her actions—reading grain, feeling depressions, closing eyes to let feet read—embody intuitive discovery. The step into the between-place and final hearing of her father's voice are outcomes of this intuitive process. Two distinct beats (table analysis, barefoot reading) and closure participation. Causal pressure is moderate: the action enables discovery but does not narrow options or impose cost. +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage, +0.5 causal pressure (moderate), −0.4 swappability (could be "decipher" or "sense") = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Analyzing the grain in wooden furniture" is signaled in paragraph seven ("began analyzing the grain in wooden furniture the way he'd taught her") and its mechanics matter: tight grain for drought, swollen curves for floods, coordinates hidden in patterns. She uses it at the table to find the carved spiral. Setup by ~25%, one key middle beat (table analysis yields coordinates), and it primes the closure lesson about reading "the weather in wood." Specificity is high. Slight weakness: after the table discovery, the method is not reprised in the final maze walk. +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat, +0.7 closure linkage (primes lesson), +0.6 specificity, +0.5 causal pressure (enables discovery), −0.3 single-beat use = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is introduced in the opening line and its three-inch-per-year westward migration structures the entire piece. It supplies the platform for her analysis, the creaking ship-like atmosphere, and the western edge from which she steps into the maze. Present in setup, development (house creaking, floorboards she helped install), and closure (steps off western edge, terrace carries her forward in final line). It constrains her choices (barefoot on old floorboards) and charges the final image ("leaving only the terrace drifting west, carrying her forward"). Three or more beats, high causal pressure, closure participation, and irreplaceability. +0.8 setup, +1.4 three beats, +1.6 causal pressure, +1.8 closure linkage, +0.8 specificity = ~7.8 (rounded down within band to avoid overcounting cumulative adjustments; strong integration across all gates).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" is established in the opening and functions as backstory frame: one altered wind current rewrote maps, changed corn growth, and initiated the father's final maze. It does not impose a live clock or tighten on-page decisions; Juniper's actions unfold without time pressure. The timeframe is vague (years since the event, unspecified duration of her return). Setup present, but no middle beat where time alters tactics, and closure does not hinge on temporal urgency. +0.3 setup (weak—background only), +0.0 beat involvement, +0.0 closure linkage (frame only), −0.5 ornamental (does not constrain), −0.4 swappability = ~4.8. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup gate as active constraint; actual use slightly lifts to ~4.8 due to thematic presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Juniper's motivation "to discover why [thresholds] feel sacred" is stated in paragraph four and sustained through her analysis and step into the between-place. It drives her return and her choice to step off the terrace. However, the desire is told more than dramatized; on-page friction between wants and costs is minimal—she does not weigh conflicting desires or forfeit an option. The final realization arrives as received lesson rather than through contested choice. Setup by ~12%, one key choice (step-off), closure participation (hears answer). +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat, +0.7 closure linkage, +0.3 causal pressure (moderate), −0.5 told-only in peak beats, −0.6 cost connection weak = ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" appears explicitly in paragraph nine ("She worked in fractured hush, the silence broken only by the terrace's gentle groaning") and implicitly governs tone throughout: quiet, contemplative, suspended between loss and discovery. The tone modulates under pressure (barefoot reading intensifies perception, the step-off shifts into lyric immersion) and charges the final image of dissolution and forward drift. Setup implicit from opening, development in the hush paragraph, and closure participation in the quiet final movement. Coherence is strong; the tone does not flatten under the peak beat. +0.8 setup (implicit but consistent), +0.9 two beats (explicit mention + final modulation), +1.8 closure linkage (tone charges final image), +0.5 specificity = ~7.2. Rounds to 7.2 within band.</comment>
