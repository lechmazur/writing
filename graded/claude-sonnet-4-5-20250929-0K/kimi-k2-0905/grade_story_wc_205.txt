<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aurelia's motivation is clear—revolutionary failure drives her to reimagine a civilization through poetic acts—but her internal contradictions remain largely told rather than dramatically acted. The dissolution ending bypasses the cost of a final choice; she becomes "burnished sorrow" rather than making a renunciation that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is present ("staggered," kneeling, crushing the shard) but the peak beat leans on abstract poeticism ("dissolved into the burnished sorrow") instead of concrete consequence. The archaeologist's sudden conversion lacks sufficient on-page friction to earn the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story accretes images (mirrors, shard, verses) toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation is delayed—who/where/when coalesce slowly across the first third—but the baroque asteroid frame becomes legible before midpoint and the delay charges the setting's strangeness, so orientation penalty is waived. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing: Aurelia's dissolution seeds a new crystal and a budding civilization. However, the cost is conceptual and oblique; her body "dissolved" into abstraction rather than a visible forfeiture, and the archaeologist's conversion lacks on-page causal steps, reading as coincidence rather than earned consequence under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid with visible time, obsidian walls, mirrored halls, and collapsed harpsichord is vivid and purposeful. Covering mirrors constrains Aurelia's method and the palace architecture shapes her tactic, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Sensory detail is selective (velvet drapes, mercury ceiling, marble pedestal) and filtered through her revolutionary lens. The setting pressures choices and charges the final image, though some description (cherubs, opera boxes) leans decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reimagining a civilization through the shard—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the archaeologist arrives and Aurelia must choose between surrender and destruction, but that choice is resolved by crushing the shard, which then creates a convenient new crystal rather than foreclosing a path with visible loss. The storm-covering sequence demonstrates agency and method, but the final act bypasses true cost: dissolution replaces decision, and the new crystal and archaeologist's conversion soften the price. Escalation is present but the ending distributes reward rather than exacting sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—revolutions that arrive too early, the gap between vision and realization—emerges from image and action rather than sermon. The shard as repository of "futures that never arrived" and Aurelia's recitation building an "impossible city" are concrete. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("already acquitted by tomorrow," "the sorrow that burnished every surface was bright enough to read by") that states rather than earns resonance. The archaeologist's sudden thematic alignment and the ships quoting anonymous lines feel imposed to underscore the premise rather than arising from earned particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Aurelia; no head-hopping. Voice is distinctive—elevated, lyric diction ("burnished sorrow," "multiplying gaze," "country that existed only because she had reimagined it")—but the register sometimes inflates beyond the moment's pressure ("poetically inclined" becomes an authorial claim more than dramatized trait). The archaeologist's brief shift at the end is legible. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful ("Drop the artifact," "Mirrorless, we become the reflection we sought"). Free indirect style is mostly clean, though a few lines blur psychic distance ("no longer certain which side of history he occupied").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("ribbons of chronology twisting like silk scarves soaked in blood," "dagger of light," "syllables stitched") and occasionally muddles clarity under pressure—mixed metaphors and stacked modifiers blur the closure beat. Template stems recur: "She [verb], [action], and [verb]" across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops appear ("the shard drank every word" / "its fractures glowing" restate absorption). The final paragraph edges into thematic summary rather than propulsive image. Rhythm varies but the elevated register holds constant even when stakes peak, flattening urgency. No severe artifacts, but density and loops accumulate to −0.8 to −1.0 range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid with visible time-storms and a crystal shard that stores anthems is a fresh synthesis. Covering mirrors to survive a temporal storm and reciting verses to seed a civilization offer non-obvious tactics. The emotional truth—failure, exile, and the impulse to reimagine rather than rebuild—feels specific. However, the "failed revolutionary finds redemption through art" arc is familiar, and the ending distributes rewards (new crystal, converted archaeologist, budding civilization) rather than extracting a final, irreversible cost. The premise is distinctive; the resolution retreats toward safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aurelia (defunct revolutionary) is present throughout, frames the opening, drives the mirror-covering method, recites verses to the shard, and makes the final choice to crush it. Her past failure motivates the reimagining stake and her dissolution seeds the new crystal. Setup, development (covering mirrors, recitation), and payoff (crushing the shard, seeding the new civilization) are all present. Her choices create the key turns: choosing to cover mirrors, to recite, to crush rather than surrender. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong, though the ending dissolves her agency into metaphor rather than a final on-page decision with immediate visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard appears early (located beneath harpsichord), is handled and examined (lifted "like a dagger of light," shows visions, stores anthems), recurs in the recitation scene (laid on pedestal, "drank every word"), and is crushed at closure, seeding the new crystal. Setup, development, and payoff are present across three distinct beats. The shard's properties (reflecting unrealized futures, storing verses) constrain Aurelia's method and enable the final act. Causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage are all strong. Its destruction and transformation into a new whole crystal charge the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute is mentioned (two universities broadcasting threats, an archaeologist arrives with plasma cutter) but functions as backdrop rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. Aurelia "cared nothing for their tenure tracks," and the archaeologist's one scene is brief confrontation followed by unexplained conversion. The dispute does not constrain her choices or alter the method; it could be replaced with any intrusion. Setup is present but development and payoff are weak; the concept is ornamental to the dominant reimagining stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" is signaled early (Aurelia composes a stanza during trial, hums a hymn, recites verses) and drives multiple beats: the mirror-covering is paired with humming, the recitation to the shard builds the impossible city, and the final crushing completes a stanza. Setup, development, and payoff are present. The trait enables her method—she reimagines through verse—and the shard responds to her poetry, making the attribute causally active. However, the trait is also described externally in the final paragraph ("every citizen is poetically inclined"), which shifts it toward theme rather than on-page cost, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Devise" appears explicitly in the mirror-covering beat ("She devised a method older than the asteroid itself") and drives the storm-survival sequence, the largest tactical stretch. Setup (storm approaching), development (covering mirrors room by room with patience and method), and payoff (storm passes without shattering) are clear. The devised method shapes tactics across multiple paragraphs and demonstrates agency under pressure. The action is causally central to surviving the storm, though it does not directly drive the final shard-crushing choice. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure, but closure linkage is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Covering mirrors during storms is introduced early (visible storm approaching, palace's mirrored halls "would amplify the tempest") and developed across a sustained beat: Aurelia moves room to gilded room, pulls velvet drapes, saves the largest mirror for last, and the storm passes without damage. Setup, development, and payoff are all present. The method is specific (denying the storm its "multiplying gaze") and the mechanics matter on the page. It constrains her actions during the middle sequence and demonstrates her tactical patience. However, the method does not reappear at closure or shape the final shard-crushing choice, limiting closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid with obsidian walls, mirrored halls, collapsed harpsichord, opera-box drapes, and marble pedestal is established early and pressures choices throughout. The mirrors amplify the time-storm, forcing Aurelia to cover them; the palace architecture (gilded rooms, ceiling fresco, broken cello) supplies resources (drapes, pedestal) and shapes her tactics. Setup, development (mirror-covering, shard placement), and payoff (final recitation, archaeologist's continued covering) are present. The setting constrains the method and charges the final image of a civilization budding inside the asteroid. Micro-setting (pedestal, drapes) alters tactics and closure participation is strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After time becomes visible" is the frame: the asteroid has "visible time" with a "slow pulse," and the storm is "ribbons of chronology." The timeframe is signaled early and the visible-time concept charges the setting's strangeness. However, visible time does not constrain Aurelia's decisions or tighten tactics on the page; it remains atmospheric. The storm's approach creates urgency for the mirror-covering, but the temporal mechanics (past/future shredding) are told rather than dramatized as a live clock altering moves. Setup and thematic presence are strong, but development and cost linkage are weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>To reimagine an entire civilization is Aurelia's stated motive ("here, where time is visible, I can reimagine you"), drives the recitation to the shard (boulevards, courts, fountains), and the final crushing seeds the new crystal and budding civilization inside the asteroid. Setup (failed revolution, wanting the shard for its reflective futures), development (recitation building the impossible city line by line), and payoff (new crystal, civilization budding) are clear. The motivation shapes the dominant stake and drives two major beats. Friction between want (to reimagine) and cost (dissolution, loss of body) is present but rendered oblique in the metaphorical ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" appears in the opening ("burnished by regret"), recurs in the covering sequence ("sorrow itself were being tucked into bed"), and charges the final paragraph ("dissolved into the burnished sorrow," "the sorrow that burnished every surface was bright enough to read by"). Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure—quieter during patient mirror-covering, sharper at the archaeologist's arrival. However, the final-paragraph repetition leans into summary and overt claim ("bright enough to read by") rather than letting the image resonate. Setup and payoff are strong, but the ending's directness flattens the tone's subtlety.</comment>
