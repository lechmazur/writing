<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is established through her professional role and ancestral connection, though the leap from cartographer to understanding she's pursuing her great-grandmother's exhalation feels more asserted than earned through prior micro-choices. Her final transformation into corridor-echo shows embodied consequence but the interiority remains more conceptual than contradictory—she moves toward the archive without visible internal resistance or competing impulse. The character arc tracks causally but lacks the friction of simultaneous contrary wants acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraphs and maintains a clear accumulative lens throughout, building density through the ivy-passage → diaries → negatives → tunnel sequence. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Mira becomes the echo she was hired to trace, a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (her disappearance, the rescue team finding only a negative). The causal chain is motivated by discovery rather than decision, which fits the accumulative mode, and the final image reweights all prior material—the building-as-camera premise pays off with undeniable conceptual pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage, fireplace, and film-negative tunnel are vividly realized and constrain Mira's movements at each stage. The climate-shift flood lines, dripping corridors, and moss texture filter through Mira's professional ear and charge the closure image: the building-as-camera reveal depends on the physical architecture established early. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent, and the negatives brushing her face in the tunnel is both tactile and conceptually loaded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping the acoustics, then discovering the echo's origin—is signaled early and tightens through the diary discovery, the photograph of herself, and the descent into the unmapped tunnel. The final image forecloses her prior identity with visible cost (she becomes the archive, the rescue team finds only a negative). Escalation proceeds through accumulative discovery rather than protagonist agency in the causal sense, which fits the inferred lens; one meaningful deepening (the realization that Livia designed a camera, not a building) reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the building-as-camera conceit and the legacy's burden motif, which recurs with escalating pressure (the diaries, the image of Mira at age seven, the final transformation). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: to discover what walls dream, you become the negative space inside their memories—this reweights the entire premise without stating a moral. The ivy, negatives, and echo motifs charge the closure without mechanical recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled, with perceptual signature grounded in Mira's acoustic sensitivity and professional idiom ("corridor echo cartographer," "photosensitive gel"). Diction remains consistent under pressure, and the prose texture—"cadence of guilt," "flip-book spanning centuries"—reflects the building's archival memory without drifting into generic elevated register. Free indirect access is clean; no head-hopping or unmotivated filter stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance discovery, image, or conceptual reweighting. Minor template cadence appears in the middle third ("She realized," "She understood," "She reached") but does not dull the closure beat. A few figurative constructions verge on overwriting ("laughter a hollow skull," "mouth open in a scream she could not yet remember") but remain legible and voice-coherent. No paraphrase loops or scaffold in the final third; propulsion holds through the descent sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The building-as-camera premise is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that transforms the haunted-archive trope through lived architectural detail and the photochemical metaphor. The ivy-as-shutter, storms-as-flash-powder extension feels inevitable in hindsight, and the protagonist-becoming-echo closure is a bold risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The emotional truth of inherited guilt and the cost of witnessing anchor the conceptual ambition in human consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her professional role (echo mapping) frames the inciting discovery. Her choices—lifting the first page, holding the negative to light, descending the ladder—drive beats, though they read more as compelled discovery than volitional turns. She participates directly in closure (transformation into echo), but her agency is reactive rather than decisive across most beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The film negative strip appears in three distinct beats: the fireplace discovery (with the inverted photograph of Mira), the tunnel lined with thousands of negatives (brushing her face, showing reverse time), and the final negative depicting the empty room. Each use escalates meaning and the object is causally indispensable—the building-as-camera premise depends on it, and the closure image (Mira as a dangling negative) recharges all prior material with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" is seeded in the diaries ("every sentence...repeated the phrase"), echoed when Mira recognizes her name, and operationalized in her transformation: the inheritance is not stone but "this dark archive, a burden of witnessing every joy and grief." The concept shapes her final choice (or compulsion) to walk backward through time and constrains the job posting that closes the story. It participates in closure with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's "sensitively perceptive ears" enable the inciting discovery (hearing "older frequencies" and the building's sigh) and justify her professional hiring. The trait recurs when negatives brushing her face trigger visions, but no visible tradeoff or cost is tied to the sensitivity itself—it functions as enabling credential rather than constraining flaw. Present in two beats but without friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Glimpse" structures the entire middle and climax: Mira glimpses her silhouette in the first negative, glimpses moments in reverse as negatives brush her face in the tunnel, and reaches the final glimpse of herself at age seven screaming. Each glimpse escalates knowledge and the mechanic is irreplaceable—the inverted-image logic depends on it. The action shapes three beats and the closure, though it remains observational rather than volitional.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries in the fireplace are discovered early (paragraph 5), deliver the first photograph and Livia Vale's identity, and contain the warning that Mira later enacts ("you must become the negative space"). The method constrains her investigation (she follows the diaries' clues into the tunnel) and primes closure, though the diaries themselves do not reappear in the final image. Present in two beats with causal force.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is named in the opening line, functions as the building's "shutter" in the camera metaphor, and anchors the descent into the maintenance hatch. Its physical properties (narrow, clogged, dripping) constrain movement and the ivy texture recurs at closure ("each glimpse revealing another layer of ivy over her own forgetting"). The setting is indispensable to the building-as-camera logic and charges the final image with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The climate shifts establish the university's abandonment (moss, flood lines, dripping memory) and justify Mira's professional hire, framing the inciting situation. The timeframe recurs when Livia's design date ("2081, back when ivy was decorative") contrasts with the present ruin, and the storms are repurposed as "flash powder" in the camera metaphor. The element shapes two beats and supports the premise but does not tighten decisions in real time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mira's goal—"to discover what walls dream about"—is explicitly named in Vale's diary warning and operationalized when Mira pursues the echo into the tunnel. The motivation is seeded in her professional curiosity (paragraph 3: "older frequencies") and culminates in her transformation: she becomes the answer to the question. Desire meets friction (the scream she "could not yet remember") and the cost is visible (her disappearance). Three beats, closure linkage.</comment>
