<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is richly layered—"haunted ambitions" and the mother's vanishing establish contradictory pulls—but key micro-choices arrive via mechanism (the seed's heat, the filament's runes) rather than her deliberation under pressure. The final realization about haunted ambitions is stated cleanly but lacks embodied cost; we don't see what Mira forgoes or endures to reach it. The mother's waveform presence reads more as conceptual wish-fulfillment than a choice that forecloses a path, weakening the closure's emotional anchor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (translator, arbor, seed) and the piece sustains a clear accumulative/textural lens: density rises through cuneiform micro-glyphs, the mercury filament, the mirrored sky, building to the obsidian plank that extends the bridge. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the new plank and the final insight crystallize the mother's pattern without a decisive external act. Cost is conceptual—"haunted ambitions are just love that hasn't learned how to change shape"—legible in hindsight but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping the score in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is vividly rendered (iron leaves, Morse-like clicks, swaying planks) and actively constrains Mira's movements: she kneels at the rail joint, etches the magnetic leaf, and the arbor's resonance triggers the mirrored sky. The clouds, seed, and filament are handled with tactile specificity. The final obsidian bloom dropping into the mirrored sky charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate's requirement that setting or recurring object constrain choice or charge the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reestablishing the archive and understanding transition—is signaled early and accumulates through layered actions (transcribing, planting, humming, etching). The arbor's tilt and mirrored sky deepen the conceptual pressure, and the mother's voice provides a micro-turn. However, escalation is more textural than causal; Mira's agency at the peak (etching the equation) feels more ritual than a trade-off with visible cost. The final step onto the new plank reconfigures options but doesn't foreclose a live alternative with felt price, keeping this in mid-7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the cuneiform glyphs, the lullaby-as-measurement, the velocity-over-distance calculus, all converging on "love divided by time." The final insight—"haunted ambitions are just love that hasn't learned how to change shape"—reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to the mother's disappearance. Minor: the equation "love over time is velocity" is clever but edges toward thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph; it stops short of full sermonizing because it's embedded in the mother's voice and leads to action (etching, resonance, bloom).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prose is lush and purposeful, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices in translator's idiom (cuneiform micro-glyphs, phonemes, equations). Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative never head-hops. Two slips lower the band: "touching distance, she thought, is the span between fingertip and memory" reads as exposition rather than lived perception, and the mother's direct speech ("Measure the interval…") shifts into a slightly elevated register that, while poetic, isn't fully grounded in Mira's embodied experience under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high and rhythm modulates well through accumulative beats. However, several lines loop conceptually: "the gentle momentum of meaning itself" echoes "the physics of transition," and "touching distance…fingertip and memory" paraphrases the earlier bridging imagery without added pressure. The equation sequence ("love over time is velocity, and velocity over distance is home") stacks abstractions in adjacent sentences, creating mild density drag. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the conceptual redundancy in the middle third triggers a −0.4 deduction in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of cuneiform translation, magnetic arbor, and "haunted ambitions" is specific and non-obvious, with the knowledge-fruit seed and mercury filament offering fresh tactile detail. The velocity calculus and mirrored-sky hourglass feel purposeful rather than ornamental. Minor: the final insight about love changing shape, while earned, echoes familiar grief-as-learning templates; transformation is present but not radical. No proximity to famous lines, and the risk (layered metaphysics, dense symbology) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's choices (transcribing, planting, humming, etching) drive the middle beats and the arbor's resonance. However, her agency at closure (stepping onto the new plank) is reactive to the bloom's creation rather than a decision with visible tradeoff. She is present in all three gates (setup, development, payoff) and shapes two beats causally, but the final act lacks a cost tied to her deliberation, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The seed is handled in three distinct beats: warm in her palm, planted at the rail joint, sprouting as a silver filament. It evolves mechanically (heating, sprouting, blooming) and its transparent final state with floating cuneiform charges the closure image. The seed is irreplaceable—its requirement for "soil that remembered" and its transformation into the obsidian plank are causally central. Minor: the seed's agency is more magical than choice-driven, keeping it just below the indispensable band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Haunted ambitions" frames the mother's disappearance and Mira's quest, appearing in the official report flashback and the final insight. It shapes the stakes (understanding why her mother left) and the closure reprice ("love that hasn't learned how to change shape"). The concept appears in setup, drives the reflective middle, and lands at closure with conceptual cost. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the final articulation edges toward theme statement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is named early and mentioned again ("her mother's voice came through…kindly, methodical"), but it doesn't visibly constrain a choice with cost. Mira's actions (transcribing, planting, etching) could proceed without this trait; it colors her approach but doesn't enable or foreclose a path. Setup and payoff gates are met via lyric reprise, but no middle development beat ties the trait to a tradeoff, capping the score at mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Reestablish" is the core action: Mira comes "to reestablish what had been severed," and the penultimate paragraph confirms "they reestablished the archive." The planting, humming, etching, and stepping onto the new plank all serve this goal. The action appears in setup, drives multiple beats, and is confirmed at closure. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the archive's reestablishment is asserted rather than fully dramatized in its consequences, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Analogical thinking" is named once ("she transcribed them as analogical thinking, letting each clang equal a wedge-shaped sign") and demonstrated through the equation work ("love over time is velocity"). It shapes the middle transcription beat and the etching climax. Setup and development gates are met, and it participates in closure via the equation, but the mechanics are brief and could be reframed as "translation" without major edits, indicating moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is introduced immediately, handled across beats (swaying, iron leaves clicking, Mira kneeling at the rail joint, etching the leaf, the arbor resonating), and its extension via the new plank is the closure image. The arbor constrains Mira's position (suspended above clouds, tilting) and enables the archive's root (iron and starlight). Strong causal pressure, irreplaceability, and closure linkage; it is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the spirit leaves" frames the opening ("when the sky still echoed with the hollow after-ring") but does not function as a live clock. The timeframe is past-tense framing rather than a ticking constraint; Mira's actions proceed without urgency tied to the spirit's departure. Setup gate is met, but no middle or closure pressure derives from the timing, and swapping "after" for "during" would require only minor edits, indicating replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—"to reestablish what had been severed…the physics of transition"—is stated early, drives the transcription and planting beats, and is fulfilled at closure ("understood the physics of transition required symmetry"). The desire is tested through the seed's inertness and the mother's voice, creating friction. Strong setup, development, and payoff, with causal pressure. Minor: the motivation is more intellectual than viscerally conflicted; Mira never doubts or fears the goal, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Touching distance" is named mid-story ("touching distance…is the span between fingertip and memory") and enacted throughout: Mira never physically touches her mother but experiences her as pattern and waveform. The tone is elegiac and proximate, coherent across beats and modulating with the arbor's tilt and the mother's voice. It charges the final image (stepping through the waveform, the new plank). Strong closure linkage and thematic resonance, though the tone is stated once rather than fully embodied in micro-choices.</comment>
