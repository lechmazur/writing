<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist exists more as a conceptual vehicle than a character with embodied stakes. Her "fever dream architect" role is asserted through label ("unsettling calm," "her fevered mind") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The composite man appears as pure symbol without pressure application, and the protagonist's weaving proceeds without visible trade-offs or forfeited paths. No on-page choice narrows options with felt cost; the ending declares understanding ("she was the thread") rather than earning it through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is severely delayed: "who" remains abstract until line 11's composite man, "when" (twilight) appears only in line 1, and the spatial anchor (gallery corridors) emerges gradually without grounding the body in a specific room or threshold. The drive lens wobbles between accumulative (weaving patterns, auroras of pigment) and causal (thread altering foundation, composite man dissolving) without teaching a stable mode by midpoint. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing ("connection's texture was simply the weight of being witnessed") but the cost is asserted, not demonstrated—no on-page forfeiture or visible price anchors the realization. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies, triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The gallery's impossible geometry (Möbius corridors, paintings with tracking eyes, windows appearing at dawn) provides vivid sensory texture and constrains movement conceptually, but spatial choreography remains vague—where exactly does she stand when weaving, and how do walls "erupt in slow motion" without altering her position? The sinew thread catches on "corners that shouldn't exist," a purposeful constraint, and the final image of breathing walls returns with modest thematic weight. However, the body never uses a specific architectural feature to solve a problem or alter tactics, keeping the setting largely atmospheric.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("discover the texture of connection") is signaled early but never tested by a live trade-off or narrowing choice. The weaving accelerates and "patterns become more complex," yet no reversal forces her to choose between competing goods or forgo a path. The composite man's dissolution and the gallery's settling are presented as revelations rather than earned turns driven by protagonist agency. No visible price (time, stamina, relational cost) alters her tactics, and coincidence (dawn breaking, gallery stabilizing) resolves pressure without her renunciation or endurance foreclosing an option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (the texture of connection, being witnessed) emerges through recurring imagery—sinew thread, neural network, spaces between—but the final paragraph states the insight directly: "connection's texture was simply the weight of being witnessed." The composite man functions as overt allegory ("he was the gallery speaking"), and the closing lines ("as memories alter the architecture of what it means to be truly seen") moralize rather than letting the image resonate. The thread-as-neuron metaphor is consistent but not reweighted by a non-obvious cost; the realization feels imported rather than earned from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the lexicon ("rational enchantment," "realistically imaginary") maintains a surreal-clinical register throughout. However, diction drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the architecture of human bonds," "synapses of shared experience") that feels imposed rather than filtered through a fever-dreaming architect's embodied perception. The composite man's dialogue ("You're mapping the spaces between us") reads as thematic exposition rather than goal-driven speech. Perceptual signature is present (she processes impossibilities "with unsettling calm") but remains generic across beats; no rhythmic intensification under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Persistent template cadence: seven sentences begin with "The" in quick succession (lines 4, 8, 14, 17, 18, 22, 27), and runs of "She [verb]" / "Her [noun]" (lines 2, 6, 7, 16, 21, 28) create monotonous rhythm (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "as memories alter the shape of a life lived backward" (line 7) and "as memories alter the chemistry of dreaming" (line 17) restate the same metaphor without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphors ("dandelion seeds," "hurricane made of human connection") and filter-verb stacks ("She realized," "she understood," "She understood now") in lines 18, 20, 26, 28 dull immediacy (−0.5). Information density is low; many lines restate the weaving concept without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "gallery as neural network" and "sinew thread from dreams" offer a fresh visual synthesis, and the composite-face stranger is a purposeful rendering of connection itself. However, the emotional arc (architect discovers connection by becoming the thread) follows a predictable self-realization template common in metaphysical/"choose your lens" prompt fiction. The final insight—"she was the thread, the pattern, the space between"—lands as fusion-of-subject-and-object, a well-worn mystical resolution. No bold risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the piece hedges by declaring calm throughout, avoiding genuine vulnerability or failure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The fever dream architect is named in line 1, weaves throughout (lines 6, 13, 21), and "steps back into the world" at line 29—setup, development, payoff present. Yet her weaving proceeds without on-page choice between competing tactics or visible cost; she never pauses, doubts, or forfeits an option. The composite man dissolves without her decision causing it. She observes and enacts but does not decide under pressure, keeping her role ornamental to the closure's Conceptual Repricing.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sinew thread appears in line 2, is woven in lines 6, 8, 13, catches on corners (line 8), grows warmer (line 17), glows (line 22), and empties by line 29 (setup, development, payoff). It drives multiple beats (weaving alters the gallery, thread connects to every heart) and charges the final insight ("the texture of connection was the sinew thread itself"). However, the thread's mechanics remain abstract—no visible trade-off when it warms or glows—and its properties do not narrow her tactical options, keeping it functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Rational enchantment" is named in lines 3, 14, 23, 27, framing the premise, but it functions as thematic label rather than dramatized method. The text does not show how rationality enchants or what tactical choices the "rational" component enables versus pure enchantment. It appears as descriptor without constraining her weaving or altering the gallery's response, making it ornamental to the closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Realistically imaginary" appears in line 9 and returns in line 29, bracketing the piece, but it describes the space's ontology rather than constraining the architect's actions. The gallery's simultaneous real/imaginary state does not force a visible trade-off or enable a tactic unavailable in a purely real or purely imaginary setting. The trait is label-only, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Erupt" appears centrally in line 14: "walls erupting in slow motion as her rational enchantment took hold." This moment coincides with the gallery's transformation (paintings bleeding colors, line 15) and precedes her realization (line 18), anchoring a key escalation. However, the eruption is passive consequence of her weaving, not a decision or choice by her, and could be replaced with "shift," "fracture," or "bloom" without structural loss. It shapes one beat but is not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Weaving patterns" is signaled in line 6 ("fingers worked by weaving"), recurs in lines 13, 21, 23, and anchors the closure insight (line 26: "she had never been mapping connection from outside it—she was the thread, the pattern"). The method drives multiple beats (each stitch alters the gallery, acceleration approaches revelation) and is present in the ending image. Yet the mechanics remain abstract—what pattern versus another, and why this sequence?—keeping it essential but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The optical illusion gallery is named in line 1, its Möbius corridors and tracking-eyed paintings appear in lines 4–5, the thread catches on its impossible corners (line 8), walls erupt (line 14), and it "continues its eternal dance" in the closing image (line 31). The gallery is the stage for every beat, its geometry constrains movement ("spaces between spaces," line 8), and it becomes a character ("the gallery speaking," line 20). The setting is indispensable to the story's logic and participates in closure, though its impossible features do not force a tactical pivot—she weaves regardless of geometry.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"As memories alter" appears three times (lines 7, 17, 32), framing the temporal metaphor, and "twilight" (line 1) and "dawn" (line 28) bracket the night. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; she weaves at her own pace, and dawn arrives as atmospheric closure rather than deadline. The memory-alteration frame is thematic rather than tactical, present but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of connection" is stated in line 3 and resolved in lines 26 and 31 ("connection's texture was simply the weight of being witnessed"). The motivation is setup and payoff-present, but it is never conflicted—she does not choose between discovery and another want, nor does the cost of discovery (empty spool, line 29) alter her stance. The desire is told and fulfilled without friction, making it functional but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unsettling calm" appears in lines 16 and 31, and the prose maintains a measured, surreal register throughout—no panic, urgency, or tonal rupture despite walls erupting and bodies dissolving. The tone modulates subtly (sinew thread warming, gallery settling) and charges the final image of her walking away "with unsettling calm, knowing..." The coherence is strong, and the tone's restraint under pressure is purposeful, though a single static mood across all beats keeps it from reaching indispensability.</comment>
