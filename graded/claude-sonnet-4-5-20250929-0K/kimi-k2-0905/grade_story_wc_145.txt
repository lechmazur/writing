<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is selective and specific ("editor's instinct to annotate," the dry-witted register), and her descent is motivated by cumulative Registry frustration plus the phrasebook's childhood question. The protagonist's final choice—tearing the page and refusing coordinates—carries visible cost (defiance of employer, loss of proof). Minor slip: the falcon's role as pressure source feels more ornamental than urgent; Maren's decision to descend lacks a legible on-page struggle or trade-off in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren returns, brews coffee, begins a new map "Origin: classified," knowing the Registry will dismiss it—visible defiance with career cost, and the final image ("she listened for rivers learning to speak") reweights her stance from dutiful cataloger to witness-keeper. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered river words, glowing microorganisms, the spiral motif, culminating in thepage-dissolving image and her refusal to transmit coordinates. One meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes convergence as a moment, not a place, which narrows her choice to witness or report. Orientation is anchored early (outpost, frozen lake, Maren alone). Cost is legible: she defies the Registry, loses proof, and accepts mythologization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frozen lake and outpost constrain her physically (ice groans, warmth from below is "impossible at these latitudes"), and the phrasebook's tactile presence (dog-ear, brittle pages) anchors her childhood question. The underground estuary's carved labels and glowing microorganisms charge the final image: the page dissolves, transferring ink to the organisms, which carry it "through subterranean arteries toward every ocean." The spiral of condensation on glass recurs (window, breath on rungs, final frost spiral), modulating from domestic observation to cosmic motif. Micro-setting detail (tripod, limestone balcony, ribbed throat-cartilage walls) is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"where do the rivers begin?"—is signaled early via the phrasebook and Maren's six-winter catalog work. One meaningful tightening: the falcon's death and the radio's "convergence" force Maren to descend; recognition that convergence is a moment (not a map coordinate) narrows her choice to witness or report. The final act—tearing the page, letting it dissolve, refusing to transmit coordinates—is driven by protagonist agency and forecloses her Registry career with visible cost. The Registry's demand for coordinates becomes the final pressure point she refuses.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—origins, witness, and the cost of preserving mystery against institutional archive—emerges through the phrasebook's river words, the underground estuary's polyglot labels, and Maren's final refusal to transmit coordinates. The ending offers a non-literal answer: rivers (and origins) are not static map points but living, self-renewing mysteries that require witness, not capture. The page dissolving into microorganisms literalizes transmission as embodied practice rather than data. Minor slip: "subtly confident" and "worrying tranquility" appear as labels in exposition rather than being dramatized through Maren's specific micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Maren's perceptual signature is selective and profession-specific: she notices condensation spirals, dog-ears, mislabeled tributaries, the Registry's silence. Diction is controlled ("editor's instinct to annotate," "obsolete star charts," "ephemeral map"). Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the descent, wider at the estuary overview). The final paragraph's rhythmic compression ("she listened for rivers learning to speak") charges closure. Minor slip: "worrying tranquility" in the penultimate paragraph is author-voice rather than Maren's idiom, and "subtly confident" appears as label rather than enacted trait.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (the phrasebook simultaneously anchors childhood question, polyglot motif, and tactile prop). The spiral motif (condensation, Braille-like rungs, final frost) recurs without loops. Figurative language is controlled ("throat cartilage," "rivers knitting themselves into a single silver thread"). Minor debt: "breath-born droplets" and "puppeteered by warm air" edge toward strained metaphor; "the first genuine expression the empty outpost had ever seen" anthropomorphizes the setting in a way that dilutes Maren's agency. "Worrying tranquility" in the penultimate paragraph is a stock phrase that labels rather than enacts tone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—polyglot convergence as a literal underground moment—synthesizes cartography, linguistic anthropology, and Registry defiance in a fresh way. The page dissolving into microorganisms is a non-obvious closure image that reweights Maren's role from cataloger to transmitter. Risk: the fantastical estuary could collapse into whimsy, but grounding details (limestone balcony, tripod rope, frost spiral) anchor the turn. Minor proximity note: the "throat" imagery (ice crack, cartilage walls, subterranean arteries) is vivid but risks anatomical over-extension. The final map title "Origin: classified" economically captures her new stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's dry-witted editor persona is signaled early (six winters, mislabeled tributaries, "swallowed her editor's instinct to annotate") and shapes her peak choice: she tears the illuminated page and refuses to transmit coordinates, defying the Registry. The trait constrains her impulse to document and enables her final renunciation. Present in setup (outpost work), development (descent decision), and payoff (refusal to transmit). Cost: career defiance. Cap eligibility met; score reflects two beats plus closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The phrasebook dog-ear marks river words (Finnish *joki*, Quechua *mayu*, Mongolian *gol*) introduced early and charged with Maren's childhood question. She speaks "mayu" aloud at the ice crack, which triggers the liquid chime and opens the shaft. The object's polyglot content is mirrored by the estuary's carved labels and the glowing microorganisms spelling the words. Present in setup (tactile dog-ear), development (spoken word opens shaft), and payoff (thematic echo in underground labels). Two functional beats; closure linkage via thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" is the radio's one-word message that frames Maren's quest. She realizes mid-descent that "the singular convergence wasn't a place on any map; it was a moment when every river's origin story overlapped." This recognition narrows her choice to witness or report. Present in setup (radio transmission), development (realization shifts her stance), and payoff (she refuses to transmit coordinates, preserving the moment over the map). The concept shapes her final tactic. Three gates met; causal pressure in one key turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" appears once as exposition label ("Maren, dry-witted and subtly confident") and recurs in the penultimate paragraph where "a cartographer in Helsinki would pause...feeling subtly confident." No on-page action is visibly enabled or constrained by this trait; it reads as tonal flavor rather than a driver of choice. Missing middle development; no cost tied to confidence. Ornamental use; late reprise does not reweight stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The falcon's return—"three days late, one wing frost-torn"—triggers the radio's "convergence" message and provides a blood-specked trail Maren follows to the lake's northern throat. The falcon's death on the corroded tripod and its impossible hover signal the shaft's opening. Without the falcon, Maren would have no vector to the convergence site. Present in setup (inciting return), development (guides route), and payoff (its tripod becomes her anchor rope). Three gates; causal pressure across two beats; irreplaceable as the herald.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The condensation pattern is introduced early (Maren watches "how the breath-born droplets slid toward a common center, forming a spiral she recognized from obsolete star charts"). The spiral recurs on the descent rungs ("forming the same spiral pattern, guiding her down like Braille") and as the final frost mark where the shaft had been. The pattern is the story's visual grammar: convergence as spiral. Present in setup (window observation), development (descent guidance), and payoff (final frost spiral). Shapes her recognition and charges the closure image. High irreplaceability; three beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The outpost anchors Maren's isolation and Registry employment; the frozen lake supplies the physical constraint (groaning ice, impossible warmth) and the shaft entrance. She locks the outpost behind her, descends through the lake, and returns to brew coffee and begin a new map there. The setting pressures her choice (remote, Registry-monitored) and provides the tripod anchor. Present in setup (outpost creaking, lake stretched), development (lake throat, shaft descent), and payoff (return to outpost for defiant mapmaking). Three gates; meaningful constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the falcon returns" frames the inciting incident; the falcon's three-day delay is noted but not tracked as live clock pressure during the descent and return. Time remains vague (twilight at return; no sense of hours elapsed underground). The timeframe sets the starting gun but does not tighten tactics. Present in setup (falcon return triggers radio); missing live escalation in middle; weakly present in payoff (twilight return). Two gates barely met; no urgency compounding.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Where do the rivers begin?" is Maren's childhood question, anchored in the phrasebook dog-ear and her six winters cataloging dead ends. The descent and estuary discovery dramatize the pursuit; her final choice—tearing the page, refusing coordinates—reveals friction between her desire to know and her refusal to let the Registry bury the data. The motivation is conflicted and drives the closure choice. Present in setup (phrasebook question), development (descent decision), and payoff (refusal to transmit). Cost: she preserves mystery over proof.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Worrying tranquility" is named in the opening ("sky too calm for comfort") and closing paragraphs ("radiating worrying tranquility"). The tone coheres through Maren's dry-witted register and the estuary's hushed awe. The phrase modulates from external unease (pre-descent) to Maren's acceptance (post-return, she no longer listens for radios). Present in setup and payoff; tone charges the final image but is partly label-driven rather than enacted through rhythm. Lyric reprise reweights slightly; two gates met.</comment>
