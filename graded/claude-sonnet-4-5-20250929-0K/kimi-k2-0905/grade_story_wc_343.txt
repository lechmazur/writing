<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is consistent—curiosity-driven, tied to her mother's legacy—and her interiority carries specificity ("fingers tracing coastlines that official maps insisted did not exist"). The climactic choice to read the dialects aloud feels somewhat unmotivated; we see no prior internal deliberation about why this particular act would work, and the chief engineer's "Ship needs a tale bright enough to burn" arrives late as a new rule. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally slides into stock phrases ("knees shook," "heart faltering"). The final shift from isolation to shared horizon registers, but the path feels compressed rather than earned through accumulated internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation arrives cleanly (airship, chart-room, Lira). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: spirals, translations, and starling murmurations accrete toward a final image where light and story merge. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira's spoken dialects restore the ship's luminance and dissolve sociable isolation—but the cost is unclear. What does Lira forfeit or foreclose by giving the ship "a story"? The captain's acknowledgment and the new map line are gains, not prices. The chief engineer's late-breaking rule ("light-feed runs on stories, not coal") introduces a mechanism that was not seeded earlier, weakening causal ground. One meaningful tightening occurs (lamps dim → Lira acts), but the resolution feels given rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The antique airship is vividly particular: "brass ribs creaking like an old librarian," "copper pipes sweated pale steam," "moonlight fell through grates in silver ladders." Spatial choreography is clean across chart-room, cargo deck, and engine galley. The hopscotch board and its chalk arrows become a micro-setting that charges Lira's discovery. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("flour-fine dust," "shadows pooled like spilled ink"). The airship itself pressures the plot—failing lights threaten to strand *Aurelia*—and the cargo-deck patterns directly enable the climactic solution. The starling murmurations outside function as both atmosphere and thematic mirror.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake is clear: prevent the airship's lights from failing and keep *Aurelia* aloft. Pressure coheres and tightens once (lamps dim further, Lira sprints to the engine galley). The chief engineer's prompt—"Ship needs a tale bright enough to burn; got one?"—arrives as a new rule rather than an earned escalation from prior tactics, reducing agency. Lira's reading of the dialects works, but coincidence resolves: the starlings form a double-helix that mirrors her tracings without prior setup, and the ship "inhales" without Lira making a trade-off. The resolution is protagonist-initiated but feels convenient. No visible price is paid; Lira gains recognition and a shared horizon without forfeiting a path or resource.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: language as map, light as memory, isolation vs. connection. The dog-eared phrasebook and the hopscotch spirals function as concrete anchors. "Light remembers its way home" and the final line "a story that would not be stranded again" avoid stating a moral yet resonate thematically. The sociable isolation motif is embodied in crew behavior and lifted by the ending without a tidy resolution. No thematic echo mars the final paragraph. The piece invites reflection on how stories sustain communities, and the starling murmuration—shifting, then dissolving—offers a non-literal answer. Minor: the seventeen dead dialects and "every tongue held a hidden latitude" flirt with abstraction but are anchored by Lira's concrete actions.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Lira's POV throughout; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is close, with purposeful pulls to wide for scene-setting ("antique airship *Aurelia* drifted"). Perceptual signature is strong: "starlings wheeled in autumn murmurations, their shifting shapes reminding her of uncharted currents she longed to name." Dialogue is minimal but functional: the captain's "You've given her a story" and the chief's "Ship needs a tale bright enough to burn" carry goal-driven subtext. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter sentences as lamps dim). Diction is controlled and character-appropriate. Free indirect style is clean. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Brief elision of how Lira knows to read aloud is acceptable given the lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; no algorithmic patterns. Sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in many lines ("She carried no compass tonight; instead she clutched a polyglot's phrasebook dog-ear..."). The hopscotch-board discovery is vivid and propulsive. Minor loop: "stranded luminance" appears twice—once as description, once as internal metaphor—without reweighting; the second use feels like synonym churn. The phrase "sociable isolation" is stated outright rather than left implicit. A few stock constructions slip through: "knees shook," "heart faltering," "spilled ink." Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "light-feed runs on stories, not coal" is a late metaphor that borders on convenient. No major scaffold or paraphrase loops. Clarity is maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The airship-setting and polyglot-apprentice pairing offer a fresh angle on "language as power" material. The hopscotch board as artifact and the notion that stories fuel light-based engines add specificity. The starling-murmuration motif is handled with care, not merely decorative. Tropes (apprentice discovers hidden knowledge) are grounded in particular details (seventeen dead dialects, chalk spirals). However, the "ship runs on stories" rule feels like a clever twist introduced late rather than organically seeded, and the coincidental starling double-helix at the climax tips toward narrative convenience. Emotional truth is present but not deeply complex; Lira's arc is sympathetic yet somewhat predictable. The ending's shared-light image is resonant but not entirely surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Lira is signaled early (first paragraph) and present throughout. Her choices create key turns: she wanders to the cargo deck (setup), copies the spirals and translates them (middle development), and reads the dialects aloud to restore the ship's light (closure participation). Each choice narrows options and pressures the outcome. Removing her would break the story's logic. The causal chain from observation to translation to spoken act is clear, though the final decision feels slightly under-motivated in the moment. Strong integration across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dog-eared phrasebook scrap appears in paragraph 4 (setup within first third), is used again when Lira copies spirals onto it (middle development), and is unfolded and read aloud at the climax (closure participation). It carries specificity: "torn from her late mother's pocket notebook, inked with translations of light in seventeen dead dialects." Its properties matter—the translations enable the final act—so it is not easily swappable. However, the scrap is handled more than inhabited; we don't see Lira struggle with its condition or weigh its sentimental cost. Two distinct beats plus closure linkage and causal pressure place it solidly, but the lack of visible trade-off or charged reprise (e.g., risking damage to the heirloom) caps the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Stranded luminance" is named twice: once as the ship's "running-lamps had begun to dim, a stranded luminance flickering" and again as "the airship's heart faltering, a stranded luminance now inside metal veins." The concept shapes the central stake—prevent the lights from failing—and the resolution directly addresses it (lights restored). It appears early (setup), pressures the middle (lamps dim further), and is resolved at closure (bulbs brighten, engines hum). However, the phrase itself is more poetic label than dramatized constraint; the mechanics of "stranded luminance" are never explained or tested in a way that narrows Lira's tactics. The story could function with "failing lights" as the concept. Causal role is present but the specificity of "stranded" does not add irreplaceable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is mentioned in paragraph 2: "her diligently curious fingers tracing coastlines." The trait is shown through Lira's actions—she traces unofficial coastlines, wanders the cargo deck, copies spirals, reads her mother's phrasebook—but the label "diligently curious" itself does not constrain a choice with visible cost. The trait enables exploration but does not force a trade-off (e.g., curiosity leading her into danger or causing her to miss a simpler solution). It is more characterization shorthand than a pressure lever. Present by the first third and consistent with her arc, but primarily ornamental. Functional but replaceable; "persistent" or "inquisitive" would work equally well.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Note" (the action of recording or observing) drives multiple beats: Lira notes coastlines on cracked slate (setup), notes secret patterns in the cargo-deck hopscotch board and copies them onto the phrasebook scrap (middle development), and the final map line she draws is an act of notation (closure participation). The climactic turn—reading the dialects aloud—grows from the prior noting and translating. Removing the note action would collapse the causal chain. The action is present across all three gates with strong causal pressure. Minor: "noting" as a verb is somewhat passive; Lira's agency could be sharper if the noting were shown as a harder choice under constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hopscotch board appears in the cargo deck (paragraph 10), mid-story but within the first half. Lira "began noting secret patterns in the squares: chalk arrows half-erased, heel-scuffs forming spirals, initials that rearranged themselves into compass roses." She copies the spirals onto the phrasebook scrap and later reads the translated phrases aloud, which restores the ship's light. The method is signaled, its mechanics matter (patterns → translation → spoken restoration), and it shapes the middle attempt and the climax. However, the connection between "noting patterns in a dusty hopscotch board" and "ship's light restored" is mediated by the late-breaking rule that the ship "runs on stories." The method is essential but arrives slightly late (second third) and the causal link feels partly coincidental. Two beats plus closure linkage, but swappability and late signal lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The antique airship *Aurelia* is named in the opening line and remains the sole setting throughout. It supplies resources (chart-room, cargo deck with hopscotch board, engine galley with light-bulbs) and constraints (failing lights threaten to strand the ship above the clouds). The setting pressures every choice: Lira must solve the ship's luminance problem or *Aurelia* becomes "a ghost above the clouds, another blank space on someone else's map." The hopscotch board on the cargo deck directly enables the solution. Spatial choreography is clear and the airship's failing state escalates the stakes. The setting is indispensable; no other location would provide the same constellation of resources and pressures. Strong setup, development, and closure linkage with high causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Amid starling murmurations" is mentioned early (paragraph 3: "starlings wheeled in autumn murmurations") and reprised at the climax ("Starlings outside suddenly veered, forming a perfect double-helix"). The timeframe is more atmospheric anchor than clock; it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The murmurations function as thematic mirror and visual motif rather than temporal constraint. The story unfolds in a continuous night ("no compass tonight"), but the passage of time is vague and does not pressure Lira's choices. The element is present in setup and closure but does not shape middle development or force urgency. Ornamental use with lyric reprise; functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To chart the next great discovery" is stated in paragraph 5: "Lira meant to chart the next great discovery by learning where language and landscape intersect." The motivation drives Lira's wandering to the cargo deck, her copying of spirals, and the final map line labeled *Murmuration Passage*. It is present in setup, shapes middle exploration, and is fulfilled at closure when she draws the new line. However, the desire is more told than dramatized in conflict; we do not see Lira weigh the cost of pursuing discovery versus, say, immediate safety or crew approval. The motivation is consistent and causal but lacks friction or visible trade-off. Strong setup and closure linkage, moderate development, but the motivation could be swapped for "prove herself" or "honor her mother" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is introduced explicitly in paragraph 8: "Sociable isolation ruled the gondola: crew members nodded, smiled, then retreated to separate alcoves." The tone is embodied in Lira's experience ("invited everywhere and nowhere, free to roam yet never truly inside the circle") and is resolved at the end: "She felt the sociable isolation lift; she was still alone with her thoughts, yet the air between people now carried currents of shared light." The tone modulates with pressure—loneliness sharpens as the lights dim—and charges the final image. However, the phrase "sociable isolation" is stated outright rather than left implicit, and the final paragraph nearly summarizes the tonal shift. Present across setup, development, and closure with coherent modulation, but the explicitness and summary lower the score. Lyric reprise with reweighted meaning.</comment>
