<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and embodied through physical choices (wire wrapping, grafting, altar-sleeping). Internal contradiction emerges in the tension between her systematic nature and the deadline's mysticism, though her flawless execution under terminal illness strains credibility. The fox and bats function more as symbolic witnesses than pressuring characters; Mara's solitary agency drives all choices. Minor deduction for competence without visible struggle: her hands shake once but the wire "steadies them," softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—copper circuit completion accumulates toward a single cadence shift when "the orchard answered with a low chime" and creatures "felt the treaty settle into marrow." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes interspecies respect with undeniable pressure, though the cost is conceptual (her departure, the transfer of pulse to the system) rather than viscerally felt. Orientation anchors promptly (caretaker, orchard, six months, morning). One meaningful deepening occurs when the diary page wrapped around copper junction literalizes the transfer. Minor penalty: the "treaty" metaphor becomes over-explicit in the final third, nudging tell over dramatized show.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stone pillars "grown, seeded by ancients who sang calcium into lattice" and copper wire constrain Mara's remodeling method; the orchard's micro-currents shape her tactics across multiple beats. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "pillars cry…fragrant resin," "harmless blue fire that smelled of chamomile and rain." The final image charges when footprints fill with copper dust, grounding the mystical transfer in tactile specificity. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (altar, ladder, rows, sea path).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—foster interspecies respect before death—is signaled early and drives all moves. Escalation accumulates through wire wrapping (seven branches by twilight), bat acceptance, fox witnessing, tourist participation, culminating in the final copper junction and chime. One tightening: the diary-page-as-conductor literalizes the pulse transfer and forecloses Mara's presence. Minor friction: the foxes and bats consent too easily; no species resists or complicates, flattening potential conflict. Cost is visible (Mara departs, leaves the diary, footprints reabsorbed) but the orchard's success feels guaranteed rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—communion across species and materials—emerges organically through copper circuits, grafted fruit, and the treaty encoded in "sap and ore." The final image of footprints filling with copper dust offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Mara's pulse absorbed into the system without moralizing. Slight deduction for near-explicit thematic summary in "broadcasting respect at twenty-four beats per minute, the exact cadence of a human heart learning to listen," which leans toward statement over implication. The orchard-as-organism conceit remains concrete and particular throughout, avoiding allegory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices micro-currents, copper patina, and cadence ("twenty-four beats per minute"). Diction is elevated and consistent, though register occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism ("corridors bent like intestines toward mutual understanding") that strains the caretaker's lexicon under terminal illness. Dialogue is minimal (brief exchanges with tourists, direct address to the orchard) and functional. Minor penalty for head-hopping: "the fox yawned…Mara took the gesture as consent" assumes vulpine intent without earning it through prior dramatization of the fox's stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and occasionally muddles clarity: "stone pillars vibrating like struck bells" works, but "footprints that filled with copper dust, a trail the island would reabsorb before the next tide" stacks metaphors without grounding the mechanics. Paraphrase loop in paragraph 2–3: "decided the news was not a death sentence but a deadline" then "Final renovation—purpose: foster interspecies respect" restates the same resolve. Template cadence in the wire-wrapping sequence: "She spoke…She slept…She began" across three consecutive paragraphs. Information density is strong elsewhere; sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for mixed metaphor at closure (copper dust/tidal reabsorption).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of botanical caretaking, terminal illness, and interspecies diplomacy through copper circuitry is specific and non-obvious. The copper-as-conductor conceit feels fresh and irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the story's logic. Minor deduction: the "gently systematic" + mystical communion blend risks the safety middle—enough strangeness to feel literary, enough structure to avoid risk. The foxes and bats accept the treaty without resistance, which eases the path rather than forcing Mara into harder ethical calculus. Strong specificity in the orchard's mechanics (micro-amps, grafting apricot onto quince) elevates above generic eco-mysticism.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices—wire wrapping, grafting, diary-page wrapping, departure—drive all key beats. Early signal (paragraph 1), development across wire-wrapping and grafting, closure participation (final junction and departure). Causal pressure: her systematic method shapes each tactic. Visible cost: she leaves the diary and walks away, footprints reabsorbed. High irreplaceability: the caretaker role is essential to botanical and architectural knowledge.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Botanical diary appears in paragraph 3 (altar slab), returns when Mara records bat event (paragraph 13), and is wrapped around copper junction then left on the altar (paragraphs 24, 26). Three beats, early signal, closure participation. Cost: abandoning the diary literalizes the pulse transfer. Swappability friction: a generic journal could substitute with minor edits; the "botanical" specificity matters less than the act of wrapping and leaving. Mid-band for functional but not irreplaceable use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Architectural secrets ("encoded in the angles of branches and the copper patina," paragraph 4) frame Mara's method early and shape her wire-wrapping tactics. Development: the secret is enacted through copper circuits and grafting. Closure linkage: the remodeled orchard "stood…a gently systematic organism" realizes the secret. Minor friction: the concept is more atmospheric than mechanically decisive; the story would function with "orchard restoration" substituted. Reaches lower 5-band for shaping one turn without high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is signaled early (paragraph 3, 5: "surveyor's eye, gently systematic"), constrains her methodical wire-wrapping and grafting across multiple beats, and appears in the final image ("gently systematic organism"). Cost connection: the trait enables her terminal project's completion. Slight swappability: "methodical" or "deliberate" could replace with minor tonal shift. Reaches mid-6s for shaping tactics and returning at closure with modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Remodel" drives the entire arc: framed in paragraph 3 ("Final renovation"), enacted through wire-wrapping and grafting (paragraphs 6, 11, 15, 20), and completed in the final image ("the temple orchard stood remodeled," paragraph 27). High causal pressure: every beat advances the remodeling. Closure linkage strong. Cost visible: Mara's pulse transferred, departure. High irreplaceability: substituting "repair" or "restore" would miss the architectural reimagining. Reaches high 8s for indispensability across setup, development, payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Copper wire signaled early (paragraph 6, "fresh coil…warm from her pocket"), used across multiple beats (wrapping seven branches by twilight, final spiral, diary-page junction), and shapes the orchard's frequency that bats and foxes respond to. Mechanics matter: micro-currents and conductivity enable the interspecies communication. Closure participation: the final copper junction triggers the chime. High irreplaceability: no substitute material carries the conductive + symbolic charge. Reaches mid-7s for essential causal work and closure shaping.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Temple orchard and living stone pillars constrain Mara's method (copper buried between stone roots, pillars that "approved of conductivity"), supply resources (oak, stone altar, chamomile border), and charge the final image (pillars vibrating, orchard as single organism). Early signal (paragraph 1–2), development (stone pillars listening, sweating resin), closure participation (pillars vibrating like struck bells, orchard broadcasting). High irreplaceability: the setting's animate properties are indispensable to the treaty's mechanics. Cost connection: the setting absorbs Mara's footprints, literalizing the transfer.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Six-month deadline is signaled early (paragraph 1, "six months to live") and frames Mara's urgency ("not a death sentence but a deadline"). Development: hands shake in month five (paragraph 18), but time otherwise does not visibly tighten tactics beat-to-beat. Closure linkage weak: the ending reads timeless rather than deadline-driven. Functional but replaceable: the story would hold with "terminal illness" substituted for the specific timeframe. Reaches lower 5-band for framing motivation without mechanically narrowing options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Foster interspecies respect" is signaled early (paragraph 3, "Final renovation—purpose") and drives wire-wrapping, grafting bilingual fruit, and the treaty metaphor. Development: Mara's choices consistently pursue the goal. Closure participation: "the treaty settle into marrow" and "broadcasting respect" literalize the motivation. Minor friction: the goal is declared more than conflicted; no species resists, so Mara never faces a trade-off between respect and another want. Cost visible (departure, pulse transfer) but tied more to mortality than to the motivation's friction. Reaches low 7s for shaping tactics without internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Brazen calm" is signaled early (paragraph 8, greeting fox "with the same brazen calm she used for tourists and typhoons"), modulates under pressure (hands shake but wire steadies them, paragraph 18), and charges the final image (she "descended the ladder for the last time" without surrender, paragraph 26). Coherent through turns: the tone holds steady rather than fragmenting. Minor friction: the tone is more static mood than dynamically modulated; peak beats (bat descent, final chime) maintain the same register. Reaches mid-6s for coherence and closure presence without steep modulation.</comment>
