<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maela's choices drive key beats—pulling the slide from her pocket, wedging it into driftwood, carving with storm guidance—but her interior voice tilts abstract ("perpetually learning the grammar of currents") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The decision to leave GPS drowned feels more symbolic gesture than earned renunciation with visible cost on the page. Micro-choices exist but lack friction between competing impulses; she moves through the storm without genuine missteps or self-deception that would raise stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece establishes who/where/when by ~100 words (Maela, archway, GPS failure), teaches a lyric pattern early (spirals, perpetual learning, layered meanings), and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the carved archway becomes a conduit, storm pauses, shadows scatter into gulls, Maela rows outward choosing the unmarked map. The final image reweights velocity-as-arrival and escape-as-letting-go with felt cost (GPS drowned, old coordinates abandoned). One meaningful deepening: the slide dissolves into sculpture, charging the closure. Closure coheres under the accumulative lens with conceptual cost legible in the final breath.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Basalt archway, tide-wet stone, salt-gray wood, and storm pressure constrain Maela's choices—she must carve during the lightning duel, wedge the slide into driftwood grain. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (foam across lenses, pine pitch smell, turbine-hum, oarlock hush) and filtered through sculptor's priorities. The archway functions as ledger and throat, its grooves signatures of debt; it charges the final image when the carved miniature echoes the stone arch. Spatial choreography stays coherent across storm, carving, and skiff departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decide whether the slide is gift or geas, resolved when Maela understands the archway as ledger and carves the fleet into permanence. Storm escalates sensory pressure; the slide's spiral rotation and shadow-fleet projection tighten options until she must carve "with the wood's memory." The final act—setting the miniature on the tidal line, rowing outward, drowning GPS—forecloses return to satellite navigation with visible cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when "the slide dissolved into the sculpture," making the choice irreversible. Agency reads as attention and endurance more than decision conflict, capping higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: velocity reimagined as arrival, debt and rescue layered like barnacles, complexity scaffolded by simplicity. The spiral motif shifts meaning—etched glass → rotating lattice → burned heartwood—without overt statement. Final image offers non-literal answer: the carved archway singing "echo and answer," Maela choosing the storm-drawn map over coordinates. The piece resists moralizing; "perpetually learning the balance between leaving and letting go" threads action rather than summarizing theme. Slight penalty for "the next breath of wind" verging on platitude, but earlier layering earns the quiet ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature (sculptor noticing grain, pitch, barnacle accretion). Vocabulary fits an artist in storm reverie—"geas," "stylus," "armature"—but occasionally drifts elevated ("timewoven alliances," "turbine-hum reverie") in ways that feel authorial rather than Maela's idiom under pressure. No dialogue on the page. Sentence rhythm modulates well (short bursts during storm, longer cadences during carving). Minor filter-verb use ("felt her own pulse recruited") doesn't dull immediacy. Compression at closure ("just horizon, just wood, just the next breath") serves the ending without obscuring focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"throat that swallowed half the horizon," "gears of salt and starlight," "words forgiven"—without always advancing pressure; several adjacent sentences loop conceptually ("perpetually learning" recurs three times, "layered meanings" twice). Template cadence appears mid-story: "She understood then... She wedged... She began to carve..." Propulsion sags slightly when projection mechanics are explained rather than dramatized. Clarity at closure holds (archway singing, GPS drowned, skiff outward), preventing deeper penalties. No major loops or scaffolding in the final third, allowing the ending to breathe.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—sculptor reads storm as lesson, lantern slide as stylus rewriting archway ledger, carving as dialogue with timewoven fleet—feels specific and earned. "Magic lantern slide in whale rib" and "archway as ledger of debt and rescue" offer fresh angles on artist-responds-to-place material. The storm-as-permission framing and GPS-drowning closure avoid cliché. Risk-taking in lyric compression and accumulative structure heightens resonance without obscuring stakes. Slight derivative echo in "perpetually learning" refrain and "escape as arrival" inversion, but transformation through embodied detail (pine pitch, oarlocks, glass dust glimmering) restores originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maela present throughout; her choices—pulling slide, wedging it, carving, setting miniature, rowing outward—create all key turns. Setup early (sculptor at archway), middle development (carving decision), closure participation (she rows outward choosing the unmarked map). Causal pressure high; her agency drives escalation and ending. Cost visible (GPS drowned, coordinates abandoned). Irreplaceable: no other character could substitute without breaking the sculptor-specific logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lantern slide pulled from pocket, wedged into driftwood, spirals rotate and project fleet, dissolves into sculpture. Three distinct beats plus closure linkage (spiral burned into heartwood charges final image). Setup early, middle enabling (projection guides carving), payoff clear (dissolution makes choice permanent). Cost tied to it (slide consumed). Slightly swappable with another magical object, capping top band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timewoven alliances shown on-page via projected fleet gestures (shielding child, trading cedar box, standing watch). Setup clear (shadows layered meanings), middle development (sailors step closer, thread through chisel), closure participation (fleet kneels, scatters into gulls). Shapes one key turn (Maela understands archway as ledger) but does not narrow options or force tactical trade-offs with visible cost tied to alliance mechanics. More thematic accent than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Perpetually learning" appears three times (grammar of currents, learning horizon like Maela learns wood, balance between leaving and letting go). Setup present, thematic reprise at closure reweights the attribute. Does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost; functions as motif rather than limiter. Label-only in early mentions; final use ("perpetually learning the balance") charges the ending slightly. Lyric resonance lifts it into mid-band but swappability with "always discovering" or "endlessly adapting" caps higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reimagine" drives the premise (escape as arrival), the carving process ("reimagining darkness into layered meanings" via glass dust), and closure choice (choosing storm-drawn map over GPS coordinates). Setup early (first paragraph), middle enabling (carving with memory reimagines fleet), payoff clear (final line: "just horizon, just wood, just the next breath"). Two beats plus closure. Cost visible (old navigation abandoned). Essential to the arc; substituting "reinterpret" or "transform" would weaken specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Layered meanings" shown via barnacle metaphor (gestures accrete), shadow fleet, and carving that lets "each curl fall like a word forgiven." Setup present, middle enabling (meanings thread through chisel), closure participation (glass dust reimagines darkness into layered meanings). Shapes carving tactic but mechanics remain abstract; no visible cost tied to the layering method itself. More motif than constraint, capping higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway present throughout; basalt throat frames action, storm hurls foam and lightning, archway's grooves are signatures, it becomes ledger. Setup immediate, middle development (storm pressure forces carving timing, archway leans in at pause), closure participation (archway sings in two voices, Maela rows away from it). Environment constrains choices (must carve during storm) and charges final image. Irreplaceable; another setting would break the ledger logic. Cost clear (leaving archway behind, no return).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>GPS fails in opening, framing the entire sequence; Maela abandons coordinates at closure, leaving it "drowned." Setup immediate (hour ago), middle implicit (storm duration pressures carving), closure strong (GPS flickers back, she ignores it). Time pressures the decision window—carving must happen during storm pause—and ending choice rejects clock time for storm-drawn rhythms. Two beats plus closure. Cost visible (navigation tool forsaken). Essential to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Scaffold complexity with simplicity" motivates the carving choice: "the grain smelled of shipwreck and pine pitch, a smell that told her to scaffold complexity with simplicity." Setup present (second half), closure echo ("just horizon, just wood, just the next breath"). Does not face on-page friction or force a trade-off with visible cost; the storm cooperates, the carving succeeds cleanly. Told more than dramatized. Lyric reprise reweights slightly but swappability with "distill" or "clarify" and lack of middle conflict cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Turbine-hum reverie" named explicitly; tone sustained via lyric compression, elevated diction (geas, stylus, armature), sensory layering (foam, pitch, oarlocks), and mythic imagery (fleet, throat, gulls). Coherent through storm intensity and carving absorption; modulates slightly at closure (hush, quieter cadence). Charges final image (turbine-hum fades into oarlock rhythm). Present early, shapes middle atmosphere, participates in ending. Specificity high but could be approximated by "dreamlike focus" with minor edits, capping top band.</comment>
