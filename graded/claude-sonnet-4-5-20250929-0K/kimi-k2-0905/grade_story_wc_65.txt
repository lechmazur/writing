<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cartographer's motivation ("to seed innovation within a constraint") is stated but not embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her sacrifice unfolds as a predetermined ritual rather than emerging from pressure-tested choice. The transformation into "the blank page she had feared" reads as abstract metaphor without visible cost that forecloses a live option. Interiority relies heavily on elevated philosophical language ("ignorance wasn't absence but a deliberate clearing") that distances rather than grounds emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who and where anchor early, but "when" (the pre-dawn temporal frame) remains decorative rather than constraining. The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural mode but the final image—stepping off the spire and "becoming the blank page"—offers Conceptual Repricing without legible cost; the consequence is told ("leaving a tattoo," "a child would later find") rather than felt on the page. The cartographer's agency is passive surrender, not a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("breath crystallizing," "low frequency that made her teeth ache"). The spire's spiral staircase and the lake's "hairline crack shaped like a question mark" charge the final image. However, spatial choreography weakens when the cartographer "stepped off the spire's edge, not falling but folding"—the physics of this moment is metaphorical rather than embodied, breaking the established material logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"only one future could be written before dawn cracked the ice"—is signaled but never tested through meaningful tightening or reversal. The cartographer's actions (walking, listening, writing mid-air) unfold as ritual without escalation; no live option is foreclosed by her choices. Dawn's arrival functions as scenic backdrop rather than a constraint that narrows tactics. The sacrifice of memories ("first, the taste of summer peaches; then, her mother's voice; finally, her own name") is a descent checklist without visible cost that alters later moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (ignorance as creative clearing, constraint enabling innovation) emerges through imagery rather than moralizing. The recurring motif of the kingfisher feather quill and the lake's "perfect surface" builds resonance. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("by writing the conditions for futures to write themselves") and the coda's direct statement ("her sacrifice a sustaining transformation") replace scene pressure with exposition. The ending offers thematic echo rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person-limited with distinct perceptual filters ("groundedly imaginative as glacier-melt carving valleys it would never see"). Register drifts into elevated philosophical diction during peak beats: "ignorance wasn't absence but a deliberate clearing" and "the necessary vacuum before creation" flatten immediacy. The cartographer's interior voice converges with narratorial summary rather than maintaining character-specific perception under stress. Free indirect style is clean but lacks rhythmic modulation as pressure builds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "darkness moved before the pen meets the blank page," "futures consume their authors," "frost flowers blooming from hairline cracks." Mixed metaphors ("kingfisher feather quill nib grew heavier, drinking not just her warmth but her weight, her shadow, the sound of her heartbeat") violate physical logic. Paraphrase loops: "the constraint revealed itself as gift: within boundaries, innovation flourished" restates the premise without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the final third: repeated "she wrote/began/understood" stems flatten momentum at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, prophetic writing, and voluntary erasure offers a fresh angle. The kingfisher feather quill as a tool that "drank her warmth greedily" is specific and memorable. However, the core premise (artist sacrifices self to enable others' creativity) closely follows familiar archetype templates. The final image—"becoming the blank page she had feared"—lands as poetic abstraction rather than an inevitable, risk-taking consequence rooted in prior causality. The story hedges its boldest move by summarizing outcomes in the coda rather than trusting the charged image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The ignorance cartographer is present throughout and makes the choice to write at the summit. However, her actions are ritualistic observation and surrender rather than decisions that create key turns. The transformation happens *to* her rather than through her agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The kingfisher feather quill nib is introduced early (gifted by a woman who spoke only in questions), handled in multiple beats (touching it to her fingertip, writing mid-air, dissolving into her palm), and returns with reweighted meaning (tattoo of a door). It enables the writing action and charges the sacrifice sequence, though the mechanics of how it works remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Writing the future" shapes the nominal stakes (writing one future before dawn) and appears throughout. However, the concept functions more as thematic framing than tactical constraint; the writing itself is described metaphorically ("tracing the shape of a door") without concrete mechanics that alter options or test choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Groundedly imaginative" appears once as label-only simile ("as groundedly imaginative as glacier-melt carving valleys it would never see") without constraining or enabling an on-page action. The trait does not generate visible tradeoffs or pressure-tested choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Prevail" is the stated goal ("to prevail not by conquering the blank page but by surrendering to it") and the cartographer achieves it through sacrifice. However, the action is passive endurance rather than a turning decision; swapping "prevail" for "succeed" or "transform" would not alter the narrative structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Predictive modeling" is mentioned twice: once as method ("Her predictive modeling required no calculations—only listening") and once when it "took root in the ice." The mechanics are never shown; it functions as abstract label rather than dramatized means that shapes attempts or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake are introduced immediately, present in every beat, and structurally essential. The spire's spiral staircase provides the physical journey; the lake's "perfect surface" and final "hairline crack shaped like a question mark" charge the closure image. The setting pressures the cartographer's movement and supplies the constraint (unmarred ice as "the last unwritten future").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Before the pen meets the blank page" frames the temporal window and "dawn" is mentioned as the deadline. However, the passage of time is decorative; no ticking clock tightens decisions or alters tactics. The cartographer's actions unfold at ritual pace without urgency tied to the approaching dawn.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To seed innovation within a constraint" is stated early and repeated at the end. The motivation is explained ("Her predecessors had failed because they tried to impose futures from outside; she would grow them from within") but not dramatized through conflicted choices. The desire lacks visible friction between want and cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sustaining transformation" is explicitly named in the final line. Tone remains elevated and mystical throughout, modulating slightly as the cartographer ascends and sacrifices memories. However, the single register (philosophical lyricism) dominates without variation under pressure; the final image is charged but the tone does not shift to deepen that charge.</comment>
